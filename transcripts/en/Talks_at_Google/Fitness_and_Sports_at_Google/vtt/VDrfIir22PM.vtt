[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:08.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.920
SACHIT EGAN: So
today, generally,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.080
we're going to talk a
little bit about two topics,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.120
one of them being identity--
which we're going to talk about

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.020
in a few moments--

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.984
and also around building a
championship team culture.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.400
And Rick and
Jennifer, both of you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.880
have been part of great
teams, great organizations.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
And so I just wanted to begin by
asking, what goes into building

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.529
a great culture at work?

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.820
RICK WELTS: Go ahead, Jennifer.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.820
JENNIFER AZZI: Me start?

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.970
OK.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.740
I think it starts
with leadership.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.070
I think it starts with
having authentic leadership.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.870
And I think that makes
a big difference.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.540
And I think, if you
are a good leader,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.344
you have to identify the
values of your group.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:46.760
And then once you
do that, I think

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.426
you have to really
live by those values.

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:51.300
And obviously, you have to set
a vision, and goals, and so on.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.383
But I think you have to
have authentic leadership,

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:55.820
and I think you have to have
everyone's values aligned

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.982
and going towards the
same goal, same place.

00:00:57.982 --> 00:00:58.940
SACHIT EGAN: Very good.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.920
RICK WELTS: Sounds very simple.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930
JENNIFER AZZI: OK.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.690
Yeah.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.940
RICK WELTS: Really hard to do.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.925
JENNIFER AZZI: Exactly.

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:05.620
RICK WELTS: And I
think, my experiences

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.860
in the organizations I've
been in, most of the time,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.420
I've gotten to an
organization when

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.520
it was a little bit broken.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.640
I seem to be attracted to
that kind of a situation.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.190
Something wrong with me.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.340
But I also think it
is a real opportunity

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.720
in the lifecycle of a company
to make significant change.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.654
Rather than go into
an organization that

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.070
has tremendous success and
trying to make it incrementally

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.980
10% better, it's a lot
more interesting for me

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.580
to go to an organization that
is really not functioning

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.837
and try to make 100%
change in the way people

00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:42.920
show up at work every day.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.709
And we can talk a lot a
lot about what that means.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:46.875
SACHIT EGAN: Yeah, for sure.

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.642
And I think you both can speak
to that type of experience.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.350
Obviously, you with
the Suns and then the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.140
Warriors, and you with
a very stagnant USF team

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.940
that you took over.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.610
Can you share any
examples of early actions

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.016
you tried to take to
change the culture?

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:02.390
JENNIFER AZZI:
Well, like Rick, I

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.240
think I'm drawn to
difficult situations.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.180
And I think for me, taking over
the program at USF, ignorance

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.880
was bliss because I'd never been
in a head coaching role before,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.950
and actually had
never coached before.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.550
So that was kind of a good
thing in the beginning.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.690
And I thought I could
change the culture,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.230
and I thought I could change
the mindset of what was already

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.160
there.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.600
And it was very
difficult. There's

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.790
a reason that teams win,
and there's a reason

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.500
that teams lose.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.650
And oftentimes, it's
right between your ears.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.780
It's your thought process.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.820
It's the way you do things.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.580
And the program at USF was
not only in the bottom 10%,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.310
it was probably the
bottom 5% in the country.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.210
So I thought we could
make change quicker--

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.793
it's not like a pro
organization where

00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:43.430
you can change your personnel.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.560
You really have to paint
a picture every day

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.900
of what your values
are, what the culture's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.830
going to look like.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.390
But it's really,
really difficult

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.230
to change what is there without
making significant changes.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.180
And for us, that took six years
before we won a championship.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.520
SACHIT EGAN: Wow.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.920
What about you with the
Suns and with the Warriors?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.240
RICK WELTS: Very different.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.320
Suns were historically a
very successful franchise

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.200
but had fallen on hard
times competitively

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.120
and financially at
the time I got there.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.650
So people there had
experienced success,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.070
and experienced
a lot of success,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.510
so it was just a recalibration
to get back to where we were.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.130
Warriors, completely different.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.540
This is-- for those of you
who are fans, the way the NBA

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.826
playoffs work, more than
half the teams, 16 out of 30

00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:31.950
actually make the playoffs.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.790
The Warriors had not made the
playoffs 16 out of 17 years.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.900
And I actually don't think you
could write that business plan

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.650
and execute it.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.900
Just by chance, you would
end up in the playoffs

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.950
more often than that.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.770
So there was a culture
where everybody

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.410
came to work every
day expecting to lose.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.715
That's just the way it was.

00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:53.600
It was in the business office,
it was in the locker room.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.130
And you know what?

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.600
It seemed to go just fine.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.424
Like every year,
everybody got a raise,

00:03:58.424 --> 00:04:00.090
everybody got a long
summer, because you

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.815
didn't have long playoffs.

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:03.106
You came back the next year,
you did it all over again.

00:04:03.106 --> 00:04:08.240
So that one was a complete
reset about getting people

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.890
who wanted to come
along for the ride

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.600
to believe what we were going
to be, not what we had been.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.316
And it was a really
interesting process

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:19.399
for the first year of the
people who clearly could

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.890
get their heads around
that, and want to come along

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.496
for the ride, and the people
who really didn't believe

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.120
we were going to
accomplish what I said

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.960
we were going to accomplish.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.775
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:28.900
This is really interesting.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.550
You mentioned that
winning, losing,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.110
it's between in
between the ears.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.320
You say that it's a mentality,
an expectation to lose.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.170
We were talking before
this chat that we

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.880
had Baron Davis at a Talks at
Google event maybe a month ago,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.380
and--

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.920
RICK WELTS: I'm laughing.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.369
That must have
been entertaining.

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:45.160
SACHIT EGAN: Right.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.810
It was.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.710
Go watch the video on
YouTube if you haven't.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.660
But he described the same thing.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.744
He talked about how he shows
up, he wasn't initially excited.

00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:55.910
He said he didn't even want
to come to the Warriors.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.240
And he shows up, and he felt
that, organizationally, people

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.240
felt like losing.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.960
And his approach he
talked about on stage was,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.240
let me get to know every
level of the organization.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.427
Let me get to know the trainers,
the ball boys, the doctors.

00:05:08.427 --> 00:05:10.010
Obviously, the team,
the front office.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.350
Let me try to figure
out what they're about,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.320
and try to influence
them individually.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.510
Does that approach
resonate with you both,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.210
or have you found other tips
or tricks that have helped?

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.530
JENNIFER AZZI: Absolutely.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.930
I think any championship
team I've been on,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.840
whether it's as a coach,
or a player, or somewhere

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.720
in between, everyone
felt a part of it,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.230
from the person that sweeps
the floor to the leader

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.090
of the entire organization.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.596
And everyone's energy has to
be going the same direction.

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:39.470
And I can really relate
to what Rick said too

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.886
about the culture
of the Warriors,

00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:42.897
because it was the same at USF.

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:44.730
I think people had
gotten really complacent.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.180
And I think, oftentimes,
human nature is

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.430
people want to be comfortable.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.721
So a big thing that we used
to talk about with our team

00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:52.610
is, get comfortable with
being uncomfortable,

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.410
because it's going to be hard.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.230
And if you want to succeed,
and you want to win, it's hard.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.660
We had class conflict,
so I got tired of it.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.160
We practiced at
6:00 in the morning.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.390
And once the team
got used to it,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.740
and then they felt like
great high achievers,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.580
you get through that
practice, and you've

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.050
achieved something greater
than you have in years.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.020
But it's a lot of work.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.730
SACHIT EGAN: Yeah,
I understand that.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.610
RICK WELTS: I think
one thing that you

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.970
have to commit to the people
who work with you is that you're

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.400
going to judge each person
by their own abilities

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.600
and their own talents.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.520
So we had, again,
a lot of people

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.020
who had not been
successful, or been

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.280
buried in the organization.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.920
And the promise
was, look, you're

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.750
going to excel in this
organization based

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.550
on what you do and
the talent that you

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.660
bring to work every day.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.810
And we now, through
that process,

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.050
ended up with two or three,
today, of the senior leaders

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.180
in the organization
who have been there

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.240
for 17 years, because
they were kind of buried

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.090
in the organization, and hadn't
really been given a voice,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.342
or been given the
opportunity to show.

00:06:52.342 --> 00:06:54.800
And to me, that was important
to have some of those success

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.500
stories to go along
with all those people

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.470
who weren't going to stick
around who we then could go out

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.970
and recruit the
best and brightest

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.620
in those particular disciplines.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.080
And the combination
of that, I think,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.180
gave the senior
team, especially,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.610
some organizational
credibility, because people all

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.590
knew they're there
for a good reason.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.340
And I think that's been
a big part of how we've

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.395
been able to navigate this.

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:19.477
SACHIT EGAN: Interesting.

00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:21.560
So one of the things that
I was going to ask about

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.050
is, as a casual fan,
a casual observer,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.700
when we talk about team culture,
it often is really talking

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.624
about the on-court product.

00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:32.540
What's going to happen
to the Warriors culture

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.114
if we add DeMarcus Cousins?

00:07:34.114 --> 00:07:35.780
Things like that are
what we talk about.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.860
And both of you
are talking so much

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.430
about the whole organization.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.130
And I know Rick
has talked about--

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.740
you started your basketball
career at 16 years old

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.870
as a ball boy for
the Seattle Sonics,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.230
and so you saw how
the doctors interact

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.670
with the players, the staff--

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.110
it's a full-- the
organization's like a living,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.820
breathing entity.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.319
And I remember you've said it
hasn't changed much since then

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.020
to now.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.100
Can you tell us about that?

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.040
RICK WELTS: Well, I had
an amazing advantage

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.270
the people who sit in my
seat don't get to have.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.350
So I'm a fly on the wall as
a 16-year-old kid in an NBA

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.540
locker room getting to
see exactly what you said,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.630
the interaction between players,
between players and coaches.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.130
Nobody's paying any
attention to me.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.990
I can just soak all this in.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.330
The media, training staff,
ownership, reporters.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.140
It was a wonderful crash
course that I still, I

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.550
think, call on today.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.630
And it hasn't changed that much.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.870
The dynamics in sports
of what those roles are,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.230
and how they intersect.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.340
The one that has changed
probably more than any

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.870
is the media, because when we
were entertaining the media

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.669
after a game, then,
there were two or three

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.760
reporters who were
print reporters who

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.780
were covering the team.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.790
And now, today, at
a Warriors practice,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.480
we probably have
30 or 40 reporters

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.614
representing all kinds
of media outlets that--

00:08:56.614 --> 00:08:58.280
players, frankly,
used to be able to get

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.210
away with a lot more.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:04.220
And reporters used to
protect players in ways,

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.890
because they had a different
kind of relationship

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.540
than they do now.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.610
I can tell you,
professional athletes

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.820
today are under more scrutiny
than any profession, period,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.470
in terms of their
personal behavior

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.090
and how they conduct themselves.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.670
It's really hard, because
you are always on.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.060
I mean, TMZ is this
far away, right?

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.370
And it's actually,
I think, quite

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.626
remarkable to see the way
that locker room has evolved

00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:29.750
as it relates to the media.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.040
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.760
And Jennifer, for you, a lot of
us in the audience-- people who

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.590
work in tech-- it's
pretty in vogue right

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.080
now to jump jobs a lot,
whether it's internally

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.670
move around within
the Silicon Valley,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.130
externally to other companies.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.930
And I was thinking
about your career.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.680
Professionally with a
few different teams,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.202
playing for the
Olympics, coaching

00:09:47.202 --> 00:09:49.160
in the collegiate ranks,
winning a championship

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.660
as a college athlete.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.140
I guess I wonder, how did
your perception of what

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.630
makes a good team culture
or a good team leader

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.851
evolve from being a player
to then being a coach?

00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:01.670
JENNIFER AZZI: Wow.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.560
That's a tough one.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.804
I think just being around
people that were successful,

00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:09.220
and watching what
they did and how

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.710
they did it, is--
and then I also,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.527
before I started
coaching, I kept

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:15.610
a little notebook of the
things I liked and didn't

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.980
like about certain coaches
so that when I coached,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.020
I wouldn't do the
things that I thought

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.960
were maybe not appropriate,
or not motivating,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.100
or that kind of thing.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.310
So I just think I've always
looked around me, whether it's

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.050
in the sports world
or not, but at people

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.966
that are good at their
jobs, and good leaders,

00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:32.870
and really tried
to learn from that.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.690
But I think team
culture is pretty

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.100
consistent across the board.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.160
If you have people that care,
and that are very engaged,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.220
and all are moving in
the same direction,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.850
and, I think, who
are-- and I know

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.080
we're going to get
to talk about this,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.030
but who are really
authentically themselves,

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.850
when you can bring your whole
self to what you do and you

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.194
don't feel split, I
think that also makes

00:10:51.194 --> 00:10:52.360
a very successful situation.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.530
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.640
That's a good
transition, actually.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:54.850
JENNIFER AZZI: Thank you.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.050
SACHIT EGAN: We appreciate that.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.340
So we talked a
bit about culture,

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.230
and identity is another
thing that's important.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.790
And we were chatting
before about how

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.572
a core tenet of
Google's culture is

00:11:02.572 --> 00:11:04.030
that we should all
feel comfortable

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.180
bringing our whole
selves to work.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.860
And so what does
identity mean to you,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.840
and has that changed for you
over your life and career?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.500
RICK WELTS: Well, it's certainly
changed for both of us.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.600
So it wasn't until 2011 in
this little front-page story

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.650
on "The New York Times," I came
out as a gay man in sports.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.850
And at the time, the
highest-ranking person

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.440
in my career, or my field,
that had taken that step.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.200
And up until that point, I
was a really happy person.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.080
I had a really
successful career.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.280
But especially in men's
professional sports,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:47.320
there was this fear in
me that somehow bringing

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.140
my authentic self to
work could potentially

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.720
be damaging to the career
that I wanted to have.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.960
And it took me a long
time to get to the point

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.580
where I felt I was at a place
where it was important to me

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.040
to take that step.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.570
And I don't regret
how long it took me.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.850
It was my story.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.850
It's my process.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.310
It happened at the right time.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.250
It's wonderful now to have
a different relationship

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.680
with some of my co-workers.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.140
I had purposely set
up walls around what

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.780
people felt comfortable
approaching me about.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.650
No one ever asked me if I
was gay in my entire career.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.980
But when I came in
after the weekend,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.310
I would purposely not ask Jen
what she did that weekend,

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.700
because I didn't want her to ask
me who I was hanging out with,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.810
or what I was doing.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.350
So people figure it out, and
are respectful about that,

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.120
but it's a sacrifice.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.620
It's a sacrifice to somebody
who's in that position.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.360
I wish I'd had
better relationships

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.520
with a lot of those people at
different level than I had.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.580
I do have those now,
which is awesome.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.400
And I think I'm
probably better at what

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.835
I do at work because
of that now today,

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:04.210
and I think I'm
probably a better

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.200
leader because of that today.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.210
But that's a journey.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.550
But yes, did it change?

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.935
It changed pretty significantly.

00:13:10.935 --> 00:13:11.768
JENNIFER AZZI: Yeah.

00:13:11.768 --> 00:13:12.855
RICK WELTS: For you too.

00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:13.938
JENNIFER AZZI: Well, yeah.

00:13:13.938 --> 00:13:16.127
And I thought everyone knew.

00:13:16.127 --> 00:13:18.460
It didn't feel like I had to
make some big announcement,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.100
like I'm gay, I have a--

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.570
at that time-- a
partner, now wife.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.510
And it didn't change until
I was actually introducing

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.250
Rick at the ADL Awards.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.550
And I remember going for a run
in the morning with my wife

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.210
Blair.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.584
And I said, OK, I'm going to
introduce Rick this evening,

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:35.497
but I don't know how
I can do him justice.

00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:37.330
First of all, I don't
know why I'm doing it,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.680
but I don't know how
I can do him justice.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.030
I can't just read his bio.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.350
I've got to do something.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.280
And she's like, oh,
you'll be great.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.870
Whatever you want
to say is fine.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.870
So then I get on stage,
and I just said, thank you,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.520
because his example for me
has helped me in so many ways,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.690
but absolutely helped
me in a leadership role.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:59.759
And I thought being open with
my team, or my players at USF

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:01.050
would actually hurt me as well.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.871
I thought, if you're
the gay coach,

00:14:02.871 --> 00:14:04.870
well, then you're not
going to get any recruits,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.880
and it's going to
change everything.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.980
And it actually did
just the opposite.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.760
I ended up becoming a lot
closer with my players.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.880
And I think they respected
me that much more.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.370
They definitely respected
me for my knowledge.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.310
But I didn't realize that they
didn't feel like they knew me.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.320
I thought they knew me because
I'm the same person every day.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.730
I walk in, I'm positive, I'm me.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.750
I'm doing my job.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.950
But when you can go on a
deeper level with people,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.000
I think you can have so
much more of an impact.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.720
And what I realized is there
were so many people around me

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.760
that I either knew or
didn't know that had

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.380
the same struggle going on.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.900
And so after introducing
Rick and having this whole

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.550
coming out thing, it
made a big difference.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.040
And my wife and I got
emails, and calls,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.840
and things from
people that were gay,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.780
straight, anything, emailing
us saying, just thank you.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.750
Thank you for being
authentic, and being

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:56.760
a good example for us.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.850
SACHIT EGAN: Wow.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.670
So you both have talked
about having a full career,

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.170
a really successful,
happy career

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.890
prior to making that choice.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.840
And so I do want to ask--

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.360
I know Rick's story a little
bit in that you'd lost a parent

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.901
and a lot was going on in your
life when you were in Phoenix.

00:15:10.901 --> 00:15:15.660
What went into, for both of you,
making that choice, I guess?

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.160
Yeah.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.618
JENNIFER AZZI:
Well, mine was easy.

00:15:17.618 --> 00:15:18.852
It was Rick's fault. So he--

00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:21.060
if he hadn't asked me to do
that, I don't know if I--

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:21.780
RICK WELTS: She sold the show.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.988
JENNIFER AZZI: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.060
RICK WELTS: [INAUDIBLE]
fill this up.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.740
JENNIFER AZZI: No, I think
it was just the right moment.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.195
Like Rick, I too
don't regret anything.

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:32.930
It was the right time for me.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.660
It was the right moment for
me, that just kind of hit me.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.500
And I think hopefully
helps people, and has

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.350
some type of a positive impact,
but I don't know about you.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.220
RICK WELTS: Well,
I had been thinking

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.540
about this for a while.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.490
And I would have a bad breakup.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.400
And part of it was
because I couldn't include

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.680
the person who was most
important in my life

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.180
into my professional life.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.810
And that made a
big impact on me.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.370
My dad had passed
away and my mother

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.970
had been diagnosed
with lung cancer,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.480
so I had really decided
it was now or never.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.910
And I didn't have any idea
how to put it in perspective.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.770
So I actually invited
a friend of mine.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.940
His name's Dan Klores.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.690
I don't know if you're
watching right now.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.670
The "Basketball: A Love
Story," the series on ESPN.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.700
He actually produced
"Basketball: A Love Story."

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.200
But in his prior life, was kind
of a media guru of New York.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.660
And I invited him to
go to dinner one night

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.730
and just said, Dan,
I don't even know

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.050
how to put this in perspective.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.790
I need your view of this.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.860
I'm thinking of doing this.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.430
And I can either just talk
to the people I work with,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.230
and the people I've
worked with in my life,

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.640
and that'll be great, and we
can take care of it that way.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.910
But maybe there's something
gnawing at me that says,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.890
maybe there's something
better that can

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.421
be accomplished by doing that.

00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:53.920
And he--

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.290
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.580
It's going to be a great
scene in the movie.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.615
He looked across the
dinner table at me,

00:16:59.615 --> 00:17:00.920
and he just said, Ricky--

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.840
he's got this funny
voice, calls me Ricky.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.980
Ricky, if you're willing to
do this, I want to help you.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.042
And I think it's page
A1, "New York Times."

00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:15.079
And that was kind of
my oh, shit moment.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.119
Like, whoa.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.200
Serious.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.390
And so we went on a journey.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.869
He connected me with a
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.390
from "The New York
Times," and "The Times"

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.360
wanted to do the story, and
make it a front-page story.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.300
And because I'd done
my job decently,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.060
nobody knew who I was.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.460
But the people I'd met in
my life, everybody knew.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.370
So we actually decided to try
to tell the story by letting

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.300
other people tell it.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.552
So I went on my little
tour of asking friends

00:17:44.552 --> 00:17:46.010
that we'd never
had this discussion

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.420
about if they would
talk to a reporter

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.503
from "The New York Times."

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:54.530
So Bill Russell, Steve
Nash, people like that who--

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.510
David Stern-- people
who then told my story.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.330
And it was an amazing blessing
to have a come-together that

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.070
way, and have it--

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.100
it was prophetic, whatever
Dan said at that dinner table

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.460
that night, because it's
exactly the way it played out.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.710
SACHIT EGAN: That's beautiful.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.840
Thanks for sharing that.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.030
We can talk about the fact that
the LGBTQ+ movement has made

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.490
incredible strides
over the past years.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.710
The fact that we're having
this conversation today

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.409
may not have happened 10
years ago, which is wonderful.

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:27.200
But I remember-- so
I'm a big Kevin Garnett

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.000
fan, so I was a
fan of the Celtics

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.070
when Jason Collins became the
first openly out player in any

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.287
of the four major North
American professional sports.

00:18:36.287 --> 00:18:37.870
And I remember
thinking, this is going

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.940
to be a big moment that-- this
is going to change sports.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.270
This is a huge step.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.860
And I feel like, in sports,
it hasn't taken off the way

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.702
that some of us had expected.

00:18:47.702 --> 00:18:49.910
Wondering if you have any
thoughts about why that is,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.970
or what sports can do
better to support people

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.385
in that situation.

00:18:54.385 --> 00:18:55.760
JENNIFER AZZI: I
think continuing

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.300
to have people that speak
out, and are truthful, and are

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.520
willing to be open
and live their lives,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.730
because everyone needs
role models that somehow

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.850
look a little like them, or
there's some commonality there.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.010
And so I think,
even seeing Jason

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.390
was a wonderful thing for me.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.450
And I just think we need more
people to be open and honest.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.524
I think that's probably
the biggest thing.

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.940
Because there is
a lot of support,

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.640
but there's still so
much pressure and fear.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.845
And you've grown up with that,
and you've grown up with--

00:19:26.845 --> 00:19:30.780
I remember, as a kid,
feeling very conflicted.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.650
I have a strong spiritual
belief and religion,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.320
and so I felt very conflicted.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.480
So do I choose this
core part of myself,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.280
or do I feel this
pressure that I can't?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.120
One thing my mom actually said
to me when I was a kid is--

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.300
when I came out to
her, I was like, well,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.550
is God still going to love me?

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.330
And she said, well,
is there anything

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.030
that you could do to make
me love you any less?

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.780
And I was like, hm,
no, I guess not.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.090
And she said, well,
that's God's love for you.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.610
So you go out, and you be
an example for other people.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.800
And I'm lucky that I
have that foundation,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.920
but a lot of people don't.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.280
And I think that's why
seeing Rick's strength,

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.830
and other people,
motivates me, and I

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.670
hope that we can do
the same for others.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.270
RICK WELTS: I'm disappointed
that the progress hasn't

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.470
happened faster.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.935
I separate a little
bit from the team side

00:20:18.935 --> 00:20:20.310
from the rest of
the organization

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.980
because I think we have
made really good strides

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.540
in our business organizations
and in our league.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.009
We are league leadership.

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:28.050
That, we talked about it.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.801
We were talking about
Adam Silver earlier.

00:20:29.801 --> 00:20:32.341
I've written in the pride parade
with Adam Silver in New York

00:20:32.341 --> 00:20:32.935
City.

00:20:32.935 --> 00:20:36.060
That's a pretty
cool commissioner.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.620
And in our business
organizations,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.340
I think all of our teams
now have diversity inclusion

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.210
councils.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.935
I think there are very
powerful voices there.

00:20:44.935 --> 00:20:48.120
And I think we have
tried to send out

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.890
every signal that this is going
to be an inclusive environment.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.880
Yet on the playing side,
that's been harder.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.410
So we had decided to
put the All-Star Game

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.380
in Charlotte, North
Carolina, a couple years ago.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.580
Three years ago, I think.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:12.660
And then the legislature had
passed some very offensive

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.775
legislation to LGBTQ community.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.390
And our league had to
decide whether or not

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.590
we were still going.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:25.470
And Adam, in a owners'
meeting in Las Vegas,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.110
gave me the last opportunity
to speak to the subject

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.490
before the owners voted on it.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.190
And I just was able
to say honestly

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.610
to the owners sitting
around the room,

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.970
I'm in touch with people in a
lot of the organizations who

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.430
reach out and talk to me
because, for whatever reason,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.430
they feel like they can
connect with somebody who's

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.740
in their situation,
and they don't feel yet

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.540
like they're in a
situation that they're

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.250
ready to take that step.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.106
And I just want you to
think about those people

00:21:53.106 --> 00:21:54.480
in your organizations
when you're

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.800
deciding what to do here.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.670
And they voted not to
take the game there.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.410
Now, things happened
subsequently

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.580
to improve the situation.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.560
We are going back
there this year.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:10.060
But I do think, for players,
you really have to remember.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.340
I have to remind myself how
young these players are,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.840
and what a short time they have
to earn a living at the one

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.780
thing they're always going
to be the best at doing.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.600
And it's a huge
amount of pressure.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.390
We're talking about
20-somethings.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.730
I wasn't ready at
that point in time.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.380
And yet we expect professional
athletes to have this maturity

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.130
beyond their years.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.590
And so I still think
a lot of players

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.000
would look at it as a big risk.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.340
I will tell you the
most interesting comment

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.090
I got through this whole process
was with a radio talk show

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.210
host in San Francisco who,
we were talking about this,

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.220
and he was a former player.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.960
And he said, you
know, I don't think

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.325
there'd be an issue about
players accepting a gay player.

00:22:59.325 --> 00:23:01.140
He says, I think
a player would be

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.950
very concerned about the
attention that would go along

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.390
with it, and the potential to
disrupt that very fragile team

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.620
environment, and
overwhelming to the team,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.270
not just to the person.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.260
And I think there's
something to that.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.580
I think it's a very
fragile chemistry

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.730
that a team has to
have to be successful,

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.730
and things can disrupt that.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.700
And I think players--

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.800
I think a lot of very
thoughtful players

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.280
have decided that, I'm not
sure I want to risk that

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.457
on behalf of my team.

00:23:33.457 --> 00:23:35.040
Not because of how
it would affect me,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.120
but on behalf of my team.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.010
SACHIT EGAN: Very
interesting insight.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.540
Thank you both
for sharing those.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.986
Not to play a blame
game, but I think--

00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:44.610
Jennifer, your answer
about what can we

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.709
do to improve the way things
are, you focused on leaders.

00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:50.250
So if we have role
models and leaders

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.200
who create that culture,
things will move forward.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.020
And you've mentioned
that the leaders are

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.790
trying to create that culture.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.720
Players even seem
to be open to it.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.420
So is it the media, then, that
we can blame a little bit?

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.950
Is there a way to
mitigate the response, or?

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.740
RICK WELTS: You know, it's
such a personal journey.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.170
It's such a personal decision.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.360
I could never
counsel anybody to--

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.940
[INAUDIBLE] you
have to [INAUDIBLE],,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.220
or you need to do that.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.680
I think it's a really--

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.630
it's going to happen.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.810
I think it's likely to
happen with a young player,

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.900
maybe in college, who
comes into the pros who

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.620
has a different view of
the world than somebody

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.750
who's older.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.380
But I really do understand it.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.213
I'm disappointed in it,
but I understand it.

00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:38.310
I will also add one thing.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.790
My partner and I got invited to
the White House the last year

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:46.110
of Obama's presidency for
his pride celebration.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:51.330
And his words come back
to me all the time,

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.030
because he was very proud of
what had been accomplished

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.260
during his administration.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.160
And we're sitting in some
room at the White House,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.930
and he's talking.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:04.230
And he was giving the
most cautionary speech

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.150
that I thought was
even odd at the time.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.560
It's like, this isn't over.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.120
This could all get reversed
as quickly as it's happened.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.430
And that weekend, the Pulse
nightclub shooting happened.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.240
And I think, culturally,
in this country,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.160
we've taken a couple steps back.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.950
And I think some things
maybe are at risk today

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.790
that maybe, five years
ago, we would have assumed

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.360
were forever.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.486
And so I think there's also--

00:25:34.486 --> 00:25:36.110
the environment's
changed a little bit,

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.230
I think, in our culture.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:42.410
I think hate is a
real thing today,

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.490
more so than it was five
years ago, in part of,

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.380
we've empowered
people to express it

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.800
in ways that maybe were
unthinkable-- at least to me--

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.880
five years ago.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.850
And I think there's a little
of that environment that's

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.260
probably playing
into it as well.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.310
SACHIT EGAN: That's also
a fantastic insight.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.060
Thanks for sharing
that story with us.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.000
I think, to shift gears
just a little bit,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.324
talking about identity, there's
all sorts of different things

00:26:08.324 --> 00:26:09.240
that go into identity.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.948
There's all different
kinds of diversity.

00:26:10.948 --> 00:26:12.950
In talking with you,
Jennifer, all the work

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.260
you're doing with the Azzi
Academy, and your role

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.330
with the NBA now, you're
really reaching out

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.790
to bring basketball and
bring a future in basketball

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.199
to the masses, all types
of different folks.

00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:23.990
Can you tell us a little
bit about the work

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.700
that you're doing?

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.533
JENNIFER AZZI: Sure.

00:26:25.533 --> 00:26:27.920
And just to give you
a little background.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.580
The NBA brand, globally--
and I think Rick can probably

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.690
speak to this more
as well, but if you

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.070
look at what they're doing
for youth around the world,

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.890
if you look at it
like a pyramid,

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.080
there's Junior NBA,
which is worldwide now.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.730
Then there are
basketball schools.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.050
Then there are academies,
and then there's

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.850
global academies at
the top of the pyramid.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.502
And that's where we're
working currently, as my wife

00:26:46.502 --> 00:26:47.960
and I actually get
to work together

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.705
on this, which is really fun.

00:26:49.705 --> 00:26:51.830
But we get to develop the
programming for the women

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.470
around the world, which
is really exciting.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.790
So to go somewhere like
India, I wasn't sure

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.080
what they would be able to
do, what the talent's like.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.670
And every region
that we've been in,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.320
so whether it's Latin
America, India, China,

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.420
Senegal, the thing that
I've taken away from it

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.545
is, number one, basketball
is a universal language.

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:12.650
So even if the kids don't
speak English and have

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.540
a hard time with it,
you can put anyone

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.480
on the court from any walk of
life, any background, any race,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.380
and you can play
this beautiful game.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.690
And so that's exciting.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.670
But the players that
we've been working with

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.040
are so grateful, so
it's so wonderful

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.274
to go around and have kids
say, in India, thank you

00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:28.940
for coaching us.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.648
I was like, what?

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:30.890
Are you sure?

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.350
But they're just
so, so respectful.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.800
And I love that you know the
NBA is so respectful of women,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.380
and is also investing
not just in the men's

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.110
academies around the world,
but also in developing

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.130
women around the world.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.110
And on the men's side,
it's pretty clear.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.779
The goal is, if you can
have a residential program--

00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:49.820
which is a little bit like
being in college here,

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.710
but without quite the
academic pressures,

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.190
and you can practice
all the time,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.730
so you don't have
the NCAA rules.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.320
But if they can use the NBA
technology to develop a player

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.020
out of India or China,
you think about the impact

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.730
Yao Ming had here, and also
had on the market in China.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.540
That's huge for the
global brand of the NBA.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.310
But again, I'm happy
that they're also

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.637
investing in the women's side.

00:28:14.637 --> 00:28:16.220
SACHIT EGAN: Here's
an interesting one

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.220
that we've gotten from
our global audience,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.422
that we all feel lucky
to work for Google.

00:28:21.422 --> 00:28:22.880
"I don't know a
Googler that hasn't

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.869
experience some form of failure
in the course of their career.

00:28:25.869 --> 00:28:28.160
Can you share a moment in
which you failed on your path

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.307
to where you are now,
and how that shaped you?"

00:28:30.307 --> 00:28:31.223
RICK WELTS: [CHUCKLES]

00:28:31.223 --> 00:28:33.590
JENNIFER AZZI: I probably have--
no, I have more than Rick.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.670
RICK WELTS: No,
you don't have any.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.544
JENNIFER AZZI: I have
a couple few good ones,

00:28:36.544 --> 00:28:38.470
but I'll keep it short.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.220
I'm just going to go
back to my experience

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.678
at the University
of San Francisco.

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:43.940
When I took over,
I really thought

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.690
that we could win faster,
just because I thought,

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.310
we can work harder, and.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.460
We won four games my first
year and five my second year.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.650
And that was really,
really, really hard.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.210
And then also being a coach,
not a player, you're sort of one

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.340
removed from-- you
can't go out and do it.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.770
So that was really challenging.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.466
And at the time, I don't know
that I looked at it as failure.

00:29:06.466 --> 00:29:08.090
I think everyone
around me did, though,

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.548
because I had done
nothing but win.

00:29:09.548 --> 00:29:13.010
So I remember my college
coach, don't take this job.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.920
My dad called me on a
regular basis, are you OK?

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.900
It's like everyone
just looked at, here

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.091
I am, just treading
water, failing.

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.590
And there was
something inside of me

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.860
that knew that we were going
to eventually-- we couldn't

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.780
look at our wins and losses.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.820
We had to look at
our incremental steps

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.830
towards getting better.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.700
But that was very,
very difficult.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.970
And I'm sure as
much as people say

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.840
it's got to be heaven working
at Google, coming on the campus,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.590
you can go out and
play whatever you want.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.030
It's pretty cool.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:41.450
You can eat.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.380
You can do everything.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.990
Probably bring your
dogs, kids, right?

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.545
SACHIT EGAN: Oh, yeah.

00:29:44.545 --> 00:29:46.294
JENNIFER AZZI: But I'm
sure there are also

00:29:46.294 --> 00:29:47.937
the challenges that
come with any job,

00:29:47.937 --> 00:29:49.520
and I think you just
have to stay true

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.370
to whatever your vision
is, and why you're there

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.180
in the first place.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.060
SACHIT EGAN: Cool.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.950
Thank you.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.678
We'll take an audience question.

00:29:56.678 --> 00:29:58.610
AUDIENCE: For both of you.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.250
You mentioned at the beginning
that your organization

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.796
was changing and other
voices were coming out.

00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:06.170
When you have so
many superstars,

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.304
but you also have
hidden superstars,

00:30:08.304 --> 00:30:10.220
how are you able to--
because all those ideas,

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.930
each one could
actually be a success.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.780
But when you have all the ideas
together-- and my main question

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.920
is, how do you bring
the hidden ideas

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.130
from those people who are
less willing to speak up,

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.400
less willing to share.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.400
Maybe they're not bringing
their whole self yet,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.230
but they have an
amazing idea, and that's

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.272
why they were hired here.

00:30:28.272 --> 00:30:29.396
JENNIFER AZZI: Interesting.

00:30:29.396 --> 00:30:31.415
AUDIENCE: How are you
bringing that out?

00:30:31.415 --> 00:30:35.690
RICK WELTS: Well, I love
our coach, Steve Kerr.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:39.650
And actually, he coined
a phrase a few years ago

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.600
that we've adopted
organizationally

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.439
as our mantra, not only
our basketball team,

00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:46.730
and that's strength in numbers.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.580
And what's behind
strength in numbers

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.300
is that, yeah, we got Steph
Curry and Kevin Durant.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.050
But without the other
12 guys on the roster,

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.640
we're not going to
win a championship.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.070
And they've created
an atmosphere

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.140
in the locker room
that celebrates

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.934
the individual craziness
of each one of those guys.

00:31:06.934 --> 00:31:09.350
It's the funniest locker room
in the history of the world.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.930
Everybody gets made fun
of, whether you're the best

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.070
player or the worst player.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.720
And there's something
about who you

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.290
are that everybody decides
is the most fun thing to make

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.320
fun of the whole time.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.000
And it's different in
our business environment.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.330
We do, actually, a lot of
training and coaching on this,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:30.170
on meeting dynamics
and things like that,

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.700
because there's some wonderful
science around it now.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.690
The people who really care about
getting the best out of people

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:40.300
really can understand that
there isn't a one-size-fits-all,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.617
outgoing, hard-charging
personality that can dominate

00:31:43.617 --> 00:31:45.700
a room in the meeting and
you get the best result.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.060
It doesn't always work that way.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.490
And I think it's
a work in progress

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.930
for us to make sure
that the voices--

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.460
that we're extracting the
best out of each of the people

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.580
we have by making them feel
like they not only have

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.280
the opportunity, but the
obligation to contribute

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.490
their thoughts if they're
in an environment where

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.050
an issue's being discussed.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.170
The way I see it,
you're in this meeting

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.540
because you're a smart person
who has a point of view,

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.510
and I expect you
to express that.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.610
It's harder for some people
than it is for others,

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.840
and a lot of guys forget to
listen to a lot of other people

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.440
sometimes when there's
talking in a meeting.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.060
And we try to call
people out on that.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.700
We try to actually
get better at that.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.600
And I do think it's a process.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.960
I don't think we're there
yet, but I think the fact

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.660
that we're aware of it,
and want to make sure

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.600
that we're providing
that platform for people

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.346
to be the best they can be is
something that we stand for.

00:32:43.346 --> 00:32:45.690
JENNIFER AZZI: I just
have a quick little story.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:50.085
So when I was also coaching at
USF, we lost to Santa Clara.

00:32:50.085 --> 00:32:51.710
And it was when we
were getting better,

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.540
and we literally should
have just crushed them.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.500
And so I could feel that we had
some issues and things going on

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.115
with the team.

00:32:58.115 --> 00:32:59.490
So I said, all
right, guys, we're

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.490
going to all get in a room,
and we're going to talk.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.948
And I want you guys
to say anything

00:33:02.948 --> 00:33:04.632
to me that you
might need to say,

00:33:04.632 --> 00:33:05.840
get off your chest, whatever.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.849
We've got to figure out
whatever's going on.

00:33:07.849 --> 00:33:09.890
So we get in the room,
and one of the players who

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.250
doesn't speak a lot
said, well, coach, I just

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.530
don't know if we
should have a stopwatch

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.350
and times on our sprints
because some players are having

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.300
a hard time, and they're
really struggling

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.874
with making the times.

00:33:21.874 --> 00:33:24.290
And I'm thinking, oh my God,
I have to listen to the ideas

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.240
that I think are crazy too.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.010
I'm asking for this.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.050
But to provide an
environment where I actually

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.050
could get stuff back that
I didn't want to hear,

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.810
and that I thought
might be ridiculous.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.800
But what it did is it helped me
to get to the psychology of why

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.210
those kids were upset.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.430
And I explained to the group.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.180
I'm like, a basketball
game is 40 minutes.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.700
It doesn't change unless,
obviously, you go to overtime

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.390
or whatever.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.580
So we have to have
a time and a score,

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.070
and we have to have
measurements on what we do.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.530
Now, the ones that are really
struggling with this, maybe

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.420
let's figure out
how you can either

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.170
eat better, work on
some other areas,

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.135
and work on the mental side so
you don't feel so much pressure

00:34:00.135 --> 00:34:01.010
in making your times.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.840
Because I'm not getting mad
at them for not making them.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.192
It's just, this is the standard.

00:34:04.192 --> 00:34:05.900
But it was just really
interesting to get

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.239
in a room with them and
listen to some things

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.400
that I think they were
just scared to say.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.870
And again, I think
as a leader, you

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.480
have to be OK with
the things that you

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.489
don't agree with,
and maybe figure out

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.230
why they're thinking
and feeling that way

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.820
so they feel validated.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.710
AUDIENCE: So winning
solves a lot of problems,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.719
especially in sports.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.010
But right now, the
Warriors are going

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.679
through a bit of a tough time,
at least for Warrior standards.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.550
RICK WELTS: Won three in a row!

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.560
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.019
You lost to my
Bucks by 35, though.

00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:31.893
JENNIFER AZZI: Uh-oh.

00:34:31.893 --> 00:34:32.973
RICK WELTS: Crushed.

00:34:32.973 --> 00:34:36.380
AUDIENCE: So how are you
managing the conflict that's

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.790
going on right now
with the organization,

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.090
both in terms of win
and losses, but also

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.739
with what's going
on in the media

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.870
with the story about
Draymond and KD, for example?

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.320
RICK WELTS: Did I
mention I love our coach?

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:47.989
Yeah.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:48.960
I love our coach.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.010
He's the best.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:56.239
He has a way of diffusing any
situation and making it OK.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.360
And he's a master at it.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.750
I try to learn from him, because
the idea that two players have

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.700
a argument on the
basketball court

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:09.930
is not like the first
time that's ever happened.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.590
We happen to have
a microscope on us,

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.140
unlike any other team in the
NBA, maybe in sports right now.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.490
And we have 29 other
teams and media

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.560
rooting for a
storyline that shows

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.080
that the cracks in the
armor finally appearing,

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.110
and this whole thing's
ready to fall apart.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:30.740
So it's bring the group together
and have an honest discussion

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.190
about what's going on, what
people are going to ask,

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.980
what our responses as
teammates ought to be.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.567
And I think that that ship
got righted pretty quickly.

00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:42.775
Couldn't agree with you more.

00:35:45.549 --> 00:35:47.840
We have an industry-- the
biggest fault in our industry

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.840
is that we've designed an
industry where half the teams

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.960
have to lose every night.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.600
I don't know if you
focused on that.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.360
When you work at Google, you
win most of the time, right?

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.042
If you work in sports,
half the teams--

00:35:58.042 --> 00:36:00.500
you're pretty much certain--
are going to lose every night.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.320
So you can't just
build it on winning,

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.830
because law of
averages, it's not

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.840
going to continue to
be that way forever.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.060
We've had an amazing streak.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.300
It's a historic streak.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.600
We're trying to go to the finals
for the fifth consecutive year.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.140
And I don't know how many
basketball historians who are

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.840
there, it's been done before.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.430
I don't know if you can
name who has done it.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:24.780
Maybe Magic Johnson's Lakers?

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.740
No.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.240
Maybe--

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:26.510
SACHIT EGAN: Russell's Celtics?

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:27.870
RICK WELTS: --Rayburn's Celtics?

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:28.370
No.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.020
Maybe Michael Jordan's Bulls?

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.100
No.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.610
Hasn't been done since Bill
Russell's Celtics in the '60s.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.740
So it's historic, what
we're trying to do now.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.170
And the pressure
mounts as time goes on.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:40.910
Sounds like it should
make it easier.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.320
In some ways, it
makes it harder.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.520
And I think that you have to
have a leader in the locker

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.780
room, not only as your
coach, but as a player who's

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.950
willing to add perspective.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.420
We have some great ones.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.380
Andre Iguodala is
Mr. Perspective.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.230
Steph Curry doesn't talk
a lot, but when he speaks,

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.550
everybody listens.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.340
Draymond Green has his role.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:04.840
You know?

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.680
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.340
RICK WELTS: But he's the
only one who plays that role.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.980
We need that on our team.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.030
So I think it's
just a willingness

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.920
to engage as teammates,
and a willingness

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.216
to decide as
teammates how you want

00:37:18.216 --> 00:37:19.340
to respond to these things.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.650
And having a leader
in your coach

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:25.000
that's willing to make
that forum happen,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.520
and force that
conversation to take place.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.270
SACHIT EGAN: Cool.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.820
Thank you.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:30.397
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:37:30.397 --> 00:37:31.980
Well, thanks a lot
just for your time.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.396
It's been really great just
to hear your different stories

00:37:34.396 --> 00:37:35.370
and your experiences.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.330
I was really relating a lot,
because I've also played sports

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.090
as well, and sports has been
a big part of my life too.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.002
And I've been a part of
big teams on the court

00:37:44.002 --> 00:37:45.710
as well as off the
court and professions,

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.500
and I remember different times
where I've been in a situation

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.360
where you're trying
to change the culture,

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.610
and I was relating a lot to
what you were saying with,

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.890
you have the vision of what
you're trying to achieve,

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.770
and you're trying to bring
everybody along there.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.200
And some people might get
it, some people may not.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.165
But one thing I have
experienced too, or have seen,

00:38:03.165 --> 00:38:05.540
is that when leaders are in
that situation, or in those--

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.350
the times right before
it starts to turn,

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:11.754
that you can feel alone,
and like your vision,

00:38:11.754 --> 00:38:13.170
and like what
you're trying to do,

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.890
and you might even wonder to
yourself, is this really right?

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:19.430
Or maybe self-doubt,
or things like that.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:22.520
So just curious, have you
experienced that, or just

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.530
different thoughts
along those lines?

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.520
JENNIFER AZZI: Yeah.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.270
You described that really well.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.510
And I think, too, it's
the classic thing in life

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.110
too, right?

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.760
Right when something's
about to turn,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.924
you're almost ready
to quit, but you

00:38:33.924 --> 00:38:36.090
know there's something
telling you to stick with it,

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.820
stick with it, stick with it.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.420
But there are many times,
before I walk into the gym,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.390
feeling like, am I the only
one that really believes this?

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.300
Am I the only one
that sees this?

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.060
We had a moment with our team
before we won the championship.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.360
We were huddled up at center
court, which we would do that

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.540
after every practice.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.600
And I had just found
out, regardless

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.300
of how we performed
in the WCC tournament,

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.020
that we would go to the NIT.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.390
Which, for USF at that
time, going to the NIT

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.600
is still a really big--
that's a successful season.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.010
You're at 20 wins.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.190
It's a big deal.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.540
We were rated sixth going into
the conference tournament.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.480
But sixth in our
conference was literally

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.730
a matter of one or two points.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:15.979
You could have been in second.

00:39:15.979 --> 00:39:17.060
It just was that tight.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.450
So we had to upset three,
two, and one to end up

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:21.750
winning the whole thing.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.990
So I didn't want them
to feel any pressure.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:24.890
I was like, you guys
have had a great season.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.330
We're on our way.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.110
Go have fun.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.180
We're holding hands.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.700
One of the players--

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.194
and I'm not going to say
what she said exactly,

00:39:33.194 --> 00:39:35.360
but she said, coach-- it
was like she was mad at me.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.750
She said, coach, "mm" the NIT.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.810
We're going to the
NCAA tournament.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.820
And I still have chills
when I think about it,

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.790
because it shifted from
my feeling it to them.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.740
It shifted from me to them.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.870
So when we went to that
tournament, I just knew.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.550
I was like, they got it.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.050
This is not me
walking to the gym

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.989
by myself saying the same
thing over and over again.

00:39:56.989 --> 00:39:57.530
And so I did.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:02.150
It felt like a shift from me to
us all really coming together.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:05.010
We needed that in order to
do what we did that season.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.330
So great point, because I don't
know that people necessarily

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.470
articulate that that well.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:13.370
RICK WELTS: I think everybody
has exact those feelings.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:16.280
If you're going to try to
do things that are hard,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.980
and do things that maybe
haven't been done before,

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.350
you're going to feel like
you're out there on an island

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.600
once in a while.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.490
Everybody does.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.287
And I was having
this conversation--

00:40:26.287 --> 00:40:27.620
did I tell you I love our coach?

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.032
Yeah.

00:40:28.032 --> 00:40:28.856
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:40:28.856 --> 00:40:30.981
RICK WELTS: I was having
this conversation with him

00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:32.909
not that long ago,
and we're kind

00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:34.200
of going back to the beginning.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.533
He had never coached a game
before he coached the Golden

00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:37.985
State Warriors.

00:40:37.985 --> 00:40:40.820
He'd won five championships,
but he'd never been a coach.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.420
And he was talking
about exactly that.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.330
All the preparation that went
into his first training camp,

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.590
and sitting there at his
first game going like,

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:55.010
I have no idea if any of
this is going to work.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.630
And he had that moment.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:00.807
He had that moment where
it's like, I don't know.

00:41:00.807 --> 00:41:02.390
I've done everything
I think I can do,

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.140
but I don't know if
this is going to work.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.840
So you shouldn't feel--

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.210
it's almost comforting
to know that everybody

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.770
has those moments.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.360
And you have to push
your way through

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.920
and get to the other side.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, yes.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.580
Thanks for being here.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.590
This has been really great.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.214
And thank you for
sharing your stories.

00:41:18.214 --> 00:41:21.530
I wanted to touch on
something that we talked

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.170
about earlier around
bringing your whole self,

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.410
and this concept
of vulnerability,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.440
and with athletes who,
in order to become

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.780
an elite athlete, the
amount of self-belief

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.750
that you have to have in
yourself to get there,

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.370
but also creating
a culture where

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.540
it's safe to be accepting
of what you may not possess,

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.730
or your faults, or
your vulnerabilities.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.370
So in an environment
just like that,

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.450
how you navigate those
types of situations.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.542
RICK WELTS: You're the athlete.

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:52.928
SACHIT EGAN: [CHUCKLING]

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.420
JENNIFER AZZI: I guess if
I look at it from being

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:01.360
the athlete in the locker
room, not the coach,

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.410
I think you're right.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.820
It's like, athletes have that--

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.320
if you're at a
certain level, you've

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.270
got that confidence,
and that belief,

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.340
and that strength, and that--

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.110
so how do you show
that other side?

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.710
I do think, to Rick's point
earlier, it's really difficult.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.260
Even in a women's locker
room, it's very difficult,

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.430
because you're supposed to
be strong and keep people

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.040
together.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.450
But I think, if you
have good leadership,

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:28.940
be it in coaching, or
captains, or people--

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.190
I also love Steve Kerr.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.630
He's amazing.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.170
I think he does such a
fantastic job with this.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.224
But I think just encouraging
people to be themselves.

00:42:38.224 --> 00:42:39.640
Because I think
if anyone has been

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.280
in any sort of
successful situation,

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.010
you know that the group
does better when people

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.080
are authentically themselves.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.170
Even that strong dude
in the locker room.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.800
It's important that people
can be vulnerable and share

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.500
all sides.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.500
There still has to be a
professionalism, though.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.150
Because it doesn't
mean that everyone's

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.610
going to go out and hang out,
and it's all friendly friendly,

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.440
but there has to be some
level of being who you are.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.190
RICK WELTS: I think
it's a great question.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.670
I think one of the biggest
challenges in business

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.610
is getting people
to ask questions

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.350
about things they
don't understand,

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.600
especially like in a meeting
environment or something.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.890
I try to be that guy
in the meeting who--

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.806
like, I know nobody understood
what that person just said,

00:43:23.806 --> 00:43:25.930
but everyone's afraid to
look like the dumb one who

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:26.920
didn't get it.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.135
So I like to be that one.

00:43:28.135 --> 00:43:29.260
I like to be that dumb one.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.870
Like, I have no idea
what you just said.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:33.470
I have no idea what that means.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.785
Can you explain to
me what that means?

00:43:35.785 --> 00:43:39.850
And it can take the
pressure out of a group.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:44.050
And as a leader, I
think you can influence

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.730
how much more
confident people are

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.340
in being inquisitive about
things that they feel

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.840
vulnerable about, because
you're prepared to make yourself

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.580
vulnerable too.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.788
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming here today and sharing

00:43:55.788 --> 00:43:57.550
your thoughts and feelings.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.720
So my question's
a bit about ego.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.830
In sports, you definitely
see ego play out

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.920
in terms of players not
being willing to sacrifice

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.500
their roles.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:13.670
And it's common today in the NBA
to have these three-star teams.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.350
The Miami Heat, the Warriors.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.850
And I like to think
about the times

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.360
where you saw Jordan make
that extra pass to one

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.370
of the shooters,
or LeBron learn how

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.920
to trust Mario
Chalmers, or Bosh.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.099
Or even on the flip side,
how Bosh had to accept,

00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:32.140
OK, I'm not going to be
the first option anymore.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.570
Can you talk to me about
how you talk to your players

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.960
about relinquishing that ego,
that ability, or the thought

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.120
process, like, I'm
the man, or the woman,

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.700
and I'm going to score 25
a night, as opposed to,

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.630
I'm going to sacrifice
so that we can win.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:45.520
JENNIFER AZZI: Well,
I think you just

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.436
have to ask people if
they want to win or not.

00:44:47.436 --> 00:44:50.870
If you want to win, this is
what we need to do to get there.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.690
I think the Warriors,
this season,

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:56.440
great example when Klay Thompson
ended up breaking Steph Curry's

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.180
3-point record,
and Steph's the one

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.730
making sure he has the ball.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.320
It's like, I think Steph is
the ultimate team player.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.200
And as good as he is, I
think that's contagious.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.560
And I think, when you
have that on a team,

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.190
that you can be
really successful.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:14.200
And I think, if winning
is the priority over self,

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.689
obviously, then I think
you can get there.

00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:17.980
But I think leadership matters.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.230
I think having a coach
like Steve, really,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.380
he's able to manage all those
different personalities,

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.990
and make them all feel
included and important

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.760
regardless to the
points on the board.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.730
RICK WELTS: I think
for our team, the thing

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:34.750
that our general manager
Bob Myers always points to

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:40.750
was when we asked Andre
Iguodala, NBA All-Star,

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.560
Olympic champion, to not
start, and to come off

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.010
the bench, which, for an NBA
player, is a big difference.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.420
And he willingly
accepted that role.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.680
And as an example
to his team, it

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.820
was extraordinary,
and really helped

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.230
set the tone for the
team that we have today,

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:06.284
because he was willing to accept
something that a lot of players

00:46:06.284 --> 00:46:07.825
wouldn't have been
willing to accept.

00:46:07.825 --> 00:46:09.190
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.980
And I think, unless, there's
any more audience questions,

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.180
we'll ask one more.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.480
I think when you
look at the Warriors

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.230
as they're currently
built, and as they've

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.120
been built through
this run, there

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.710
are so many players who fit
a certain mold really well.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.490
Even the guys like Livingston
at one time, Mo Speights.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:29.080
Everybody plays that role well.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.540
And you always talk about
Steve Kerr, and the way

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.630
that he commands
people's respect.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:38.530
I don't think I knew how good he
was at that until he took over

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.330
as coach of the Warriors.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.730
Observing him, is there
a trait or set of traits

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.397
that he utilizes to
get that respect?

00:46:46.397 --> 00:46:48.105
RICK WELTS: He's an
awesome communicator,

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:50.380
and there's no
player on his roster

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.794
who's confused about
what the role is,

00:46:52.794 --> 00:46:55.210
or what they should be doing,
or what his expectations are

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:55.709
for them.

00:46:55.709 --> 00:46:58.450
And as easy as that sounds,
I think a lot of coaches

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:03.982
aren't really good at that,
and players are not sure

00:47:03.982 --> 00:47:04.940
exactly where they fit.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.150
And I will say that one
of the benefits of having

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:14.720
some sustained success is, all
those players aren't the same.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.500
You mentioned DeMarcus Cousins,
or Matt Barnes, or Nick Young,

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.500
or players that, in
other environments,

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.190
may not have
succeeded really well.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:27.530
Because of the structure
of that team now,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.870
and the leadership
in the locker room,

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:32.300
you can bring a player
like that in who

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.600
can have a new approach to the
way they're playing the game.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.880
I remember-- God, I
sound really old now--

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.690
Dennis Johnson.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.870
Is that a player you ever--

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:43.220
Hall of Fame player.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:47.240
We drafted him at the
Sonics when I was there.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.307
Incredibly athletic.

00:47:49.307 --> 00:47:50.390
Could jump out of the gym.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.520
Couldn't hit the side
of the barn shooting

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.860
when he was drafted.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.610
And won a championship
with us as a starting two

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.710
guard with the Sonics.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.050
Was a total jerk the
whole time he was there.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.160
Was not a good teammate.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.980
Was not a good
person to be around.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.770
Got traded to Phoenix.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:12.620
Had the same problem in
Phoenix after a couple years.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.280
Got traded to Boston and became
a completely different player,

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.160
because he got put in an
environment with Larry Bird,

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.860
Robert Parrish, Kevin McHale.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.040
And that wasn't the
way it worked there.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.350
And he wasn't the big dog there.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:32.480
And he became the best
player imaginable, All-Star

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.000
repeatedly, champion repeatedly.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.900
But if you can create
the right culture,

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.660
you can bring people into that
culture who may not naturally

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.737
gravitate toward that, but
will because of the strength

00:48:44.737 --> 00:48:45.820
of the people around them.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.952
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:48:46.952 --> 00:48:48.660
Jennifer and Rick,
thanks for being here.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.670
Thanks for your time.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:50.500
Appreciate it.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:50.650
JENNIFER AZZI: Thank you.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:51.680
RICK WELTS: Thank you.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.180
Yeah.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:53.939 --> 00:48:54.980
JENNIFER AZZI: Thank you.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.313
RICK WELTS: It was a lot of fun.

00:48:56.313 --> 00:48:57.430
Yeah, thank you.
