[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:08.648
As part of this course, you'll be given access to a virtual machine that

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.801
contains an environment and tools that should aid your work for

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:15.914
the course. For example, the virtual machine has ARGO UML,

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:20.470
a UML-aware drawing tool. You are not required to use ARGO UML, but

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.810
it may enable you to get started more quickly with the UML related work.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.760
There are other tools such as Eclipse installed as well. In addition to

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.780
the virtual machine you should also be aware of the class resources page.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.050
It not only contains links to all the courses required readings, but

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.970
other items referenced in the lessons, and some pointers.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.220
That should allow you to dig deeper into topics that interest you.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.590
I encourage you to explore. Also, if you are aware of other interesting

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.530
resources, let us know on the class forum and we will add them to this page.
