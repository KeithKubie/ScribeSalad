00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.980
SPEAKER 1: To celebrate the
mathematical constant of pi,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.220
we're going to attempt the most
accurate calculation ever

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.240
of pi using pies.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.309
Now, before we do our pie-based
pi calculation,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.900
we'll have a quick crash course
in circles and why pi

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.500
so important.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.290
Now to do that because we're in
the UK, home of many famous

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.490
circles, we've come from the
oldest and greatest circles,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.390
which is, of course, this one.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.720
It's the football circle here at
Knott County Football Club.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.040
Apparently, they are
the world's oldest

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.493
Football League club.

00:00:37.493 --> 00:00:38.460
SPEAKER 2: How do
you know that?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.580
SPEAKER 1: There's a giant
sign that says that

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.435
right behind me.

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.690
Which does mean for a while
there, I guess they had no one

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.000
else to play, but who knows.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.340
So this circle here, as you can
see, there's two things

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.500
going on with the circle.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.270
First of all, there
is the diameter.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.090
So it's this nice, wonderful
straight line here that goes

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.790
right through the middle
of the circle.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.250
And the great thing about
diameter is it's a nice

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.770
straight line.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.380
So if I wanted to, I could get
a measuring tape, and I could

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.450
measure from the start all the
way across here to the finish

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.380
and get a very precise
measurement of the distance

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.480
across the circle.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.210
Now around here, we have
the circumference.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.470
Now this is a lot harder
to measure.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.500
As you can see, it's
a curved line.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.870
So instead of having
to measure it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.100
directly, we can use pi.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.980
Now pi is the ratio of the
straight line diameter to the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.760
total distance all the way
around the outside.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.900
And if we know that ratio, we
can do one measurement for the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.910
diameter, multiply it by pi, and
get the exact distance all

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.630
the way around the outside.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.360
All right, enough messing around
on a football pitch--

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.340
let's go get our pies out.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.240
All right, first thing
we need is a circle.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.250
SPEAKER 2: People find
it notoriously

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.340
hard to draw circles.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.345
How do you get around
this problem?

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.600
SPEAKER 1: Actually, we were
talking to the guy who does

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.270
the circle on the pitch for
the football stadium here.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.680
And he does it the same way,
I think, most people do.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.160
He gets a bit of string, makes
the middle bit of the string

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.350
remain perfectly still in what
will become the center of the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.880
circle, and then use that to
draw a nice, equal distance

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.430
line all the way around.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.650
In fact, I guess that's the best
way to define a circle--

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.710
it's the line of all the points
the same distance away

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.080
from a center point.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.800
The center point will
be my pen, and the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.070
outside will be the chalk.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.744
All right.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.420
Let's do this.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.020
My goal is to not actually do
any measurements other than

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.140
using pies.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.566
So the entire thing is going
to be pie-based.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.530
We get the circumference and the
exact number of pies, give

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.060
or take, we get the diameter and
number of pies, divide one

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.520
by the other, we get pi.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.290
Pi was historically really
calculated this way because

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.260
it's notoriously inaccurate
to try and calculate pi by

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.510
measuring a circle.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.970
To get any kind of accuracy on
our final answer, we have to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.590
be as precise as we can be.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.200
This is a mild problem because
I want to go through from the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.140
very edge of the circle, but,
as you can see, I've

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.500
positioned all the pies exactly
on the line as if

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.180
they're little mini tangents.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.570
So I'm going to have to move
these two out, and then I can

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.175
start doing the diameter exactly
on the circumference

00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:13.425
there like that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.240
So that's 84 and 1/3.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.540
264 and 2/3 pies around, where
the diameter is 84 and 1/3 pi.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.800
To get pi, we just divide the
circumference by the diameter.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.770
OK, and if we actually work out
what that is, it equals--

00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:52.320
that's pretty good.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:04.680
Pi from pies, we got 3.13834,
which is approximately 3.14.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.975
So using pies, we've
got pi to be 3.14.

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:14.570
I am a very happy
man right now.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.580
Anything between 3.1 and 3.2,
I would have been happy.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.855
But to get 3.14, I'm
downright ecstatic.

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:21.714
So there you are.

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:26.360
That is officially the world's
most accurate calculation of

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.170
pi using pies.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.803
SPEAKER 2: It wasn't really
something we planned to make

00:05:32.803 --> 00:05:35.750
part of the video, but as a
lot of you have asked, the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.540
pies we used were donated and
were no longer fit for human

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.430
consumption.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.840
So we couldn't give them to
charity, like we did, for

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.050
example, with all the
to baked beans that

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.780
Heinz donated us earlier.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.090
However, in the spirit of pi
day, we did attempt to make

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.300
some kind of gesture, and we
donated 314 pounds, of course

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.840
314, to a local charity here in
Nottingham that helps give

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.690
food to people in
times of crisis.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.390
Now, a lot of have expressed a
lot of interest in charity,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.300
and we'd really encourage you,
if you're in a position to do

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.290
so, to also make a donation.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.570
And we've put some links
under the video.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.980
And because we're all
numberphiles here, why not

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.330
make your donation a multiple
of pi in some way?

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.260
SPEAKER 1: 16, 17, 18, this is
length L. And that means that

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.090
the distance here is 2L.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.340
OK?
