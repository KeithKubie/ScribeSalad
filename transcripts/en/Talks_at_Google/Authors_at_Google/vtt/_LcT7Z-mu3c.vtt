SHILPA: It is my
extreme pleasure

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.940
to introduce to you
all Harold Davis,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.920
an award-winning
photographer, the author

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.550
of several bestselling books
about photography and image

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.900
processing.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.280
And his artwork, we have
some in the back of the room.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.400
You're going to see
some on the slides.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.254
It's been shown all
around the world.

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:24.670
So we're really
excited for Harold

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.250
to be here with us to share
the passion and the story

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.020
behind the photos.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.750
And with that, please welcome
me in joining Harold Davis.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.550
HAROLD DAVIS: Hi, everybody.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.390
Thank you very much
for having me here.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.250
It's really fun to be
at Google, the thing

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.860
I use every day, all the
time, for everything.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.100
So hi, everyone.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.880
I'm a photographer and a writer.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.870
And when I was asked to think
about this talk, what Shilpa

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.710
said to me is tips and
techniques to help people

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.480
become a better
photographer is what

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.850
is going to matter to them.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.620
I started to think
about this, and I

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.140
don't know how to put
this very politely,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.860
but the fact is that for
technically competent people--

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.930
which I'm going to
make the assumption

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.760
that everyone in this room is--

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.270
the technical part of
pragmatic photography

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.560
can be encapsulated in somewhere
between six and 12 slides.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.360
So that's not the hard part.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.000
The hard part is the
non-technical part.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.770
It's a non-hierarchical
field that, once you master

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.170
the gear and the
theory of exposure,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.170
it's more about
feeling, spirituality,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.180
things that are a bit
more touchy-feely.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.160
So I decided to call my talk
"The Zen of Photography."

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.610
And here's a message from
your sponsor, my book that's

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.580
for sale out there.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.580
This is a new
hot-off-the-press book.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.400
It's called "The Photographer's
Black and White Handbook."

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm the author of 19
photography books, some of which

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.500
have been bestsellers.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.229
I'm also the author of
about 30 other books

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.389
on a variety of topics.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.770
This was my previous
photography book,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.390
which was called "Achieving Your
Potential as a Photographer."

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.330
And the one before that,
"The Way of the Digital

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.350
Photographer."

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.480
And here are some of
my backlist titles

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.570
on Photoshop, on black and white
photography, night photography,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.840
macro photography.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.530
I've been translated
into about 20 languages.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.090
This is the Spanish
edition of one

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.420
of my black and white books.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.520
Lest you think I only know
about photography, if you look

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.110
carefully at these
slides, you'll

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.420
note that my name is on these
books related to Google,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.470
including the still-in-print
"Google Advertising

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.750
Tools" in its second edition.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.210
So I've had a number of lives.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.060
And I'm going to
say that there's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.280
more to life than a cubicle.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.120
That said, if I can convey
the sense in this talk

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.850
that what every field
that's worth doing

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.210
is about a soaring
imagination, that

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.800
would be what I want to convey.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.090
You can have a soaring
imagination in a cubicle,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.590
in fact.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.390
But I have lived a life,
since I left programming

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.140
and IT behind, that has
been very adventurous

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.230
and taken me to some
incredibly wild places.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.080
This talk is organized into
a section on black and white

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.290
and then a somewhat
mirroring section on color.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.360
So let's start with this
image of a workbench.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.260
It's an antique
Russian workbench

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.760
in Fort Ross, where the Russians
back in the 19th century

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.370
owned about half of
what's now California.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.540
And note that I
created this photograph

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.210
to look as much like
an etching as a photo.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.750
So I am a post-film
digital photographer.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.300
One of my collectors said,
Harold, what you really do

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.850
is you use photographs
as your source material,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.970
digital photographs as
your source material,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.260
and you paint with them.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.390
And that's a fairly
accurate depiction.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.720
What I do is one
part digital painting

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.490
and one part photography.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.390
It's important to realize that
essentially what a camera is

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.950
these days is a computer
with a lens at one end

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.930
and a scanner at the other end.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.600
I call this image "The
Road Less Traveled."

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.990
And basically, it's a
foggy day near where

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.990
I live at the Green Dragons
[INAUDIBLE] Monastery.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.930
And there are two roads,
and you can make a choice--

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.270
take the easy one,
or take the hard one,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.830
or try to live up fully
to your potential.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.330
What is it that you can do
that's most worth doing?

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.590
One thing that photographers
at a certain point run into

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.740
is many images have
been made already.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.280
Ansel Adams made,
essentially, a great image

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.830
from the spot, Tunnel
View, in Yosemite Valley.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.130
And you go there, and when
the light is pretty good,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.640
you see about 50
photographers lined up

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.700
with tripods making the image,
but it's still worth doing.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.010
I use this image of a
slot canyon in Arizona

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.430
to show that, even
though you have

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.380
tons of information
in photography,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.980
it's not always wise to show it.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.890
The photographs you've
seen are largely

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.830
what are called monochromatic
HDR photographs, namely,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.390
they're bracketed
sequences of shots.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.710
But with this image,
the black area

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.780
at the bottom, the
triangle, and up at the top,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.970
I had plenty of
information to reproduce

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.100
every detail in
there, but I chose

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.030
not to to make a dramatic
ribbon of light at the top.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.910
So the topic of
light is something

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.820
that comes up a great deal in
photography for good reasons.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.350
Not only is it built into
the word "photography,"

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.340
"writing with light," but
as a matter of physics,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.660
it's absolutely impossible
to photograph an object.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.560
All you can capture
using a sensor

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.900
is light that is
emitted or reflected

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.100
by an object, one or the other.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.460
So one of the really
important things

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.750
as you start to take your photos
beyond the just common level

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.480
is to analyze the
light that's coming in.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.890
Is it reflected?

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.740
Is it emitted?

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.010
What is it reflected
or emitted by?

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.720
That will get you pretty far
in terms of understanding it.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.870
This is a nice
reflection in a pond

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.250
up in Maine at Maine Media
Workshops, where I teach.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.270
So many black and
white images are best

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.600
done where there is essentially
an absence of visual color

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.500
anyhow.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.860
One of the ways you
say, hey, is something

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.350
going to work for black and
white, is to look out and say,

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.210
there's not much
color here anyhow.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.960
And at night is a good
time to find that.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.550
During the day, this
would essentially

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.512
have been impossible to make
in black and white or color

00:07:18.512 --> 00:07:19.970
because it would
be full of people.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.820
But at night,
there's nobody there,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.790
and you can get a nice
range, dynamic range,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.310
from darkest dark
to blackest white.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.580
An overlooked but
very difficult part

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.150
of being a professional or
serious amateur photographer

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.530
today is data management.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.340
I have upwards of 100
terabytes of data.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.140
I have to be able to find stuff.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.810
When I have a client
who wants to license

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.850
an image from 10
years ago, I need

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.410
to be able to find
the relevant files.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.580
So one of the things I help
educate photographers in

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.010
is how to maintain
a content management

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.580
system for photography.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.600
So there are many ways you can
get black and white images.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.556
You can set your camera to do a
black and white JPEG, and then

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:13.180
the next image, you
turn it off, so you

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.620
can have black and white color.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.770
But the recommendation for high
quality black and white that

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.500
can be reproduced like
the prints of mine you see

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.320
in the back, or in
really high quality,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.200
or like the book
that is back there,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.690
is to create a four-color
image, and then,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.740
using one or more RAW files--

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.590
and the loop towards your right
on this particular diagram

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.500
is the question of whether
it's one or more files--

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.040
convert it to color, and
then use a layered conversion

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.130
to black and white.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.860
So this is a little
bit like the old zone

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.140
system was for
chemical photography,

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.400
because using targeted layers,
layer masks, and painting

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.980
tools, you can say
exactly how you

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.890
want to convert each part of
an image to black and white.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.570
And it doesn't all
have to be the same.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.900
And that's a really
important point.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.530
Essentially, there's a hierarchy
of black and white conversion

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.880
techniques where one axis
here is the effort involved,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.800
and the other is the quality.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.760
This could be summed
up "no pain, no gain."

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.950
So I spent a lot of time
in the Photoshop darkroom.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:32.800
Generally, for any kind of
photography, what really

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.420
happens is you get some kind of
concept, and then you go out,

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.370
and you try and photograph it.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.436
And there's a recognition
of whether you got it.

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:44.560
And then you go back, and
you say, how did it work?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.893
Or maybe it didn't work so well.

00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:47.680
Let me plan to do it again.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.840
And then you go,
and you process it.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.590
And ultimately, at the bottom
of this hierarchy of things

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.060
you do, you edit.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.090
And edit is a hugely important
process in photography.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:04.150
And then you show it, you
print it, you put it in a book.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.210
I don't feel I really
understand any of my images

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.360
until they're
beyond the monitors.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.340
You can't really tell
for sure how good

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.500
an image is as
long as it is only

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.890
seen digitally on monitors.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:23.770
So I worry most about
whether my images

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.200
convey a quality of emotion.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.030
That's what I care about.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.900
And you can take a fairly
commonly photographed object,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.130
like this nautilus shell.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.890
Somewhat counterintuitively,
I photographed

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.310
this nautilus shell on a
white light background.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.020
There was light
coming through it.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:47.080
And then I transformed it into
a black background in Photoshop.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.470
And it's been a standout image,
reproduced many, many times

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.460
all over the place.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.020
And people don't
really understand

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.780
that part of the reason
for that is the glow that's

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.760
coming through the
shell, which you wouldn't

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.040
see if you lit it differently.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.830
Of course, you can
also go and see

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.520
whether you can shoot vegetables
to look like women or waves

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.470
coming in on the ocean.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.560
And one of the really fun
things about photography

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.230
is the way you can control
how motion is rendered,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.720
such as the motion of
water in these waves.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.790
It's the shutter
speed setting, which

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.550
is very badly named, because
it's not actually a speed,

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.620
it's a duration of time.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:33.670
So that's a good takeaway
for the six technical slides.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.300
Shutter speed is not a speed.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.030
It is a duration of time.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.400
And how motion is
going to be rendered

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:46.870
depends upon how much time
you expose the subject

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.940
to the medium in your camera.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.270
A tell with this
photo that it's not

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.150
exactly what it seems
in terms of the lighting

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.940
is the fact that the
freighter in the background

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.140
has lights on.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.380
So this was captured
at about midnight

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.180
on a dark, cloudy night.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.580
The long exposure makes for
the luminosity, and the clouds,

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.640
and the water.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.050
And again, this is really
a question of the light.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.170
From a digital
camera's point of view,

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.250
if you vary the exposure to
vary for the quantity of light,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.130
it doesn't really care whether
it's low light or high light

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.650
very much.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.830
There are a couple
of footnotes on that,

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.780
but that's basically true.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.850
And again, another long exposure
water image, the Cayucos

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.130
Pier off the coast
of California.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.270
One of the things I look for
in my black and white images

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:44.180
is what's called high-key
and low-key imagery.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.630
This is a bridge near Astoria,
Oregon, over a big bay.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.440
And my purpose in doing it was
to go from dark on the left

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.540
to light on the right.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.330
And this is the opposite--
a dark image at night

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.350
where the purpose is to
create a dark look about it.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.350
And the sun's setting behind
Bixby Bridge on the Big Sur

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.460
coast, which, by the
way, as you may know,

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.140
is now closed to all traffic
because of 45 mudslides

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.320
all along the
coast or something.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.570
With this night shot of the Bay
Bridge in San Francisco, what

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.960
I did was I timed it so
that the moon was behind

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.380
the pillar of the bridge there.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.790
A joke is that it used to be
hard to do things like this.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.340
And these days, there are
a couple of different apps

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.280
that let you calculate
sun, moon, position, angle.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.280
One is called The
Photographer's Ephemeris, TPE,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.470
and it's basically
a Google Maps mashup

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.660
that's got the right sun
and moon charts in it.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.730
Safety pin is an
object in California.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.379
It says, if you're an
immigrant, you're OK with us.

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:51.670
We're not going to turn you in.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.110
So I don't know whether that's
a symbol here yet or not,

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.000
but it is for us.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.750
So one of the things
that used to be,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.780
when I was a film photographer
in the darkroom, I

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.734
used to use chemicals
to create toning.

00:14:06.734 --> 00:14:08.400
There was a process
called solarization,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.850
where you would turn the
light on in the darkroom

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.910
and partly expose the
paper as it was processing.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.370
Well, there are
various simulated ways

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.910
to do the same technique with
black and white photography

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.560
in the digital darkroom.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.511
Also, you can use things like
mobile phones and mobile phone

00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:26.010
apps.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.880
So the last two photographs that
I've shown you are iPhone apps.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.740
This is an iPhone app also.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.900
And what I have
found recently is

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.350
that there is actually a market
for reasonable size prints

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.270
that I make on the iPhone.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.850
And one of these days,
I'm going to just

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.790
give up the big cameras and
the 30-pound gear on my back

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.050
and just carry my iPhone around.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.550
Maybe.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.630
As if.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.020
People look at this image.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.280
Is it Chinese mountains?

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.150
No.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.820
It's a beach with sand, and
you can see the footprints

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.390
at the top.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:03.880
So seeing is what
photography is really about.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.470
With this one, I timed
it so that the moon

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.440
was rising in increments
enough that it bisected

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.150
the previous shot of the moon.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.450
The cables you see there
are the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.660
And one neat trick you
can do in black and white

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.640
is you can invert images.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.580
Like in the chemical
darkroom, the difference

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.180
between positive and negative,
a negative was the negative,

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.500
and a print was the positive.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.450
Well, these days, you
can do the same thing

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.340
and flip back and forth easily.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.100
So if you want to create an
image like this Tuscan road

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.400
in an antique frame, it's
really pretty easy to do that.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.800
This image of the
rooftops of Paris

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.000
is what's called split-toned
in black and white.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.170
Sorry about that.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:55.800
I processed part of it for
the roofs for one tonality

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.100
and the buildings for another
to create greater gradations

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.310
in the size of the building.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.890
Point here, really, in
this sepia-toned image

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.110
is that the circumflex
is like a little face

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.700
alone on the keyboard.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.590
And another sepia image.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:15.540
So some of my images are what's
called monochromatic HDR, which

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.230
means they're extra high
resolution black and white

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:23.220
done through a sequence of
captures that are combined.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.240
And things like this
one where, if you

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.310
think about where
the sun is coming up

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.950
under this dragon in
the Anza-Borrego Desert,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.530
this side of the dragon
would be totally black.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.300
But it's blended
together so that I

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.030
have the white and the black.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.680
And the last was the wheels
that run the San Francisco cable

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.340
cars.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.760
And this is a slot
canyon in Arizona.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.340
And as you can see, my
photography in recent years

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.500
has taken me all over the world.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.660
And it's also taken me
to places like this,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.330
which is under the
Berkeley, California, pier,

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.120
and I got to share it
with rats and crabs.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.450
So being a photographer
professionally is not

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.240
for the squeamish, necessarily.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.540
It is for people who enjoy
seeing beautiful things.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.230
This is along the Kumano
Kodo pilgrimage trail

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.180
in Japan in the Kii Mountains.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.339
And it's called The
View of 10,000 Peaks

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.109
from a particular pass.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.450
There are about maybe
100 I could count,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.060
but they say 10,000.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.839
Now if you just noticed, there
is a black and white version,

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.150
and here is a color
version of the same.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.490
Here is a color
version of the shot

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.850
of the Pyramid in the Louvre
Court that I showed you

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.310
a couple of slides ago as well.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.020
So my pattern here is
that I'm mirroring back,

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.412
and I've moved into color.

00:17:41.412 --> 00:17:42.870
But the point,
really, is you don't

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.800
have to decide whether you're
doing black and white or color

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.720
until you come to
process the image.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.920
You shoot everything the same,
really, as an RGB color RAW

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.300
file.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.310
So digital photography
is a reality.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.560
No, it's not reality, it's art.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.450
If I were a
journalist, there would

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.490
be a strict code about
what I had to do,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.800
and I would hope I
would adhere to it.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.120
But as a photographic artist,
I can do whatever I want

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.660
and wherever my
imagination takes me.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.480
I like to photograph
glasses at the dinner table

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.050
when I'm traveling since
I do so much traveling.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.800
And this, I think of as the
Eye of Sauron in a wine glass.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.660
And this one was
more intentional

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.080
because what I did was I put
a marble on a piece of paper,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.910
lit it with a
single strong light,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.540
and then I blended a shot of
the ocean into the shadow.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.690
So obviously,
something like this

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.840
is a photo composition with a
nautilus shell and a drawing

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.410
render of a photo,
so it's a drawing

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.700
coming to life, kind of.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.410
And similarly with this, this is
an in-camera multiple exposure

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.010
done with choreography with
a single model and studio

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.346
strobes.

00:18:57.346 --> 00:19:01.510
And this also, I had the
model basically pirouette

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.290
on a ring in the air and
photographed her about eight

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.550
times.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:11.770
And similarly here, the effect
is one of an Indian goddess.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.350
So a camera is an
extension of ourselves.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.290
For me, it's a way to explore,
to get to know things,

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.050
to understand things,
to see the things I love

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.060
about this wonderful
Earth of ours,

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.790
to explore what
happens with time.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.520
This is an
eight-minute exposure.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.340
What happens to the roaring
waves of the Pacific

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.900
when they roar in
at eight minutes?

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.780
They smooth out and get calm.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.010
This is Tuscany.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.510
This is the Lombard
region of lakes in Italy

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.760
with the blue light of dawn.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.210
The joke about photographers
who care about color

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.860
is that what you
really care about

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.130
is the blue light at dawn,
and then the golden hour

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.440
a half hour before
sunset, and the blue light

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.710
after that golden hour, and you
can sleep the rest of the day.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.620
And this is more or less true.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.310
It's a hill town in France
and a hill town in Italy.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.460
So, yes, let's wonder
about what's out there.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.740
That's a great goal
for photography.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.920
This is the town and
monastery of Nachisan,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.020
which is at the inland sea
terminus of the Kumano Kodo

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.130
trail in Japan.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.740
And I tried to add
painting elements

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.160
to this image to make it
look a bit like Shangri-La.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.450
A park in the suburbs of Paris.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.380
People.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.270
Proper study of
people as people.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.770
This guy had four kids,
and he had them all

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.030
tattooed on himself.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.690
I have four kids too, but I'm
not going to tattoo them on me.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.160
This is my youngest, my
daughter, Katie Rose.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.900
There she is.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.560
There they are.

00:20:54.624 --> 00:20:57.700
This is a model that I
photographed for a while

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.600
in Paris.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.850
My third son.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.300
Here he is again.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.140
There am I. You got to
take things a little

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.600
lightly sometimes.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.850
That's just to see
if you're awake.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.102
Want to take better photos?

00:21:12.102 --> 00:21:14.060
Well, the first thing
you say is stand in front

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.260
of more interesting things.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.690
Yeah, if you go to
the Marin Headlands

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.730
in front of the
Golden Gate Bridge,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.400
you'll take better
pictures, probably.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.530
But the real trick is to have
something interesting to say.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.090
Every photo is a
kind of narrative,

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.990
and it's a poem or a story.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.120
And you can't do
a great narrative

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.100
without some idea
of who you are.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.700
Now this one.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.746
OK.

00:21:35.746 --> 00:21:37.370
There's a nice list
there on the right,

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.230
but leaving that
outside, consider this

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.150
an example of multitasking.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.540
By the way, so potty,
meal, mouse, and clicker.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.790
My son hates it when
I show this slide.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.480
I'm a digital painter, and I use
photos for my source material.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.540
One of the interesting
things about photography

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.820
is that there are so
many different uses

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.290
you can make of it.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.300
This image I call
"A Kiss for a Rose."

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.610
And it's interesting
from a Google perspective

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.440
because if you search Google
Images for "Georgia O'Keeffe,"

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.860
"rose," this is always
on the return list,

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.110
which, since she's a great
painter, I don't mind.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.990
One of the things I really
love to photograph are flowers.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.730
This is an arrangement that I
shot on a backlit light box.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.590
Somebody said to me it looks
like Bulgarian folk art.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.590
But I actually think of
it as a low geostationary

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.580
orbit of jasmine buds
around a clematis.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.850
So it all depends how
you look at things.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.220
And more light box
flower photography.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.710
So one of the ways that it's
interesting to print some

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.250
of these images is to
take nice exotic papers

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.730
and make them look
like something special.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.660
Like this image of the
Sagrada Familia in Barcelona

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.970
can look beautiful
on a metallic paper.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.720
In my book "Achieving
Your Potential,"

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:11.030
there is a story of a hero's
journey at the end where people

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.200
can fill out their stops.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.350
And in some ways, being an
artist or a photographer

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.180
is like going on a journey
and taking a quest.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.280
And sometimes, if
you're open to things,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.480
there are side
trips on the quest.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.840
Beginner's mind is great.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.210
I envy anybody in here who
doesn't know much about

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.860
photography because that
means you can experiment.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.650
You can try anything you want.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.860
And you don't have to
say, OK, each image

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.940
has to be really good.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.290
You can just try it and see.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.520
That's really how I learned.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.550
I tried everything
I could think of.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.590
And I'm going to
just finish it up

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.000
with a couple of night images.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.820
The last one you saw
was at Jemaa el-Fnaa

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.160
in Marrakesh, the
place of the dead

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.290
where they have camels
and everything else

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.460
you can imagine.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.990
This is about a two-hour
exposure off Point Reyes,

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.510
and look what happens
again to the giant rollers

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.720
from the Pacific when you
calm them out like that.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.530
This is an about
three-hour exposure

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.890
in the great Bristlecone Pine
Forest of the White Mountains

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.120
of California, and these are the
world's oldest living things.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.350
Imagine.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.650
So these kinds of photos
of the night that I

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:24.200
take that are multiple-hour
exposures are like the world

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.110
as a tree or a rock sees them.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.030
It's also worth noting that
as Vincent van Gogh said,

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.000
the colors of the night can
be as vibrant and charged

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.830
as the colors of the day.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.780
I like answering emails
related to photography,

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.320
and here's some of my
contact info and my blog.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.547
And with that,
thank you very much.

00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:45.443
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:46.497 --> 00:24:48.080
SHILPA: Thank you,
Harold, for sharing

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.650
all those wonderful
pictures and insights.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.685
So now, I get the
opportunity to ask

00:24:52.685 --> 00:24:55.010
you some questions
about the inspiration

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.690
behind going into
photography and why

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.530
you started in this discipline.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.850
So I read that you actually
went to computer science school

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.320
and had a math major as well,
and then went to law school.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.900
And then what
changed the direction

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.360
of what you were focusing
to go into something

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.250
so much more creative?

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.100
HAROLD DAVIS: Well, they're
two separate questions.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.470
Thank you.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.720
Law school wasn't for me.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.040
I'm just not cut
out to be a lawyer.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.300
In terms of my background
as a computer programmer,

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.590
it's something I
still love, and I

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.570
think it's a very
creative endeavor,

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.250
and I think it has
a lot in common

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.740
with being a photographer
at its highest practice.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.310
There's a very zen aspect
to good programming.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.110
SHILPA: Thank you
for noting that,

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.500
because I think that's
important to showcase

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.600
that both elements are
creative in their own art form.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.540
And how have you
leveraged that foundation

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.660
with what you do
today in processing?

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.830
HAROLD DAVIS: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:05.900
At the core level, I'm
not scared of computers.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.800
And I worked for an
enterprise database company.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.130
I know how to create a CMS.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.620
And I know how to
write Photoshop macros.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.880
I've written probably a dozen
books on programming languages,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.190
from C# to Java and so on.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:29.470
And I've worked for major
software houses and so on.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.450
And I joke, the only
thing I program these days

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:36.170
are Photoshop macros,
but it's so important.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.500
After all, what you have
with a digital photo

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.320
are bits of information,
just like in a computer.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.390
And you have to have
some sense of how you can

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.320
organize these and use them.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.730
Now, true, I'm using a
high-level program in Photoshop

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.820
with visual feedback, but
still, having some concept

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.710
of the modeling that's
going on underneath

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.592
and what calculations it's
making is really crucial.

00:26:58.592 --> 00:27:00.050
SHILPA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.650
Did you find that translating
and molding that background

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:08.630
and applying it to photography
and to writing was difficult?

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:12.050
Did you find changing
that mindset--

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.150
HAROLD DAVIS: That's a
great question, Shilpa.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.649
There are a couple
of aspects to it.

00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:22.910
Writing a book, when it's
a technical how-to book,

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.420
at any rate, is an issue
of organization, largely.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.270
If you have a good
outline, then each chapter

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.936
is writing a term
paper in college.

00:27:30.936 --> 00:27:32.810
I don't know about you,
but I was pretty good

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.340
at term papers in college.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.190
In fact, I partly worked
my way through college

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.330
with writing term
papers for other people.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.830
SHILPA: Wow.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.920
I needed you.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.040
HAROLD DAVIS: A book,
if you're well-organized

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.176
and you break it down into
bit-sized pieces, that's what's

00:27:49.176 --> 00:27:50.300
involved in writing a book.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.910
You can't teach
something to somebody

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:54.620
unless you understand it.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.546
And at the same time, teaching
it or writing a book about it

00:27:58.546 --> 00:28:00.920
is a great way to learn it
more deeply because you really

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.640
have to know it to explain
it and write about it.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.210
On the other hand, there
really is a different mindset

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.610
from working for a
technology company

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.650
and being a free,
creative person.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:20.875
And sometimes, I almost have
to turn a switch for myself.

00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:21.500
SHILPA: I know.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.180
I find that even
personally, when

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.710
I try to do that,
it's a struggle

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.840
to switch between the two hats.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.480
But you've done it so well and
integrated the two together so

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.600
beautifully, as we saw today.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.090
So talking about the book, "The
Photographer's Black and White

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.820
Handbook," you alluded
to it, but let's

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.919
talk a little bit more about
why only black and white.

00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:43.460
HAROLD DAVIS: Well,
one of the things

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.100
that works very well
with photography

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.600
is to intentionally
choose limits

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.550
because that gets
you some constraints

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.530
that you can bounce against.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.840
So I like doing that
in a number of ways.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.520
Sometimes, I'm
going to say, hey,

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.090
I'll go out and just photograph
with one lens today, one

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.370
focal length, or
maybe one aperture.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.470
So black and white is
interesting that way.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.540
But it's also
interesting because color

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.250
is very seductive.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.490
When you see something
in color, it's

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.600
like you're going
to go to that first.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.610
And it hides a
multiplicity of flaws.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.450
Portraying something
in black and white

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.140
is like portraying its bones,
the essence of a thing.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.080
Composition matters much more
in black and white photography

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.490
than it does in color.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.500
There's also an
instinctive reaction

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.840
that people have when
you present something

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.750
in black and white because
they know it isn't natural.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.620
It's not the world.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.060
This business that
photography is

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.076
reality, which is never
true anyhow, that's

00:29:48.076 --> 00:29:49.950
cut when you say black
and white because they

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.220
know it's not reality.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.520
So it's a way of setting
it off and saying,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.860
this is art that is
strong and powerful.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.740
And that also has a little bit
to do with the historical roots

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.710
of photography because it was
black and white for so long,

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.970
up until the late 1950s, really.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.480
SHILPA: And so there's a
varying level of photographers

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.980
in the audience
today, so if they

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.990
are interested in
capturing a really

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:16.370
beautiful black and white image,
is there a certain equipment

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:21.720
list, a certain tool to use in
post-production or post-imaging

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.510
that you would recommend?

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:27.300
HAROLD DAVIS: Well,
the best camera to use

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.110
is the one you have with you.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:35.820
That sounds like a piece of
sophism, but it's very true.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.490
So I would say the
first piece of advice

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.880
I would have is start carrying
a camera around with you.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.700
Because what often happens
is we hit something,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.160
and for some reason we don't
stop to take a photo of it.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.100
Like on my way walking down
here, I passed a fire hydrant.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.760
And the top of the hydrant had
this wonderful hexagonal, shiny

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.910
nut on top of it
behind a red thing.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:01.020
So I stopped with my
iPhone, and took the time

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.860
to compose it right, and
did a symmetrical shot

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.480
of the fire hydrant.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.210
So I'm not a gearhead.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.670
That's one of the
things that comes up

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.480
a fair amount in my
workshops and stuff.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.660
It's just not the
most important part.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.240
That said, if you
want to do some

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.370
of the things I
do professionally,

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.420
which is to reproduce
a mural that's

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.420
10 feet by 20 feet with
nice resolution or something

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.000
like that, you do need
high-resolution gear,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.330
good lenses, tripods,
good technique, and so on.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.090
I do recommend
Photoshop as the tool

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.000
to use for processing
photos, but Lightroom,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.090
Adobe's other offering,
is also pretty good.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.104
SHILPA: OK, great.

00:31:43.104 --> 00:31:44.520
And then in terms
of apps, you had

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.936
mentioned that
there are some apps

00:31:45.936 --> 00:31:48.960
that you use on your iPhone.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.660
For folks out there that
use Android as well,

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.935
what apps would you recommend
for image filtering or post?

00:31:55.935 --> 00:31:58.020
HAROLD DAVIS: Here's a
message from our sponsor.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:02.720
The go-to app on the
iPhone is Google Snapseed.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.550
It beats anything else out
there by an order of magnitude.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.180
SHILPA: I'm glad to hear that.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:09.971
HAROLD DAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:20.210
So I actually have a list of
recommended apps that I use,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.020
and I'd be happy to
send it to anyone who

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.660
wants it who sends me an email.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.390
Besides that, I do like
some of the Painterly apps.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:32.490
There's a thing called
Waterlogue that's really good.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.100
There are a variety of things.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.500
Oddly, you can actually
do layers and masking

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.790
on the iPhone.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.530
There's an app
called Leonardo that

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.760
lets you do gradients,
layers, masking, and so on.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.770
I find when I'm
doing that that I

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.920
must be totally insane and
obsessive-compulsive because

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.100
here I am painting a mask
on a stupid little screen,

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.110
but you can do it.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.860
SHILPA: Thank you.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.780
I already spent
an hour filtering

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.880
using Instagram
filters, so I can only

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.890
imagine opening up
to the world of apps,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.626
I will spend five hours,
probably, filtering a picture.

00:33:04.626 --> 00:33:07.202
So thank you for that.

00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:09.410
And one thing that you
mentioned on one of the slides

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.076
was interesting.

00:33:10.076 --> 00:33:14.160
You said that, in order to
really capture a great picture,

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.537
you need to become an
interesting person,

00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:18.370
as a matter of fact.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:22.230
So how did you, in your life--

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.550
or how do you define
what is interesting?

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.050
HAROLD DAVIS: Yes.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.030
[LAUGH]

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.600
There's no single
answer to that.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.820
But try to not be
a narrow person.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.580
Try and be nice to
the people around you.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.600
Try and read a
lot, go exploring,

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.020
go hiking, embrace trees.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.270
SHILPA: So if there's somebody
out there that's like,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.080
am I interesting?

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.190
Am I not sure?

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.154
Just be who you are and
then take it from there

00:33:49.154 --> 00:33:50.070
to capture the moment.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.900
HAROLD DAVIS: Be who
you are, but more so.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.595
SHILPA: OK, well, that
should be easy enough.

00:33:54.595 --> 00:33:56.600
HAROLD DAVIS: You think?

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.100
SHILPA: And so I did want to
give the chance to the audience

00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.970
to ask a question.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.130
So there's two mics
as well, so feel

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.050
free to jump up
and queue up if you

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.300
have any questions for Harold.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.639
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about ratios

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.760
of photos that you take to
the ones that are actually

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.389
worth showing and that you
would publish somewhere.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:23.469
Is your technique you
would go out and, say, take

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:25.000
1,000 photos in a day?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.434
Or are you looking for
very specific compositions,

00:34:27.434 --> 00:34:29.350
and you know what you
want before you take it,

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.940
so you take a lot fewer?

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.460
And I'm also curious, it would
be very interesting to see

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.043
the ones that were dead on, that
were worth publishing, versus

00:34:36.043 --> 00:34:39.550
the ones near the same subject,
but the composition isn't quite

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.030
right, and an analysis of what
was not quite right about that,

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.659
and how you fixed it
in a subsequent shot.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.550
HAROLD DAVIS: That's
a great question.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.670
The fact of life is
that, like everybody

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.530
who's a professional
photographer,

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.670
I shoot many things I
never want to show anyone.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.250
And you probably would
have to put things

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:04.660
under my fingernails to get
me to show you the bad ones.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.390
But nonetheless,
your point, really,

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.520
is very, very well taken.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.040
And interestingly, I do lead
workshops, and what I find

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.580
is that I tend to photograph
less than the people

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.720
in my workshops.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.720
I am somewhat
targeted in what I do,

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.450
and I do often have
an idea in advance

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.210
of what it's going to
be or why I'm doing it,

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.880
and I wait till I see something
really good to take the photo.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:38.950
But that said, of a given
session where, let's say, just

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:42.370
off the top of my head,
I took 200 RAW files,

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.560
I might have one.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.870
So another way to
look at this is

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:48.850
consider that if you
had a painter who

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.820
did one great painting a week.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.100
That would be 52 great
paintings a year.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.010
That would be 150 great
paintings in three years.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.170
That would beat Picasso cold.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:02.840
So somehow, photographers are
expected to do more than that,

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.720
and it's not realistic.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.710
But it's in my interest
as a professional

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.570
not to show crappy work.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.540
So I try to be
sensible about that.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.930
The other thing is that you
can't judge it immediately

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.070
after taking it.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:21.160
That's not possible because
you're not objective.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.230
I couldn't take a picture
if I didn't think,

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.890
hey, there's something
here, I love it.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.860
So I'm in love with my
photos when I take them.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.810
When I look at them
back on a monitor--

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.520
and part of the trick
to this is to look

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.600
at them both big and small.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.270
You want to see them at
100% on a huge monitor.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.840
You also want to see what
they look like as a thumbnail.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.320
And usually, my reaction is,
what the hell was I thinking?

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.110
And maybe six months later, I
have some kind of realistic--

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:53.650
I can see what I was
thinking, and they're halfway

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.330
good, halfway bad.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:59.320
Fundamentally, by the way,
I don't throw images away.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.390
If something is totally
black, I'll delete it.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:04.240
But otherwise, I long
ago made the decision

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.000
that considering how
cheap storage space is,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.790
it's really more expensive
to take the time to go

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.204
through them well and avoid--

00:37:12.204 --> 00:37:13.870
that I'm going to
throw away some things

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:17.080
I later want if I'm
not very careful.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.080
And to take the time to be very
careful about doing that is

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:26.250
a mistaken priority, basically.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.260
You know, there's no
magic word with this.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.380
The other thing I'd
say is that the process

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.900
of digital photography
itself sometimes

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.470
requires overshooting
because, A, I

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.610
do a lot of bracketed
sequences, and, B,

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.340
since part of what
I do sometimes

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.340
is put disparate things
together from a similar scene,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.960
I want to try to cover all
bases when I'm in a thing.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.350
I'm going, for example, next
month to the world's largest

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.810
cave in Vietnam, which
is quite an expedition

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.940
to get to and so on.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.790
And the real cost
is getting me there.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.640
It's not what I
do once I'm there.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.160
And if I'm there
and taking an image,

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.050
I want to make sure
I get all pieces

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.700
that I might possibly need.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.600
So that leads to a
bit of overshooting.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.240
And obviously, I don't end up
using all those pieces a lot

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.740
of the time.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.280
Does that answer your question?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.363
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.380
AUDIENCE: How has that changed
since you made the switch

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.030
from film to digital?

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.940
Were you overshooting
on film as well?

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.845
HAROLD DAVIS: No, it
was too expensive.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.230
What I do find in
my workshops is

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.730
that some of the
best students are

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.090
people who had a real
background in film photography

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.799
because there was a discipline
to that that, in some ways,

00:38:42.799 --> 00:38:45.340
you just don't have with digital
because it's so easy to just

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.214
keep pressing that button.

00:38:48.214 --> 00:38:49.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.280
I just started taking photos.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.690
Do you have any simple
tricks to take a photo

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:56.310
when you are facing
a light source

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.966
and taking a photo of a person?

00:39:00.737 --> 00:39:02.445
It just shows up as
black when I take it.

00:39:02.445 --> 00:39:04.320
HAROLD DAVIS: Yeah, so
it's going to do that.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.170
Again, what I said
is watch the light.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.330
So that's what's called
a backlit situation.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.920
So you've got two ways you can
deal with that, if you want.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.320
If you are a professional
photographer and someone said,

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.180
I'm handing you your
day rate, you've

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.100
got to make a decent
portrait of this person

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.470
with a backlight,
technique number one

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.920
and probably the best bet is to
use what's called a fill flash

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.420
strobe in the front.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.490
So you take a flash unit.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.790
You attach it via either
a wireless or wire line

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:32.650
to the camera.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:34.280
You hold it up here.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.050
You have some kind
of diffuser in it.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.970
You use the controller
in your camera

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:41.115
to set it to fill mode so it
isn't going to totally blanch

00:39:41.115 --> 00:39:41.740
out everything.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.780
And you use that to light
the face of the subject.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.940
So that's probably
the number-one way

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.690
professionals would do that.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.780
The other possibility,
if you have

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.480
the time and a very
willing subject,

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:57.380
you put the camera on a tripod,
and you do a bracketed exposure

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:57.900
sequence.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.080
So you get one for the
front and one for the back,

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.105
and then you combine the two.

00:40:02.105 --> 00:40:05.087
AUDIENCE: How about to
doing this on a phone?

00:40:05.087 --> 00:40:07.670
HAROLD DAVIS: You can do either
of those two things on a phone

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:12.740
as well, but it takes a
little more gimcrackery.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:16.960
There are a couple of programs,
Leonardo, Image Blender,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.990
are two of them that let you
combine different exposures.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:25.700
You actually can control the
exposure on an iPhone to some

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.270
degree by where you tap
with the native camera app,

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:35.030
but also by using either Red
Dot+ Camera or Camera+ app.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.310
And you can actually
control the exposures,

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:39.360
and then you can
combine and blend them.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:39.550
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.050
Thank you.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:42.950
SHILPA: On average,
piggybacking off

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:46.160
that question, how long do
you take from actually taking

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.920
the photo or even
setting up for the image

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.240
and to the whole post-processing
part of the workflow to when

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.197
you're like, this is
done, this is complete.

00:40:55.197 --> 00:40:57.280
How long does that typically
take you, on average?

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.140
HAROLD DAVIS: Yeah,
it's hard to give you

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.840
a single number on that.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.460
It really depends on the image.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.770
The image I posted
on the top of my blog

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.140
from the Brooklyn
Bridge last night,

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.820
if anyone wants to look at
that, was about an hour.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.280
Some images take months.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.780
Yeah.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.279
SHILPA: OK.

00:41:13.279 --> 00:41:15.290
That's fair.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:18.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:22.940
Any advice you would give about
getting into model photography

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.490
or people photography?

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.860
As a software developer,
it's pretty easy

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.105
to go and shoot landscapes.

00:41:29.105 --> 00:41:33.120
But when photos involve
people you have to direct,

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.180
that is a bit harder.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.690
HAROLD DAVIS: Well,
I'm not sure I

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.410
agree with the premise
of your question,

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.470
but it's a good question.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:48.110
I would say, actually, starting
with models is a good idea

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.360
because there are
some basics about how

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.250
you want to compose
and light people

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.600
that you can learn with a model.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.550
And a professional model is
actually a very good person

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.080
to help guide you
to how to do it,

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.850
and to learn what
works and doesn't work,

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.890
and also how to use
studio lighting,

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.490
if that's how you're doing it.

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.620
And actually,
professional models

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.530
are really not that expensive
for photographers to hire.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:16.820
So it's-- a typical going
rate's about $100 an hour.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.300
You said model and
then portraits,

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.600
and the two are pretty
different things, really.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.190
But I would consider
starting with a model.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:33.020
And I would consider finding a
meetup, or a photography club,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.360
or something like that
that organizes model

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.750
shoots for the first
couple of times

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.730
so that you don't have to
worry about getting the studio

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.830
lights together, and
the studio space,

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.900
and hiring the model,
and everything like that,

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.790
so you can see how it's done.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:50.180
It's not very hard to take
basic pictures of people

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.940
in a studio that are well-lit.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.030
What becomes hard is to take
something that says something

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.920
about the person and so on.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.530
And that comes back to become
a more interesting person

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.540
because, to do that,
you need to have

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.920
a dialogue with the person.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.720
They need to feel
at ease with you.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.630
You need to feel out a way to
get them to reveal themselves.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:14.120
There's a very famous portrait
that the photographer Arnold

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.550
Newman took of the industrialist
Krupp, who, in Germany,

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.970
he employed slave labor during
the period up to the Second

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.320
World War and so on.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.830
And he managed to
get Krupp to pose

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.490
with lighting in
front of his factory

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.260
so that Krupp looks
like he basically

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.420
is a walking skull on top.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.010
It's a very evil portrait.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.690
He conveys the man completely.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.200
And the man was very careful
to try to not put himself

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.160
in that situation.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.410
And the rumor is that
some of Krupp's people

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.870
tried to steal the negative
back from him after they

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:45.950
realized what he'd done.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.960
So the right kind of portrait
can be very revealing,

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.440
but you need to understand
the person that you're

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.930
trying to make the portrait of.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.716
It's not really something
that's easy to do in a flip way.

00:43:57.716 --> 00:43:59.090
The technical side
of it, though,

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.950
as I said at the
beginning of this talk,

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.060
is really not that hard.

00:44:05.462 --> 00:44:08.430
AUDIENCE: Hey, Harold, thanks
for coming to talk to us.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.812
This is the brightest light
I've ever seen in my life,

00:44:09.812 --> 00:44:10.320
by the way, Shilpa.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.019
Just a heads up.

00:44:11.019 --> 00:44:12.310
HAROLD DAVIS: Tell me about it.

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:14.110
AUDIENCE: So I was curious.

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:16.150
For amateurs or
semi-professional photographers

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.858
that are looking to
increase their income

00:44:17.858 --> 00:44:19.420
in a saturated
photography market,

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.990
do you have any suggestions
for the most efficient manner

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.100
of making that happen?

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.195
Besides the whole art and
the hobby form of that,

00:44:27.195 --> 00:44:28.570
there's a lot of
us that might be

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:31.300
interested in paying off some of
the gear that's been purchased.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.820
HAROLD DAVIS: That's a
very interesting question,

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.980
and there are several different
ways I can address it, really.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.190
One thing I would
say as an overview

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:46.990
is that the various things
that have decimated part

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.520
of the business of photography.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.170
For example, the lower end
wedding photography business

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:55.940
is dead, and that's because
cousin Joe takes the photos.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.000
And as someone
notoriously said, we're

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.100
all photographers these days.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.150
But the very same forces
that have done that

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:08.830
have also led to increased
opportunities too.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.840
And that's a very
interesting thing.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.780
I, for example, recently
licensed a whole lot

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.300
of photos for an annual
report to a hedge fund

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.740
based in Singapore.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.340
They found me on
my Flickr stream.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.160
This is something that
you could have only done

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.870
through an agent, if
at all, 20 years ago.

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:32.830
So Google Search
giveth and Google

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.260
Search taketh in this
particular realm.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.490
And the people who know how
to use social media correctly

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.670
probably are the winners here.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.640
What I tell students
who ask that question--

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.920
and they're all full
of marketing schemes--

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.530
the best thing you
can do is to really do

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.440
beautiful photos or great
photos and get them out there.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.990
The cream does tend
to rise to the top.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:46:00.040
And actually, if you put
things on a website, or a blog,

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.830
or a photo-sharing site, if
it's a really good image,

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:04.210
people will notice it.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.110
So that's really
my recommendation.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.987
It doesn't sound terribly
commercial, but it works.

00:46:08.987 --> 00:46:09.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.240
SHILPA: When you're
talking about posting,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.390
is there a platform that's
worked best for you?

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:18.220
Is it Flickr?

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.705
Is it Tumblr?

00:46:20.705 --> 00:46:22.580
Is it Instagram?

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.470
Where do you find
the most success

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:26.620
in drawing in followers?

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.160
HAROLD DAVIS: That's
a great question.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.340
First of all, every
professional photographer

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.220
I know who makes a
living at it has found

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.230
their own unique
path, so whatever I do

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:40.250
is likely to not work
for somebody else.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:43.580
My most important
venue is my own blog.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:48.710
I've been blogging since 2005,
10 to 30 stories a month.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.420
And I do it for myself.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.700
It's my day book.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.160
The way Edward Weston, the
photographer, had a day book.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.880
He kept notes about
his photography.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.590
For a niche blog, I have a
reasonably high readership,

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:06.170
and I get solicited to
place advertisements on it.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:09.320
I long ago decided the only
thing I'm advertising is me.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.610
So it's a commercial-free site.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:15.620
And that really works
quite well for me.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:19.340
It's a WordPress blog, but
one that I maintain myself

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:23.840
with a bulletproof
WordPress host.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.900
So that works well.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.820
Flickr's worked
very well for me.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.510
I'm not a big
Facebook person, but I

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.700
have to maintain a presence
there and on Twitter.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.965
So however they want to
find me, they can find me.

00:47:37.965 --> 00:47:38.840
SHILPA: It was funny.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.850
So I was reading
Harold's blog, and it

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:44.150
says that you are not a fan
of the generation of selfies,

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:47.180
but you still embrace social
media and all the platforms,

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.250
which is great.

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.650
Just because the world
is taking selfies,

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:54.185
and there is a lot of
things that are promoting

00:47:54.185 --> 00:47:56.060
and devices that are
selling because of them.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.040
What are your
opinions about that?

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.200
HAROLD DAVIS: Well, thank you.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.940
I have a little
personal frustration

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.030
in that I'll go
someplace to photograph,

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.650
and I'll get out
my tripod, and I'll

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:13.070
get out the 36-megapixel
camera, and I'll

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.900
put a nice piece of
ZEISS glass on it.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.685
And then somebody is going to
run up with their selfie stick

00:48:17.685 --> 00:48:19.310
and camera and get
right in front of me

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:20.630
and whatever I'm photographing.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:22.220
It's like, oh, please.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.020
But I don't know.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.980
I don't get the urge, really.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.300
It's like, eh.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.200
Maybe I'm not in love with my
own face enough or something.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.240
So I do a lot of traveling.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.950
I'm going to be in
five or six countries

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:43.490
in the next two months,
and a lot of them

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.220
are wonderful places,
and it's fun to go there.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.800
But I think that a lot
of these selfie things

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.980
are about proving that one
has had these experiences

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.980
rather than actually
having the experiences.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.960
And that's, I think, what it
really comes down to for me.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.240
SHILPA: That's an
interesting perspective.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.930
So my last question
to leave us with today

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:05.300
is, where is one
place that you're

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.170
looking to photograph next?

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.840
And what story have
you still not told

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:12.140
that you are wanting to
still share with the world?

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.600
HAROLD DAVIS: Thank you.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.590
Well, I'm going to this
wonderful, huge cave in Vietnam

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:19.290
next month.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.920
It's big enough to
put a skyscraper in.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.440
It's got its own rivers,
ecosystems, plants,

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.010
and cathedral-like entrances.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:31.790
It's about a day's walk in the
jungle to get to the entrance.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:33.750
So that's high on my list.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.860
I'm also going to the mountains
in the north of Vietnam

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.570
on the Chinese
border, where there

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:40.470
are tribal languages spoken.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.012
SHILPA: Oh, wow,
that sounds amazing.

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:44.636
HAROLD DAVIS: But there are many
parts of this beautiful world,

00:49:44.636 --> 00:49:46.010
and I've seen only a few so far.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.860
So there is much
that I want to do.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:55.310
The broader question, just
in as humble a way as I can,

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:58.190
I just want to work to be the
best person, artist, and part

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.070
of our society that I can be.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.160
That's really--

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.260
SHILPA: Thank you so much.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:02.900
Well said.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.010
Very beautifully said.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.150
We have one more last
question from the audience.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.040
So, Joe.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.390
JOE: One more.

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:12.380
So just a question
on your last comment.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.140
You take so many
majestic photos and go

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.180
to so many beautiful
places, which is great.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.540
But I think, maybe for a
beginning photographer,

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.630
it could also be inhibiting
because, well, I'm never

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:25.070
going to go to
that crazy cavern,

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:28.200
so should I even bother
taking a picture?

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.610
What are some examples
of some mundane things

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:36.470
that you've seen that you've
made into great photos?

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.680
HAROLD DAVIS: Well, I
mentioned a couple of them

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.970
just a short while ago.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:44.510
For example, the Brooklyn
Bridge last night and the fire

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.680
hydrant I photographed
on the way up here.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.760
And even that tool bench
with the Russian thing

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.830
that I started my slide off
with, or a nautilus shell.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.890
These are things that are
accessible to everyone.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.590
I think New York is a
great place to photograph,

00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.900
and there are some wonderful
images to be made here.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.210
In fact, looking at New
York and coming back--

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.400
I grew up here
and have been away

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.520
for maybe a quarter of a
century living other places.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.170
Coming back here,
it's amazing what

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.570
transformation is happening
all around and everywhere.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.760
What an incredible
thing to photograph.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.790
I would just also make
one other comment,

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:20.890
and that is that I'm a believer
in a concept called resistance.

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:23.960
That something tries to stop
us from being our creative,

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.340
best selves.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.520
And what you said is one form--

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.910
it's one I feel too--
one form of resistance.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:36.020
One form of resistance for me
is I have to get somewhere.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.240
I have to take one of my kids
to a doctor, whatever it is.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.970
And so I don't stop
to make the photo.

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.470
But what you're
saying, it's already

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.534
been done, why should I bother,
is another form of resistance.

00:51:45.534 --> 00:51:48.200
And generally, whenever you feel
that, the best thing you can do

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.910
is say, screw you, resistance.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:52.030
I'm going to do it.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.190
SHILPA: Well, on
that note, thank

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.340
you so much for being with
us here at Talks at Google.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.617
It's a pleasure having you.

00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:01.200
The books are in the
back of the room.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.700
Everyone, grab a copy of "The
Photographer's Black and White

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.352
Handbook."

00:52:04.352 --> 00:52:06.810
And if you can stick around,
hopefully, you can sign a few.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:07.620
HAROLD DAVIS: Be
my great pleasure.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.360
SHILPA: Thank you so much.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.230
Thank you, guys.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.280
[APPLAUSE]
