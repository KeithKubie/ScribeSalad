MALE SPEAKER: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome to another Talks
at Google event.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.910
So thank you all for
joining us today.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
Today, we're very pleased to
host paleoanthropologist and

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.140
National Geographic adventurer
Lee Berger.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.970
Dr. Berger leads the
paleoanthropology research

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.640
group at the University
of Witwatersrand

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.970
down in South Africa.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.450
And among his many discoveries
include the

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.570
Australopithecus sediba.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.110
Again, I guess clearly, Latin
was not my strong suit.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.250
Were it written in French, it
would have been better.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.910
And also his work on the Taung
Bird of Prey hypothesis.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.770
Dr. Berger, he's taking a break
from his research in

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.620
South Africa to tour on his
latest book, which is actually

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.570
entitled "The Skull on the
Rock." It is a book intended

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.580
for wide audience that
chronicles his discovery of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.470
the recent human ancestor
skeletons and also his

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.060
integration with Google
Earth, of all things.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.050
He uses our tools to advance the
field and also to advance

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.810
our knowledge of
human history.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.148
So please join me in welcoming
Lee to Google.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.076
LEE BERGER: Thank you.

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:07.468
Thank you very much.

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:09.330
Thank you.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.150
I just have to say that, on
behalf of pretty much the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.250
entirety of the scientific
community, we probably owe

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.680
more to your organization as an
open access and open window

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.170
into new areas of science
than almost any

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.565
other on the internet.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:28.840
That includes the normal things
you think of, like

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.350
Google Earth and Google Scholar,
that we depend on now

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.730
almost completely, as scientists
but also just

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.330
[? google-ine, ?]

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.560
which is a lot of fun.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.520
This sort of story that I'm
going to tell you has a lot of

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.640
those components in it.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730
I'm going to tell you
a story about a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.170
discovery in human origins.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.930
I'm a paleoanthropologist.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.200
I look for early human
ancestors.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280
I actually look for the
rarest sought-after

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.330
objects on the planet.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.830
I'm in a field of science that
actually probably has more

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.860
scientists in it than it does
objects that we study.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.380
There are literally just a few
thousand of these incredibly

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.950
precious objects.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.509
Most of them are just fragments,
tiny little bits

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.970
and pieces.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.180
About 80% of the record of
human origins in Africa

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.150
represents isolated teeth.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.980
The remaining, say, 18% of that
represents little bits

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.580
and pieces of post-cranial
bones, of which we almost had

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.560
no complete elements
from the neck down.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.620
Those skulls and stuff you see
on "National Geographic" and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.640
such, those are incredibly
rare,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.640
numbering just a few dozen.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.270
But this story is a story of
some success in discovery.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.830
And while parts of it may seem
like a eureka moment and a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.060
sort of what wondrous luck, like
many great discoveries

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.040
that happen, it begins
in failure.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.300
In the late 1990s, I was
privileged enough to win the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.850
first National Geographic
Prize for Research and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.990
Exploration.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.970
When I went to receive that
medal in Washington, I was

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.660
hauled up into those magnificent
offices up on the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.040
top floor of National
Geographic, sat across from

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.640
Gilbert Grosvenor, the then
CEO, and Bill Allen, the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.490
powerful editor of
the magazine.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.770
And they said something that I
hope all of you hear some time

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.370
in your life.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.510
They said to me, you can have
anything you want, any amount

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.400
of money you want, to do
anything you want.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.540
Now, they of course
meant that within

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.230
some reason, I presumed.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.460
But I knew exactly what
I wanted to do.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.770
I wanted to apply technology
to the search for these

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.740
incredibly rare fossils and the
sites that they come from.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.810
And the reason I wanted to do
that so badly around 1997 was

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.570
a series of technological events
that occurred at that

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.040
time that made it
more accessible.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.030
One was the readily available
handheld GPS.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.600
Now, things like the highly
expensive Trimble GPS had on

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.050
the box that it could get you
to within the remarkable

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.180
distance of something like 15
meters on planet Earth.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.650
And it cost thousands
and thousands of

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.790
dollars to do that.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.610
The other thing that happened at
that time was that NASA had

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.520
released its digital
satellite images.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.310
And I could afford down to the
30 meter pixels that they had.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.910
And I think most of you would
remember back in those times,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.410
that those sheets cost in the
neighborhood of $10,000 apiece

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.220
for one sheet.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.970
And we had to get new computers
at my university to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.550
even run them.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.055
I think they were something
impossible like 300 or 400

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:29.170
megabytes a file that we had
to run at that time.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.150
But there I received this grant
to go do this expedition

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.970
utilizing this technology.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.040
And I set off across
southern Africa.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.100
But also, concentrated some of
my work in an area right

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.210
outside of Johannesburg, South
Africa, that's now called the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.890
Cradle of Humankind, a UNESCO
World Heritage site.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.600
It wasn't then.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.780
It was a dolomitic limestone
area that stretched for about

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.380
60 kilometers in length
and about 10 in width.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.370
And from that area, which is
arguably the most explored

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.290
area on planet Earth for these
early hominid fossils,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.650
continuously since 1935, had
come some of the most

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.080
fantastic fossils, but from
a tiny number of sites.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.410
By that time, there'd only been
about 14 fossil-bearing

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.290
sites for these early
human fossils.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.910
But only about four of them were
considered really of any

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.290
serious value.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.350
So it was in that environment
of looking for these things

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.360
that I began to utilize
this technology--

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.280
not only do the first GPS
coordinates of sites, because

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.010
we didn't have them.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.060
They were all map coordinates
prior to that.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.720
But also to find new sites.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.320
And over a three-year period,
I did find new

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.330
sites in the area.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.170
I managed to find four new
fossil sites in that area.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.900
I know that doesn't sound like
a huge number, but remember

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.530
the context of only knowing
of 14 fossil sites.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.260
And remember that it was the
most explored area on planet

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.350
Earth for these very things.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.010
I found an additional 30 caves
that were undocumented.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.440
We had about 30 non-fossil
bearing case

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.780
documented in that area.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.340
And I thought this
was pretty good.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.655
And so as we moved into the
late '90s and early 21st

00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:10.810
century, I began digging some
of these new sites, with the

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.760
hopes of them producing
some of these

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.390
extraordinarily rare fossils.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.130
Now, let me tell you just
how important even

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.080
single finds are.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.130
When I first went to Africa,
in 1991, I found two fossil

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.080
hominid teeth, two single
teeth, at a site called

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.500
Gladysvale, right in the
middle of this area.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.140
And it made "National
Geographic" magazine.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.730
Can you imagine?

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.970
It was the first new
site in 48 years.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.050
And that's the kind of a rarity
that people like me

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.990
deal with in their day-to
day search.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.720
So as I began to explore these
sites, I did find a few bits

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.270
and pieces, which made
me pretty happy.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.540
But I did not find anything
extraordinary by the time we

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.490
moved into the early
21st century.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.020
Now having said that, I have
to qualify that most of the

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.230
people that do what I do will
never find what we seek.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.840
Can you imagine going into a
field of science where there's

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.370
probably a 99.9% chance that
you will never discover a

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.990
single element of one of these
early hominids in the wild?

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.610
You literally can count the
scientists who've actually

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.010
physically discovered these in
Africa on two hands and have

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.220
some fingers left over
when you do that.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.220
So I did this digging.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.780
But I work at a university.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.520
And for anyone who's ever worked
in the academic or

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.970
university environment,
universities live off things

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.290
like "Nature" and "Science"
papers,

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.370
these high-impact papers.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.070
And finding little bits
and scraps wasn't

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.710
getting us into those.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.010
And as we reached about 2005,
2006, my university made the

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.175
decision to begin moving away
from my exploration unit that

00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:50.090
I had established to search for
these sites and move into

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.240
an area of science driven
solely by technology, to

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.090
replace that.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.100
I was going to be effectively
retrenched.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.910
They couldn't, of course.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.010
I was a tenured professor
by the time.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.120
But they were moving in
this new direction.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.470
Because a lot of critical things
that I don't have to

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.200
explain to this audience were
happening at that period.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.140
Processing power was becoming

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.570
enormous and readily available.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.050
Computers--

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.740
things like geometric,
morphometric, the ability to

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.100
handle these big data sets
that were produced by CT

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.320
scans, three-dimensional
exercises,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.670
were coming into vogue.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.200
That's what was getting on
the cover of "Nature" and

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.930
"Science." And that's where my
university started moving.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.620
They started searching
for a director.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.190
And eventually in 2007, they
actually found someone to

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.150
effectively replace me, a young
man who had been my

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.870
former student.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.730
I think some of you in
technology will sympathize a

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.430
little bit with that
sort of transition

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.070
that occurs very quickly.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.550
But it was an exciting period.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.690
We bought equipment.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.190
We bought tons of these
new computers,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.850
very expensive software.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.860
And we even started bringing
in a whole host of young

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.580
people to start building a lab
that no longer really focused

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.830
its full energy on finding new
fossils, but studying those

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.665
that had been discovered over
the past 70 or 80 years.

00:09:05.665 --> 00:09:08.310
It was going to be a
retrospective thing as we

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.550
moved into this new world.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:16.310
And there I found myself, in
December period of 2007,

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.570
surfing the web, looking
for a new life.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.280
I was kind of looking for where
I would find myself in

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.590
the future, with all of the kind
of things I've explained.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.980
And it was at that moment that
I became the last human being

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.600
on Earth to discover
Google Earth.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.170
Now, as most of you did, what
did everyone do when they

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.610
first discovered Google Earth,
a long time before I did?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.220
AUDIENCE: Look at your house.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.690
LEE BERGER: You look at your
own house, to see if you're

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.740
lying naked by the
swimming pool.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.540
I wasn't.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.420
Then you look at places that
are familiar to you.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.480
And sometime in that journey,
you find that amazing white

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.560
box there on the left-hand
side that has those GPS

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.430
coordinates that you
can stick in.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.190
And if you've got some,
you stick them in.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.510
And you fly out of outer space,
right to this singular

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.550
fantastic point.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.320
Well, I had some of the most
expensively obtained GPS

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.890
coordinates on the planet.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.170
And I eagerly put the
first ones in.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.960
And it zoomed in from outer
space in that great zoom in--

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.490
and landed on nothing.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.380
The second one, nothing.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.750
The third one, nothing.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.250
I had useless GPS coordinates.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.800
It did not take me long
to google why they

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.840
were useless, of course.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.380
The United States government had
owned those satellites in

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.700
the late 1990s.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.640
They'd put deliberate
error into them.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.800
And that, combined with the
error in my relatively

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.510
primitive handheld GPSes,
created a form of a

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.250
compounding error.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.350
And all of my data points were
off by dozens, if not

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.880
hundreds, of meters.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.050
They were useless.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.020
I'd spent three years of my
life and several thousand

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.190
dollars of National Geographic's
money.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.380
And I was sad for a while.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.500
I was probably most sad about
having to call up National

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.250
Geographic and explain this.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.720
And so I spent January,
February, and March moving the

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.210
points from their incorrect
position to

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.490
their correct position.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.890
Because I could actually
see the sites that

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.490
I intended to do.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.330
Amazingly, the area where I'd
concentrated my research had

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.270
5-meter resolution on
Google at that time.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.830
And I could see the sites.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.000
I knew the area very well.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.970
And I can actually see
the physical sites.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.880
And it was in the process of
moving those dots from the

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.800
wrong place to the right place
that I began to discover

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.010
something amazing.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.340
I first started thinking I saw
patterns in the distribution

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.030
of these various caves and
various fossil sites.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.090
It seemed that the fossil
sites seemed to cluster

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.060
together in unusual ways.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.200
And I also learned through
correcting that error what a

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.370
cave site and then what a fossil
site looked like from

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.490
outer space.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.440
And I begin to think that,
if that's a cave, this

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.020
looks like a cave.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.540
But I knew it couldn't be.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.580
I had walked over that
area over the last 17

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.120
years prior to that.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.770
Everybody, every big name
in paleoanthropology has

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.790
explored this area.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.830
I knew there was nothing
to find.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.180
But by March of that year, it
bothered me enough that I

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.490
created a list of targets.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.230
And I did something
very human.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.670
I went as far away within this
region as I could get from the

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.470
site of Gladysvale, where I'd
spent the last 17 years

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.760
looking for these things.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.130
Because I knew there
was nothing there.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.760
I knew that area as well
as my own backyard.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.780
And so I moved away from there,
actually into a little

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.030
town called Krugersdorp,
actually the city limits, with

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.420
this list of first targets.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.610
And on my first day out in
March, I found 21 new sites.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.860
21 sites that no scientist
had ever seen before.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.940
By July of that year, I'd found
600 new sites, that no

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.970
scientist had put a pin on,
40 new fossil sites.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.980
So we went from effectively,
say, 17 or 18 fossil sites

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.400
that we knew of to well over 70
of them, in just a matter

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.960
of moments.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.370
It was an incredible,

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.330
incredible period for discovery.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.420
Everyone was very excited.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.120
Because suddenly, we had these
resources in front of us, this

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.920
long potential, that could last

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.625
decades, hundreds of years.

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:19.870
And I truly thought that
that was going to be my

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.480
contribution to this field,
this discovery of

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.420
this mass of resources.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.590
When by the end of July, I
moved back into the area

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.580
around Gladysvale.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.570
And of course, immediately
I began finding

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.650
sites, all in the area.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.420
I had missed them.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.630
They'd been right in
front of my eyes.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.430
And the 1st of August, I moved
into the area that you're

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.750
about to see, as this camera
zooms up, an area that I knew

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.560
I wasn't going to find anything
in, even by that age.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.780
Because down in this valley,
back in the late 1990s when I

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.540
was doing that National
Geographic expedition, I had

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.190
found one of those four
fossil sites.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.400
It was 1 kilometer away from
Gladysvale, one and a half

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.020
hills away from where I had
spent the last 17 years.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.710
And I had been on this road that
runs in here literally

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.390
hundreds of times over
the last 17 years.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.150
However, I saw these targets,
which you see being

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.610
highlighted right now.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.930
And by that time, I suspected
that that was what caves and

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.080
potential fossil-bearing
caves looked like.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.530
So I drove down this road
with my dog Tao.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.960
And as I got to right here, I
realized that I was going to

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.370
make a discovery of at least
some cave sites.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.640
Because there was an old
lime-miners' trackway, that

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.140
somehow all of us had missed,
running right up to this

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.720
particular little
grove of trees.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.845
I heard you all gasp
when you saw that.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:47.300
I know.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.880
But the reason I gasped when I
saw that is it shouldn't have

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.730
been there.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.230
Any time you see a grove of
trees like this, what you're

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.500
actually seeing is a disturbed
area of soil.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.200
It means that this dolomitic
terrain, which is

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.360
2.6-billion-year-old limestone,
is very tough for

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.390
trees to grow in.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.120
When you see clusters like
this, particularly of two

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.030
types of trees, white stinkwood
and wild olives--

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.590
it's the light one and the dark
one there-- you know that

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.740
there's disturbed or collapsed
systems underneath.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.020
I walked into that, and I
saw this shocking thing.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.110
No, you don't have to gasp all
at once when you see that.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.590
What that was was a tiny little
hole in the middle of

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.565
that grove of trees.

00:15:29.565 --> 00:15:32.760
That hole is about 2 by
2 and 1/2 meters.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.600
It was very unusual.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.780
It was a hole dug by
the lime miners.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.760
They'd found it.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.670
They know there was a collapsed
cave there.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.960
They put in three drill holes
and three dynamite blasts.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.640
They'd blown up some rock in a
typical way, in their search

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.400
for lime in these caves.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.590
But they'd done something then
I had not seen before.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.560
They left it alone.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.320
And I'd almost never
seen that.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.420
I turned the first rock
over that I came to.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.840
And there was an antelope
humerus, an arm bone, sticking

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.700
in this concrete-like
rock infill.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.500
I was stunned.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.510
I was less than a kilometer
from where I'd

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.060
spent the last 17 years.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.430
I was less than 200 meters
from where I'd found

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.720
a site in the 1990s.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.380
So I had been there.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.220
And I could tell no other
scientist had been there,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.690
because we leave tells.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.020
We pile little rocks together.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.140
We sort the things when
we find them.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.000
But I was on a mapping
expedition.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.765
So I looked around.

00:16:24.765 --> 00:16:26.190
I saw there were
other fossils.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.430
And I took that terrible
picture.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.470
I took an accurate GPS
coordinate, some notes, and

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.780
walked up the hill and
found 46 new caves.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.020
46 caves in this little hidden
valley that no scientist had

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.470
seen before, in the center of
the most explored area on

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.310
planet Earth for those
very objects.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.600
I was stunned.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.940
I went back to the lab.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.060
And we'd had a tragedy just a
couple of weeks before this.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.800
The young man who was going to
come and take over my position

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.780
and change this whole
organization into this

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.300
high-tech organization was
killed in a motorcycle

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.990
accident in London.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.579
And we were devastated because
we were rudderless.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:08.710
We'd already hired people.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.569
We'd spent enormous amounts
reequipping

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.089
to go in this direction.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.599
And a young man came into
my office, a young

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.810
Kenyan named Job Kibii.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.369
And he said, would I take over
his postdoctoral supervision?

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.180
Charlie was going to be his
postdoctoral supervisor.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.380
And I said, no, Job, I won't.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.890
You're a lab guy.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.550
I'm a field guy.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.500
I can't teach you that.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.500
But I've just found this site.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.050
And if you want to learn to be
a field guy, let's go out.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.600
Let's take a look at this site
and see what it has to offer.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.860
And so we went back out there.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.370
On the 15th of August, Job,
myself, my then nine-year-old

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.650
son Matthew, and my dog Tao
went back to that site,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.150
walked up to it.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.960
And as we walked up, I told them
how I'd discovered it, in

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.150
much the way I've
just told you.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.440
We got to the edge
of this pit.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.400
We were looking down into it.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.240
And I said, OK, guys,
go find fossils.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.040
If you find any fossils,
give me a call.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.410
I'll come and identify them.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.540
And let's see what
the site has.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.790
And with that, Matthew
and Tao are gone.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.120
This is a huge game reserve.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.540
There's leopards and giraffe
and zebra and

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.390
antelopes and stuff.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.420
And I think he's off
to chase some--

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.380
I'll see him at lunch time.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.340
So I turned to Job.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.660
And I said, I bet the lime
miners left this alone,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.320
because they did the
same thing I did.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.400
They found this site first,
in the bottom of the hill.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.220
They start digging it.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.700
So the foreman walks up the hill
or something and sees all

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.970
these other caves.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:28.820
He comes back.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.580
They blast.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.030
Nothing really looks good.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.660
They take up, and they had
destroyed every single one of

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.720
those other caves, just
destroyed them.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.280
And as I finish saying
that, Matthew said,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.400
Dad, I found a fossil.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.600
Matthew was 15 meters off
the site, in high grass.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.960
And I almost didn't
go and look.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.940
I almost didn't go and look
because I knew absolutely what

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.500
Matthew had found.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.650
Matthew had found an
antelope fossil.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:19:00.350
Because for every one of these
early human ancestors that we

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:08.590
find, every one piece, we find
250,000 antelope fossils.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.940
But he's my nine-year-old son.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.790
And like you, you all want to
encourage fossil hunting.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.140
So I wandered over to him.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.750
I got about 5 meters away,
and I saw this.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.020
And I knew that his
and my life were

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.180
going to change forever.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.400
Because he was holding
that little block.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.100
This was taken moments after
that, in that high grass.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.840
You can see there was nothing
else around it.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.480
He was sitting at the base of
a lightning-struck tree.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.505
But what I saw sticking out of
the side of that rock from 5

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:36.290
meters away was this.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.930
Now I got you to gasp.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.150
No one gasped.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.510
I knew exactly what that was.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.320
That was an early
human clavicle.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.580
That's this bone right here.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.400
It's your collarbone
right here.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.630
And I knew instantly.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.990
They're really easy
to identify.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.670
Firstly, only a few mammals
have them in Africa.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.920
Bats have them because
they fly.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.830
It was too big.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.570
Moles have them, because
they dig.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.040
It was too big.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.130
And primates have them.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:08.610
And only amongst primates do
you ever see this very

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.870
characteristic S-shape,
a sigmoid curvature.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.790
And at that particular moment in
time, I happened to be the

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.290
only world's expert on
hominid clavicles.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.780
I'd done my PhD on them.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.850
I did my PhD on them because
they were so rare that there

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.900
were only bits and pieces
of fragments left.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.760
I in fact did my PhD on the
clavicle, the proximal

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.150
humerus, and the scapula.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.280
Because no one else wanted to,
because we didn't have any in

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.580
the fossil record.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.290
And I was looking at one.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.500
Matthew says I cursed.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.900
I don't believe that.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.290
But I took the rock and did
what any of you would do.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.680
What else could this be?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.480
And I turned it over and
sticking out of the

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.170
back of it was this.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.750
And that was completely
unmistakable.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.010
That is the lower jaw and
a canine, maybe the most

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.080
identifiable tooth, in a jaw
of a hominid, sticking out.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.420
And I could see other bones.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.180
And then I was very excited.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.900
I might have actually
cursed then.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.120
Because I knew that I had the
real possibility of holding in

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.520
my hand what Matthew had found,
a partial skeleton.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.370
And at that point, there had
been approximately seven found

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.180
in all of history from
anywhere, in Africa.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.530
You would know some
of their names--

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.370
Lucy, the Turkana Boy, Little
Foot, the Dikika

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.800
child, Lucy's child.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.190
And then the remaining two
are so fragmentary,

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.450
they only have numbers.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:35.160
That is any piece of a head,
associated with any piece of a

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.410
body, of a single individual.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.580
We're very generous with the

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.010
definition of partial skeletons.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.520
And I was probably
holding one.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.180
I called the South African
Heritage Resource Agency,

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.790
because there's actually cell
phone coverage at the site, to

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.670
get permission to take it out.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.680
We got it back to the lab,
this concrete-like rock.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.320
My preparator started
preparing it.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.360
Within days, we realized Matthew
had found a skeleton.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.590
And we knew a lot about
it almost instantly.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.540
We could see that it
had this jaw in it.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.990
And it was a child, probably
about 11 to

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.010
12, 13 years of age.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.430
Its third molar wasn't
erupted.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.690
Its limbs had not finished
growing.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.180
We could see the growth lines,
the unfused epiphyses.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.790
It was hugely exciting.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.620
It was the upper part
of a child.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.250
It was a magnificent moment.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.420
There was much rejoicing
at the Institute.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.110
You can literally build
institutes around a discovery

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.650
like this, and ours.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.860
So I had to wait until I had
heard that I was going to

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.650
actually get the permit
to work the site.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.400
On September 3, I got the call
that I would get the permit.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.640
On September 4, we all went back
to that site, everybody

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.870
from my university that had
a PhD or master's in

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.725
paleoanthropology, biological
anthropology, archaeology, or

00:22:48.725 --> 00:22:52.050
who liked dogs, went
back to the site.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.260
Because as I told you, we
don't find these things.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.840
We spend our lives not
discovering them.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.700
And I think everybody there--

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.310
14 of us went--

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.280
had the idea that if a
nine-year-old can do it in a

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.130
minute and a half, this
is our moment.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:16.170
Three hours after arriving
there, we had found nothing

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.330
that we could definitively
call a hominid.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.020
In and out of that hole-- you
can see how tiny it was--

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.250
we couldn't find anything
that seemed to

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.690
associate with this block.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.810
We couldn't put it
back in place.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.330
We couldn't find anything that
we could definitively say

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:30.910
wasn't an antelope
or something.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.460
And we were devastated.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.770
Now, in South Africa, I come
from a sort of British

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.790
culture, an English
culture there.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.130
So when times are really
bad in that culture,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.170
we break for tea.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.670
And so we did break for tea.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.810
We went, sat under the tree.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.010
And I walked back over
to this pit.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.930
And I stood there, staring
down into that hole.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.720
And I was trying to reconstruct
that moment, maybe

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.190
100, 110 years ago.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.900
A blast must have
just gone off.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.660
The rocks are scattered
out here.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.410
And how could a rock get from in
here to over there, back in

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.470
the high grass where Matthew
had found it?

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:09.450
And I began to have that
hideously ugly feeling that

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.650
maybe this didn't
come from here.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.750
What if that rock had just
fallen off of an old ox wagon

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.080
or something, coming from one
of those other 46 caves that

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.270
had been destroyed?

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.910
And I was devastated.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.590
And as I was staring at that,
visualizing that moment, the

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.240
sun came up so it shined just
along the back of that.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.820
And there, sticking out of the
wall, the wall that we had all

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.830
been next to dozens of times,
was a proximal humerus of an

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.750
early human, sticking
right out the wall.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.140
Remember, I did my
PhD on them.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.560
I know what they look like.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.460
I didn't say anything.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.070
No, I climbed down
into the hole.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.640
I walked towards it.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.730
I got about a meter and
a half away from it.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.530
And I realized that the scapula,
the shoulder blade,

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.220
was sitting in articulation.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.150
I still didn't say anything.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.410
I put my hand on the wall.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.560
And two hominid teeth
were lying loose and

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.140
fell out into my hand.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.380
Then I said something.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.320
And everyone rushed
down in there.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.430
We were hugely excited.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.950
We suddenly realized that our
paradigm had been wrong.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.760
Because lying all around us were
blocks like this, with

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.140
actually the proximal femur.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.080
We had been anticipating
failure, when in fact, we were

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.610
sitting on a treasure trove.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.850
Well, that has changed
everything.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:25.800
From that extraordinary
experience, I didn't realize

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.850
that what I was looking at
was not the skeleton

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.260
that Matthew had found.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.000
It was a second skeleton.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.710
Because never before in all of
history had two skeletons been

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.870
found in the same place.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.440
The one I found, we knew
immediately, after we took it

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.780
back to the lab and begin to
prepare it out, was actually

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.090
an adult skeleton.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.870
It had a fused epiphyses.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:58.140
So I could see that it was
an older individual.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.250
It would turn out to later be
a female, an adult female.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.740
We would later find Matthew's
skeleton lying just 50

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.160
centimeters above
that position.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.320
And so this little site, in
the past several years--

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.350
that I would eventually call
Malapa, which means my home in

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.540
the Sotho language--

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.320
has produced extraordinary
results.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.430
And also, we've been very
fortunate because we've

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.680
discovered at a time where
we've been able to apply

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.720
extraordinary technology
to it.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.030
This looks like a
video to you.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.110
It's not a video.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:30.310
It's actually 21 million
three-dimensional coordinates,

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.660
each accurate to about a
millimeter and a half on

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.500
planet Earth, that we can
actually take and place every

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.580
find back into context.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.070
If we'd found it six years
ago, we could not have

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.060
achieved that sort of technology
application.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.030
In April of 2010, my team and
I announced that these

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:53.260
skeletons were actually a new
species of early human.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.870
We did it in a special
edition of "Science."

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.780
And of course, my colleagues
all forced me

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.620
to show this image.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.600
Because for scientists, getting
your fossil on the

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.460
cover of "Science" is like for a
rock star being on the cover

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.906
of "Rolling Stone." So they
forced me to put this up here.

00:27:07.906 --> 00:27:10.350
But the preservation
is extraordinary.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.950
At that time, we had
these skeletons.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.580
We named a new species, called
Australopithecus sediba.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.690
Australopithecus is
the genus name.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.940
We had to accept an already
existing one that we felt it

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.370
associated with.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.910
"Sediba" means source or well
spring or natural spring.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.415
And you'll hear why we named
that in just a moment.

00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:32.820
As incomplete as those look at
that time, they were both

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.920
independently the most complete
early hominids that

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.230
had ever been discovered in
the history of science.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.550
Both more complete than the
famous Lucy fossil.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.070
The site would yield
preservation that we could not

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.550
even imagine just
a few years ago.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.860
I hope you can see the quality
of the musculature, the

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.690
preservation of that bone, that
we would then know was

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:59.360
1.977 to 1.98 million
years old.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.240
So you're looking at a
2-million-year-old fossil.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.450
That is the most complete early
hominid skull that has

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.910
almost certainly ever
been found.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.970
There is amazing preservation
that goes

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.650
beyond the bone there.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.160
We have found organic
preservation there.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.540
Some of you might have seen, we
announced the discovery of

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.520
calculus and tartar on the teeth
just a few months ago,

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.550
in the journal "Nature." And
inside of that were food

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.670
particulates.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.930
So never again will a scientist
like me guess at

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:26.850
what they ate.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.750
We know that they ate fruits and
nuts and seeds, like you

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.180
would expect.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.410
They also ate bark,
interestingly.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.950
That isn't that uncommon.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.830
That's the kind of thing
that actually happens.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.040
But it's that level of
preservation that's

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.010
extraordinary.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.310
We may have even found skin.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.750
We may have even found
early hominid skin.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.470
Watch this space early
next year.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.630
Last year, we published more of
this material in "Science,"

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.860
in another special edition,
more of the

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.010
extraordinary fossils.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:59.990
And these skeletons became
then works in progress.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.580
The female on the left, you
can see is remarkably

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.490
complete, with critical bones
that we had never before seen

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.410
in the fossil record.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.550
He looks pretty incomplete,
only at about 40%.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.920
My wife, who is a medical
doctor, a radiologist in fact,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.290
is just finishing her PhD in
paleoanthropology now.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.210
I guess so she had something
to talk about

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.460
over the dinner table.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.350
But she did it on scanning
the blocks in rocks.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:27.350
And in doing that, the very last
block that she scanned a

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.630
few months ago had
the remainder of

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.070
his skeleton in it.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.540
So we now know that he will be
almost completely complete,

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.570
something unprecedented at
that time depth, really

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.850
unprecedented out of the last
few thousand years.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.770
They don't look anything
like they should.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.470
Sediba is bizarre.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.470
It could be because they are so
complete that we had been

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.470
misreading the rest
of the record.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.450
That is, we'd been
underestimating things like

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.060
limb length and the
shape of them.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.710
Or it may be that we have found
truly one of the most

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:02.090
mosaic, transitional fossils,
and unexpected species that

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.710
ever existed in that critical
time period.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.350
Because at that moment, it's
when we transitioned from

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.570
these early australopithecines
like Lucy to our genus, Homo.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.590
They have incredibly
long arms.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.240
Here, you can see the arm
of a chimpanzee on

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.635
the left-hand side.

00:30:18.635 --> 00:30:19.760
In the middle is sediba.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.130
That is a pygmy.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.150
And they're all scaled
to the same size.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.900
You can see sediba has
long, ape-like arms.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.210
The moment we had that
discovered, we knew exactly

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.520
what the hand would be.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.060
Because that is the
arm of a climber.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.220
And we knew that the hand would
be long, with curved

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.800
phalanges for climbing, because
that's what other

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.380
australopithecines look like.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.120
That's what apes look like.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.210
Except the hand was sitting at
the end of that arm, and it

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:47.760
didn't look anything
like that.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.850
That's the most human-like
hand that has ever been

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:55.040
discovered out of Homo sapiens
and Neanderthals.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.540
We don't have any Homo erectus
hands, so we don't know what

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.370
they look like.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.260
But it is not an
australopithecine hand.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.590
In fact, that hand at 2 million
years is more advanced

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:08.310
than the hand of Homo habilis,
which was the first early

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:13.020
member of new species put into
that genus, but is almost

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.620
300,000 to 400,000 years
younger than this.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.820
That's an extraordinary thing.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.460
How can you have a derived,
advanced hand, sitting on this

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.780
end of this ape-like arm?

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.440
The answer is, we don't know.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.820
But if you ever wonder--

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.135
you know, people go, well, how
can you tell from just a bit

00:31:29.135 --> 00:31:32.180
or a piece, that it really
is a biped or it's

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.480
a human-like ancestor?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.420
Here's a good example.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.100
This is sediba's upper limb.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.530
You're going to see this part
published very shortly.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.970
But you can see how
long it is.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.880
This is a chimpanzee.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.870
But you can see how the scapula
is shaped broad and

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.540
wide at the base, in order to
accommodate bipedalism.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.100
And what is most striking is
the difference between the

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.820
hand morphology here, with the
short, long-thumbed hand of a

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.230
human, and the long, curved
hand of an ape.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.110
The pelvis and other
parts of the

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.310
anatomy are equally bizarre.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.610
This is Lucy's pelvis
in the middle.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.830
That's what it should have
looked like, because the

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.880
cranial capacity of sediba is
only 420 cubic centimeters.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.610
That's the size of a grapefruit,
if you imagine.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.850
It's amongst the smallest of
any australopithecine.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.600
And we had thought that the
reason australopithecines had

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.020
these wide, stable pelvises
was because they could.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.540
Humans have a tall, broad
pelvis, in order to have a

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.120
sort of destabilized
bipedalism.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.100
It actually seems
disadvantageous.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.600
We developed an entire thing.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.400
Read a textbook.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.890
It's called the obstetric
hypothesis.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:45.370
The idea that the reason the
human pelvis is inefficient

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.580
like that is because we
needed to give birth

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.360
to big-brained babies.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.430
Sediba single-handedly proves
that's not true.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.860
Every textbook's going to
have to be rewritten.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.360
Because it has a human-like
pelvis, but this incredibly,

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.100
incredibly tiny brain.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.290
We can even tell things like
the female had had a child.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.940
She has indications of having
the stress marks, having the

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.890
child and that.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.310
And other amazing things, like
they have sex differences in

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.200
the pelvis.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.750
We know a lot about the site.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.870
We know the site existed about
30 to 50 meters underground 2

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.140
million years ago.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.910
It was some sort of submerged
sediment trap, in a pool of

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:28.530
water supersaturated with
calcium carbonate.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.620
And that these hominids
were falling in there.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.860
They actually have evidence that
they'd broken their arms.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.400
He's broken both of
his arms at the

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.990
surgical neck of the humerus.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.260
She seems to have dislocated
her right arm as she fell,

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.650
possibly sticking it out.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.080
And they are there with
many other animals.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.570
They're there with antelopes.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.940
They're there with saber-toothed
cats.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.020
They're there with hyenas,
down to little

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.190
mice, insects, birds.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:53.950
None of them have
been scavenged.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.680
So whatever the situation that
they found themselves in was

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.430
so protective that it prevented
scavengers from

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.220
getting to them.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.370
They were buried very quickly
and cemented, like Jimmy Hoffa

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.130
being poured into concrete.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.620
And that's why we have this

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.590
extraordinary, remarkable situation.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.739
Every animal we find is the most
complete that has ever

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.340
been discovered in the history
of Plio-Pleistocene

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.110
paleontology on the continent
of Africa.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.170
We're able to do, because of
their completeness, fairly

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.159
remarkable reconstructions.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.590
This is Karabo in the middle.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.620
This is Lucy here.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.400
And this is Turkana Boy, a
Homo erectus that's about

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.840
400,000 years younger.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.960
You can see the lengthening
of the legs, but still the

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.600
maintenance of an abnormally
long arm, but not an increase

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:40.929
in the head.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:46.270
This is a remarkably complex
transition that we as a field

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.280
of science did not expect.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.880
And we don't know what
to do with it.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.659
As I said, it sits at a critical
time period, right at

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.570
the transition between this
group of australopithecines

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:58.210
and whatever comes next.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:02.690
We don't know whether this is
that transition or not because

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.170
it's so unexpected.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.590
We probably will find
out eventually.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.370
Because the skeletons I'm
showing you are not alone.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.090
They are there with many
other individuals.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.560
We have found at least four
other skeletons in a company.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.100
At least two infants, an adult,
and at least another

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.280
juvenile, at least we haven't
excavated yet.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.520
We are going to see from this
site potentially the most

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.020
extraordinary look at a
population of early humans

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.200
that anyone has ever seen.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.220
We've also been able to apply
really cool technology to it.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.720
You may have noticed that
the rock was still left

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.860
underneath the skull.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.860
That's my team's gift to future
scientists, 100 years,

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.260
1,000 years, 10,000
years from now.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.330
That's the record of
where we found them

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.670
as technology improved.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.420
And the reason I can afford to
leave that time capsule for

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.720
future generations of scientists
is that I can make

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.760
the rock disappear now.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.530
I can then take a skull out.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.320
I can take the various pieces
that we find in the rock.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.810
I can put them back together.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.960
And then I can, of course,
make it invisible.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.080
And yes, what you're
seeing there is in

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.810
fact a fossil brain.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:17.070
You may wonder, how can you
have a 2-million-year-old

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:17.810
fossil brain?

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.250
Well, the answer to that is
that every time your heart

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.110
beats, it pounds out effectively
an image of the

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.810
exterior of your brain on the
inside of your skull.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.900
By taking this scanning
technology, we can pass

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.000
through, reverse that image, and
of course create a replica

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.990
of sediba's skull.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.730
And it, of course, doesn't look
like what it should, just

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.350
like the rest of its anatomy.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.290
It has a 420 cubic
centimeter brain.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:44.900
But as you can see from this,
it's bilaterally asymmetric.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.130
That's an advanced trait,
very similar to ours.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:51.490
And also, if you're very careful
in looking, you will

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:55.070
see that as this turns around,
it has a bulge in this area,

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.750
which is called Broca's
area, which is often

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.090
associated with language.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.770
So there appear to be some
changes, reorganization going

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:08.390
on, before encephalization,
before brain size increase.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:09.830
That's got to be
rewritten, too.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.190
Because that was completely
unexpected from

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.340
our previous record.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.800
You can see also, we can do cool
things like look at the

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.750
developmental age, look at
various parts of the interior

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.630
structure, that we just didn't
have the capacity until very

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.790
recently to do.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.210
This is the most expensive
picture you will ever see

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.650
produced in your life.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:30.120
I don't care what you have
on your walls at home.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.420
This machine cost 6.5 billion
euros to produce this.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.930
It's a synchrotron--

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.520
two weeks in front of that to
create this image, which is a

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:47.830
0.075 micron reproduction of
that skull, the most accurate

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.390
reproduction passing through
it ever done

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.250
for an early hominid.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.000
It's allowing us to look right
down to the basic building

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.140
structure of these.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.670
We can actually look down to
the point of looking at the

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.340
daily incremental growth
lines in teeth.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.510
So you will know eventually, how
old that little child was,

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.280
to within nine days of his
death, 2 million years ago.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.680
That's pretty cool.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.090
So what did I learn
from all this?

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.640
And what I'm going to
leave you with.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.230
Well, a couple of things
that I would like to

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.340
leave you with here.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.280
One is that I think that a lot
of people out there in the

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.960
real world, and particularly
children, feel that all the

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.780
cool stuff has been
discovered.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.190
That basically what we will do
out there in the natural world

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:33.300
is follow in the footsteps
of great explorers.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.140
That we've explored this
planet over the

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.660
last 300 or 400 years.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.620
We've set foot on it.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.340
We've climbed all
the mountains.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.530
If you're going to get in
"National Geographic," you

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.320
have to climb naked up the south
side of Everest with a

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.050
dead parrot on your shoulder
if anyone's

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.180
going to pay attention.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.900
That if you're going to make big
contributions in business

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.760
or engineering or [? science, ?]
it is going to

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.990
be incremental in its growth,
maybe even in software

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.570
engineering or the internet and
such as that, because it's

00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:59.720
all been laid out.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.940
What this discovery says
is that is not true.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:08.130
Sitting there in the middle of
the most explored area on

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:13.480
planet Earth for these very
objects, so easy that a

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.420
nine-year-old could see it,
was not only just another

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.130
piece of one of these, but maybe
the best that have ever

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.660
been discovered to date.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.160
That means, absolutely,
that we have not

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.630
explored this planet.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.310
We may have walked all over
every square inch of its

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.730
surface, but we have
not seen it.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:37.090
What is now going to happen is
that this generation is going

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.070
to be privileged enough to
utilize technology, crowd

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:45.260
sourcing, to actually see and
understand what we've been

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.360
stepping on this entire time.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.390
The second thing that comes out
of this is that we humans

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.650
have a tremendous sense
of backyard syndrome.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.540
You all know what backyard
syndrome is?

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.150
Backyard syndrome is this.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.770
If I do an exercise with you,
I say, look around this room

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.640
that we're sitting
in right now.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.830
Pay special attention to it.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.240
And then we walk outside
to that coffee shop.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.020
And I say, OK, I want you
to draw this room.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.260
And I want you to draw your
backyard, or your living room,

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.220
or your kitchen, something
you're

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.470
intimately familiar with.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.170
You will do a better job of
drawing this room than you

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:19.140
will your backyard.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.120
Because your backyard is
actually, in your brain, an

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.010
amalgamation of all your
experiences with it.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.380
It looks like what your backyard
looked like two years

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.140
ago to the present.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.880
It's why you will find a
Post-it note on your

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.790
refrigerator from two years
ago, reminding you to do

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.570
something you didn't do.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.750
Because that's how
our brain works.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.550
We're protected from the normal
until there are gross

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.470
differences that are seen.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:50.390
There was a fossil in a site
sitting in the middle of the

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:55.430
most explored area on planet
Earth by scientists, by people

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:58.930
looking for these very things,
and we missed it.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.130
My colleagues and I had
backyard syndrome.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.480
It took the eyes of a child
who had no expectation of

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.540
non-discovery to actually
find that first piece.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.580
This has been an extraordinary
situation for us.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.020
It's been a humbling experience
for my team.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:23.000
I went from an organization that
was going to be closed to

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.010
an organization with more
than 100 scientists

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.350
from around the world.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:32.090
We represent one of the single
largest focused scientific

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.570
projects on the planet.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:38.420
All in the short space of
time, all based upon the

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.980
discovery by a nine-year-old
of a clavicle.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.260
And that's why, if some people
would ask why we've written

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.760
things like this children's
book first, because it did

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.020
touch children.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:55.360
This idea that first, they
could contribute.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.220
They could participate in big
science, and it isn't just a

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.690
fluke of discovery.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.040
It's not just that Matthew said,
Dad, I found a fossil,

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.010
with no knowledge.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.540
He saw something different.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.570
Remember that the rest of us had
to spend hours and hours

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.960
to actually gain that childhood
phenomenon.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.090
So ladies and gentlemen, it has
been a privilege to talk

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.450
to you here at Google.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.130
You, as I said at the beginning
of this, have done

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.640
more for the natural sciences
and scientists, with your open

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.600
access and freedom, than
almost any other.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.570
I can tell you, you have been
an inspiration for my large

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:36.800
team of scientists.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.320
We are probably the first team
in a very competitive,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.830
contentious field that have
completely opened access to

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:44.860
these fossils.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.350
Any scientist can look at these
fossils at any time,

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.670
published or unpublished.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.670
And a lot of that is due
to the inspiration that

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:57.500
organizations like yours have
done, in the very sense that

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.430
it was the free access to
information that in fact was

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.960
very much responsible
in the beginning,

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.970
for making this discovery.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.220
Thank you very much.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:23.240
So yeah, how I would balance
that sort of thing is I don't.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.540
I literally have not spent more
than a minute and a half

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.500
at those other sites.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.520
And I didn't have a
nine-year-old with me when I

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.260
went back to them.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.350
But what I'm doing now is
trying to train the next

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:33.800
generation of explorers.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.800
We need to get people
out of the labs.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.510
We have done a tremendous job
of training, for the last 30

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:44.810
to 40 years, laboratory
scientists.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:48.000
We're great at analyzing
the small amounts

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.880
of material I have.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.910
What we have not trained is a
great deal of people with an

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.460
awareness that there's more out
there to be discovered.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.660
In fact, in 2000, a major
scientist in the field,

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.580
actually from this particular
region of the world, said

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.700
there were no new fossil sites
to be discovered on the

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:05.640
continent of Africa.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.190
We had pretty much found
the entire trend.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.970
Something like this
proves that wrong.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:13.150
That also, though, engendered
a spirit of a lack of

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.735
exploration and discovery
in our field

00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:16.590
that we need to kill.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:18.100
It needs to be killed.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.520
Things like this will kill it.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.730
But we're actually going to
begin training, deliberately,

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:23.430
young explorers.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.990
We're building exploration
academies that train not only

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.390
people in paleontology
but all the fields.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.770
Because if it's true
in my field, it's

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.020
true in your field.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.040
I just think it's right
next to a city.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.130
The fact is the discoveries
happened there.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.610
Like many discoveries, what
that does is become this

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.200
magnet for people to go back.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.160
Because we love safety,
don't we?

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.520
If he found it here, I'm going
to start in the cave right

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.250
next to it.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.540
Then I'm going to start in
the one just out of that.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.820
These dolomitic limestones cover
huge regions of Africa.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.350
You can find them in Zimbabwe,
Mozambique, Zambia, Angola,

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:11.120
Uganda, the Congo, huge
regions of Africa--

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.210
unexplored.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.710
You can find in Eastern
Europe.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:14.810
You can find them in India.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:15.800
You can find them in China.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.000
I'm working with the
Chinese now.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.900
I'm looking at building
exploration, instead of just

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.760
working in sites that were found
by Westerners in the

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.240
1920s and 1930s.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.730
We need to just get out there.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.780
It's not going to
be a miracle.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.980
It's just going to be that
we haven't been looking.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.530
I know it looks like bone.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:36.630
It's not bone.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:37.930
It has been replaced.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.500
What you're seeing here in
this particular sense,

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.210
although the preservation is
very good, the kind of

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:48.950
yellowish color is actually due
to calcium phosphate, a

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:52.020
large amount of phosphatic
materials from bat guano and

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.560
things replacing into it.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.860
It's been replaced heavily by
calcium carbonate, manganese,

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.020
magnesium, and other minerals.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.140
That's not bone.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.080
The teeth are absolutely the
same teeth that were in their

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.470
mouth, interestingly.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:06.040
Because it's already a
fossil in your mouth.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.930
It's a hard substance.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:13.910
However, having said
that, there is

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.180
organic trace in this.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.470
And because of the
extraordinarily interesting

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:23.830
way in which it was preserved,
very suddenly, very quickly,

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.330
it has preserved
very surprising

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:30.320
levels of organic material.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:36.540
And that opens up potentials of
exploration that are really

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.790
quite exciting.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:45.730
We think it was probably
almost like a sinkhole

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.480
environment, but almost
like a pitcher plant.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.120
And it probably had
water in it.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.180
Well, they were preserved
in water.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.200
So we know it had water
in the bottom of it.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.160
And we probably think that all
of these animals were going

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.430
after water.

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.700
Water is about the only thing
in the world that a animal

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.910
will take a life or
death risk for.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.660
We tend to forget, because we're
nice and civilized, how

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.860
important water is.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.350
But if I put you on a 30-meter
platform that you couldn't

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.250
reach the pole underneath, and
I put you up there with all

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.900
the water you could drink, I
could come back in two weeks

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.110
and there'd be a skinny you,
sitting alive up on top of

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.095
that platform.

00:47:22.095 --> 00:47:25.410
If I put you up on that platform
with non-liquid

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:29.370
foods, and I put a glass of
water at the bottom--

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.080
48 hours.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.890
You might make it 72, before
I'd find your body at the

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:35.090
bottom of it.

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:37.250
And these all seemed
to have indications

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.490
of breaks and falls.

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:41.310
They were desperately trying
to get down there.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:42.530
And they wouldn't
do it for food.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.570
You're mixing animals--
carnivores, herbivores,

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.430
omnivores--

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:49.060
together, into this strange
mix of things.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.270
And the only thing that
unifies them is water.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.140
That's precisely what was
happening when I found those

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.140
600 or so other sites.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.450
I learned where the direction
of flow would be along fault

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:04.450
lines and such as that.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:08.090
So I didn't always have to see a
clean cluster of trees, like

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:08.710
I described to you.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.790
I was finding them also
without that.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.040
It's also the kind of thing that
we're now applying and we

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.140
can put into computers and
programs to actually do that

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.750
in areas that we haven't
explored yet.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.650
Once we ground truth a little
bit, we can find these

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:25.540
patterns and actually use
them to find more.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.950
That's going to offer an
explosive rate of discovery, I

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.200
think, in the next decades.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.600
In this particular case, there
isn't a cave, although there

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.940
may be a cave underneath.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.250
We're about to do
ground-penetrating radar.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.640
As you move up the hill, there
are lots of real caves in the

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.820
ones that you would think of.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.420
And some hold fossils,
some don't.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:53.210
It's really like-- imagine
a block of Swiss cheese.

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:56.020
And imagine the holes you can't
see are real caves.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.580
And the ones where the cheese
is cut are these.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.110
And they've been infilled
by various materials.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.350
So some of them are
little holes.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:03.285
Some of them are big holes.

00:49:03.285 --> 00:49:06.690
And it depends on the luck
of where you are at that

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:10.780
particular slice, on the form
and shape of that hole,

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.870
although all of them
were at one time a

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:15.170
cavity within the Earth.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.460
We're going in that direction.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.280
We're using things.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.430
We're working with the
[? SAFARI ?] program, with the

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:28.180
U-2 fly-overs, that look at
things like spectral imaging

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:28.820
and all that.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.790
We're looking at magnetics.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:35.500
We're looking at all kinds
of ways to establish the

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.500
existence of these.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.190
What it will require, though,
is another generation of

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:42.120
strong fieldwork, where you're
getting out and ground

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.680
truthing the existence of these
and then relaying it

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.650
back to these enormous and
fantastic data sets that we're

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.460
accumulating.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.140
That's why things like Google
Earth, as it improves, and the

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.950
quality of that are
so important.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.240
Because it's going to launch
this resource base for the

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.890
future of fossils.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.460
You may very well see a
situation very, very shortly

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.090
that these are fast becoming
not the rare,

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.110
sought-after objects.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.650
They'll still be sought after.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.900
But they may not be rare.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.175
If you'd asked me that three
or four years ago, I would

00:50:18.175 --> 00:50:19.960
have waffled on about
well, they

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.480
lived in broken woodlands.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.450
And we take the animals
and we--

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:27.090
the beauty of this site is it
collected over a period of

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.700
probably a few weeks to, at
most, a couple of months the

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.920
entirety of the assemblage.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.810
We're finding organic remains,
plant remains, seeds.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.960
We have things like fetuses of
antelopes inside of their

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.620
mothers, inside of this.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.890
We're going to give you the time
of year within a couple

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:42.190
of weeks that this happened.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:45.030
We're also going to give you a
texture of environment that's

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.770
unprecedented.

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:49.780
You're going to see a real
environment reconstructed.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.340
I'm not going to tell you what
that is right now, because

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.600
we're building this
super-accurate picture.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.690
And anything I tell you would
in fact just be a disservice

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.750
to the quality of
the information.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:03.050
We will know.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.460
I can reveal this, that we just
recently-- because we

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.130
were scanning with these
high-resolution scanners,

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:11.220
scanning the blocks-- we found
out that the blocks themselves

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.420
are not rock in the
way we thought.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.740
They're actually comprised
of organic material

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.170
like leaves and seeds.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:20.020
We'd been destroying the very
evidence we had always been

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.330
looking for of the actual
environment.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:24.190
And they're buried in it.

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.330
And we were taking it away in
order to figure out what the

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:30.130
environment was that
they lived in.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.350
AUDIENCE: It's kind
of like peat.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:31.830
LEE BERGER: Yeah.

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.530
But of course, it would be.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.910
Imagine the bottom of a cave,
with trees and a world out.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.590
Every time it rains, that
material gets washed in.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.710
Leaves fall in, an
animal drops in.

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:44.210
It's an organic compost,
if you will.

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.850
That's exactly what's
in the bottom.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.085
You mix a high degree of calcium
carbonate coming out

00:51:49.085 --> 00:51:50.640
of the dolomitic limestones.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.250
The water is supersaturated
in calcium carbonate.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.990
Add some fine silts into that.

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:57.970
It is a perfect environment
for fossilization.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.930
We are hoping so.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:07.790
We're hoping that we will be the
generation of scientists

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:12.800
that minimizes the destruction
of material.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.730
If I'd had even a portion of the
rocks that were attached

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.030
to some of the great fossils,
like the Taung child or Lucy,

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:22.020
or these things, we could do
so much now with them.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.450
We could date them.

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:24.960
We can't date them anymore,
because that

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.230
material has been removed.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:28.700
We could tell the environments
and that sort of thing.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.840
We have recognized that.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.070
And we're the first team that's
backing off of that

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.310
material and saying, no, first
we've got to push technology.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.810
So this large block that my
wife, Jackie, discovered has

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.020
got this skeleton in it.

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.005
And I'm not letting it be
prepared, even though there

00:52:44.005 --> 00:52:47.350
are bones in there that we have
never seen in the history

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:49.040
of searching for human origins,

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.610
complete femurs and stuff.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:53.910
I'm making them push the
technology before I will touch

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:55.780
that, to try and extract them.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.620
To try and make programs that
will actually see into this

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.750
and extract them in a quality
that we can use.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.730
Because it might be the last
time this happens.

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:06.550
And if we don't invent that
technology, who's

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:07.260
going to invent it?

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.560
And you need something big
enough to drive the kind of

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.215
R&amp;D that it takes to push the
field in a direction.

00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:15.579
And this is big enough.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:21.190
Excellent question.

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:22.440
Next?

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.590
We, as you might imagine, are
expending every effort,

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:34.610
working with the very
finest labs in the

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:36.220
world who work on that.

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.780
Because it's impossible.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.260
There will be no
2-million-year-old DNA.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.510
Of course, there won't.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.860
However, we have certain things
preserved that may give

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.790
signals that things like amino
acids were preserved.

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:54.490
And if amino acids
were preserved,

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:55.810
you might have proteins.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.870
So good question.

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:07.390
That's probably a good
one to end on.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.550
Thank you very much, everyone,
for your attention.
