00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.430
In the following graph,
is y a function of x?

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.320
So in order for y to
be a function of x,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.610
for any x that you input into
the function, any x for which

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.370
the function is defined.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.790
So let's say we have
y is equal to f of x.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.480
So we have our little
function machine.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.190
It should spit out
exactly one value of y.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.511
If it spits out multiple values
of y, we don't know what f of x

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.510
is going to be equal to.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.230
It could be equal to any of
those possible values for y.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.350
So let's see if, for this
graph, whether for a given x

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.960
it spits out exactly one y.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.330
Well, the function
seems to be only defined

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.360
so the domain of this function
is x is equal to negative 2.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.050
That's the only place where
we have a definition for it.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.680
And if we try to
input negative 2

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.810
into this little black
box, what do we get?

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.050
Do we get exactly one thing?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.550
No.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.410
If we put in negative 2
here, we could get anything.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.440
The point negative 2,
9 is on this relation.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.620
Negative 2, 8 is
on this relation.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.360
Negative 2, 7; negative 2,
7.5; negative 2, 3.14159--

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.330
they're all on these.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.860
So if you put a negative 2 into
this relation, essentially,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.710
you actually get an
infinite set of values.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.540
It could be 9.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.960
It could be 3.14.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.120
It could be 8.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.840
It could be negative 8.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.990
You get an infinite
number of results.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.910
So since it does not
map to exactly one

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.110
output of this function,
in the following graph,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.857
y is not a function of x.
