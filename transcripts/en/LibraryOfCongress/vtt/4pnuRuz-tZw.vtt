00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Today, we have invited you to a
very special program and our partner

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.560
in this program is an organization
called Everybody Wins D.C.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.530 position:56%
and they have helped bring you here.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.450
And we'll be giving you a special
gift at the end of the program,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.860
a book, from the author, Jarrett
Krosoczka who is right there.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.000
And Jarrett is from
Wister, Massachusetts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
He's come a long way.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.490
And he brought a gift with
him, his daughter, Zoey,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.870
if she could raise her hand.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.710
&gt;&gt; She's in the other room.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.350
&gt;&gt; Hi. Okay.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.100
Jarrett is a very famous author
who's written a lot of books.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.610
He's written several series.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.180 position:56%
One is called the Lunch Lady series.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.790
There are 10 of those.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.090
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] came alive.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.400
&gt;&gt; The one you're going to hear

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.760
about today is the Platyppus Police
Squad series of which there are 4

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.760
and there'll be another
one out next year.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.970
He's also written a memoir.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.270
Maybe he'll tell you what that is.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.660
That's coming out in 2017.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.150
We also have two other
special guests

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.760
because the Platypus Police
Squad is about police officers.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.500
So the Library has Capitol
Hill police who work with us

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.630
and take care of us
and make us safe.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.930
And we have Richard --

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.630
Officer Richard Webb
and Officer Renee White.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.930
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.230
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.530
&gt;&gt; And they're going to be
talking about [inaudible].

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.160
Okay? So here's Jarrett.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Karen.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.810
Hi everybody, how are you?

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.110
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.880
&gt;&gt; Good. Well, I'm so
glad to be here with you.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.200
My name is Jarrett.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440
I'm an author and I'm
an illustrator.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.300
So I write the words
and I draw the pictures.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.890
And I feel lucky enough that I
get to have my books published.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.030
And I've written several
picture books,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.510
the Lunch Lady graphic novels,
the Platypus Police Squad novels

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.160
but for me, it began
a long time ago.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.890
It started when I was a kid

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.330
when I was writing books
in elementary school.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.390
When I was in third grade, 8 years
old, I wrote this book in class.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.790
How many people here have ever
written a story ever in your life?

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.740
Raise your hand if you ever have.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.560
The class or even a little
short story, not a whole book.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.960
Well, I hope you guys realize
that you guys are authors too.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.310
Yeah, I see more hands going up.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.610
I know you have.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.010
I know you have.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.950
So this is where my
career as an author began.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.010
It started with me writing stories
in school when I was in kid.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.110
So I don't like to the first book
that was ever published as to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.480
where my career as an author begin,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.970
I look to the first
book that I ever wrote.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.380
And the first book
that I ever wrote,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.360
I wrote when I was
just about your age.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.770
A little bit younger and
it was called The Owl

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.280
Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.090
The book had a cover.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.430
You open up the book, the first
thing you saw was the title page.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.900
You know you get the name of the
book, the name of the author,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.460
some information about
the publisher.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.940
And it was story that was
told with words and pictures.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.900
And that's exactly what
I today for my job.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.670
My job today is tell stories
using words and pictures.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.370
Now words and pictures
are teammates.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.430
Words will tell one
part of the story

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.870
and the pictures will tell
another aspect of the story so that

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.430
when they come together they
tell the full story of the book.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.910
And sometimes you might decide
they're going to work alone

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.210
because maybe part of the story
will be told with just the words.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.510
But likewise, maybe part

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.470
of the story will be told
with just the pictures.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.080
And the very last page of my book
was the about the author page.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.520
You know the page in
the back of the book

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.820
where you learn about the author.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.270
And I had one when I was a kid too.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.270
I hope you guys have
them in your books.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.830
And it read Jarrett lives
in Wister, Massachusetts.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.450
He goes to Gates Lane
[phonetic] School.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.980
He liked making this book.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.280
I love that last sentence.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.670
He liked making this book because
I loved using my imagination.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.340
And that's what writing is
writing is using your imagination

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.640
but on paper.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.230
So as a kid I loved writing so
much that I wouldn't wait for this

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.530
to be a homework assignment.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.650
I'd get home from school.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.530
I would take out pieces of
paper and staple them together.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.410
And I would make my own books.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.030
And this wasn't a homework
assignment.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.260
You know? None of my grown
ups at home were saying hey,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.560
Jarrett it's time to write a book.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.140
I just wanted to be creative.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.330 position:56%
So in fourth grade, I wrote a book
about an egg and a tomato and a head

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.270
of a lettuce and a pumpkin.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.030
And I -- they were best friends.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.060
They went to a haunted house

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.750
where there were dangers
around every corner.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.540
There was an evil blender
that wanted to chop them up.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.620
[Laughter] And there was an evil
toaster that wanted to cook them.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.200
There was an evil microwave
that wanted to melt them.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.990
And I would have so much
fun making these stories.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.290
So throughout my childhood
whenever I had some free time,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.780
I would use that free time
to write and illustrate.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.730
I would make my own comics.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.320
I would share the comics
with my friends.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.280
And I loved seeing how people
were entertained by these stories

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.420
and comics and books
that I was making.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.250
And when I was in college, I kept
writing and I kept getting older.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.550
I kept writing.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.500
I then got real serious about
saying this is what I want

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.050
to do for my job.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.740
So I started sending
my work to publishers.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.320
And you know what they said?

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.740
They said we don't really
like your work all that much.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.180
Here's your book back.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.480
We don't want to publish it.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.780
And for two years that happened.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.650 position:56%
For two years, I mailed my books out

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.870
and they came back
with rejection letters.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.460
And I would write another story and
mail it up to another publisher.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.590
It'd come back with a
rejection letter but eventually

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.630
after two years, I
had a book published

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.860
and it was Good Night, Monkey Boy.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.500
And this big publisher, they
took my words and pictures

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.390
and put it all together
in that book.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.260
And made copies of that book.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.910
They sent copies of that book
out to schools and stores

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.180
and libraries all across
the country.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.200 position:56%
And so now, kids were reading books
just like I was a kid reading books,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.990
you know back in the day
when I would find the books

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.080
at my local library, the school
library, or the bookstore.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.130
And I kept writing and I
had more picture books come.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.050
So Punk Farm, Ollie the Purple
Elephant, My Buddy, Slug, Baghead.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.610 position:56%
I had the Lunch Lady graphic novels.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.290
There are 10 books in
the series that started

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.760
with the Cyborg Substitute.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.860
And it kept going and
the last book that came

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.930
out was the Schoolwide Scuffle.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.710
And now I am in the middle of this
world of Platypus Police Squad.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.020
And Platypus Police
Squad, they're novels.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.800
They've very heavily
illustrated novels and they're

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.810
about these two detectives.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.810
There's Detective Rick Zango.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.900 position:56%
He's the hot shot young rookie who
plays fast and loose with the rules.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.950
And he's partnered with Detective
Cory O'Malley who is sort

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.720
of like the old timer and
plays it by the books.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.880
He's a bit of curmudgeonous,
a total grump.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.180
Total opposites.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.490
They need to learn to work
together to keep their city safe.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.360
Now, like all of my books,
there are a ton of illustrations

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.170
that complement the words and the
pictures do help tell the story

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.180
but in the novel, though, the
words are really taking the lead

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.500
and telling the story
about these two guys.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.590
Even their -- Detective Cory
O'Malley, he always has to drive.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.430
He does not let the
rookie drive ever.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.830
So this is where the
series came from.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.610
I had a book come out
called Punk Farm.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.260
It's a picture book about these
farm animals that are rock stars.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.040
And a whole year before
that book was published,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.890
I would end my author presentations
by drawing a picture of one

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.160
of those farm animals with
their big aviator sunglasses.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.460
And I would ask the students

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.910
to guess what they thought
my next book would be about

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.670
and they all had these
different ideas.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.120
And they were all incorrect
but one idea that kept coming

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.620
up was students thought this was
a story about police officers.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.680 position:56%
They had those rock star sunglasses.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.320
They mistook those sunglasses
as that of being of cops.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.710
And so I thought well maybe I
could do something with that.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.380
So I started writing a book
called Penguin Police Squad

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.780
about these two penguins
that were cops.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.990
The curmudgeon old timer, the hot
shot rookie and they were penguins.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.970
Same names and everything
and I filled my sketchbooks

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.650
with these penguin characters.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.550
Explored their penguin home lives

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.580
and how they would be
different from one another.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.150
I thought about the other citizens

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.360
that would inhabit
this penguin city.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.940
I went to the New England
Aquarium and --

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.410
with my sketchbook and I went

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.870
to the penguin exhibit
and I drew the penguins.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.510
I studied the penguins but
then after a year of working

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:01.480
on penguin police squad,
suddenly penguins were everywhere.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.520
Everywhere you looked there
was a penguin documentary.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.170 position:56%
It was called March of the Penguins.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.170
It came out of nowhere and it was
like the biggest thing at the time.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.430
There were multiple animated
movies starring penguins.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.810
I mean these penguins were surfing.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.460
These penguins were tap dancing.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.600
These penguins were spies.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.730
There was an online
video game about penguins

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.280
that was very popular at the time.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.010
And I was talking to my manager
one day, he helps me, you know,

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.440
take my ideas and bring them to
the publishers and I was talking

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.480
to my manager, and he said you know
nobody wants another penguin story

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.780
right now.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.080
Penguins are just done.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.380
They're played out.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.680
They've had their time
in the spotlight.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.460
Nobody wants another penguin story.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.290
I was really -- as you can
imagine, I was crest fallen.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.550
I was sad because I had
spent all this time working

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.830
on penguin police squad
but I took a step back

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.720
and thought well what did
I love about the penguins?

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.340
I loved the way it sounded.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.780
Penguin police.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.080
Does anyone know what that is

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.090
where two words start
with the same sounds?

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.620
It's called alliteration where two
words start with the same sound.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.480
So I thought okay, I like that
-- I like the alliteration.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.430
I like that penguins are weird.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.760
I like that they are
unlikely heroes.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.310
So I thought what other animal
starts with the pa sound, is weird,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.860 position:56%
and would make for an unlikely hero.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.310
And I thought oh, the platypus.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.850
And in my sketchbook I started
sketching out these platypuses.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.840
And now once I said it's a
book about platypus cops,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.680
I thought they don't -- not
everybody needs to be a platypus.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.070
You know before every
character was a penguin.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.350
Here I thought there
could be a singer

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.470
at the night club and
she's a flamingo.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.000
She's a horrible singer
but nobody says anything

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.070
because her boyfriend owns
the club and he's this panda

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.290
who no one is sure
if they can trust.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.010
You know there's a kangaroo.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.310
There's a koala.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.840
And There's a hippo who acts
as like the security guard

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.480
for the business, the panda.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.230
And I put together a pitch.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.690
An official document that
says to my publisher,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.990
hey this is my idea for a new book.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:12.280
And I was lucky enough that
Walden Pond Press said hey let's

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.580
publish this.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.920
The world needs a good
platypus cop story.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.840
And I was -- it just
worked out so well.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.670
So I then got to writing the story.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.120
And when I'm organizing
thoughts in my notebook,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.630
I put together what's
called a story mount.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.460 position:56%
And I sort out what's going to
happen at the beginning of the story

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.550
and in the rising action, in the
climax which is the biggest moment

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.200
of the story, the falling
action and the resolution.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.500
And I'm just brainstorming.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.820
And you guys, I'm sure
you've brainstorm in class

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.410 position:56%
where you get all these of ideas
out of your head and onto the paper.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.600
And I get to write it.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.040
And I was so proud
of this first draft.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.720
I mean I had written picture books.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.050
I had written graphic novels.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.140
I had never written a
full length novel before.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.220
And I'm saying this
Word document was just,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.910
you know, thousands of words long.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.610
I had never worked so hard
on a story in my life.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:13.430 position:56%
And I sent that manuscript, that
first draft, into my editor and just

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.430
like you know you guys
pass in your papers.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.980
And your teacher might make a
few comments and make some marks

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.280
and you have to rewrite and
you have to edit and revise.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.650
And you have to write it again.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.260
You guys go through that, right?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.620
Yeah I go through that too.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.540
So here are the first two
pages of my editor's letter

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.470
to me explaining why my
story was not working.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.710
I want you to take note
this is single spaced.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.540 position:56%
This isn't a double spaced document.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.670
Here are pages 1 and 2

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.040
of my editor's letter explaining
why the story wasn't working.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.240
Here are pages 3, 4 and 5.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.550
And then here are pages
6, 7, 8, and 10, 11, 12,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.640
and 13 single spaced explaining
how I just had it all wrong.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.930
I needed to take another
look at my story.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.360
I had to throw away about 90%
of everything I had written.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.920
And while that's tough to do,
sometimes it has to be done

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.600
if you want to get your story
to the best place possible.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.900
So I kept writing.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.610
I kept revising.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.900
Kept getting notes back from the
editor but eventually the story was

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.970
in great shape and then my
publisher, they take my --

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.810
the story that I've written,
you know, in a Word document.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.800
And they plug into the design of
what the book will be printed at.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.030
So I get to see okay, the
words will be this big.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.810
About -- there'll be about
these many lines on a page.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.510
And now I reread that and I start
making sketches in the margins

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.790 position:56%
of what do I want to see in the art?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.260
How do I want to embellish
the story with the art?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:56.580
And we'll plug in the sketches
that I've made into the story.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.710
And we see how the words
and pictures are flowing.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.420
And then I get to work
on the final artwork.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.280
And to create the final artwork,
I take this special paper.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.550
It's called Bristol board
and it's how I make the art

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.630
for the Lunch Lady books as well.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.740
And I use pencils and I
use a brush dipped in ink

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.040
and it looks something like this.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.470
I start by just drawing
out the characters.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.920
And I'm using this special pencil.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.310
It's called non-photo blue.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.780
It's a special shade of pencil
that a computer can't see.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.360
So what happens is I take out my
ink and I dip my brush into the ink

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.660
and I draw the final line work.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.710
And I draw with a brush because
you get a very dynamic line

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.010
when you draw with a brush.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.310
That line goes from thick to thin.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.700
Now when I scan this
artwork into my computer,

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.520
the computer will only
see the black line work.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.950
It won't see that special shade
of blue, that non photo blue.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.020 position:56%
So I don't have to go through and
erase all of the pencil marks or all

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.800
of the art from the book.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.190
Now this art that I create in my
hands, I scan into my computer,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.610
I can see it on my computer screen.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.960
And in Photoshop, all the
shades of gray get plugged in.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.530
And it all gets bound up in a book.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:16.710
Now from the time that I started
thinking about Penguin Police Squad

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.490
to the day that Platypus
Police Squad was published,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.300
it was about 9 years.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.110
So it was several years
of brainstorming.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.120
I was sometimes I wasn't sure
what to do with this idea.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.490
I didn't know what kind
of book it would be.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.160
At one point, I thought
maybe it's a picture book.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.460
The story kept getting longer.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.760
I thought maybe it's
a graphic novel.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.050 position:56%
And I thought, you know, I'd like to
maybe try to write this as a novel.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.770
So there are -- there you'll see.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.170
There's the Frog Who Croaked.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.460
That was the very first book.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.280
And there's The Ostrich Conspiracy.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.930
There's Last Panda Standing

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.830
which will be everybody will
be receiving a copy of today.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.370
And just today, the cover for
the fourth book was released

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:03.510
and it's called Never Say Narwhal.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.280
And this book will be out in
May and it'll be the last book

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.790 position:56%
in the Platypus Police Squad series.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:17.890
So I'd like to bring a chapter
from Platypus Police Squad to life.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.130
And I sure I could have just
opened the book and read it to you

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.890
but I thought it'd be more exciting
to have some readers' theater.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.070
Readers' theater is
when actors recreate --

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.360
you know, create and bring to
life a scene from the book.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.250
So we have here from the
United States Capitol Police,

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.780
we have Officers White
and Officer Webb.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.360
They're going to be bringing
our characters to life.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:48.140
Now one character is an old
curmudgeon, grump plays it

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.340
by the books and one is the hot
shot young rookie who plays fast

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.640
and loose with the rules.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.940
Did you guys decide
amongst yourself --

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.540
&gt;&gt; -- who was going to
play what character?

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.840
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.100
&gt;&gt; Okay. So if you would please
pick up chairs and the chairs,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.920
now this is going to be transformed
into their unmarked squad car

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.590
and this is from one of the opening
chapters from The Frog Who Croaked.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.540 position:56%
It's the two detectives are
working together for the first time.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.930
It's their first time in the
cop car driving together.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.470
As I mentioned earlier, Detective
O'Malley he never lets anybody

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.770
else drive.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.490
Detective Rick Zango very excited.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.790
I mean put it this way.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.410
How many people here have a
younger brother or sister at home?

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.440
It's kind of like that.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.130
Right? Sometimes they kind
of maybe get into everything.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.630
Now how many people here have an
older brother or sister at home?

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.680
And don't they think
they know everything.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.070
Yeah. Sometimes, right?

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.540
And Karen Jaffe, who's the Director
here at the Young Readers Center,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.050
is going to play the
part of the narrator.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.450
And while this is all going on,

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.900
I'm going to be right here
recreating the illustrations

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.260
from that chapter.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.510
Okay. So on the count of 3,
you guys will be the directors.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.970
And you can see action or you
could give it a little more flare.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.720
You could say action.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.020
You guys ready?

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.620
&gt;&gt; Okay ready.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.450
One, two, three.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.050
&gt;&gt; Action.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.350
[Laughter]

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.030
&gt;&gt; That [inaudible] Detective
Corey O'Malley has a new partner,

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.790
rookie detective Rick Zango.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:35.450 position:56%
This is their first patrol together
driving in their unmarked squad car.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.350
Zango can barely contain
his excitement

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.480
as they drive to the docks.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.000 position:56%
Unmarked squad car is totally sweet.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.280
There are sirens and an
intercom and a flashing light

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.670
that can be strapped on
the roof with a magnet.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:55.790
The squad car is even outfitted
with the most up to date laptop.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.860
Zango eyes the police band
radio and the dashboard

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.820
like it's his birthday party
right there in the car.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:08.310
As he looks at it, the
radio crackles to life

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.330
with a radio [inaudible].

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:16.450
Car 153 officers on the scene
are requesting an update

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.750
on your position.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.720
Over. O'Malley eyes on the road,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.450
reaches for the mouthpiece
but Zango is quicker.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.420
&gt;&gt; That's a big 10-4 dispatch.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.720
Car number --

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.240
&gt;&gt; Give me that mouthpiece.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.060
&gt;&gt; Car 153 here, coming
up on the coliseum now.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.250
We're pulling into the
shipping area 6 minutes.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:43.570
Rule number 1, rookie no one
touches this radio but me.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.090
Got it?

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.890
&gt;&gt; Zango slumps down frustrated.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.290
They're probably moving
about 5 miles an hour.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.160
He hates being stuck in here.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.470
The Kalamazoo Coliseum
looms large up ahead

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:04.960
and a huge billboard beside the
stadium reads it's your chance

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.420
to name the new home of
the Kalamazoo City Sharks,

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:16.440
a Pandini [phonetic]
project, your sharks better.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.200
&gt;&gt; Look at the billboard.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.240
What is it with Pandini?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.090
I can't get him out of my fur.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.010
&gt;&gt; He's been pretty busy
the last year or so.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.090
&gt;&gt; Traffic slows to
an even slower pace.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.490
Making the traffic problem
worse, a huge crowd trying to get

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.920
to the ticket window has
spilled out onto the street.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.220
&gt;&gt; What's up with this?

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.140
&gt;&gt; Pandini is selling off parts
off the old stadium to raise money

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.880
for the Children's Hospital.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.250
Totally forgot that
was happening today.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.550
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.850
A Children's Hospital.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.080
&gt;&gt; What? You don't think
sick kids need medicine.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.380
It's a win-win.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.580
The hospital gets the
funds it needs.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.800
The die hard sports fan
gets it piece of history

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.410
and the new stadium is
going to be beautiful.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:12.050 position:56%
I think it's great that our athletes
are getting a stadium that they

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.280
and their fans can be proud of.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.580
And the tickets --

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.450
&gt;&gt; By now the squad car
is stopped completely.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.630
Zango taps his foot.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.140
They're never going
to get into the docks.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.790
He wishes O'Malley
would do something.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.230
&gt;&gt; Or maybe it's up to me.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:35.080
&gt;&gt; Zango slaps the light onto
the roof and flips on the siren.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.840
The cars in front of them instantly
start moving out of the way

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:43.300 position:56%
and like a stampeding herd, the
crowd outside the coliseum scatters.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.380
Shoving and knocking
one another over.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.430
&gt;&gt; What are you doing, rookie?

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.900
&gt;&gt; Maybe that wasn't
such a good move.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.850
Zango turns off the siren.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.150
&gt;&gt; Sorry partner.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.660
Thought you were in a hurry.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.220
It's off.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.270
&gt;&gt; Rule number 1, I'm the
senior detective in this car.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:09.240
I say how fast we go not you
especially when I'm driving.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.760
&gt;&gt; I thought rule number 1 was
no one touches the radio but you.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.760
&gt;&gt; Rule number 2, we're on a case.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.860
We're trying to travel
below the radar here.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.330
You want everyone in town
to know that we're the cops.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.040
The key is to keep low, keep
a low profile as possible.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.420
Got it rookie?

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:39.640
&gt;&gt; Rule number 3, as this is
where your real education begins.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.050
Junior, we need to stay
tuned in at all times.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.360
We stay focused on the city.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.400
Listen to its sounds.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.330
Smell its smells.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.150
Feels its pulse.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.760
We need to know what it's thinking.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.690
Anticipate what it's thinking about
to do -- to know what to do next.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:05.630
Detective, work is -- detective
work is about using your instincts.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.840
Stay a few steps of the unexpected.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I know but --

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:18.170
&gt;&gt; No buts, work is all about
keeping your bill to the ground.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.090
&gt;&gt; Oh lady.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.410
&gt;&gt; What did you just call me?

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.500
A little old lady.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.700
That's a lot of -- are you
even listening to me, rookie?

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.910
&gt;&gt; A little old lady crossing
the road, O'Malley, watch out.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:40.710
&gt;&gt; Zango pulls at the wheel and
the squad car swerves just in time.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.540
O'Malley's heart rate quadrupled.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.470
Sweat pops off his hand.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.020
He unbuttons his jacket.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.670
&gt;&gt; Yowser, that was a close one.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.230
&gt;&gt; O'Malley glances in
the rearview mirror.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.010
Sees a little old lady
shaking her cane.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.510
Zango folds his arms and smirks.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.770
&gt;&gt; What was the last bit
about paying attention?

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.570
&gt;&gt; This radio crackles again.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.040
Where are you, 153?

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.340
You're taking all day.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.640
What's your ETA?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.940
&gt;&gt; PDQ.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.540
&gt;&gt; And he flips the siren
on, throws the light

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.960
onto the roof and steps on the gas.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.650
&gt;&gt; Rule number 4, you got to know
when to put the pedal to the metal.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.400
They're expecting us at the docks.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.150
&gt;&gt; As they finally speed through
the streets, Zango thinks.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:36.420
&gt;&gt; I would have been
there a half hour ago.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.720
[Laughter]

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.020
&gt;&gt; Ready? We'll say and scene.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.320
And scene.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.620
&gt;&gt; And scene.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.120
&gt;&gt; Good work everyone.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.670
[Clapping] Does the Library

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.860
of Congress have a
community theater program

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.780
that you guys could enroll into?

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.080
&gt;&gt; No.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for being here.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you guys so much.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.880
&gt;&gt; Does anybody have a question
for me or for the officers

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.730
that are here that
you'd like to ask?

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.030
&gt;&gt; How do you --

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.330
&gt;&gt; Hold on.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.740
I'm going to have you speak
into the mic [inaudible].

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.100
&gt;&gt; How do you draw
without messing up?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.380
Without like the blue line
or nothing and you just draw

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.720
and don't mess up anything?

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.830
&gt;&gt; Oh I mess up all the time.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.720
It's not about getting
upset that you mess up.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.910
It's about when a piece of artwork
isn't going the way you want it to,

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:27.750
you just make some
changes, that's all.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.880
&gt;&gt; How do you get creative
and draw that quickly?

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.180
&gt;&gt; How do you creative?

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.340
Well, you know, I pay
attention to the world around me

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.110
and at the same time, I zone out.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:42.130
So you know, I might see something
that inspires me in reality

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.280
and I just have to take some time
to be alone with a sketchbook.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.290
Alone with my thoughts which
is pretty difficult today

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.400
because there's something to
look at and something to view

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.750
and there are phones and
computers and screens.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.350
But to be alone with a
sketchbook and just draw

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.650
and let your mind wonder.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.510
And that's how I get creative.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.060
[ Silence ]

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.970
&gt;&gt; Are the rules that you told her
real rules that you would tell her?

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.400
&gt;&gt; Are those -- is that how they
would really talk in the car?

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:22.070
Is that how you'd really
talk in a squad car?

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.370
&gt;&gt; He would yes.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.670
&gt;&gt; No. [Laughter]

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:25.970
&gt;&gt; Not really.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.290
We kind of laid back.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.590
Yeah.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.950
&gt;&gt; Well guys thank you so much
for spending some time with us

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.410
at the Young Readers Center today.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.940
What a gift for us to all be at
the Library of Congress together.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.320
I had a wonderful time
and I hope you did too.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.510
Thank you.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.180
