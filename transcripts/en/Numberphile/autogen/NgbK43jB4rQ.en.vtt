so let's talk about the four color

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530
so let's talk about the four color
 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.439
so let's talk about the four color
theorem it's a favorite with

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
theorem it's a favorite with
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.789
theorem it's a favorite with
mathematicians it's easy to state so the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799
mathematicians it's easy to state so the
 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.280
mathematicians it's easy to state so the
statement is every map can be colored

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
statement is every map can be colored
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.459
statement is every map can be colored
using four colors such that two

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469
using four colors such that two
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.980
using four colors such that two
neighboring countries are different

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
neighboring countries are different
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.990
neighboring countries are different
colors that would be confusing if it

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000
colors that would be confusing if it
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170
colors that would be confusing if it
wasn't so all maps can be done in four

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
wasn't so all maps can be done in four
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.570
wasn't so all maps can be done in four
colors in other words I'm saying there

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
colors in other words I'm saying there
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.660
colors in other words I'm saying there
are no maps that need five colors it's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670
are no maps that need five colors it's
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.429
are no maps that need five colors it's
not obvious and you'd think more

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
not obvious and you'd think more
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.560
not obvious and you'd think more
complicated maps would need more colors

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
complicated maps would need more colors
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.650
complicated maps would need more colors
but apparently all maps can be done with

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
but apparently all maps can be done with
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.990
but apparently all maps can be done with
just four colors or better so this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
just four colors or better so this
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.709
just four colors or better so this
problem

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

it was unsold it was solved finally in
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.250
it was unsold it was solved finally in
the 1970s although the method they used

the 1970s although the method they used
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350
the 1970s although the method they used
to solve it was a little controversial

to solve it was a little controversial
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.040
to solve it was a little controversial
at the time but has had a large effect

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
at the time but has had a large effect
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.180
at the time but has had a large effect
on mathematics today so the story of how

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
on mathematics today so the story of how
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.319
on mathematics today so the story of how
this problem came around is kind of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
this problem came around is kind of
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869
this problem came around is kind of
keeps apparently there was a guy who was

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
keeps apparently there was a guy who was
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389
keeps apparently there was a guy who was
trying to color in the counties of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
trying to color in the counties of
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.640
trying to color in the counties of
Britain I don't know why he was trying

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
Britain I don't know why he was trying
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830
Britain I don't know why he was trying
to do that but he was and he suspected

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
to do that but he was and he suspected
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440
to do that but he was and he suspected
he could do it using four colors and he

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
he could do it using four colors and he
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.910
he could do it using four colors and he
mentioned it to his brother and his

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
mentioned it to his brother and his
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560
mentioned it to his brother and his
brother was a math student and his

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
brother was a math student and his
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539
brother was a math student and his
brother mentioned it to his lecturer who

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
brother mentioned it to his lecturer who
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580
brother mentioned it to his lecturer who
was a man called or Gustus de Morgan

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
was a man called or Gustus de Morgan
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560
was a man called or Gustus de Morgan
he's a famous mathematician and when it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
he's a famous mathematician and when it
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.390
he's a famous mathematician and when it
was de Morgan who spread this problem

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
was de Morgan who spread this problem
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.570
was de Morgan who spread this problem
around so to prove it we either need to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
around so to prove it we either need to
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240
around so to prove it we either need to
show that every map can be done with

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
show that every map can be done with
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.090
show that every map can be done with
four colors or better or we just need to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
four colors or better or we just need to
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.990
four colors or better or we just need to
find one example that needs five colors

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
find one example that needs five colors
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.780
find one example that needs five colors
so people were trying it and if you try

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
so people were trying it and if you try
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880
so people were trying it and if you try
it with maps it does work if you try it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
it with maps it does work if you try it
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.149
it with maps it does work if you try it
with the map of the world you can color

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
with the map of the world you can color
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460
with the map of the world you can color
it with four colors if you try it with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
it with four colors if you try it with
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.429
it with four colors if you try it with
the map of the United States you can do

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
the map of the United States you can do
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.069
the map of the United States you can do
it with four colors you try any real map

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
it with four colors you try any real map
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319
it with four colors you try any real map
you can do it with four colors I mean

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
you can do it with four colors I mean
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.999
you can do it with four colors I mean
you can get this problem two children

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
you can get this problem two children
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:53.990
you can get this problem two children
right if you want to keep them quiet

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
right if you want to keep them quiet
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300
right if you want to keep them quiet
after a while you start to think well

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
after a while you start to think well
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.660
after a while you start to think well
maybe I'll need to invent a map maybe if

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
maybe I'll need to invent a map maybe if
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.050
maybe I'll need to invent a map maybe if
I can invent a weird complicated map I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
I can invent a weird complicated map I
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.440
I can invent a weird complicated map I
can find one that needs five colors so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
can find one that needs five colors so
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940
can find one that needs five colors so
that's what you start to do doesn't look

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
that's what you start to do doesn't look
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.029
that's what you start to do doesn't look
like any sort of real-life map so we got

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
like any sort of real-life map so we got
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.080
like any sort of real-life map so we got
this map and now we're going to color of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
this map and now we're going to color of
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.270
this map and now we're going to color of
it so let's start with the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
it so let's start with the
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.210
it so let's start with the
I think orange next country has to be a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
I think orange next country has to be a
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.800
I think orange next country has to be a
different color so I'm using the purple

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
different color so I'm using the purple
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.980
different color so I'm using the purple
here let's try the next country so this

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990
here let's try the next country so this
 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.570
here let's try the next country so this
is all fairly simple I can't use purple

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
is all fairly simple I can't use purple
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220
is all fairly simple I can't use purple
I can't use orange because they're

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
I can't use orange because they're
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.110
I can't use orange because they're
touching I'll use the blue next one what

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
touching I'll use the blue next one what
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640
touching I'll use the blue next one what
do you want what do you want lady well

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
do you want what do you want lady well
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.330
do you want what do you want lady well
we can't use blue or orange we could use

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
we can't use blue or orange we could use
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.630
we can't use blue or orange we could use
purple again ah why that is a wise

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
purple again ah why that is a wise
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.870
purple again ah why that is a wise
choice let's use purple again why not

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880
choice let's use purple again why not
 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.490
choice let's use purple again why not
let's not go to the expense of using a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
let's not go to the expense of using a
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.970
let's not go to the expense of using a
fourth color so now let's do this one

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
fourth color so now let's do this one
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.440
fourth color so now let's do this one
blue again and we can use perdu again so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450
blue again and we can use perdu again so
 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.930
blue again and we can use perdu again so
that one excellent that might put us in

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
that one excellent that might put us in
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.520
that one excellent that might put us in
a good position maybe to the next

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530
a good position maybe to the next
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.250
a good position maybe to the next
country so here we've got we can't use

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260
country so here we've got we can't use
 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.740
country so here we've got we can't use
blue we can't use purple what should we

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750
blue we can't use purple what should we
 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.000
blue we can't use purple what should we
use we can use orange why not and I join

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
use we can use orange why not and I join
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.610
use we can use orange why not and I join
you use the orange on the opposite one

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620
you use the orange on the opposite one
 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.590
you use the orange on the opposite one
so we'll do this one in orange and then

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
so we'll do this one in orange and then
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.110
so we'll do this one in orange and then
we need a fourth color we do need you

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120
we need a fourth color we do need you
 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.370
we need a fourth color we do need you
have to go to the fourth color do we

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
have to go to the fourth color do we
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.520
have to go to the fourth color do we
yeah yeah yep purple blue and orange are

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
yeah yeah yep purple blue and orange are
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710
yeah yeah yep purple blue and orange are
being used this does have to go into the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720
being used this does have to go into the
 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.680
being used this does have to go into the
fourth color I've got pink here on the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
fourth color I've got pink here on the
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.090
fourth color I've got pink here on the
opposite side it's the same obviously

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100
opposite side it's the same obviously
 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770
opposite side it's the same obviously
all these pink over here it looks like

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
all these pink over here it looks like
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.600
all these pink over here it looks like
we have to use four colors for that so

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610
we have to use four colors for that so
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.210
we have to use four colors for that so
okay so this is a map that was solvable

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220
okay so this is a map that was solvable
 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.610
okay so this is a map that was solvable
with four colors here's another

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
with four colors here's another
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.770
with four colors here's another
important map I'll make you like that

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780
important map I'll make you like that
 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.620
important map I'll make you like that
there's only four countries but if we

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630
there's only four countries but if we
 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.360
there's only four countries but if we
try and color it in and I'll do

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
try and color it in and I'll do
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.770
try and color it in and I'll do
something similar I'll do the orange in

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
something similar I'll do the orange in
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.550
something similar I'll do the orange in
the middle again purple up here well

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
the middle again purple up here well
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.860
the middle again purple up here well
this one can't be purple it can't be our

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870
this one can't be purple it can't be our
 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.330
this one can't be purple it can't be our
angel means blue and this country it

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340
angel means blue and this country it
 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.520
angel means blue and this country it
can't be orange it can't be purple it

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
can't be orange it can't be purple it
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.520
can't be orange it can't be purple it
can't be blue so I'm forced to use the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530
can't be blue so I'm forced to use the
 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.449
can't be blue so I'm forced to use the
fourth color which is the pink so this

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459
fourth color which is the pink so this
 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.190
fourth color which is the pink so this
is an example of a map that definitely

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200
is an example of a map that definitely
 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.289
is an example of a map that definitely
needs four colors so we're going to boil

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299
needs four colors so we're going to boil
 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.150
needs four colors so we're going to boil
the problem down a little bit they say I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
the problem down a little bit they say I
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.270
the problem down a little bit they say I
took this map again I'll draw it here

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280
took this map again I'll draw it here
 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.370
took this map again I'll draw it here
say map instead of coloring it in all

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380
say map instead of coloring it in all
 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.199
say map instead of coloring it in all
the sections let's just say I color in

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209
the sections let's just say I color in
 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.900
the sections let's just say I color in
at the center of each region I will just

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910
at the center of each region I will just
 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.330
at the center of each region I will just
get the same idea won't it I don't have

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
get the same idea won't it I don't have
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.090
get the same idea won't it I don't have
to use all that in and maybe instead of

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100
to use all that in and maybe instead of
 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.890
to use all that in and maybe instead of
drawing out the whole map maybe if I

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900
drawing out the whole map maybe if I
 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.349
drawing out the whole map maybe if I
just said if two countries are touching

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
just said if two countries are touching
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.900
just said if two countries are touching
each other they share a border right

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910
each other they share a border right
 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.969
each other they share a border right
I'll just connect them with a line what

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979
I'll just connect them with a line what
 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.650
I'll just connect them with a line what
I've made is I turn that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660
I've made is I turn that
 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.400
I've made is I turn that
app into a network so this map has made

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410
app into a network so this map has made
 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.920
app into a network so this map has made
this network and the question can this

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930
this network and the question can this
 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.100
this network and the question can this
map be colored using four colors or

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110
map be colored using four colors or
 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.350
map be colored using four colors or
better is the same question of saying

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360
better is the same question of saying
 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.680
better is the same question of saying
can this network be colored using four

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
can this network be colored using four
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.890
can this network be colored using four
colors or better such that two countries

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900
colors or better such that two countries
 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.900
colors or better such that two countries
that are connected with a line are not

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910
that are connected with a line are not
 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.600
that are connected with a line are not
the same color so it kind of boils down

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610
the same color so it kind of boils down
 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.370
the same color so it kind of boils down
the problem it makes it more abstract

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380
the problem it makes it more abstract
 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.110
the problem it makes it more abstract
but that's actually a good thing

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120
but that's actually a good thing
 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.330
but that's actually a good thing
it makes it easier to solve there are

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340
it makes it easier to solve there are
 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.250
it makes it easier to solve there are
things we can learn now about maps by

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260
things we can learn now about maps by
 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.440
things we can learn now about maps by
studying networks instead so the reason

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450
studying networks instead so the reason
 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.540
studying networks instead so the reason
we want to use networks for a start it

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
we want to use networks for a start it
 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.030
we want to use networks for a start it
shows when two maps are the same I'll

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040
shows when two maps are the same I'll
 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.650
shows when two maps are the same I'll
show you I mean what about if I had a

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660
show you I mean what about if I had a
 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.180
show you I mean what about if I had a
map that looks like this yeah so this

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190
map that looks like this yeah so this
 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.040
map that looks like this yeah so this
this map looks like a handbag as

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050
this map looks like a handbag as
 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.830
this map looks like a handbag as
Radiesse this told me but if we draw the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840
Radiesse this told me but if we draw the
 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.260
Radiesse this told me but if we draw the
network for this map so I'm just going

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270
network for this map so I'm just going
 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.620
network for this map so I'm just going
to put the adat in each region and then

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630
to put the adat in each region and then
 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.180
to put the adat in each region and then
I'll connect them if they're connected

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190
I'll connect them if they're connected
 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.940
I'll connect them if they're connected
like this you will find that you get the

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950
like this you will find that you get the
 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.750
like this you will find that you get the
same network as this previous map we did

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760
same network as this previous map we did
 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.910
same network as this previous map we did
so there's four countries again it gives

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920
so there's four countries again it gives
 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.830
so there's four countries again it gives
me the same network is effectively the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840
me the same network is effectively the
 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.570
me the same network is effectively the
same map even though it looks different

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580
same map even though it looks different
 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.540
same map even though it looks different
so by studying networks we can study all

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550
so by studying networks we can study all
 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.100
so by studying networks we can study all
the different kinds of maps even when

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110
the different kinds of maps even when
 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.290
the different kinds of maps even when
they look different now all maps make

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300
they look different now all maps make
 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.070
they look different now all maps make
networks but not all network are valid

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080
networks but not all network are valid
 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.310
networks but not all network are valid
maps I'll show you what I mean this is

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320
maps I'll show you what I mean this is
 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.110
maps I'll show you what I mean this is
not going to be a valid map and I'm

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120
not going to be a valid map and I'm
 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.980
not going to be a valid map and I'm
going to say we're all going to be

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990
going to say we're all going to be
 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.960
going to say we're all going to be
touching each other nor mutually

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970
touching each other nor mutually
 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.420
touching each other nor mutually
touching countries we all share borders

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430
touching countries we all share borders
 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.120
touching countries we all share borders
so it looks like I got this right looks

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130
so it looks like I got this right looks
 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.630
so it looks like I got this right looks
like that now this is not going to be a

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640
like that now this is not going to be a
 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.670
like that now this is not going to be a
valid map because if you try and turn

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680
valid map because if you try and turn
 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.100
valid map because if you try and turn
that into a map it's not going to work

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110
that into a map it's not going to work
 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.560
that into a map it's not going to work
the problem is the lines cross which

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570
the problem is the lines cross which
 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.030
the problem is the lines cross which
when you try and turn it into a map

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040
when you try and turn it into a map
 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.270
when you try and turn it into a map
doesn't make sense you can try but it

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280
doesn't make sense you can try but it
 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.700
doesn't make sense you can try but it
just doesn't make sense it is allowed if

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710
just doesn't make sense it is allowed if
 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.680
just doesn't make sense it is allowed if
we can untangle the lines and that might

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690
we can untangle the lines and that might
 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.659
we can untangle the lines and that might
happen I'll show you what I mean so so

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669
happen I'll show you what I mean so so
 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.930
happen I'll show you what I mean so so
these are countries here and let's say

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940
these are countries here and let's say
 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.000
these are countries here and let's say
these countries touch each other as well

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010
these countries touch each other as well
 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.730
these countries touch each other as well
so I would connect them with a line but

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740
so I would connect them with a line but
 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.500
so I would connect them with a line but
if I do that you see the lines cross I

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510
if I do that you see the lines cross I
 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.450
if I do that you see the lines cross I
don't have to do it that way I could

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460
don't have to do it that way I could
 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.659
don't have to do it that way I could
have drawn a line like that so I could

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669
have drawn a line like that so I could
 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:41.940
have drawn a line like that so I could
have

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950
have
 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.430
have
entangled that so if I can untangle it

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440
entangled that so if I can untangle it
 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.650
entangled that so if I can untangle it
that's fine that's a valid map and my

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660
that's fine that's a valid map and my
 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.600
that's fine that's a valid map and my
study networks there are some features

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610
study networks there are some features
 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.570
study networks there are some features
of maps that we can learn by looking at

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580
of maps that we can learn by looking at
 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.900
of maps that we can learn by looking at
networks this one in particular in any

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910
networks this one in particular in any
 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.700
networks this one in particular in any
map you're going to have a country let's

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710
map you're going to have a country let's
 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.970
map you're going to have a country let's
call it a country a right there's going

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980
call it a country a right there's going
 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.320
call it a country a right there's going
to be a country in every map those

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330
to be a country in every map those
 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.480
to be a country in every map those
either just by itself or on like an

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490
either just by itself or on like an
 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.190
either just by itself or on like an
island or country a is connected to one

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200
island or country a is connected to one
 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.990
island or country a is connected to one
other country I mean that might happen

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000
other country I mean that might happen
 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.200
other country I mean that might happen
or country a is connected to two other

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210
or country a is connected to two other
 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.750
or country a is connected to two other
countries so you'll get a network that

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:18.760
countries so you'll get a network that
 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.040
countries so you'll get a network that
looks like that that'll be country a

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050
looks like that that'll be country a
 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.290
looks like that that'll be country a
there in the middle or you might have

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300
there in the middle or you might have
 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.000
there in the middle or you might have
country a which is character three

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010
country a which is character three
 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.800
country a which is character three
countries this all seems perfectly

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810
countries this all seems perfectly
 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.430
countries this all seems perfectly
reasonable as a in the center country a

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440
reasonable as a in the center country a
 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.410
reasonable as a in the center country a
could be connected to four countries or

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420
could be connected to four countries or
 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.500
could be connected to four countries or
now for a in or country a could be

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:37.510
now for a in or country a could be
 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.670
now for a in or country a could be
connected to five countries and that all

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680
connected to five countries and that all
 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.000
connected to five countries and that all
seems reasonable but every map will have

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.010
seems reasonable but every map will have
 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.670
seems reasonable but every map will have
at least one country that looks like one

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680
at least one country that looks like one
 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.120
at least one country that looks like one
of these what you can't have is every

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.130
of these what you can't have is every
 

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.600
of these what you can't have is every
country connected to six other countries

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.610
country connected to six other countries
 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.820
country connected to six other countries
or more all I'm saying is there is at

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:56.830
or more all I'm saying is there is at
 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.250
or more all I'm saying is there is at
least one country in that map that's

00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.260
least one country in that map that's
 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.440
least one country in that map that's
either connected to one or two or three

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:01.450
either connected to one or two or three
 

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.230
either connected to one or two or three
or four or five but if you have a map

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240
or four or five but if you have a map
 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.540
or four or five but if you have a map
where they're all mutually connected to

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:06.550
where they're all mutually connected to
 

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.750
where they're all mutually connected to
six or more countries that's a network

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:09.760
six or more countries that's a network
 

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.920
six or more countries that's a network
that can't be untangled

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:10.930
that can't be untangled
 

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.410
that can't be untangled
so all maps have this feature one of the

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:13.420
so all maps have this feature one of the
 

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.650
so all maps have this feature one of the
countries is one of these on this list

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:16.660
countries is one of these on this list
 

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.020
countries is one of these on this list
now we can start talking about the four

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.030
now we can start talking about the four
 

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.340
now we can start talking about the four
color theorem this is actually really

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.350
color theorem this is actually really
 

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.430
color theorem this is actually really
useful so the full color theorem is hard

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440
useful so the full color theorem is hard
 

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.130
useful so the full color theorem is hard
to prove and they tried for a long time

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:26.140
to prove and they tried for a long time
 

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.300
to prove and they tried for a long time
like I said it took 125 years they did

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.310
like I said it took 125 years they did
 

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.880
like I said it took 125 years they did
manage to prove easier versions of the

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:32.890
manage to prove easier versions of the
 

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.040
manage to prove easier versions of the
four color theorem so the four color

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.050
four color theorem so the four color
 

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.200
four color theorem so the four color
theorem means there are no maps that

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.210
theorem means there are no maps that
 

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.420
theorem means there are no maps that
need five colors I can probably prove

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:39.430
need five colors I can probably prove
 

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.400
need five colors I can probably prove
that there are no maps that need seven

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:41.410
that there are no maps that need seven
 

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.880
that there are no maps that need seven
colors that's probably easier to explain

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:43.890
colors that's probably easier to explain
 

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.600
colors that's probably easier to explain
okay I'm going to have a go okay imagine

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:48.610
okay I'm going to have a go okay imagine
 

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.750
okay I'm going to have a go okay imagine
there are maps that need seven colors

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760
there are maps that need seven colors
 

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.340
there are maps that need seven colors
these are maps that can't be done with

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:53.350
these are maps that can't be done with
 

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.800
these are maps that can't be done with
better right so there are maps that

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:55.810
better right so there are maps that
 

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.499
better right so there are maps that
seven pick the floor each one okay so

00:08:58.499 --> 00:08:58.509
seven pick the floor each one okay so
 

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:01.290
seven pick the floor each one okay so
you've got a small one now because it's

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.300
you've got a small one now because it's
 

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.629
you've got a small one now because it's
a map it's going to contain a country

00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:03.639
a map it's going to contain a country
 

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:05.340
a map it's going to contain a country
which is going to be one of these A's

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.350
which is going to be one of these A's
 

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.949
which is going to be one of these A's
that I've called here on this list so

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959
that I've called here on this list so
 

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.100
that I've called here on this list so
take that country and put it out to

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.110
take that country and put it out to
 

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.619
take that country and put it out to
delete it take it away you've made a

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:13.629
delete it take it away you've made a
 

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:16.049
delete it take it away you've made a
smaller map now because it's a smaller

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:16.059
smaller map now because it's a smaller
 

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.350
smaller map now because it's a smaller
map that means you can do it in six

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360
map that means you can do it in six
 

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.230
map that means you can do it in six
colors do you remember the map I had was

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240
colors do you remember the map I had was
 

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.319
colors do you remember the map I had was
the smallest that had to use seven so if

00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:25.329
the smallest that had to use seven so if
 

00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:27.509
the smallest that had to use seven so if
I take a country away smaller I can do

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519
I take a country away smaller I can do
 

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.600
I take a country away smaller I can do
it with six great if I put my country a

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:30.610
it with six great if I put my country a
 

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.689
it with six great if I put my country a
back in that means I have a spare color

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:33.699
back in that means I have a spare color
 

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:36.119
back in that means I have a spare color
to use for a I mean the worst-case

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:36.129
to use for a I mean the worst-case
 

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:38.910
to use for a I mean the worst-case
scenario is this last one here and these

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920
scenario is this last one here and these
 

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.040
scenario is this last one here and these
could be all different colors they might

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.050
could be all different colors they might
 

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.019
could be all different colors they might
put a back in I'm still going to have a

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:43.029
put a back in I'm still going to have a
 

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:45.030
put a back in I'm still going to have a
spare color a six color that I can use

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040
spare color a six color that I can use
 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.150
spare color a six color that I can use
which shows that the map can be done in

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160
which shows that the map can be done in
 

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.730
which shows that the map can be done in
six colors after all now the shown that

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:50.740
six colors after all now the shown that
 

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.710
six colors after all now the shown that
all maps can be done with five colors

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720
all maps can be done with five colors
 

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.150
all maps can be done with five colors
that's a little bit harder

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160
that's a little bit harder
 

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.249
that's a little bit harder
the proof is exactly the same the proof

00:09:56.249 --> 00:09:56.259
the proof is exactly the same the proof
 

00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:58.470
the proof is exactly the same the proof
is exactly the same except in this

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480
is exactly the same except in this
 

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.869
is exactly the same except in this
worst-case scenario down here at the end

00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:00.879
worst-case scenario down here at the end
 

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:03.509
worst-case scenario down here at the end
here and it becomes harder because if

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519
here and it becomes harder because if
 

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.090
here and it becomes harder because if
those are five different colors and you

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:06.100
those are five different colors and you
 

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.090
those are five different colors and you
put your country a back in you might

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.100
put your country a back in you might
 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.679
put your country a back in you might
have to reuse a color which you don't

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:10.689
have to reuse a color which you don't
 

00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:12.600
have to reuse a color which you don't
want to do so the arguments a bit more

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.610
want to do so the arguments a bit more
 

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.100
want to do so the arguments a bit more
complicated you have to show that you

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.110
complicated you have to show that you
 

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.590
complicated you have to show that you
can recolor it and you still have a

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600
can recolor it and you still have a
 

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.860
can recolor it and you still have a
spare color for a so it's a harder proof

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:19.870
spare color for a so it's a harder proof
 

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.249
spare color for a so it's a harder proof
but it's along the same line then they

00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:23.259
but it's along the same line then they
 

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:25.949
but it's along the same line then they
try to do it with four can we share that

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959
try to do it with four can we share that
 

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.360
try to do it with four can we share that
all maps can be done with four colors

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:27.370
all maps can be done with four colors
 

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.350
all maps can be done with four colors
and that argument doesn't quite work it

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360
and that argument doesn't quite work it
 

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.410
and that argument doesn't quite work it
just wasn't strong enough so this went

just wasn't strong enough so this went
 

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.240
just wasn't strong enough so this went
unsolved for a long time so where some

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:19.689
networks and he said every map must have
 

00:11:19.689 --> 00:11:22.290
networks and he said every map must have
at least one of these networks within it

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:22.300
at least one of these networks within it
 

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.199
at least one of these networks within it
and they showed that every map contains

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:25.209
and they showed that every map contains
 

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:27.900
and they showed that every map contains
one of these networks each one of those

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:27.910
one of these networks each one of those
 

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.030
one of these networks each one of those
networks can be colored with four colors

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040
networks can be colored with four colors
 

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.359
networks can be colored with four colors
or can be recolored with four colors and

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:33.369
or can be recolored with four colors and
 

00:11:33.369 --> 00:11:35.819
or can be recolored with four colors and
that that is enough to show that every

00:11:35.819 --> 00:11:35.829
that that is enough to show that every
 

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:39.239
that that is enough to show that every
map can be done with four colors now it

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:39.249
map can be done with four colors now it
 

00:11:39.249 --> 00:11:41.519
map can be done with four colors now it
is a hard proof and a part of the

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:41.529
is a hard proof and a part of the
 

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:43.949
is a hard proof and a part of the
problem was having to show that this

00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959
problem was having to show that this
 

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:46.799
problem was having to show that this
list could be colored with four colors

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:46.809
list could be colored with four colors
 

00:11:46.809 --> 00:11:49.799
list could be colored with four colors
because it was a long list there were

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:49.809
because it was a long list there were
 

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:53.549
because it was a long list there were
how many networks was on this list 1938

00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:53.559
how many networks was on this list 1938
 

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:56.669
how many networks was on this list 1938
networks and to do that they use the

00:11:56.669 --> 00:11:56.679
networks and to do that they use the
 

00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:59.790
networks and to do that they use the
computer and that was controversial at

00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800
computer and that was controversial at
 

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.369
computer and that was controversial at
the time this was the first computer

00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:02.379

is done with computers but this was the
 

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.239
is done with computers but this was the
first and people were wary of this proof

00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:15.249

for a start one of the problems is
 

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:21.929
for a start one of the problems is
involves checking lots of cases that's

not the best kind of proof it is a
 

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:26.789
not the best kind of proof it is a

proven is valid but the problem with
 

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:29.669

like that kind of truth it's not the
 

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:41.579
like that kind of truth it's not the
best kind but it's still a valid proof

00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:41.589
best kind but it's still a valid proof

the proof has been improved for a start

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:44.439
the proof has been improved for a start
 

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:46.679

we had this long list of networks that

we had this long list of networks that
 

00:12:46.689 --> 00:12:48.619

we had to show we could color in that

something I think it's shorter now I'm
 

00:12:55.869 --> 00:12:57.359
something I think it's shorter now I'm
not sure how short it is at the moment

not sure how short it is at the moment
 

00:12:57.369 --> 00:12:59.879

at the moment though the proof still

00:12:59.879 --> 00:12:59.889
at the moment though the proof still
 

00:12:59.889 --> 00:13:02.730
at the moment though the proof still
requires this massive checking of cases

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:02.740

so it's still not a beautiful proof this
