00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.554
Just wanted to begin today by
pointing out a couple of

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:07.572
articles
from today's Boston Globe.

00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:11.000
There's an article that's on
the financial

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.616
pages about investors
reconsidering gene therapy,

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:18.059
and startups funded as
technology evolves.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.000
A lot of you have heard the
words gene therapy.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.221
A lot of you,
at the end of that bacterial

00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:27.500
genetics lecture,
said you

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.000
weren't quite sure what
complementation was.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.379
But, gene therapy is basically
complementation put to work.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.669
The
idea is if you got a broken

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:42.664
gene, and you can put in a good
copy, then

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:45.455
you'll take the cell back to
being normal,

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:49.548
which is exactly what we're
doing in those phage crosses

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:52.332
where we had two phage,
one with the

00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:56.130
mutant copy of the gene,
and one with the wild type copy

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.166
of the gene.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:02.000
And they're saying here that
there's a renewed interest.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.733
Now, the basic strategy in
these things is to take usually

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.121
a
retrovirus, the same kind of

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.132
idea that we heard about with
the HIV-1

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:16.340
virus that will make a DNA
copy, and then the copy gets

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.284
inserted
somewhere in the chromosome.

00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:22.263
So, the good thing is it puts
in a new

00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:23.828
copy in a chromosome.

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:27.330
The bad thing is you got a
piece of DNA being

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.652
stuck somewhere in the
chromosome.

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:32.397
And there are places where it
can go

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:36.552
where it doesn't matter,
and there are other places

00:01:36.552 --> 00:01:38.866
where it
really does matter.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.666
So, it's been a very tricky
business

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.548
with gene therapy.

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:44.998
Part of the thrust here is
they're thinking that

00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:47.783
maybe they need to pick targets
were the person's going to die

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:49.534
anyway so
that if there is a risk of

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:51.665
getting cancer or something,
it's outweighed

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:52.776
by the possible thing.

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:54.089
That's sort of the thrust.

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:56.589
You can see the
article; it's in today's paper.

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:58.333
It's very timely for what we
are

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.668
talking about now.

00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:03.992
And then on Friday I'm going to
start talking about recombinant

00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:05.504
DNA strategies and stuff.

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:07.946
But there's
another article in today's

00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:08.314
paper.

00:02:08.314 --> 00:02:10.585
This is one of those things
that I

00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:13.808
told you about where an article
is published in the,

00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:16.626
in this case,
online in the journal Nature.

00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:19.056
They have an embargo on a press
thing

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:21.960
until Thursday or so,
and then the article is on,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.022
the hot papers that
have just come out show up in

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.527
the newspapers,
usually either on Friday

00:02:27.527 --> 00:02:28.124
or Monday.

00:02:28.124 --> 00:02:31.764
And this is yet another system
that they describe as making

00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:35.608
a molecular repair kit that
corrects mutations in the cells'

00:02:35.608 --> 00:02:36.000
DNA.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.539
So far, this has only been done
in cells.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.485
But it's working well
enough, and the article is

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:44.000
saying this approach could
become a serious

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.363
competitor to conventional gene
therapy.

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:49.850
In here, you have sort of
a layman's account of this kind

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.000
of complementation by gene
therapy.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.914
We're talking about gene
therapy in that field which

00:02:54.914 --> 00:02:57.812
attempts to force
feed healthy genes into cells

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:00.000
hobbled by defective ones has
been

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.333
plagued by failure,
and recently was found to cause

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.416
leukemia
in some patients.

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:09.840
That's probably because of the
insertion events associated

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.077
with these viruses.

00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:14.197
This new system
rewrites the small stretch of

00:03:14.197 --> 00:03:15.810
misspelled genetic code.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.165
That's
typically the reason the gene

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:18.950
has gone bad.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.338
So it's a different kind
of strategy.

00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:24.053
This is the first report I've
heard of that.

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.525
Some of
the stuff we're talking about

00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:28.915
is sort of inescapable because
you're

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:30.614
going to see it in the paper.

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:32.722
Here, they're telling you the
sort

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:34.152
of thing I was just saying.

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:36.166
The viruses inject their
payloads at

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:39.133
random within the cell's mass
of DNA sometimes disrupting

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:39.901
normal
genes.

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.423
Even when genes land in good
locations, the molecular

00:03:42.423 --> 00:03:44.522
machinery
that regulates their activity

00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:46.497
is also often thrown off,
leaving the

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.272
healthy genes operating at a
level too low to be helpful or

00:03:49.272 --> 00:03:51.489
functioning
in the wrong parts of the body.

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.036
It must begin to sound
familiar.

00:03:53.036 --> 00:03:54.962
You
stick a random piece of DNA

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:58.582
somewhere, you can disrupt the
regulation in the gene as well

00:03:58.582 --> 00:04:01.329
as just landing in the open
reading frame.

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.138
So there's a problem with gene
therapy.

00:04:04.138 --> 00:04:07.207
Now, they'd like to make you
think that this is going to be

00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:09.710
the promise to everything,
but as always it's more

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.323
complicated.

00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:12.280
And
so, I just picked up the last

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.713
paragraph of this article.

00:04:13.713 --> 00:04:15.544
Other
scientists said the approach

00:04:15.544 --> 00:04:17.629
looked promising,
but predicted it would

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.848
end up struggling with this
problem of its own,

00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:20.234
James M.

00:04:20.234 --> 00:04:22.399
Wilson, a gene
therapy researcher at the

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:23.799
University of Pennsylvania.

00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:26.233
Now, there's
somebody who's in a position to

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:29.176
criticize, but also has a vested
interest himself in the

00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:31.524
alternative therapy,
noted that the first step

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:35.000
of the new process causes for
zinc fingers.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.094
It's a kind of protein that's
involved in this,

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:41.241
to make a fresh
break in DNA to accommodate the

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:43.613
insertion of the corrected
sequence.

00:04:43.613 --> 00:04:47.288
It's the same kind of break
with radiation that can lead to

00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:47.922
cancer.

00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:51.122
And we're going to talk today
about, you'll see where

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:53.891
double-stranded
breaks and whatnot can be a

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.538
real problem in terms of the
integrity of

00:04:56.538 --> 00:04:59.909
the DNA and genome stability,
which is maintaining gene

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.230
stability so
important in avoiding cancer.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.615
You guys are a tough crowd.

00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:09.371
Comments ranged from,
this was the best lecture that

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.054
I'd given to ones
that were absolutely the other

00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:14.528
end of the spectrum.

00:05:14.528 --> 00:05:16.523
You're a very hard
group.

00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:20.707
I truly am going to take,
I don't have time really to sit

00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:23.096
back
and redo all my lectures,

00:05:23.096 --> 00:05:26.536
but I've a huge amount of
input, and I'm going

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:30.883
to go back over all this input
I'm getting, and take it very

00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:34.859
seriously
in terms of how I go about

00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:37.000
things next year.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.455
I can see a number of changes
I'm going to make.

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:44.089
Whoever sent me the
e-mail that talked about the

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:47.000
Dock Street Bohemian Pilsner
brewed in

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.560
Utica, NY, this classic golden
Pilsner, pungent,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.785
perfumy taste and
so on, it was a moment of

00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:57.000
lightness, but if I got too many
things like

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.615
that it's not going to help me
in trying to figure out how to

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:02.000
do.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.476
For the person who asked about
how to avoid accidental

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:08.371
pollination,
when they're going to do that,

00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:10.920
they actually take the stamens
off the

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.267
flowers so you don't get
accidental self fertilization.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:17.304
You actually go
out and make ones that are just

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:19.039
male or just female flowers.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.056
You can do
that rather easily.

00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:24.307
OK, so what we got into last
time, or what I told

00:06:24.307 --> 00:06:27.525
you last time,
and I promise you that there's

00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:30.059
another Mendel
lecture coming.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.071
For those of you who thought
this

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:35.957
was a little slow,
you may find the next one is

00:06:35.957 --> 00:06:36.773
all too fast.

00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:39.016
But
anyway, that will be how it

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:39.350
goes.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.597
Mendel had carried out this
fundamental series of

00:06:42.597 --> 00:06:43.307
experiments.

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:45.497
And I did linger over it
because I

00:06:45.497 --> 00:06:49.002
think it's so simple you can
actually see the scientific

00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:51.452
process
in action, and it also isn't

00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:53.783
complicated by any techniques
that

00:06:53.783 --> 00:06:54.639
we can't see.

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.928
And it was a tremendously
important insight that

00:06:57.928 --> 00:07:00.220
genetic information came in
units.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.375
But as I told you,
it wasn't

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:06.268
accepted because for most of
the world at the time,

00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:08.491
it was a
statistical argument.

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:11.875
There weren't any entities that
were two of inside

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:14.149
a cell, and all that sort of
thing.

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:16.625
So, it didn't take over
scientific

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:17.253
thinking.

00:07:17.253 --> 00:07:21.375
It wasn't until about 1900 when
several other geneticists

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.672
did finally find systems that
duplicated Mendel's results,

00:07:25.672 --> 00:07:28.011
and
therefore showed that these

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:30.875
were general inferences,
something that

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.815
Mendel himself,
as I told you,

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:35.625
by choosing weeds and bees as
follow-up

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.784
systems hadn't been able to do.

00:07:37.784 --> 00:07:40.363
These other geneticists showed
them

00:07:40.363 --> 00:07:41.580
in other systems.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.089
But the other thing that made
the difference at

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:49.815
the time, was by this point
cytologists, who were looking at

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:53.105
cells under microscopes,
had found entities whose

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:56.831
behavior seemed to
match those of these particles

00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:01.069
of information that Mendel had
postulated to explain these

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.000
patterns of inheritance that he
was seeing.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.505
These particles,
because they were called

00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:12.172
chromosomes, which literally
means colored things,

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:16.444
the reason they were colored
was not because

00:08:16.444 --> 00:08:21.659
they were inherently colored,
but because cytologists were

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:25.065
staining
the cells with a variety of

00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:25.688
things.

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:28.887
And that was what allowed them
to

00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:31.164
visualize these.

00:08:31.164 --> 00:08:36.571
And so, by staring into
microscopes,

00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:43.725
right around this time,
around the turn of the century,

00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:49.591
1900s or so,
cytologists had come up with

00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:52.778
three key observations.

00:08:52.778 --> 00:09:02.117
One was that
chromosomes came in matched

00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:04.000
pairs.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.476
So, let's say in this cell,
there were too long and too

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:12.307
short.

00:09:12.307 --> 00:09:16.103
So
that's a chromosome.

00:09:16.103 --> 00:09:20.913
And it corresponds,
we now know,

00:09:20.913 --> 00:09:26.344
to a
double-stranded DNA molecule

00:09:26.344 --> 00:09:31.000
that's been all condensed up.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.934
And there are two copies of
each chromosome in this thing.

00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:38.272
So: two
long, two short,

00:09:38.272 --> 00:09:41.586
one came from mom,
one came from dad.

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:44.339
And for
bookkeeping purposes,

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:48.399
I'm going to color them so that
from one parent

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.810
is unshaded,
and the other one is shaded.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:58.015
Most of you know in human
cells we have 23 pairs of

00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:00.000
chromosomes.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.614
This is a now fancier method of
visualizing chromosomes called

00:10:04.614 --> 00:10:08.731
painting chromosomes where you
take little stretches of DNA

00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:10.810
that
are unique to particular

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.842
sequences, attach dyes,
and then use them to

00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:16.719
stain the cells,
and so they will color only

00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:18.458
particular chromosomes.

00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:21.704
And we have 22 pairs of
identical chromosomes,

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.382
and then the sex
chromosomes here,

00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:27.691
X and Y, this would be a male,
or two X's

00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:28.847
if we were .

00:10:28.847 --> 00:10:32.221
We'll return to those in the
next

00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:32.795
lecture.

00:10:32.795 --> 00:10:35.734
Kim Nasmyth,
who spent his life working on

00:10:35.734 --> 00:10:38.551
how these
chromosomes segregate gave a

00:10:38.551 --> 00:10:39.628
talk a year ago.

00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:42.409
He's in London at a
hospital in London.

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.938
And then he brought in the next
slide.

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:47.579
There
was an artist who spent several

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:49.998
months visiting with him,
trying to

00:10:49.998 --> 00:10:53.911
find ways to represent in art
some of what she saw going on.

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.461
And I
thought you might enjoy seeing

00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:57.539
this, the slide.

00:10:57.539 --> 00:11:00.811
This is the human
complement of chromosomes,

00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:03.330
represented in stripy socks
that

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.775
various staff members from the
hospital brought in for

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:09.278
her to do this.

00:11:09.278 --> 00:11:14.547
So, a little touch of scientist
humor which some of you may

00:11:14.547 --> 00:11:17.749
think is pretty nerdy,
but anyway there it

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:19.815
was for what it's worth.

00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:22.914
He showed that in our
departmental

00:11:22.914 --> 00:11:23.846
colloquium.

00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:28.081
OK, the second thing,
then, that the cytologists

00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:32.243
noted by staring at this was
during ordinary cell division,

00:11:32.243 --> 00:11:35.573
which gives
two identical daughters the

00:11:35.573 --> 00:12:07.000
numbers of chromosomes per cell
is preserved.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.142
And this ordinary cell division
is given a special name of

00:12:15.142 --> 00:12:16.285
mitosis.

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:20.281
So
if we take this cell,

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:27.000
the first thing that happens,
then, is the

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.821
chromosomes are duplicated.

00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:40.880
We've talked a lot about DNA
synthesis at the molecular

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.776
level.

00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:45.059
This is looking at it.

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:51.603
Excuse me,
and so, there are now two DNA

00:12:51.603 --> 00:12:57.000
molecules, that each one of
these

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:07.000
new DNA molecules is given a
special name.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.660
This is called a chromatid.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.306
So there was one DNA molecule
here.

00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:18.087
It's now duplicated,
but you'll notice these are

00:13:18.087 --> 00:13:20.425
still joined
together.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:25.922
The point at which they are
joined together is known as the

00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:26.927
centromere.

00:13:26.927 --> 00:13:31.407
And then, after this,
after the DNA's been copied,

00:13:31.407 --> 00:13:34.539
these
things are lined up at the

00:13:34.539 --> 00:13:38.538
center of the cell and then they
are pulled

00:13:38.538 --> 00:13:44.846
apart to give two daughter
cells that are just like what

00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:46.792
you started with.

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:50.799
This part, so this is 2N,
if N is

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:53.481
the number of kinds of
chromosomes.

00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:55.531
And then there's two each.

00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:56.710
This is
2N.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.377
At this point,
the DNA contents of the cell is

00:14:01.377 --> 00:14:02.000
4N.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.911
This is 2N.

00:14:02.911 --> 00:14:03.822
This is 2N.

00:14:03.822 --> 00:14:06.390
We're back to where we started.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.272
This part was
invisible to the cytologists,

00:14:10.272 --> 00:14:13.599
at least in the sense the
chromosomes

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:15.774
at this point are extended.

00:14:15.774 --> 00:14:19.399
And so, they weren't able to
visualize them

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:22.389
by looking through the
microscope.

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:28.252
But as it came time for cell
division, then the chromosomes

00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:31.000
condensed up very tightly.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.323
This is probably to avoid
tangles.

00:14:33.323 --> 00:14:36.000
And you need to pull them apart
into

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.742
the two daughter cells.

00:14:37.742 --> 00:14:41.000
And then the part that you
could see, this

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.285
was known as mitosis,
this process by which the

00:14:44.285 --> 00:14:46.428
chromosomes are pulled
apart.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:51.000
So, mitosis is a mechanism for
nuclear division that results in

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
two daughters with identical
genetic information.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:19.000
When you contrast this to
meiosis,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.206
which I'll show you in just a
minute, this has been studied

00:15:28.206 --> 00:15:31.948
for
years in a kind of observation

00:15:31.948 --> 00:15:32.341
way.

00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:34.994
I showed you at some point.

00:15:34.994 --> 00:15:37.460
This is
an animal cell where the

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.230
chromosomes line up,
and then they pull apart.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.040
I think I showed you,
and you can see the cells

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.004
divide once they've
done that.

00:15:45.004 --> 00:15:48.538
I'm going to show you this next
thing, which everything

00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:49.960
happens more slow motion.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.692
This is a picture of the blood
lily, so it's a

00:15:52.692 --> 00:15:53.043
plant.

00:15:53.043 --> 00:15:55.500
Again, the choice of model
system is often,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.192
if it has a feature
that is good for a particular

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.000
thing.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.478
This happens,
very easy to visualize in these

00:16:04.478 --> 00:16:05.348
lily cells.

00:16:05.348 --> 00:16:09.341
Now here, the
cells have duplicated their

00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:14.971
chromosomes, and the daughter
chromosomes are held together.

00:16:14.971 --> 00:16:18.076
They're glued together,
so you can

00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:21.491
tell in this thing that they've
been glued.

00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:26.253
Now, in order to separate
the first thing they have to do

00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:29.460
is line up at the equator of the
cell.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.295
And then it pulls apart and you
can see that each daughter cell

00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:37.962
gets one
of the duplicated chromosomes.

00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:40.023
OK, so that's mitosis.

00:16:40.023 --> 00:16:44.452
It generates
two copies of what you started

00:16:44.452 --> 00:16:44.956
with.

00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:51.498
The other observation that the
cytologists made was that cell

00:16:51.498 --> 00:16:58.999
divisions that produce sex cells
work by a different system.

00:16:58.999 --> 00:17:16.333
So, the third thing,
And, I'm going to give you the 

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.501
scientific word now for sex
cells.

00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:20.999
So, they're usually called
gametes.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:24.311
General term,
so that would be sperm and egg,

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:28.431
or pollen would
be a kind of gamete.

00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:32.856
In this process,
the number of

00:17:32.856 --> 00:17:36.144
chromosomes is halved.

00:17:36.144 --> 00:17:42.570
And this special type of cell
division is

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.111
known as meiosis.

00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:52.285
It's very important,
because if we didn't have

00:17:52.285 --> 00:18:02.000
meiosis we wouldn't have any
progeny.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.236
We need to be able to cut the
number of chromosomes we have

00:18:07.236 --> 00:18:11.099
per cell in
half, so as Mendel inferred,

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:15.000
then when each parent made a
contribution

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.301
you'd be back up to the right
number of cells.

00:18:19.301 --> 00:18:24.750
Now, so this process
begins again by duplication of

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.616
the DNA.

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:28.000
So this would be 2N.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.387
Now we go to,
as before, with one interesting

00:18:34.387 --> 00:18:37.000
difference here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:57.466
So we are at 4N in the cell. But
you notice that I've drawn

00:18:57.466 --> 00:19:02.000
these duplicated chromosomes
with

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.666
chromatids overlapping.

00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:09.304
This point of,
I didn't do this too well.

00:19:09.304 --> 00:19:12.424
The
point of connection:

00:19:12.424 --> 00:19:18.000
where the two chromosomes
overlap is known as

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.500
the chiasma.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:26.000
It's a point of actual physical
interaction between

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.047
the chromosomes.

00:19:28.047 --> 00:19:32.909
And what it allows the cell to
do is

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:38.154
to have the two homologous
chromosomes, in this case the

00:19:38.154 --> 00:19:41.260
two
long ones, find each other,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.545
and actually physically
interact.

00:19:44.545 --> 00:19:49.781
That's a critical event for the
next step that I'm going to show

00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:50.363
you.

00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:54.417
It's also a point,
which you'll see in the next

00:19:54.417 --> 00:19:59.090
lecture, there is
additional genetic diversity

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.000
introduced into the system.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.450
So, at this point,
what's happened is that the DNA

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:09.016
has doubled, at this
point, looks sort of like

00:20:09.016 --> 00:20:12.000
mitosis except for the fact that
the

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.032
duplicated chromatids have
overlapped.

00:20:15.032 --> 00:20:18.642
There's a least one of
these for every pair of

00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:20.285
duplicated chromosomes.

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:24.416
So what happens in the
next phase, which is known as

00:20:24.416 --> 00:20:30.513
meiosis I is that the pairs of
duplicated chromosomes are

00:20:30.513 --> 00:20:32.000
separated.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.920
So, we get two cells.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.759
We might get,
say, the unshaded of this one

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:41.104
and
the shaded of the little guys.

00:20:41.104 --> 00:20:44.799
And the other one then is
shaded with a

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:47.911
long one and unshaded with this
one.

00:20:47.911 --> 00:20:50.311
This is 2N, and this is 2N.

00:20:50.311 --> 00:20:54.044
But if
you'll take a look at what's

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:57.599
happening over here,
you will see

00:20:57.599 --> 00:21:04.000
that we don't have the same
thing going on.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.356
In that case,
we were producing identical

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:09.893
copies of the starting
cell.

00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:13.588
In this case,
we've got something different

00:21:13.588 --> 00:21:17.431
now because
we've separated both copies of,

00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:20.362
let's say, the chromosome from
dad

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:24.630
from both copies of the
chromosome that originated with

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.520
mom, and the
other way over here.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.270
These, then,
undergo a second round that's

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:37.388
known as meiosis II,
which resembles now mitosis in

00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:40.816
the
sense that the duplicated

00:21:40.816 --> 00:21:46.000
chromatids are now pulled apart
into daughter

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.070
cells so that this one will
generate one long,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.000
unshaded one,
one short,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.542
and there will be two of those.

00:21:57.542 --> 00:22:02.000
In the cell,
it will generate a shaded

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.096
long and unshaded like that.

00:22:05.096 --> 00:22:08.856
So now, there are four of
these.

00:22:08.856 --> 00:22:12.122
And you'll notice that there is
now an N.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:17.091
So, we halved the number of
chromosomes during meiosis via

00:22:17.091 --> 00:22:20.285
a process by two rounds of
division.

00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:24.668
The other thing you can think
of is you can begin to see,

00:22:24.668 --> 00:22:28.603
at least, when
the evolution of sex was such a

00:22:28.603 --> 00:22:31.712
powerful force in driving
evolution

00:22:31.712 --> 00:22:36.062
by introducing so much
variation, because each of us

00:22:36.062 --> 00:22:39.462
has a copy of
each of our 22 chromosomes

00:22:39.462 --> 00:22:43.142
where we have homologous pairs,
one from mom,

00:22:43.142 --> 00:22:44.621
one from dad.

00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:48.833
That every time we make a sex
cell,

00:22:48.833 --> 00:22:52.610
a sperm or an egg,
what happens is for chromosome

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.817
1, you can either get
a copy from mom or the copy

00:22:56.817 --> 00:22:57.590
from dad.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.165
And then the next one:
copy

00:23:00.165 --> 00:23:03.265
from mom, copy from dad,
and so on.

00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:08.619
You can see the variation is
possible just from that part of

00:23:08.619 --> 00:23:10.140
the process alone.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.434
And there's going to
be more variation that comes

00:23:14.434 --> 00:23:18.000
about from events that happen
where this

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.709
chiasma is as I'll show you.

00:23:20.709 --> 00:23:24.000
So, meiosis then,
as I said, is a

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.956
mechanism for nuclear division
that produces four daughter

00:23:28.956 --> 00:23:34.421
cells with
half the genetic info of the

00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:36.000
original.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:24:14.000
So, how did I write that?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.092
And in this case,
the daughters are not

00:24:22.092 --> 00:24:24.221
identical.

00:24:24.221 --> 00:24:31.145
Does somebody have a
question?

00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:32.151
Yeah?

00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:39.400
Oh, this part of the process,
the

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.125
cytologists broke this down
when they were observing.

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:45.823
So, it was a
part they couldn't see.

00:24:45.823 --> 00:24:49.000
When they started to be able to
see it, they

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.275
first saw this one division,
and then the second division.

00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:55.904
They
called the first round of

00:24:55.904 --> 00:24:58.598
division of meiosis I,
and the

00:24:58.598 --> 00:25:01.201
second meiosis 2.

00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:06.713
So it was just a name given to
the

00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:08.058
process.

00:25:08.058 --> 00:25:08.898
Yeah?

00:25:08.898 --> 00:25:15.453
Oh, sorry, excuse me,
I see the problem.

00:25:15.453 --> 00:25:19.654
OK, it goes
this way.

00:25:19.654 --> 00:25:26.208
This period of time is called
meiosis I.

00:25:26.208 --> 00:25:36.379
That part of the
process is called meiosis I,

00:25:36.379 --> 00:25:41.000
meiosis II, sorry.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.916
Yeah, I mean what I wrote down
as arbitrary.

00:25:44.916 --> 00:25:49.055
You could've had 2 from
mom, and 2 from dad.

00:25:49.055 --> 00:25:52.773
And in fact,
I guess if we have 22 pairs we

00:25:52.773 --> 00:25:56.189
could
eventually have a sperm or egg

00:25:56.189 --> 00:25:59.855
that had all of the copies from
mom, and

00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:02.201
all of the copies from dad.

00:26:02.201 --> 00:26:05.415
You could calculate the
statistical

00:26:05.415 --> 00:26:09.022
chances of that happening,
but what you'll discover as

00:26:09.022 --> 00:26:12.249
we'll find next
time, is that even if you did

00:26:12.249 --> 00:26:15.079
that the chromosomes would no
longer be

00:26:15.079 --> 00:26:19.041
identical to what you got from
mom or dad, because there's a

00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:21.985
little bit
of genetic recombination going

00:26:21.985 --> 00:26:23.574
on during that process.

00:26:23.574 --> 00:26:26.931
I'll also show
in a minute that you can get

00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:29.582
errors in this process,
and that

00:26:29.582 --> 00:26:31.749
these are important.

00:26:31.749 --> 00:26:36.166
So, what happens then is that
fertilization,

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:41.000
what the cytologists can see
happened was that the number

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.776
of chromosomes have been
halved.

00:26:43.776 --> 00:26:47.000
So, you had N plus N giving you
2N

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
where this might be,
for example,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.571
the egg, and this might be the
sperm, since gametes have half

00:26:55.571 --> 00:26:59.000
the number of genetic content
when they

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
fuse, then you go back to the
original number.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.162
And this gave rise to what was
known as the chromosomal theory

00:27:12.162 --> 00:27:14.299
of
inheritance.

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:20.500
Even though cytologists didn't
know what these

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.193
colored things were,
they seemed to have the

00:27:25.193 --> 00:27:31.913
properties that you would
expect the carriers of the

00:27:31.913 --> 00:27:36.000
genetic information to have.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.766
Be duplicated before a cell was
going to divide and then they

00:27:39.766 --> 00:27:42.336
seemed
to be very precisely segregated

00:27:42.336 --> 00:27:44.663
so that each daughter cell got
one

00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:44.973
copy.

00:27:44.973 --> 00:27:48.006
And it made sense,
then, in terms of the formation

00:27:48.006 --> 00:27:50.845
of sex cells
you'd have, and then it would

00:27:50.845 --> 00:27:51.928
all come back up.

00:27:51.928 --> 00:27:54.878
So, the cytologists
proposed this chromosomal

00:27:54.878 --> 00:27:56.240
theory of inheritance.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.020
Chromosomes were the
carriers that carried the

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.000
genetic information.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.743
And you can see now that
Mendel's work was rediscovered,

00:28:05.743 --> 00:28:08.695
which is more
or less what happens around

00:28:08.695 --> 00:28:11.663
1900, how beautifully it mapped
on top of

00:28:11.663 --> 00:28:15.239
this because the genetic
information came in particles.

00:28:15.239 --> 00:28:16.497
You'd think,
oh,

00:28:16.497 --> 00:28:20.500
well those particles are
sitting on those chromosomes.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.161
They get
duplicated.

00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:23.596
They get separated.

00:28:23.596 --> 00:28:25.485
They get divided in half.

00:28:25.485 --> 00:28:28.675
Their
number gets divided in half

00:28:28.675 --> 00:28:31.000
when you make sex cells.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.280
So, I want to at least point
out, let me go onto this next

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.332
thing here.

00:28:36.332 --> 00:28:39.613
Here was one other picture I'd
shown you.

00:28:39.613 --> 00:28:42.933
This was a cancer cell
dividing again.

00:28:42.933 --> 00:28:45.557
We see the same process at
work.

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:47.952
And that just
reminds you,

00:28:47.952 --> 00:28:51.534
when I was talking about that
kind of process,

00:28:51.534 --> 00:28:54.546
trying
to remind you that one cell

00:28:54.546 --> 00:28:57.664
gives rise to two cells,
and one DNA

00:28:57.664 --> 00:29:03.000
molecule gives rise to two DNA
molecules.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.400
But these phenomena are related
even though one talks about them

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.870
in different parts of the
courses, and if you've got more

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.931
than one DNA
molecule per cell,

00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:14.754
then each one's a chromosome.

00:29:14.754 --> 00:29:18.113
And then you have to
take care of segregating those

00:29:18.113 --> 00:29:18.623
as well.

00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:22.433
But a point that I'd made is
that up until this part to the

00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:25.000
right could be a yeast or an E.
coli, but

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.771
if it's going to be someone,
something more complicated

00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:31.185
that's
got different kinds of cells

00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:33.799
like us, then we have these
ultimately,

00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:36.322
an adult human with 10^14 cell.

00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:39.333
So, this process has happened
over,

00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:41.896
and over, and over again.

00:29:41.896 --> 00:29:45.999
And it has to be really very
accurate.

00:29:45.999 --> 00:29:50.720
And, there was remarkable
advances have been made in

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.190
understanding this
process over the last few

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.796
years.

00:29:55.796 --> 00:29:59.332
And a lot of this was due to
the

00:29:59.332 --> 00:30:06.000
work of Lee Hartwell,
who carried out experiments,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.812
I guess, that offered some key
insights into the basis of the

00:30:10.812 --> 00:30:13.699
whole
cell cycle, of which this is

00:30:13.699 --> 00:30:14.501
just part.

00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:16.907
So they said,
here we can't

00:30:16.907 --> 00:30:20.492
really see all of this stuff in
the microscope.

00:30:20.492 --> 00:30:24.768
What cytologists were
able to observe was that after

00:30:24.768 --> 00:30:27.816
the chromosomes had duplicated,
then

00:30:27.816 --> 00:30:29.350
they condensed up.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.270
They became visible,
and they could see that

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.247
part of the system.

00:30:35.247 --> 00:30:38.887
So, a great body of knowledge
has

00:30:38.887 --> 00:30:42.242
been learned over the past few
years.

00:30:42.242 --> 00:30:44.664
Lee Hartwell,
who was a

00:30:44.664 --> 00:30:49.369
postdoc at MIT with Boris
Magasanik a number of years ago,

00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:52.850
was one of
the key people who led to this

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.295
round of insights.

00:30:54.295 --> 00:30:59.420
And what we now know,
the cell cycle can be basically

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.000
divided into four parts.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.142
So a newly born cell,
if you will,

00:31:05.142 --> 00:31:08.665
undergoes what's known as phase
of

00:31:08.665 --> 00:31:12.881
the cell cycle that's known as
the G1 phase.

00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:18.148
And you could think of
this as, amongst other things,

00:31:18.148 --> 00:31:21.998
sort of preparation for
duplicating the

00:31:21.998 --> 00:31:23.061
cell's DNA.

00:31:23.061 --> 00:31:27.506
And then, there's a phase known
as the S-phase,

00:31:27.506 --> 00:31:32.191
which is
when DNA synthesis takes place.

00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:37.918
That now gives the cell an
information content of 4N.

00:31:37.918 --> 00:31:42.125
There was then another phase
known as G2,

00:31:42.125 --> 00:31:48.875
which you could think of as
preparation for pulling the

00:31:48.875 --> 00:31:54.085
chromosomes apart,
and for the cell dividing.

00:31:54.085 --> 00:31:57.627
And that's
known as mitosis.

00:31:57.627 --> 00:32:01.750
And so, this is quite
remarkable.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.531
It's quite fundamental.

00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:07.250
It's a very elegant and very
complex system of

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.947
controls.

00:32:07.947 --> 00:32:12.750
And what Lee learned is that
there is an elaborate system of

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.772
what we now know as checkpoints
in the cell cycle.

00:32:16.772 --> 00:32:20.514
And the idea is
pretty much the same sort of

00:32:20.514 --> 00:32:23.750
thing that you might do if you
were an

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:28.648
engineer and you were setting
up a quality control process

00:32:28.648 --> 00:32:31.459
that
involved a series of stages.

00:32:31.459 --> 00:32:34.142
And what a checkpoint does is
it

00:32:34.142 --> 00:32:37.824
basically demands successful
completion of a prior phase

00:32:37.824 --> 00:32:40.297
before
the system is permitted to move

00:32:40.297 --> 00:32:41.384
to the next stage.

00:32:41.384 --> 00:32:44.035
And you can sort of
see the problem here,

00:32:44.035 --> 00:32:46.998
that if you are trying to,
say you're copying

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:50.050
your chromosome,
your DNA, and you only got part

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:50.829
way through.

00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:53.094
And
then you proceeded to the part

00:32:53.094 --> 00:32:55.569
where you pulled the chromosomes
apart.

00:32:55.569 --> 00:32:58.946
There would be all kinds of
chaos inside of the cells

00:32:58.946 --> 00:33:02.864
because you
would be breaking chromosomes.

00:33:02.864 --> 00:33:06.375
You wouldn't be getting
identical

00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:08.041
information.

00:33:08.041 --> 00:33:13.180
And there are three major
checkpoints.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:18.041
There is a
checkpoint at the G1/S

00:33:18.041 --> 00:33:19.234
boundary.

00:33:19.234 --> 00:33:23.875
There is actually more than
one.

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:31.299
But there's an intra-S phase
checkpoint, and then there's

00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:35.205
another
one at the G2/M boundary as

00:33:35.205 --> 00:33:35.683
well.

00:33:35.683 --> 00:33:39.411
And the way that Lee found this
out,

00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:43.452
I wanted to just take you back
because remember when I was

00:33:43.452 --> 00:33:46.431
talking,
well, first we talked about how

00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:49.056
would you get a mutant affecting
an

00:33:49.056 --> 00:33:51.950
essential cell,
a gene whose function is

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.880
essential for the cell.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.703
We said you'd have to be
conditional in some kind of way,

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:02.779
because the organism would be
dead, and couldn't use genetics

00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:03.736
to study
it.

00:34:03.736 --> 00:34:07.721
So, when I introduced you to
those phage, and we wanted to

00:34:07.721 --> 00:34:10.408
study
critical functions needed for

00:34:10.408 --> 00:34:13.175
phage growth,
we needed a conditional

00:34:13.175 --> 00:34:13.702
mutant.

00:34:13.702 --> 00:34:18.000
Remember, we did look for
temperature sensitive mutants.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.599
So that's what Lee Hartwell
started to do with yeast in 1970

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:24.787
approximately.

00:34:24.787 --> 00:34:29.199
He just looked for mutations
that were temperature

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.288
sensitive lethals in yeast.

00:34:31.288 --> 00:34:34.152
Now, yeast can be diploid,
but they

00:34:34.152 --> 00:34:36.882
also can be haploid,
which is just one copy of

00:34:36.882 --> 00:34:38.096
genetic information.

00:34:38.096 --> 00:34:40.039
So
just like a bacterium,

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:42.768
haploid yeast,
if you get a mutation

00:34:42.768 --> 00:34:45.414
affecting a gene,
then you see its phenotype

00:34:45.414 --> 00:34:48.761
right away because there
isn't a complication of the

00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:49.885
second chromosome.

00:34:49.885 --> 00:34:52.520
And Lee got the Nobel
Prize for his work,

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.273
just, I forget,
three years ago or a short time

00:34:55.273 --> 00:34:56.260
ago
anyway.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.000
And so, this was the process he
was studying.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.476
I showed you this movie.

00:35:01.476 --> 00:35:03.629
In this case,
this is budding yeast,

00:35:03.629 --> 00:35:06.269
and you
can see why it's called budding

00:35:06.269 --> 00:35:08.614
yeast is that rather than the
still

00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:12.288
growing and segregating down
the middle, the daughter cells

00:35:12.288 --> 00:35:14.728
grow as
little buds coming off the

00:35:14.728 --> 00:35:15.076
side.

00:35:15.076 --> 00:35:18.643
The DNA is still going to be
duplicated as we got,

00:35:18.643 --> 00:35:21.134
and then segregated into the
daughter.

00:35:21.134 --> 00:35:23.176
So
that part of the process is

00:35:23.176 --> 00:35:25.846
there, but there's yeast growing
sped up a

00:35:25.846 --> 00:35:27.550
bit so you can see it.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.416
So, what Lee found was that
when he

00:35:30.416 --> 00:35:34.355
looked at his TS mutants,
he found that they tended to

00:35:34.355 --> 00:35:36.745
arrest at
characteristic stages,

00:35:36.745 --> 00:35:40.081
and he was able,
then, to figure out that there

00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:44.346
must be some sort of checkpoint
system that is something went

00:35:44.346 --> 00:35:46.832
wrong
during one of the stages,

00:35:46.832 --> 00:35:49.748
then the cells with all pile up
at a

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:53.449
particular characteristic stage
in the cell cycle.

00:35:53.449 --> 00:35:55.987
And this was
controlled by these

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:56.875
checkpoints.

00:35:56.875 --> 00:35:59.538
These checkpoints are of
enormous

00:35:59.538 --> 00:36:03.104
importance because if something
goes wrong with them,

00:36:03.104 --> 00:36:05.629
as happens often in
cancer cells,

00:36:05.629 --> 00:36:09.690
then you get a huge increase in
instability of the

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.441
genome very similar to the way,
losing, for example,

00:36:13.441 --> 00:36:16.554
mismatch repair
causes instability of the

00:36:16.554 --> 00:36:19.844
genome and therefore things that
can cause a

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:24.466
cell to forget to divide when
it stopped dividing when it hits

00:36:24.466 --> 00:36:27.372
its
neighbors, which part of the

00:36:27.372 --> 00:36:30.000
cell it belongs to and so on.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.016
Those kinds of changes will
come with much greater

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:35.000
frequency.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.405
Another thing that was
completely remarkable was

00:36:38.405 --> 00:36:42.205
because it was yeast
it was relatively easy to find

00:36:42.205 --> 00:36:43.897
genes that were broken.

00:36:43.897 --> 00:36:46.159
Going back to
complementation,

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:48.478
leaving aside the
technicalities,

00:36:48.478 --> 00:36:51.875
if we had a mutant
that's a TS lethal and it's

00:36:51.875 --> 00:36:55.000
dead, if we put in a good copy
we'll know it

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
because the cell won't die at a
high temperature anymore.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.775
So, you can sort of see from
the first principle it was

00:37:02.775 --> 00:37:04.753
relatively
straightforward to find the

00:37:04.753 --> 00:37:06.887
genes in yeast that are
necessary for cell

00:37:06.887 --> 00:37:07.567
cycle control.

00:37:07.567 --> 00:37:10.331
The remarkable thing is that
they've been conserved all

00:37:10.331 --> 00:37:13.453
the way up to humans that the
proteins that are involved in

00:37:13.453 --> 00:37:14.998
the
cell cycle control are

00:37:14.998 --> 00:37:16.664
virtually identical in humans.

00:37:16.664 --> 00:37:17.899
So, the
system, again,

00:37:17.899 --> 00:37:20.664
is probably locked into place
because it works so well.

00:37:20.664 --> 00:37:23.599
And once it was working,
then evolution didn't have a

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:24.426
lot of
space.

00:37:24.426 --> 00:37:27.182
I won't say it's completely
identical in human cells,

00:37:27.182 --> 00:37:29.114
for
example, have a few more

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:31.000
wrinkles that they throw in.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.346
And fundamentally,
you can see evolutionarily that

00:37:35.346 --> 00:37:37.583
the system
evolved once.

00:37:37.583 --> 00:37:42.000
One thing I just want to
comment on, and here's just

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.385
an example of the sort of thing
that can happen if you get a

00:37:46.385 --> 00:37:50.161
problem with
pulling chromosomes apart when

00:37:50.161 --> 00:37:53.000
they're not ready,
or something

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.469
happens that make a break in a
chromosome.

00:37:56.469 --> 00:37:59.551
You will get a double
strand break,

00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:04.000
and cells don't like that,
and they try and fix it up.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.552
I think in this case,
you can see that chromosome 9

00:38:07.552 --> 00:38:10.891
has picked up a
piece of a couple of other

00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:11.842
chromosomes.

00:38:11.842 --> 00:38:15.597
This piece here came
from chromosome 8 over here,

00:38:15.597 --> 00:38:18.498
and this piece here came from
chromosome

00:38:18.498 --> 00:38:18.721
22.

00:38:18.721 --> 00:38:22.438
And so, this cell now has
things kind of messed up.

00:38:22.438 --> 00:38:25.143
And this
particular chromosome's got

00:38:25.143 --> 00:38:27.225
parts of two other chromosomes.

00:38:27.225 --> 00:38:30.872
And so, you
can start to think about the

00:38:30.872 --> 00:38:33.000
consequences of that.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.748
You'll see when you start
segregating chromosomes,

00:38:36.748 --> 00:38:38.153
there are
issues.

00:38:38.153 --> 00:38:41.635
And also, the junctions
themselves can sometimes do

00:38:41.635 --> 00:38:44.413
things
like creating fusion proteins

00:38:44.413 --> 00:38:46.998
that have aberrant properties,
for

00:38:46.998 --> 00:38:50.756
example, a signaling molecule
that's now locked permanently

00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:53.422
into the on
position or something like

00:38:53.422 --> 00:38:53.760
that.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.329
Those sorts of things can
happen by

00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:57.263
these as well.

00:38:57.263 --> 00:39:00.996
So, here's a very abbreviated
form, the principal that

00:39:00.996 --> 00:39:04.935
happens, or what happens so
that the chromosomes become

00:39:04.935 --> 00:39:07.114
visible
in the microscope.

00:39:07.114 --> 00:39:10.175
There is about a couple of
meters of

00:39:10.175 --> 00:39:11.946
DNA in every human cell.

00:39:11.946 --> 00:39:14.527
So, you can see almost from
first

00:39:14.527 --> 00:39:18.431
principles, it almost has to be
packaged in some way to fit in

00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:20.066
that
little, tiny area.

00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:23.231
And down at the basic level,
the DNA is looped

00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:26.402
around a little cluster of
proteins called histones.

00:39:26.402 --> 00:39:29.224
And then, as the
cells approach the mitotic

00:39:29.224 --> 00:39:31.938
stage, they package these and
higher, and

00:39:31.938 --> 00:39:35.323
higher, and higher levels of
packaging so that the

00:39:35.323 --> 00:39:38.006
chromosomes
get more and more compact,

00:39:38.006 --> 00:39:40.644
and therefore less like
spaghetti, and

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:45.000
less likely to get tangled when
they are pulled apart.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.537
Now, this teaching as part of
the course.

00:39:47.537 --> 00:39:48.615
It's in the book.

00:39:48.615 --> 00:39:50.646
It's a
little like glycolysis,

00:39:50.646 --> 00:39:52.710
though, and there's so much
detail.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.611
It's hard
to notice at all.

00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:57.750
And what I've tried to do here
is just sort of

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.541
take a step back,
focus you on the really big

00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:02.000
parts of the process.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.677
But you can see this is a sort
of typical textbook thing

00:40:05.677 --> 00:40:08.679
showing you
the various sub stages of this

00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:11.228
process that cytologists have
given

00:40:11.228 --> 00:40:13.034
names to each part of this.

00:40:13.034 --> 00:40:15.844
For example,
you can see the chromosomes

00:40:15.844 --> 00:40:19.900
lining up at the equatorial
phase just before they're going

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.355
to be
pulled apart.

00:40:21.355 --> 00:40:25.076
One little detail which I
glossed over at this point

00:40:25.076 --> 00:40:27.647
as you can see that the
chromosomes are,

00:40:27.647 --> 00:40:31.079
of course, surrounded by the
nuclear membrane.

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:33.936
And, at least in many cells,
what

00:40:33.936 --> 00:40:37.248
happens is just before the
chromosomes are going to be

00:40:37.248 --> 00:40:39.502
pulled
apart, this nuclear membrane in

00:40:39.502 --> 00:40:41.684
a matter of 20 or 30 seconds
goes from

00:40:41.684 --> 00:40:45.030
being a membrane into sort of
breaking into a whole little

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.513
series
of membrane sacs.

00:40:46.513 --> 00:40:49.434
And then, after the chromosomes
have pulled apart,

00:40:49.434 --> 00:40:53.309
now you reassemble the nuclear
membrane around each set of

00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:54.013
chromosomes.

00:40:54.013 --> 00:40:57.184
And I think there's still an
awful lot to be learned

00:40:57.184 --> 00:40:59.984
about how that particular trick
is done.

00:40:59.984 --> 00:41:02.430
And that's a
textbook diagram.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.250
These are the kinds of things
the

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.721
cytologists were looking at as
they were describing it.

00:41:08.721 --> 00:41:11.125
And one thing
you can certainly see,

00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:14.250
I think, is that there are a
lot of, if you want

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:17.955
to think of them as cables,
this whole process is done by

00:41:17.955 --> 00:41:19.411
molecular
machinery.

00:41:19.411 --> 00:41:21.860
And in fact,
one of the key things for

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.655
ensuring that the
chromosomes are all lined up is

00:41:25.655 --> 00:41:29.466
each are attached to each
pole of the cell.

00:41:29.466 --> 00:41:33.000
So, an individual chromosome
feels

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.913
tension on both sides,
and there's pretty good

00:41:36.913 --> 00:41:41.228
evidence at this point
that says that what has to

00:41:41.228 --> 00:41:45.000
happen before mitosis is allowed
to proceed

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.647
is that each duplicated
chromosome must feel the tension

00:41:49.647 --> 00:41:51.000
on both sides.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.338
And if one of them is only
attached on one side,

00:41:55.338 --> 00:41:58.517
it's not allowed
to go ahead.

00:41:58.517 --> 00:42:02.818
Here are a couple more
pictures.

00:42:02.818 --> 00:42:07.104
The chromosomes are in blue,
and all this cabling is in

00:42:07.104 --> 00:42:07.580
green.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.466
You can
see a molecular machine's

00:42:10.466 --> 00:42:11.916
basically at work.

00:42:11.916 --> 00:42:16.677
And I wanted to show you
this picture because this is

00:42:16.677 --> 00:42:17.600
important.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.140
There's two parts to
this.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.880
Julia, could you hit?

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.284
So, this is a normal mitosis.

00:42:24.284 --> 00:42:28.480
These are
in lung cells from a newt,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.000
which are very flat.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.960
So it's easy to visualize them.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.427
I believe this is by Nomarski,
a kind

00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:37.481
of optics called Nomarksi
optics.

00:42:37.481 --> 00:42:39.856
What they're doing,
the duplicated

00:42:39.856 --> 00:42:43.556
chromosomes are getting lined
up at the equatorial position in

00:42:43.556 --> 00:42:46.392
the cell,
and you get a spindle attached

00:42:46.392 --> 00:42:50.188
to one side, and then a spindle
attached to the other.

00:42:50.188 --> 00:42:53.139
And once that's happened,
then you can see

00:42:53.139 --> 00:42:54.182
the chromosomes.

00:42:54.182 --> 00:42:56.592
Watch this one over here,
for example.

00:42:56.592 --> 00:43:00.431
It just got
attached, and it's being pulled

00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:02.000
into the middle.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.110
And once the cells feel that
all the tension,

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:09.198
there's tension on all of
them, and then it enables the

00:43:09.198 --> 00:43:11.089
next stage of the process.

00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:13.900
And you will
see each of the daughter

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.907
chromatids segregate before.

00:43:15.907 --> 00:43:18.967
And, I just want
to impress upon you it's

00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:22.360
complicated enough just
replicating the DNA at

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.907
the fidelity we talked about.

00:43:24.907 --> 00:43:28.860
An awful lot of other stuff
has to go on.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.515
And it would be a reasonable
question: is there ever a

00:43:33.515 --> 00:43:34.000
mistake?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.787
And there is.

00:43:34.787 --> 00:43:37.476
This one actually
shows another cell where

00:43:37.476 --> 00:43:39.323
there's going to be a mistake.

00:43:39.323 --> 00:43:41.907
You can't
see it yet, but you can see the

00:43:41.907 --> 00:43:44.000
chromosomes are all condensed
up.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.028
And they are beginning to get
these spindles attached.

00:43:47.028 --> 00:43:49.714
And as they get
attached to the site then they

00:43:49.714 --> 00:43:52.000
get localized in the central
part right

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.208
down the equatorial plane of
the cell.

00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:59.179
But, I think you'll start to
see the problem emerging at the

00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:00.000
moment.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.942
I think it's going to be this
guy right here.

00:44:02.942 --> 00:44:06.781
I think a little arrow
will probably appear before too

00:44:06.781 --> 00:44:07.130
long.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.723
But what's happened is this
one didn't get properly

00:44:10.723 --> 00:44:12.283
connected on both sides.

00:44:12.283 --> 00:44:15.096
But, the cell's going
to go ahead anyway.

00:44:15.096 --> 00:44:15.492
Watch.

00:44:15.492 --> 00:44:18.460
The one up here is going to get
pulled in.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.396
There it goes.

00:44:19.396 --> 00:44:20.935
It's getting pulled in.

00:44:20.935 --> 00:44:24.949
And then, once it's in there,
then the cell is going to go

00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:26.554
ahead and divide anyway.

00:44:26.554 --> 00:44:29.522
So you can see
what the problem is.

00:44:29.522 --> 00:44:32.726
This one's got two over here,
and

00:44:32.726 --> 00:44:35.685
this one over here is missing
it.

00:44:35.685 --> 00:44:39.503
This process is known as
non-disjunction.

00:44:39.503 --> 00:44:43.635
This is the sort of thing that
happens in cancer

00:44:43.635 --> 00:44:47.914
cells that have broken,
where the checkpoint gene is

00:44:47.914 --> 00:44:48.501
broken.

00:44:48.501 --> 00:44:51.080
And
then, if you have that,

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.898
then the cells go on.

00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:57.345
The same problem
happens in meiosis,

00:44:57.345 --> 00:45:00.000
and it's up here.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.971
It's the same principle that if
you end up with,

00:45:03.971 --> 00:45:08.516
if you don't segregate
the cells, the chromosomes

00:45:08.516 --> 00:45:12.000
correctly, then you can end up
with

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.970
a sex cell that has two copies
of one of them.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.434
And the other one has
none.

00:45:18.434 --> 00:45:22.000
And if you have two copies,
or 2N plus 1N,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.882
then you end up with
a trisomy.

00:45:24.882 --> 00:45:30.000
And if you have zero plus N,
you end up with what's known

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.742
as a monosomy.

00:45:31.742 --> 00:45:36.222
So, these would be from defects
in

00:45:36.222 --> 00:45:36.938
meiosis.

00:45:36.938 --> 00:45:42.666
I'll just close by saying the
one that you probably have heard

00:45:42.666 --> 00:45:46.730
of is Down's Syndrome which is
trisomy 21.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:51.129
That comes about from
this sort of process.

00:45:51.129 --> 00:45:55.554
It's a very debilitating
genetic deficiency.

00:45:55.554 --> 00:45:59.683
Most of you are probably
familiar with it.

00:45:59.683 --> 00:46:02.000
This process happens.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.528
Things go wrong at meiosis,
about one in every fifth

00:46:05.528 --> 00:46:08.344
detectable
human pregnancy doesn't go to

00:46:08.344 --> 00:46:10.856
completion for the most part
because

00:46:10.856 --> 00:46:14.828
of an underlying problem like
this, that the body is set up to

00:46:14.828 --> 00:46:17.118
need
the pairs of each chromosome.

00:46:17.118 --> 00:46:19.711
If you have one too many or one
too few

00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:21.014
it's usually lethal.

00:46:21.014 --> 00:46:24.139
So, if one in every five human
pregnancies has

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:27.138
that happened,
you end up with a miscarriage.

00:46:27.138 --> 00:46:30.078
My wife and I have
been through it.

00:46:30.078 --> 00:46:33.000
It's a devastating experience.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.985
I think you can just look
around and figure the odds.

00:46:35.985 --> 00:46:38.443
A significant
number of the people in this

00:46:38.443 --> 00:46:40.807
room are going to have to cope
with this.

00:46:40.807 --> 00:46:44.411
And I'm just bringing this up
for your attention right now is

00:46:44.411 --> 00:46:46.427
it
something that in our society

00:46:46.427 --> 00:46:48.615
we tend not to talk about very
much

00:46:48.615 --> 00:46:52.175
unless maybe you're a Hollywood
movie star and it makes it into

00:46:52.175 --> 00:46:53.783
the
tabloids or something.

00:46:53.783 --> 00:46:56.423
But it's a very common human
experience, and

00:46:56.423 --> 00:46:58.132
very difficult to cope with.

00:46:58.132 --> 00:47:00.329
But there it is,
for most of those

00:47:00.329 --> 00:47:03.775
pregnancies that terminate very
early, usually the underlying

00:47:03.775 --> 00:47:05.876
cause
is a problem that traces back

00:47:05.876 --> 00:47:08.141
to the kind of stuff we see here
where

00:47:08.141 --> 00:47:11.691
something went wrong during the
segregation process of making

00:47:11.691 --> 00:47:12.941
the
sex cells.

00:47:12.941 --> 00:47:16.250
And as I say,
if it happens in just

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.849
our ordinary cells,
that's one of the thinks that

00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:22.430
leads the
progression to cancer.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.563
OK, so I'll see you on
Wednesday.
