seeing that new mode of production
 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.670
seeing that new mode of production
caused me to think that she you know

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680
caused me to think that she you know
 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.690
caused me to think that she you know
this this shouldn't stop with just

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700
this this shouldn't stop with just
 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.859
this this shouldn't stop with just
programming that we can build all kinds

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
programming that we can build all kinds

of other things so the encyclopedia was

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
of other things so the encyclopedia was
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660
of other things so the encyclopedia was
the first project and now the rest of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
the first project and now the rest of
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.249
the first project and now the rest of
the library and search engine and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
the library and search engine and
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.889
the library and search engine and
everything else trying to really push

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
everything else trying to really push
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.510
everything else trying to really push
that whole idea forward

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520
 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520
so the wikimedia foundation of course is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
so the wikimedia foundation of course is
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.229
so the wikimedia foundation of course is
the nonprofit organization that I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
the nonprofit organization that I
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.160
the nonprofit organization that I
founded runs wikipedia and lectionary

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
founded runs wikipedia and lectionary
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.540
founded runs wikipedia and lectionary
and all of the other nonprofit sites I

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550
and all of the other nonprofit sites I
 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.699
and all of the other nonprofit sites I
think the main my main focus for where I

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709
think the main my main focus for where I
 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.550
think the main my main focus for where I
think we'll go in the future is focused

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
think we'll go in the future is focused
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.440
think we'll go in the future is focused

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
on the languages of the developing world
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.470
on the languages of the developing world
so right now we're really really strong

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
so right now we're really really strong
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.630

strong in Japanese Chinese but we're not
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.059
strong in Japanese Chinese but we're not
so strong in the languages of Africa the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069
so strong in the languages of Africa the
 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.190
so strong in the languages of Africa the
languages of India but those are all

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
languages of India but those are all
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.259
languages of India but those are all
coming and that's really an increasing

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269
coming and that's really an increasing
 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.800
coming and that's really an increasing
focus of my interest in my work is to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810
focus of my interest in my work is to
 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.500
focus of my interest in my work is to
try to see what I can do to help promote

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
try to see what I can do to help promote
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.140
try to see what I can do to help promote
and get things going and get get some

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
and get things going and get get some
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.430
and get things going and get get some
excitement going in that part of the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
excitement going in that part of the
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.319
excitement going in that part of the
world I think one of the things that is

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
world I think one of the things that is
 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.900
world I think one of the things that is
we know one of the impacts here is that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
we know one of the impacts here is that
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.379
we know one of the impacts here is that
we have a much higher degree of informal

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389
we have a much higher degree of informal
 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.390
we have a much higher degree of informal
learning than we used to have that's not

about I don't know albania and you might

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
about I don't know albania and you might
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.690
about I don't know albania and you might
think albania barely barely know

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
think albania barely barely know
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.039
think albania barely barely know
anything about it and i don't know the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049
anything about it and i don't know the
 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.470
anything about it and i don't know the
history I should go to the library and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480
history I should go to the library and
 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.059
history I should go to the library and
look that up but I mean frankly nobody

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069
look that up but I mean frankly nobody
 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.440
look that up but I mean frankly nobody
ever much went to the library to look

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
ever much went to the library to look
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.030
ever much went to the library to look
things up it was you know that's quite a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
things up it was you know that's quite a
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.410
things up it was you know that's quite a
journey you have to put aside a lot of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420
journey you have to put aside a lot of
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.140
journey you have to put aside a lot of
your energy to go and do something like

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
your energy to go and do something like
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.879
your energy to go and do something like
that whereas now when somebody wonders

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889
that whereas now when somebody wonders
 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.710
that whereas now when somebody wonders
about Albania they just type Albania

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
about Albania they just type Albania
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.110
about Albania they just type Albania
into a search engine they get typically

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120
into a search engine they get typically
 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.089
into a search engine they get typically
the Wikipedia article they get a nice

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099
the Wikipedia article they get a nice
 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.009
the Wikipedia article they get a nice
basic history and background and they

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019
basic history and background and they
 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.050
basic history and background and they
can really dig very deep if they want to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060
can really dig very deep if they want to
 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.449
can really dig very deep if they want to
follow the sources and you can learn a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459
follow the sources and you can learn a
 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.789
follow the sources and you can learn a
lot all that kind of learning I think

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799
lot all that kind of learning I think
 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.920
lot all that kind of learning I think
helps people to become you know better

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
helps people to become you know better
 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.289
helps people to become you know better
citizens better decision makers in their

citizens better decision makers in their
own lives sometimes its political but

own lives sometimes its political but
 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.580
own lives sometimes its political but
sometimes it's personal decisions that
