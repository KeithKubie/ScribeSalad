1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,460
The Joe Rogan experience.
Oh,

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:06,720
you sober up and then they become
annoying and then they want to talk about

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,050
their sobriety.
I cannot stand,

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,750
can't say I'm recovering
addicts. They dropped me. Yeah,

5
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:17,580
man. They're worse than
people who just find yoga.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,970
They just won't shut the fuck
up about recovery. Yeah. I, I'm,

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,560
I'm guilty of that with many things.
If I get into something,

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,250
I can't shut the fuck up about
it, but I get it, you know,

9
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:32,220
for them it's like this pivotal moment
in their life where all of a sudden they

10
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:35,220
have their shit together and they
just want to talk about all the time.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,580
The thing that drives me nuts
though is when they judge, yes.

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,220
They always get a little judgey
that like, are you sure? Like,

13
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:45,420
do you need that last drink? And I'm
like, yeah, I do and I can handle my shit.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,530
So maybe alone. Hey, I'm super sorry.
You got that fucked up gene. Yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,540
Whatever it is. You went too far with
it. But I've got it under control.

16
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,760
I like being a little buzzed like it.
And luckily the drugs in the,

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,940
in the drinking that I do, it's a,
you know, I, if I'm going to drink,

18
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:03,270
I drink high quality stuff,
uh, smoke a little weed,

19
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,210
but the other drugs don't really do it
for me to have you fucked with the other

20
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:09,960
drugs. What do we tried? Just about
everything. And it just like, not for me.

21
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,750
Like I've done cocaine and the next
day been like, I just feel stupid.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,630
Like I feel like everything that came
into my mouth last night was dumb.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,870
I feel like hell. Uh, I
enjoy, we'd chills me out a,

24
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,250
I like beer and wine and, and
uh, and vodka and whiskey.

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,810
I have not done a lot of things.
I've never done masculine
or pod. Just basically,

26
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:31,920
I think they're pretty much the same
thing. I've never done, um, coke.

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,680
I've never done meth.
I've never done any real in Pheta means.

28
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,050
I've been always been
scared of those though,

29
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,350
because those are the ones that I've
seen people like really lose their lives

30
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:44,770
for. Yes. And I don't mess with them. Fed
means at all and I don't enjoy it. Uh,

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,510
as someone who grinds their teeth,
you know, like that's, that's awful.

32
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,740
And I found like with comedy,
you can't be funny on cocaine

33
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,800
at comics who do do who do
cocaine and our flight. Yeah.

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,910
Because I just find it to be like,
you're not,

35
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,680
I can't laugh at anything
and I can't, like I'm talking
too fast. My timing's off.

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,440
Uh, and like, I'm not
thinking in a funny way,

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,320
but I've always been surprised to
comics who have coke problems. Yeah.

38
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:14,460
Joey Diaz talked about that, cause Joey
Diaz did coke for years, but he doesn't,

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,800
he's never done coke. And Gannon
said, she goes, I, he goes,

40
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:20,580
every time I tried it I was
fucking terrible. He goes,
it takes away your soul,

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,990
your heart. You've got no heart when
you up there. Yeah. You know, the,

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,610
I guess again, I've never done
it, but uh, what I get is just,

43
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,470
I get that whole speedy thing
where you just like your,

44
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:38,190
your sense of how people are perceiving
you as distorted timing is distorted.

45
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,030
Yeah. They got, I don't even go on stage
high. Oh Man, I have a couple of beers.

46
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't want to be slurring. What if
I'd been smoking pot at all that day?

47
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,840
It's a worst show for it. Really? Yeah.
I wonder why that is. I think I'm just,

48
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,740
I'm just in my own head,
you know, and make,

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,330
it makes me want to get through the set
as opposed to being present and enjoying

50
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,780
it. Like I just want it to be over
so I can go chill out. You know?

51
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,400
I just interested in that
only on only with weed.

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,130
One of my favorite things to do when
I would take guys in the room with me,

53
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:07,270
he's get them so high that they could
barely talk and then put them on stage.

54
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,440
That's what I do. The first, the first
two guys I would open for on the road,

55
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,910
it was a Doug Benson and Brian
Posehn, Jesus Christ. They were like,

56
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,730
they wanted to smoke
all day that I was like,

57
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,030
every time I was a feature act like little
most every time I was a feature act,

58
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,870
I was terrible because I thought like,
I have to smoke. I've got this book.

59
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,400
These guys are,
they won't take me on the road,

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,790
but I'm like barely getting through
this half hour and I'm terrible.

61
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,410
It's not a smart move for someone who's
just getting going to be that high on

62
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:40,360
stage. But one time I did, I was, uh, I,
I really didn't smoke pot until I was 30,

63
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,990
like really smoke pot. But I did it a
handful of times when I was younger.

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,890
And one time when I was like a 21,

65
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,970
I was living with my buddy
Jimmy. And uh, him and his,

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,350
one of his friends came over and he had
pot and we smoked some pot during the

67
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,730
day.
I think we had a barbecue or something.

68
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,170
And then I had a gig like six hours later
I was still high and I remember being

69
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,640
on stage and,

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,840
and my timing was excellent and I was
so locked in and focused and I remember

71
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,970
being terrified that I was
going to be terrible. Terrified,

72
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:17,380
but I really nailed it for whatever
reason. But then I never did it again.

73
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,200
And I was like, Whoa, I
got away with it, you know?

74
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,260
And then I started smoking when I
was 30 and it Kinda changed my act.

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,790
Like it made my act from like,
it made my act more introspective.

76
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,490
I started talking about weird or subjects
and more interesting thing I thought I

77
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,030
started talking about things that
I was actually more interested in.

78
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,470
Did you start to write on stage more
when you were high on stage? Yeah,

79
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:45,850
I kind of always have written on
stage a little bit, but mostly, um,

80
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,010
mostly like tangents.

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,790
Like I'd go off on a weird branch if I
knew how to get back to the river, right.

82
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,010
Oh,
take like a weird stream off to the right.

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,210
And then just long as I knew how to get
back to the river of whatever the fuck I

84
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,900
was talking about, I'd be
fine. But when I'm high,

85
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,560
I'll just let go wandering
through the woods. Like I'm not,

86
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:07,930
I'm not even concerned about the
river. I'm like, you know, there,

87
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,350
there's the river of thought,
the pattern that you're following.

88
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,070
But when I'm high, I'm like, what?
Who the fuck wants that and why?

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,570
Why would you be that person?

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,630
And then I started thinking
like I remember when I was
a kid and then I'll just

91
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:24,580
like out of nowhere have this idea and
I'm hoping it's going to go somewhere.

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,430
And those moments I feel
like they're like, it's like

93
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,870
foraging for food.
Like occasionally you find it,

94
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,360
like if you go out looking for mushrooms,
you don't know where they are.

95
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,270
You might find edible mushrooms.
Hopefully you're going to find them.

96
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,150
Sometimes you won't. Sometimes you
come home with an empty basket,

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,380
but sometimes you get them and the only
way you find out is if your forage,

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,310
and that's kind of what it feels like
when I'm high on stage. It's like, okay,

99
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,860
but then I'm also really worried
that I'm going to be boring.

100
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,210
Like I want to beat,
I know these people paid to see.

101
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,270
I know I'm trying to develop material,

102
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,580
but I also know I'm entertaining
these people in the present.

103
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,230
So it's like a fine line.
