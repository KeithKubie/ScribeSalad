MIKE FOX: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.690
I'm Mike Fox from the developer
marketing team.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.830
It's my pleasure to introduce
today's speaker.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.480
I met Michael Mace when we both
worked at Apple, and he

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.290
was the director of competitive
analysis, and that

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.530
was prior to him leading the Mac
platform marketing group.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.740
After he left Apple, he came to
Silicon Graphics, so this

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.790
campus is pretty familiar
to him.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.190
Since then, he's worked in a
number of companies, including

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.010
at Palm, where he was the vice
president of product planning

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.050
and chief competitive officer.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.320
He's consulted for a number of
companies throughout Silicon

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.940
Valley and the tech industry,
and he's currently the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.520
co-founder of [INAUDIBLE] and
a mobile strategist at

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.198
usertesting.com.

00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:45.980
Now, he shared his deep
experience in product and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.250
business strategy in a hands
on business strategy guide

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.360
called "Map the Future,"
which he's going to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.030
talk a bit about today.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.280
It's currently available on
Amazon and a number of other

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.110
marketplaces, but hopefully, you
guys can help me get him

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.910
on Google Play when we're
done, as it is an ebook.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.810
Now, because the book covers a
wide breadth of topics, he

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.200
offered to focus on an area
that should be really

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.230
interesting to Googlers, which
is how different companies'

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.430
attitudes towards the future
impacts the effectiveness of

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.860
the strategies they
create and follow.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.660
So please join me in
giving a big Google

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.980
welcome to Michael Mace.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.410
MICHAEL MACE: Well, thank you
very much, and it's very, very

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.320
cool to be here.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.290
I'm really excited about it.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.290
So I'm going to try to cover a
lot of ground in a relatively

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.650
short period of time.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.740
So let me address how we'll deal
with questions right up

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.270
at the start.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910
So there are two types of
questions-- questions of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.540
clarity, like I don't understand
what you're saying,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.450
or could you give me a little
more detail on that?

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.820
Chances are if I've confused
one of you, I've probably

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.590
confused many of you
in the room.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.510
So if you have that sort of
question, wave your hand,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.780
throw something, whatever's
necessary to get my attention,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.350
but please ask it right away.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.480
The second type of question is
questions of discussion, like,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.370
oh, I want to add an interesting
anecdote related

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.330
to that point, or, I think
you're an idiot, and I'd like

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.430
to explain why.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm completely up for having
that sort of discussion, but I

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.540
want to do those at the end so
that you can see the sum of my

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.670
information.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.110
So if you're confused, though,
please ask stuff right away as

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.500
we go along.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.940
So before I get into telling
you the content, let me

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.690
summarize what I'm going
to talk about today.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.190
So we as an industry and as a
society are usually, in my

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.520
opinion, wrong when we try to
think about the future.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.710
And I'll give you some examples
on why I say that.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.250
And the reason is because
we think about it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.320
in the wrong way.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.410
We either try to control the
future, especially in terms of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.580
businesses and doing business
planning-- we either try to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.560
control the future through
incredible vision that we

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.500
have, and we're just going to
impose our vision for the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.970
future on customers and on the
marketplace, or we try to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.600
analyze our way through
the future.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.760
It's like, let me see if I can
figure it out in enough detail

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.610
that I'll be able to tell
exactly what's going to happen

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.420
in the future, and then
we'll just react to

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.770
whatever's going to go on.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.260
Both of those perspectives end
up having big vulnerabilities.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.510
To get it right, to do a better
job of looking at the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.870
future, you need to be able to
mix a couple of different

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.660
perspectives and different
thinking styles.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.790
So specifically, you've got to
get specialized information on

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.050
customers, and competitors,
and advanced technologies.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.070
And second, you've got to
be able to tap into both

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.180
intuitive and analytical ways
of looking at information.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.000
And so I'm going to talk today
about the background behind

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.560
that, how you get it right, and
kind of give you a general

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.190
framework around this.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.970
So you already heard the
background on me.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.300
I've been in the industry for
quite a while, and I've done a

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.990
bunch of things.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.530
And once you've been in the
industry, you start picking up

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.770
on trends that you see--
repeated things.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.780
And I'm sure some of you guys
have experienced this as well,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.670
where you start thinking,
gee, wasn't that tried

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.470
before and it failed?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.240
Why in the world are they
doing that again?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.130
Or, gee, that's not supposed
to work, but it actually

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.810
worked this time.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.860
What in the world was
going on with that?

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.000
And so I kind of had the
same experience.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.660
And one of the things that I've
seen over and over and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.800
over again is that-- forgive my
language-- but we suck at

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.830
predicting the future.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.890
I mean, we just do
a terrible job.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.910
And to give you an example of
that, I'm going to pick on a

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.150
book, which is actually
a really good book.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.980
This is one of the bestselling
business books of the 1990s.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.760
It's called "Competing for the
Future." If any of you have

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.339
ever done business classes in
college, they force you to

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.209
read this one, most likely.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.880
And it's not at all a bad
book, but it's really

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.570
emblematic of the problems
we have about

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.340
thinking about the future.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.470
And so if you read the book,
it starts off with some

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.460
predictions about things that
are about to happen.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.890
So they said, we're standing on
the verge of these great,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.000
entirely new industries
that are about to

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.620
revolutionize our lives.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.540
And it's one of those throwaway
introductions where

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.230
they're saying things that
everybody believes is

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.840
completely true, just in order
to set up the idea that it's

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.770
important to be ready
to change.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.050
And the interesting thing
is they made these nine

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.350
predictions in 1994 about stuff
that was imminent back

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.900
in the mid-1990s, and it's
really interesting to look

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.210
back and see what happened with
those predictions that

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.210
everybody thought
were completely

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.060
obvious at the time.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.490
So I want to go through those.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.590
So number one, miniature robots
built from atomic

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.370
particles that could unclog
sclerotic arteries.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.240
So you can understand where
people would get these ideas.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.550
There's an old science fiction
book called "Fantastic Voyage"

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.450
by Isaac Asimov.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.480
It's still a good read today.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.000
There was a movie done with
Raquel Welch swimming through

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.170
the bloodstream.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.780
But anyway, the idea of if you
could just somehow miniaturize

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.180
and take tiny lasers into the
body and zap cancer or heart

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.010
blockages or things like that,
it seems really intuitive that

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.890
you ought to be able to do it.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.620
And it seemed like it was
imminent in the mid-1990s.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.080
But you go forward about 19
years, and you look today, and

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.230
the closest we've got
is this thing.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.310
So this is a camera pill.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.750
It's about the size of the end
of my finger, so it's not

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.350
particularly easy to swallow.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.440
But the idea is that you swallow
it, and then it will

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.380
do a virtual colonoscopy as it
moves through your digestive

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.770
tract by taking pictures.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.210
But as it turns out, it doesn't
actually do as good as

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.980
a real colonoscopy, according to
most of the stuff that I've

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.520
read, and that's about the
closest that we've gotten to

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.900
this stuff.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.960
So we are still way, way far
away from being able to inject

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.420
robots in your bloodstream that
would go and be able to

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.410
fix things inside the body.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.040
Second one, telephone switches
and other devices that will

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.640
provide real time translation
between people conversing in

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.340
different languages.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.940
So we made a lot of progress
on this one, but remember,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.050
what they're predicting here
is real time translation

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.420
between people of completely
different cultures and

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.250
languages as they're talking,
like if you met somebody on a

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.790
train or something like that.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.050
And the translation is not up
to that point even today.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.160
We're getting closer to it, but
you can't really do real

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.750
time continuous translation,
and that's what this was

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.810
predicting that we were on the
verge of 20 years ago.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.210
Third, digital highways into
the home that will offer

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.330
instant access to the world's
store of knowledge and

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.940
entertainment.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.810
That actually happened.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.850
So they got this one
exactly right on.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.720
And this is what a successful
prediction looks like as you

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.060
look back at it and you go,
wow, they really kind of

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.700
nailed that thing.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.830
Fourth, urban underground
automated distribution systems

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.090
that will reduce traffic
congestion.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.120
I don't know what they were
thinking about there.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.710
Is it supposed to be pneumatic
tubes, or something like that?

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.740
I'm not sure.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.090
They said it was imminent
back then.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.200
I still don't even understand
what the projection was

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.070
supposed to be.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.460
Next one, virtual meeting rooms
that will save people

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.470
the wear and tear
of air travel.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.880
So this one is interesting,
because it was right and wrong

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.010
at the same time.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.160
We've definitely gotten a
lot of progress on video

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.080
conferencing.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.120
However, it hasn't been
used the way they

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.520
expected it to be.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.040
So air travel has continued to
go up dramatically, even as

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.380
we've been installing
all of these video

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.460
conferencing systems.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.290
And the reason is most business
travel, which is what

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.020
they were talking about, is done
to do one of two things.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.510
It's either to go to
conferences, or it's to sell.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.760
Both of those things you
have to do in person.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.975
It's really hard to close a
sales deal with somebody when

00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:48.015
you don't even bother to go
into their office and take

00:07:48.015 --> 00:07:49.690
them out to drink afterwards.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.290
What has happened, though, is
we've used videoconferencing

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.020
in a very different way to make
it possible to set up

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.020
these distributed groups that
work together on projects much

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.830
more easily than you
can do in the past.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.430
And I've seen that myself.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.700
The software startup that I'm
working on, we're distributed

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.035
all over the valley, but we get
together regularly over

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:09.760
Skype, and it's just whenever
we need to talk, we can just

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.070
get together immediately.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.930
Forget about commuting.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.700
We don't have to mess
with that stuff.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.890
So they were right about the
technology, but they were

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.550
wrong about the way the market
was going to use it.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.330
Next one, biomimetic materials
that will duplicate the

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.800
wondrous properties
of materials found

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.290
in the living room.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.290
So National Geographic wrote
about this a couple years ago,

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.820
and they said most practitioners
conclude their

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.520
enthusiastic discourses on their
bio-inspired invention

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.080
with a few halfhearted theories
on how it may someday

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.679
make its way into
the real world.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.940
Often, it sounds like
wishful thinking.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.429
OK, so something that seemed
imminent back then, seems

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.970
imminent today, but is not
actually traversing into the

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.340
marketplace.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.490
Satellite based personal
communicators that will allow

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.420
you to phone home from anywhere
on the planet.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.310
So those do exist today.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.520
However, compared
to cell phones,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.200
there are some problems.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.790
The phone is three times the
weight, the cost of a call is

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.520
$1.00 a minute, and the phone
costs $1,000 unsubsidized.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.010
So the economics of this one
haven't worked out the way

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.660
that they were expecting.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.430
Next, machines capable
of emotion,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.650
inference, and learning.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.650
I don't even know how you make
a machine feel emotion.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.600
I'm not sure we understand how
emotion even works in human

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.290
beings, so this one does
not feel imminent.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.210
And then, finally,
bioremediation.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.370
So custom designed organisms
that will help clean up the

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.230
Earth's environment.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.180
We actually do bioremediation
today with organisms.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.820
However, they are naturally
evolved organization organisms

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.600
that we've gone out and found.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.610
The amount of bioremediation
being done by genetically

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.860
tailored organisms is extremely
tiny, and it's still

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.950
experimental.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.510
And by the way, that old style
bioremediation was already

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.180
being done in 1994, so
basically, the field hasn't

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.040
changed that much in terms of
fundamental technology.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.380
So you add all these things
together, and they probably

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.280
got about two out of the
nine predictions right.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.410
So about 22%.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.340
Now, you might look at that and
say, well, that's not too

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.340
bad as a batting average.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.270
It's hard to predict the future,
and at least they got

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:56.870
some of them right.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.440
It was provocative thoughts,
which is kind of OK if you're

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.210
writing a book, but if you're
running a business, it's a

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.850
much bigger problem, because a
business can't go-- unless

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.500
it's Google--

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.030
and invest in all nine
of those fields.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.230
In most cases, and even for
Google, you guys, if you're

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.290
really going to make an
investment, you've got to

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.720
focus down and put a
lot of effort but

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.420
behind a couple of things.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.170
And if you're a business and
you go bet on one of those

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.740
nine predictions, chances are
you're going to be wrong, and

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.650
you're going to tank
the company.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.490
And I put a little picture
up here that I think is

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.260
emblematic of that.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.430
Anybody want to guess at what
that's a picture of, that

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.380
thing there?

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.540
So it's obviously a satellite,
but do you know

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.730
what sort of satellite?

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.130
AUDIENCE: Iridium?

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.260
MICHAEL MACE: Iridium.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.510
Oh, very, very good.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.650
OK, that is in iridium satellite
paid for by Motorola

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.630
to tune of about $2.6 billion.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.580
And Wired celebrated it by
calling that product Edsels in

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.780
the sky, and it was one of the
factors that led to part of

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.340
Motorola ending up being a part
of Google today, because

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.560
the company wasn't able
to sustain itself.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.560
So the consequences when a
company takes a flyer on one

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.230
of these predictions can
be incredibly severe.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.160
And we need to do a better
job if we're going to be

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.330
successful as businesses.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.260
So the question you want to ask,
then, is why is it that

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.500
we get these predictions
wrong so often?

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.930
And this is another observation
that I've gotten

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.010
into after watching companies
in the Valley and in

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.900
technology in general for
a long time is that most

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.740
companies tend to fall into one
of two buckets in terms of

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.390
how they think about
the future and how

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.230
they look at it.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.300
And I've labeled those visionary
companies and

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.940
analytical companies.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.150
So visionary companies are
companies usually led by a

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.820
relatively charismatic leader
who has an idea about what's

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.800
going to happen, and come hell
or high water, everybody in

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.690
the company is going to work in
support of that vision, and

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.750
we're all going to just go do
it, and we'll make it happen,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.050
and I don't really care what
anybody says about whether or

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.610
not it's possible.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.320
Analytical companies are kind
of the opposite extreme.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.920
What they do is they tend to
try to use careful market

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.150
research, other sorts of
analysis, to figure out

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.780
exactly what the future is going
to look like, almost

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.010
like a weather report.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.310
And then you just plan for the
future weather that you're

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.010
expecting to have happen.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.900
So examples of these two
types of companies.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.770
The one that people always
talk about for visionary

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.980
companies is Apple
under Steve Jobs.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.030
Visionary leader, decided what
was going to happen, everybody

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.990
went and worked on it.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.540
It didn't matter if
you objected.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.000
You could go work
someplace else.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.560
And they were just going to go
implement on that stuff.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.110
I think Amazon, you can make a
very good argument that they

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.320
tend to operate much the same
way when they place some of

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.960
the big bets that they make.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.980
But there are others that
haven't been as successful.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.480
I spent about six years at Palm
and PalmSource, and that

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.350
was a visionary leader led
company that kind of ran out

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.610
of vision over time and got into
some serious problems.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.270
And I'll talk about the types of
problems you can get there.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.380
You also get a lot of companies
that sound wonderful

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.850
at the time, and they actually
tend to enter our mythology of

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.140
great companies that people
get nostalgic about, but

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.440
they're financial disasters.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.950
And that's stuff like DeLorean--
you know, the

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.420
DeLorean Motor Vehicle
Company--

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.910
or my personal favorite, the
Roton Rotary Rocket.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.110
Anybody ever hear
about this one?

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.320
So it goes up like a rocket,
comes down from space like a

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.270
helicopter.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.080
And they actually got to the
point where they did a couple

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.680
of flight tests before they
completely ran out of money.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.280
And still, though, it was
a beautiful, beautiful

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.530
technological idea.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.940
So the rate of failure in these
visionary companies is

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.000
actually really, really high.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.840
The ones that succeed are
really successful.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.120
But far more often,
you get failures.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.870
The second one is analytical
companies, and these tend not

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.550
to be as celebrated in our
culture, I guess because the

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.130
idea is that a visionary is
good, and analytical is kind

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.590
of wimpy, or something
like that.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.710
But actually, a lot of these
are the most successful

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.980
companies in the economy.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.390
So I'd argue GE is a
great example of

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.550
an analytical company.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.530
Samsung, the other big consumer
electronics companies

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.490
in Asia are almost all
analytical fast followers.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.120
They watch what happens
in the marketplace.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.030
They respond very quickly to
changes, and they follow

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.460
behind the leadership that
other people are doing.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.760
Very successful business
model.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.470
When it's done right, they're

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.170
fabulously successful companies.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.920
As visionary companies get
older, they tend to eventually

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.110
convert into analytical
companies once the leaders

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.010
aren't there anymore.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.040
So that's like IBM, HP, classic
case of a company

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.670
that's very, very analytical,
and actually

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.890
very cautious today.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.960
Adobe's another really, really
good example of that.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.570
So it's not that visionary
or analytical are

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:18.480
either better or worse.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.960
It's just that each of those
types of companies has some

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.410
strengths and some weaknesses
that you need to be aware of,

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.760
and they both have
vulnerabilities when they're

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.160
thinking about the future.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.970
So strengths of the analytical
companies.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.830
As I mentioned, very, very good
at responding to market

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.880
changes, because they're always

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.650
monitoring for those things.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.360
They do a great job on cost
effectiveness and efficiency

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.410
and things like that.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.840
And if you put them in a
predictable industry where

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.000
change is something that's
relatively easy to anticipate,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.480
they can be totally relentless
at just running down whoever

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.930
the leader is and just chewing
them apart financially.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.640
The weaknesses are, first of
all, these companies tend to

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.230
be vulnerable to group think.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.880
If you are always scanning the
marketplace, saying, what are

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.290
the newest trends?

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.700
What are people talking about?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.840
What are the things that are
going to come along?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.440
It's very, very easy to get
co-opted by whatever is the

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.250
hot topic that people
happen to be talking

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.580
about in the industry.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.900
And this happens especially
frequently now that we're

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.170
online, where the online
discussions tend to turn into

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.230
this echo chamber where we're
just trading the same opinions

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.300
back and forth with each
other all the time.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.980
And you get to a point where it
seems like, well, everybody

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.000
is saying this, so
it must be true.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.740
Like, everybody says that
tablets are a sucky business

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.090
to be in, and that we've tried
it for 20 years, and so

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.030
therefore, it's a dumb idea
to invest in tablets.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.970
So of course it's stupid to try
to do a tablet computer.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.285
Until somebody who was a little
more visionary managed

00:15:38.285 --> 00:15:39.800
to do it right.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.720
The second thing these companies
do is because

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.820
they're always looking at
logical analysis of

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.660
information, it's always
possible to get more detailed

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.700
information about your short
term problems and your short

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.100
term needs than it is
to get information--

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.650
really tangible information--

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.440
about long term opportunities.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.340
So what they do naturally is
they tend to focus down on,

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.640
oh, we've got a problem in the
medical market, and we need to

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.300
fix our sales channel there.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.200
And that can produce an extra
$100 million in revenue over

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.230
the next two years.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.520
Let's put 100 people working on
fixing that sales channel.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.130
As opposed to, well, there's
this idea on something that

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.350
might be a $10 billion business
five years from now,

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.900
but we're not really sure, and
it's really kind of nebulous.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.490
If you're an analytical company,
you'll just naturally

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.430
weight the area where you have
more information, even though

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.160
it's lower return, and it's
more incremental, over the

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.540
stuff that's more nebulous and
further out, because it just

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.480
doesn't feel as real, and
you're trying to be

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.460
responsible and analytical
about this stuff.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.320
It's very hard for these
companies to differentiate,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.450
because, again, they tend to get
co-opted by the consensus.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.740
And so what they do is they
produce the same things that

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.560
everybody else is doing,
but just with a

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.380
little tweak on it.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.330
Oh, we'll add a little bit
of our special sauce, or

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.780
something like that, and in the
end, the sauce ends up not

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.160
being as special as you
might expect it to be.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.640
They also get what I tend
to call mission drift.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.850
And this is especially
challenging for Agile based

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.140
software firms in the
tech industry.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.140
Well, what happens is, Agile
is absolutely wonderful.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.980
I mean, I buy into it.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.300
It's a much better way to do
software, especially when

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.359
you're online, than the stuff
that we used to use when I was

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.010
starting my career.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.000
However, Agile teams sometimes
can shift away from doing

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.040
Agile implementation.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.869
In other words, let's try
doing it this way.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.060
Does that go well
with customers?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.250
No?

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.520
Let's try something slightly
different.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.050
Let's iterate really quickly
and run a bunch of

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.140
experiments.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.609
To where they start doing that
same sort of experimentation

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.599
with what their fundamental
mission is.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.740
In other words, well, it's not
selling quite as well as we

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.130
thought, so let's try focusing
on a different type of

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.900
customer, or a different
value proposition, or

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.610
something like that.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.940
Let's just redirect.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.383
And the VCs even feed into this
when they say, pivot!

00:17:37.383 --> 00:17:38.720
You've gotta pivot!

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.860
Be ready to pivot!

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.480
Well, the problem is if you
pivot too much, you end up not

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.050
pursuing any particular
target.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.720
Instead, you're pursuing
whatever's the hot thing in

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.430
the tech industry discussions
these days, and it's, oh, I've

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.685
got to be in online service, or
I've got to go do this, or

00:17:52.685 --> 00:17:54.190
I've got to do this
other thing.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.920
When I was at Palm, the big
trendy thing was everybody was

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.490
supposed to be an online
destination community like

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.880
AOL, because AOL was
hot at the time.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.400
And so everybody was trying to
go re-duplicate that, and so

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.910
we were all going and building
these online destinations.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.960
Turned out none of them turned
out to be very useful for

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.440
anybody, and as a result, a lot
of people wasted a huge

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.980
amount of money.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.745
That's very typical of what can
happen in this situation

00:18:15.745 --> 00:18:18.260
with mission drift
for projects.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.410
OK, strengths of visionary
companies.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.160
Very, very focused,
and very decisive.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.800
Again, usually, you have a
charismatic CEO who will fire

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.630
anyone who disagrees.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.730
So it's really easy
to stay focused.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.320
They're also willing to invest
in the long term.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.450
They don't care about one year
return, they don't care about

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.540
five year returns.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.960
They're after something
that they're to

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.250
pursue in the long term.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.460
You look at the way that Jeff
Bezos talks about Amazon, and

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.430
the type of things
that he does.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.870
He doesn't really care if the
investors like it or not.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.090
I mean, he cares at some
particular level, because he

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.020
doesn't totally control the
company, but for the most

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.170
part, he's just going to do what
he feels is best, and you

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.080
just should come along
for the ride.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.600
Weaknesses of these companies.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.600
Well, the first one is, they'll
ignore market data.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.940
So there's that old
quote, don't

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.350
bother me with the facts.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.650
If you're a visionary, and if
you believe in your vision,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.560
it's not just that you'll tend
to disregard market research

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.170
and external market information,
but you will

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.030
actually sometimes feel
threatened by it.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.030
And I've seen this with the
leaders of some visionary

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.860
organizations if they're a
little bit less personally

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.860
secure is, if you bring in
market research that says

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.290
something different from my
vision, you might actually

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.190
convince some people in
the company not to be

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.690
obedient to my vision.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.100
And therefore, because I don't
want that sort of cross talk

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.660
going on within the company, I'm
not going to let you bring

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.980
market research in here, and
we're not going to look at

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.620
market data, because that would
just be a distraction

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.800
from what I've always
decided this right.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.450
Now, sometimes that's good,
because it can help you keep

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.400
you focused.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.720
But the area where it gets to be
a problem if it means that

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.780
you start ignoring information
about stuff that's going on

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.370
the marketplace that's
really important.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.610
That can get to be really,
really tricky.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.360
Second, they'll just
generally ignore

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.050
advice from the outside.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.530
And these are the sorts of
companies where, because the

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.460
leader is charismatic and has
total control, they can march

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.730
the company straight off a cliff
if their vision ends up

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.890
being wrong at some point
in time in the future.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.060
Look at what happened to Rim,
where the founders had been

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.460
proven right at one point in
time, and then later out,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.260
turned to be wrong, refused to
reconsider what they were

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.320
doing, stayed the course, and
stayed the course so long that

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.350
they ground that company
completely down into the dust.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.270
That's what can happen to a
visionary company when they

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.700
run out of vision.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.020
So a great example of how this
process works and how both

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.600
visionary and analytical
companies can get themselves

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.710
into trouble is the history
of the smartphone.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.500
And so I want to talk about that
a little bit, because I

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.640
think it's a really good
instructive example.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.390
So early, early days of
development of the smartphone,

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.180
there was this thing
called the internet

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.840
that was really new.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.030
So now we're talking late '90s,
something like that.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.390
And we knew that it was becoming
very, very popular in

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.960
PCs, and it seemed really,
really obvious that because

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.720
people liked it on the PC, they
would also want to take

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.710
it across to the phone.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.480
And so the big emphasis in the
phone industry, the consensus

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.540
that everybody had, was
we've got to move the

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.110
internet onto the phone.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.990
And the way that we're going
to do this is things called

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.860
wireless application
protocol, or WAP.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.920
And it looked a little
like this.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.410
And I guess that screen
is too small for you

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.000
to be able to see.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.090
So what you've got here is a
little tiny phone-- you know,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.410
one of the really tiny little
phones that we can make that

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.430
you want to have in your pocket,
because it's so tiny.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.160
It's got a keypad and a little
four way pointer here, and

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.440
then it's just a few little
lines of text with underlined

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.580
links that you can use to
go from page to page.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.590
So it worked like the internet
in the sense that you had

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.340
hypertext that was linked
together, but it didn't have

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.820
the graphics of web pages, it
didn't have the web experience

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.080
that people were used to, it
didn't actually look like the

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.650
web at all.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.650
It looked like just some
hypertext documents that

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.230
somebody had made up.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.350
These phones received an
incredible amount of

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.270
investment.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.410
I mean, subsidies up the wazoo
for the distribution of the

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.360
phones, huge companies that
were founded to create WAP

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.770
infrastructure and content
and all this other stuff.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.320
There was only one problem with
that stuff, which is that

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.660
customers didn't like it and
didn't want to use it.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.390
So WAP cratered completely in
terms of whether it was really

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.030
being effective at getting
the internet into phones.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.730
Instead, what started to sell
were much bigger phones.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.970
And this is not quite
to scale, but

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.120
that's not too far off.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.350
They were based on the
PDAs of the time.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.860
So it was not about bringing
in web stuff.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.650
In fact, WAP was not
even implemented on

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:19.950
these phones sometimes.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.480
But instead, it was about
personal information, managing

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.730
your calendar and address book
and other stuff like that, and

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.180
having that connected with the
phone, and also getting the

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.870
beginnings of a base
of applications.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.760
So Palm, for instance, had
tens of thousands of

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.370
applications for a while, so we
kind of got the beginnings

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.360
of that mobile application
infrastructure.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.050
These products started
doing better.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.410
And so the emphasis in the
industry shifted away from

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.320
those WAP phones, and the
investment went into, OK,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.020
these PDA enhanced phones.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.790
And every big phone manufacturer
started licensing

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.600
these things and building them,
and it started having a

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.150
growth curve.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.500
And that's where the industry
was really focused.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.660
At the same time, in a secret
hideout in Ontario, Canada

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.430
there was a company called
Research In Motion that was

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.620
making alphanumeric pagers.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.960
So I don't know if everybody
even remembers how pagers

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.400
worked these days, but it was
a way to sent text messages

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.580
without a phone, and they were
very popular back in the 1990s

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.740
for people who needed to get
short bits of information

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.970
very, very quickly.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:20.960
So places like stock traders,
and government officials who

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.520
needed to be up to
date on headlines

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.740
and things like that.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.430
And what the guys at Research
In Motion did was they

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.110
realized that they take their
pager technology and they

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.540
could apply it to email.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.480
So they started making larger
devices that could connect

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.850
into the Outlook email that
everybody was using in

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.490
business at the time, and would
enable you to carry your

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.820
email around with you.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.060
And eventually, they
built phone into

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.200
these devices as well.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.470
Now, I was at Palm at the time
that this was going on, and

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.950
although people talked about
Research In Motion and the

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.970
BlackBerry devices, the
awareness of them was really

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.260
low, because the customer
penetration was mostly back

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.680
east in New York and Washington
and places like

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.420
that, so people just were
kind of blind to it.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.090
But what happened was RIM got
this technology to mature,

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.310
they got it into all the phone
networks, they got all the

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.630
carriers to carry it, and all
of a sudden, this was the

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.500
explosive growth thing
in smartphones.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.390
This was the majority
smartphone

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.310
in the United States.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.370
Everybody decided they
had to copy that.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.260
And I got into the discussions
that we had with the carriers

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:18.770
at the time.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.740
Well, what they started telling
us was, well, the

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.730
future is clearly stuff like
RIM, so you need this keyboard

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.610
on these devices, and get rid
of that stupid touch screen.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.140
It just gets scratched.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.250
RIM doesn't have a touch screen,
so why are you guys

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.130
doing that yourselves?

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.790
And so actually, at Palm, we
spun up a project to do

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.730
non-touch screen Palm OS
devices, believe it or not.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.770
That's how far this
process went.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.490
So what happened was you had the
analytical companies who

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.360
were trying to look at things
analytical, and were just

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.410
responding to things that were
going on in the marketplace,

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.810
and so they were focused
on PDA phones.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.710
RIM comes along, a visionary
company with a different type

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.930
of smartphone that was focused
on email, takes

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.290
the market by storm.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.750
Everybody then goes and focuses
on trying to copy the

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.370
thing that RIM had done.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.570
So we have the analytical
companies zigzagging like

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.160
this, going after
this new thing.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.480
Then, of course, this guy comes
out with the iPhone,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.360
which was absolutely everything
that the industry

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.360
consensus said you should
not do in a phone.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.960
It was a touch screen, it was
focused on web stuff, it

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.360
didn't handle email particularly
well, it didn't

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.580
have a built in keyboard, so
you couldn't do your email

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.610
management.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.310
And here's a quote from a
senior executive in the

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.830
industry when iPhone came out.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.030
"That's the most expensive phone
in the world, and it

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.300
doesn't appeal to business
customers, because it doesn't

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.000
have a keyboard, which
makes it not a

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.120
very good email machine.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.670
I like our strategy.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.850
I like it a lot.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.700
Right now, we're selling
millions and millions and

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.970
millions of phones a year.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.790
Apple is selling zero
phones a year."

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:45.760
Ballmer, right?

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.470
Steve Ballmer.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.000
That was what Steve
said about it.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.650
And we see where things
ended up there.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:56.010
So what you've got is a repeated
pattern of analytical

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.080
companies following the
consensus, driving themselves

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.990
into kind of a corner, a
visionary company comes in

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.470
with something else, grabs
tremendous market share,

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.310
everybody goes and tries to
chase that, and then another

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.080
visionary company comes
along and is able to

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.290
change things again.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.780
So it's this back and forth.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.960
For a while, RIM was really hot,
because they had a good

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.140
vision for this stuff.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.940
Then they ran out of momentum on
that vision, Apple came up

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.360
with something different, and
then RIM ended up trying to be

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.080
a follower.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.260
So what do you do about this if
you're in this situation?

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.400
How do we prevent these
things from

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.720
happening to our companies?

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.730
Well, I think what you need to
do is you need to change how

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.030
you think about the future.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.040
That analytical viewpoint and
that visionary viewpoint both

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.210
have big flaws.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.250
So you cannot completely control
the future, no matter

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.410
how good a visionary you are.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.810
Things will happen that are
beyond your control.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.360
And you cannot completely
predict

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.030
what's going to happen.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.330
However, you can influence what
will happen in the future

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.030
if you have a good idea of what
the possibilities are.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.900
The future isn't
fixed in place.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.950
It's a thing that's in motion.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.880
So what you really want to
look at is, what are the

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.220
things that are potentially
changing?

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.250
What are my options, and
therefore, what can I try to

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.370
cause to happen in the future?

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.960
What we need is something like
the roadmap that you use when

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.290
you're planning a road trip.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.260
So we're in California, right?

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.780
So have you done this
on vacation?

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.520
You pack up the car, and you go
drive to someplace like a

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.010
Yosemite or Yellowstone or
something else like that?

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.950
There's this really cool process
that you go through

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.570
when you're planning
those trips.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.470
You look at a map-- either
a paper map or an

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.870
electric one online--

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.300
and you look at, OK, there's
the Grand Canyon.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.380
And so, wow, the Grand Canyon's
really big, but there

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.420
are only couple roads in.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:33.080
So I could go here to the south
rim, and then I guess I

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.700
could go over to Navajo
National Monument.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.110
That's a really long way.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.610
If I went up to here, that
puts me close to Zion.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.280
So I could go here, and
I could go up to

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.230
this one, or I could--

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.180
I can't go over here.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.410
There are no fricking roads, so
let's not worry about that

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:45.980
one too much.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.520
But let's string together
the destinations

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.130
that we could go to.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:53.780
So just as a roadmap tells you
the potential things you could

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.980
and could not do in planning a
vacation, a strategic roadmap

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.450
for a company tells you the
things that you might and

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.440
might not be able to accomplish
in the marketplace

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.120
so that you can plan out which
ones you want to go after.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.150
It's not a prediction.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.340
It's a set of possibilities that
we can make much, much

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.980
finer grained than what most
companies are doing today.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.240
So the elements of that future
roadmap for a company are

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.390
three things.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.400
First of all, you've got
to understand customer

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.040
psychology.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.200
That's like the terrain
that's on the map.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.390
So I'm not saying market
research, like, what do people

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.830
think, or something like that.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.140
You want to understand what
their needs are, how they

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.200
think, what things do
they care about?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.710
Because what you're looking for
is latent subjects that

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.960
they would be interested in,
problems that they have that

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.280
you might be able to solve.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.280
Doesn't really matter what they
think today, because they

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.790
may not understand that those
problems are solvable.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.680
They may not even realize
that they're problems.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.350
But if you can get inside their
heads, and if you can

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.080
look at, well, OK, I would be
able to solve this problem if

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.010
I did X and Y, that's the
beginnings of mapping out what

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.960
are the great destinations
that you could go to.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.440
Like, for instance,
what RIM said.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.270
Well, email's really important
to people.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.000
Nobody's asking for a mobile
email product.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.620
But if we took their email and
we made mobile, wow, that

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.410
would probably really go
over well with people.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.740
Let's go ahead and try that.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.540
Second, an understanding
of technology futures.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.930
So that's like the roads.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.040
Can we get there?

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.900
There's some destinations the
customers might actually love,

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.320
but we simply can't reach
it, because the

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.790
technology isn't ready.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.260
Whereas there are other
places, well, we could

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.290
definitely go there, and it's a
good cost, and we'd be able

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.340
to do it pretty quickly.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.230
Let's add that to the list
of things that we

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.920
really try to consider.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.120
And then the third piece
is competitive insight.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.070
And not traditional competitive
analysis in this

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.400
industry, which is usually about
testing somebody else's

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.330
products and getting
speeds and feeds.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.390
I'm talking about understanding
the psychology

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.100
of your competitors so that you
will understand how they

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.330
will react when you do something
in the future.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.210
Because something that's
different about a business

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.930
roadmap as opposed to planning
a vacation is that for a

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.490
business roadmap, you have to
take into account, well, maybe

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.350
somebody else is going to get to
the Grand Canyon before me,

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.810
and they will buy every camping
spot in the Grand

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.190
Canyon before I get there.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.190
And if they're going to be able
to do that, I probably

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.090
don't want to plan on going
to the Grand Canyon.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.750
I probably should drive straight
to Zion instead.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.250
And so you have to think about
those things, and you have to

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:05.840
map that out.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.350
And the way to do that is you
understand your competitors

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.480
well enough that you can figure
out what they're going

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.460
to do in the future before
they even realize it.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.540
And it is possible to do that.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.840
So you've got to take those
three perspectives and you

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.960
integrate them together into
a single view that lets you

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.670
think about what's going to
happen in the market overall.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.610
What are the possibilities that
I could do if we invest

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.890
properly, and therefore, what
are the opportunities that we

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.370
could get at before
anybody else does?

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.050
So you could ask, and people
sometimes ask me, why those

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:34.450
three things?

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.920
Why competition and customers
and technology in particular?

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.820
Very often, those are the things
that produce the errors

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.360
that we make in our predictions
about the future.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.830
So, for example, that satellite
phones thing was

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.720
basically an error in
underestimating the

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.840
competition.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.240
If you'd really thought through
clearly what the

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.370
economics of cell phone
technology would be and where

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.840
that's likely to go and what's
going to go on with that, you

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.830
would have been able to see, you
know, that satellite stuff

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.430
is just not going to scale
the way we want the

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.540
cell phone stuff to.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.980
And oh, by the way, the phone's
going to have to be

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.540
really heavy, because we need
this huge battery to be able

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.430
to talk to a satellite several
hundred miles up, as opposed

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.420
to talking to a cell phone
station that's maybe a mile

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.920
away or something like that.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.820
And battery life is always a
problem in the tech industry.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.570
And therefore, we know we're
going to have a battery life

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:20.860
problem, and that's
a crippling issue

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.760
for us to deal with.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.900
That teleconferencing thing
was a market error.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.070
They were right about the
technology, but they were

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.430
wrong about how customers
were going to use it.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.870
And frankly, if you just thought
through why do people

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:33.730
do business travel?

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.320
What are the things they're
trying to accomplish?

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.990
It would have been pretty
fricking obvious that in most

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.240
cases, you can't use
teleconferencing to replace

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.810
most of the sources of business
travel, but that

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.060
there might be other problems
that customers have that

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.260
they're not even thinking
about that you

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.170
might be able to solve.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.840
And then those clot
busting robots.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.890
That was just a technology
error, plain and simple.

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.740
If you think about actually
building an autonomous little

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.010
swimming robot that can go in
your bloodstream, could swim

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.600
to a clot, would have little
graspers or manipulators or

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.840
lasers or something that would
blast the clot, but you can't

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.830
throw little pieces of the clot,
because those would go

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.660
and cause other embolisms
within the body.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.370
You have to actually grab those
pieces and hide them or

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.020
hold them or something
like that.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.010
And oh, by the way, if the robot
breaks down, you have to

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.790
make sure that it doesn't
turn to a clot itself.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.840
And you have to figure out
how to power that thing.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.870
You have to give it enough
intelligence that it can work

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.340
autonomously, or you have to
figure out some way to control

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.890
it from the outside
without wires.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.100
I mean, come on, guys.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.870
That's like science
fiction stuff.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.510
That is like "Fantastic Voyage."
We're not close to

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.830
being able to do that,
even today.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.050
And so it was crazy to think
in the mid-1990s that you

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:40.540
could do that.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.820
And if they'd thought through
the real technological issues

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.280
around that, that was something
they could have been

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.110
anticipated.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.660
So the benefits of doing
this roadmap.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.780
For a visionary company, what
you use this for is to deepen

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.550
the vision that's being driven
by the founders.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:57.680
So it's not in competition
with their stuff.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.330
It's more like due diligence.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.860
So, OK, here's your vision of
the marketplace that we're

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.780
going to build.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.380
Here's how customers actually
respond to that.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.690
Here's what they think, not in
terms of oh, they don't see it

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.120
and they don't get it, but do
they really have that problem?

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.460
Are they emotional about
that problem?

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.670
Are there other things that
they care about more?

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.070
Very often, it's so easy for
us in the tech industry to

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.600
convince ourselves that the
solution that we have is

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.140
solving a problem that the
customers really care about.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.900
But unless you very carefully
validate that, a lot of times

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.620
what you end up doing is a
problem that the customers

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.160
don't find very motivating.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.155
And as a result, you don't get
much revenue and much growth.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.810
For the analytical companies,
what it does is it breaks you

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.040
outside of that analytical box,
and it helps you think

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:38.700
more creatively.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.630
Because in the process of
getting those competitive

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.580
people and the market
researchers and the

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.420
technologists to bounce ideas
off of each other, they'll

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.250
start to say things like, well,
you know, if we put

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.030
together this and this and this,
that might be really

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.310
big, and that could be
a new possibility.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.560
You wouldn't have thought
that otherwise.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.290
You wouldn't have come
up with it through

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.140
an analytical process.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.340
It's more like enhanced
brainstorming.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.560
But what it does for an
analytical company is it makes

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.700
those vague future possibilities
more tangible.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.470
It fleshes out the story and the
logic behind them a little

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.600
bit better so that you can start
to evaluate those future

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.730
possibilities with a little bit
more rigor and trade them

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.139
off against the short term stuff
that always seems more

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:15.139
compelling.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.870
So in both cases, what that road
map can do is it fills in

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.719
some of the gaps in the mental
model that companies are

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:24.060
building in their thinking
about the future.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.409
So why don't we build
these things today?

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.409
Organizationally, most companies
in the Valley are

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:32.510
not set up to do this sort of
work, because those three

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.380
groups that I talked about are
in completely different

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.980
locations, if they even exist,
and they are managed in

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.120
totally different ways with
different cultures.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.679
So, for instance, competitive
analysis.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.580
In most companies these days,
there is not even a

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.080
competitive analysis group.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.690
It's something that's done by
junior product managers.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.719
So somebody comes in, and
they're a college intern or

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.624
something like that, and you
say, hey, you're just learning

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:54.449
the industry.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:56.620
Let me have you go do the
competitive analysis.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.060
Go try this product and come
back to me with a paper on

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.520
it-- write up five pages,
or something like that.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.880
And we feel like that's
really good.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.110
But here's the deal.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.380
If your new college intern
is doing your competitive

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.270
analysis, how much insight are
they going to come up with on

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.790
the deep psychology of the
competitors that you're

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:13.190
dealing with?

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.830
Because that's really the value
that you want to get is

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.750
how do they think, and what
are they going to work on?

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.860
Not just some details about
product features or

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.890
something like that.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.810
Furthermore, what happens to the
careful knowledge that you

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.720
gained about the competitor when
that intern then goes on

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.910
back to college or goes to some
other company to work or

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:28.870
something like that?

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.910
You haven't established a
knowledge base within the firm

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.890
about how competitors think.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.670
Instead, you just scattered
that out to other places.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.240
So rather than treating this
as a throwaway junior data

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.780
collection function, you need
to treat it as a senior

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.180
analytical function that's on
par with other strategy stuff.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.730
You get people who are really
good at this stuff, you train

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.260
them up over the years, and they
can start to develop a

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.580
knowledge base to be able to
say things like, well, you

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.620
know, when confronted with this
sort of situation that

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.760
we're talking about, here's
what Microsoft's probably

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.850
going to do, and here's what
Amazon's probably going to do,

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.900
and here's what Google will
probably do, given what I know

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.940
about their senior management
and their culture and all that

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.740
sort of stuff.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.930
And you can actually, once you
get experienced with this, you

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.610
can make pretty good predictions
about how they're

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.100
going to behave.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.010
Second, market research, in most
companies, is a separate

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.560
service group.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.520
It usually reports
into marketing.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.655
So it's doing usually research
on awareness and consideration

00:36:19.655 --> 00:36:22.670
and other marketing metrics that
marketing cares about.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:26.100
Maybe they'll do an occasional
project for a product team

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.190
that's working on stuff.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.500
But usually, even that, it'll
be not so much about

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.380
understanding customer needs,
but it'll be more about how

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.900
are they going to react
to this product?

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.660
Here's the marketing message
that we want to try,

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.840
or things like that.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.340
What you really want to get
to from market research is

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.340
understanding the psychology of
customers so that you can

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.280
predict their future behavior,
just like the way you try to

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.780
predict the future behavior
of competitors as well.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.580
To do that, you have to
spend a long time

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.780
dealing with the customers.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.400
It's years of research.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.890
And you need the same people
working on it over time so

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.860
that you can build up that
institutional knowledge of

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.940
here's how customers think,
here's what they would like if

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.050
we built it for them.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.660
And then third, advanced
technology to the extent that

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.960
companies in the Valley still
have dedicated advanced

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.130
technology teams, and that's
become relatively

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.000
rare over the years.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.070
They usually work in isolation,
and what they do is

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.280
long term projects that they
cook up on their own that tend

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.760
to be stuff that engineers
are really interested in.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.770
Kind of fundamental
breakthroughs, as opposed to

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.010
advanced development of stuff
that's actually been vetted

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.190
with market research and
competitive analysis to figure

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.560
out if it actually does
something that'll make sense

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.050
to the rest of the company.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.630
In addition, because those
advanced technology people, in

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.200
most companies, tend to work
in isolation, even if they

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.020
come up with a brilliant idea,
it's incredibly hard for them

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.260
to sell it to the rest of the
company, because they don't

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.970
have the expertise in marketing
and in competitive

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.380
stuff to be able to explain,
here's how we'd actually win

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.200
in the marketplace.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.210
Instead, it's just, look at this
beautiful thing I built.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.260
Don't you want to build it?

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.790
Well, no, we're busy.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.820
And so that's why most advanced
technology projects

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.020
in most companies never get
transferred into mainstream

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.180
production.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.360
So you put those three groups
together, and you get the

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.450
synergy between them, and then
you're starting to do advanced

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.060
modeling of the marketplace,
including all these different

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.490
aspects, and you can actually
build up some pretty good

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.850
models about here's how things
might develop, here are some

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.180
opportunities that we
might want to go

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.200
after in the future.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.900
And you can see this stuff
before other companies do.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.860
So that is the first 30
pages of the book,

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.890
believe it or not.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:27.120
After that, the rest of it is
this big how-to guide on how

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.250
to implement those ideas I
was just talking about.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:33.650
So how to manage those three
teams, details about how to

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.130
get them to work together,
because they have very

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.350
different cultures, and just
out of box, they will not

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.040
respect each other.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.900
In fact, they think each other
are idiots, usually.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.350
How do you produce one
of those roadmaps?

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:43.610
What are the steps
you need to take?

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.800
How do you distribute it
within the company?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.890
And then specific topics
about problems that

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.060
companies run into.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.950
How do you segment the market
for a new product?

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.950
How do you identify your first
market segment that you're

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.110
going to go after?

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.740
How can you use this stuff to
lead Agile development and

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.630
avoid mission drift?

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.110
How do you use it?

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.780
Because the Agile team does need
to be improvising on the

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.100
how it does things.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.080
You just don't want them
improvising on the what.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.950
And if you do a roadmap right,
it can do this nice job of

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.870
constraining the team and
keeping them focused.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.080
Managing the adoption curve.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.310
How do you go from
early adopters?

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.030
How do you know when you've
moved from early adopters to

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.520
mainstream?

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.390
There's a bunch of
stuff about that.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.120
And then a really important
issue, especially in big

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.600
Silicon Valley companies, is
managing internal politics.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.180
Because if you are taking this
roadmap and trying to tell the

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.320
company what to do, you
inevitably can run into

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.360
resistance, unless you've been
very, very careful about how

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:30.880
you set it up.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.520
So I talk about some
of that as well.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.790
So what do I want you to
remember out of this

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.310
discussion?

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.680
So first of all, we think
about the future

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.850
in the wrong way.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.220
We either tend to try to have
this vision that's this

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.750
all-encompassing thing that
cannot possibly be wrong, and

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.130
we try to drive the world
to that vision.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.730
And occasionally, if you're
Steve Jobs, you get lucky, and

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.150
that works out.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.570
But for the most part, it
doesn't work at all, which is

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.860
why you get all those
failed companies

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.130
like the Rotary Rocket.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.420
Or you get a company that's
successful once because it got

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.766
lucky, and then it continues
to try to be visionary, and

00:40:00.766 --> 00:40:02.300
they're never visionary
again, and it ends up

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.820
screwing things up.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.600
And then those analytical
companies, because they're

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.280
trying to just look at tangible
stuff, tend to miss

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.780
the longer term opportunities
that are really

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.940
hard to make tangible.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.760
So, second, if you want to deal
with that, what you've

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.080
got to do is set up this roadmap
function or something

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.140
like it that will play
counterpoint to your own

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:20.900
thinking style.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.730
So if you're analytical, it kind
of pulls you out of your

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:23.830
comfort zone and
makes you think

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.240
about longer term vision.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.520
If you're visionary, it tests
your ideas rigorously against

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.830
real world data so that you
can make those ideas

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.170
stronger-- not to replace
them, but

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.240
to make them stronger.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.610
Creating a strategy
roadmap really

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.040
helps with this process.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.600
So you want to put together your
customer thinking, what

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.960
you can build, and what the
competitors are going to do.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.660
And ultimately, what that lets
you do is anticipate future

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.790
things that you might be able
to do in the marketplace to

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.150
pick the ones that
you want to do.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.100
Basically, rather than trying
to predict the future, pick

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.450
out the potential future that
you want to create and then go

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.070
get everybody aligned against
creating that future.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.900
That's really the right way
to plan for the future.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.520
So with that, I'll take
time for discussion.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.550
Here's my contact info.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:08.180
So that's my email, that's where
you can get at the book,

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.630
and that's where my blog is,
and that's me on Twitter.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.250
So with that, thank you very
much for your time, guys, and

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:15.530
if you have any questions,
I'd be glad to take them.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:20.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.900
AUDIENCE: I'm curious what
your thoughts are about

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.370
transitioning between visionary

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:25.700
and analytical companies.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.400
Either you try to do it, or
you're forced to do it.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.800
Like in the case of Apple, they
lose a visionary leader,

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.190
and maybe there's nobody
there to replace them.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.330
MICHAEL MACE: Yes, so
transitioning between a

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.720
visionary and an analytical
company.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.060
Really, really hard to do.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.100
Usually, it fails.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.030
Apple tried to prepare
really hard.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.030
And it's not clear, by the way,
that Apple has decided

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.890
that it wants to be an
analytical company.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:49.910
They did a huge amount of
training on how did Steve

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.040
think, and what would Steve do,
and that sort of stuff,

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.760
not in the sense that they
wanted people to literally

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.800
say, well, what decision
would Steve have made?

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.810
But it's kind of like, what
were the mental habits?

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.230
How did he look at the world?

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.950
And the interesting question
about Apple is, are they going

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.630
to be able to institutionalize
that visionary function?

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.610
Do they have some people in
house who can do that stuff?

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.380
Or do they need to convert
themselves over to analytical?

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.000
The problem with trying to
convert to analytical is

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.480
almost all of your business
processes need to be changed.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.170
If you're going to be
analytical, you need a lot

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.070
more process inside.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.810
You need different sorts of
managers who can do analytical

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.830
thinking, as opposed to the
people you've hired to

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.420
implement your vision, who are
very tell me what to do, let

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.780
me just carry it out.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.090
You need people who can kind
of think about stuff more.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.720
So it is a really, really
hard thing to do.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.230
And usually, what happens
is the companies fail.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.010
If they've got enough runway,
if they've got enough money,

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.670
then it's easier to make that
transition, as they've got

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.760
more time, and Apple certainly
has a ton of money.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.310
So it'll be interesting
to see how it goes.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.080
But there's no exact playbook
for how to do it.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.010
It's a great question,
but there's no single

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.710
way to make it happen.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.660
AUDIENCE: Basically, principles
discussed here, the

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.810
propensities of two types of
thinking, I think also maybe

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.010
apply to the individual level.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.410
MICHAEL MACE: Yes.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.910
AUDIENCE: So people tend to have
this intuitive thinking

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.220
or analytical.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.880
So can you comment on those kind
of things based on your

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.985
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:08.985 --> 00:43:09.890
MICHAEL MACE: Yeah.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.520
So individuals who are either
intuitive or analytical in the

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.600
way they approach things--
which is

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.240
completely true, they exist--

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.220
the big thing is, make sure that
you are at a company that

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.740
respects whatever your style is,
and make sure you're in a

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.550
role that rewards that stuff.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.950
So for instance, if you're a
really analytical thinker, and

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:31.680
you're just doing analysis, you
probably actually don't

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.670
want to try to do competitive
analysis, because usually, you

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:37.170
have limited data available on
competitors, and you have to

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:39.390
form a lot of conjectures about,
OK, based on the little

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.830
things that I know, here's
what they're

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.140
probably going to do.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.080
However, if you're analytical,
you could be a really, really

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.670
good market researcher, because
so much of that is

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.750
dealing with data.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.870
So it's find a job that
will use your

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.660
strengths, number one.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.310
And number two, work in a
company-- it doesn't have to

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.190
be, oh, I'm a visionary,
therefore, I want to be in a

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.910
visionary company.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.720
In fact, if you're a visionary,
and you work in a

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.430
visionary company, that can be
very, very uncomfortable,

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.000
because your vision may
not be the same as the

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.150
vision of the CEO.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.720
You'll just get your butt fired
really, really fast.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.910
But find a situation where the
company will let you do what's

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.570
your special added value, will
respect it, and will let you

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.360
go optimize the thing
that you're best at.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.000
That's the big thing.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.390
And it's not a particular
job title.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.570
It's do your managers understand
what you do?

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.610
Do you understand what you're
good at so that you can

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:25.850
describe that to them?

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.362
It's back to my general rule for
all career management in

00:44:28.362 --> 00:44:29.090
the Valley.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.530
Get hired for the
right reason.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.140
Get hired because they really
understood you, not because

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.080
you made a good pitch
for a job.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:35.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.150
Also, just a followup, since
you're at Google, you have

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:41.370
that scale, right?

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.110
One side or the other side.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.490
Where do you put Google?

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:46.080
MICHAEL MACE: Yeah, excellent.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.610
I was hoping somebody was
going to ask that.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.680
MICHAEL MACE: So where
is Google on that?

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.970
Is Google a vision led company
or an analytical company?

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.430
And I'll give you my take, which
I don't expect all of

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.350
you to agree with.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.090
But this is me on the outside
having watched Google a lot is

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:05.570
that, although a lot of people
want to always say that Google

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.280
is a visionary company, because
it did so much to

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.980
found the internet, and there
are projects that you guys are

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.870
doing that are definitely
visionary-- like I'd say the

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:17.490
self driving car and Google
Glass and things like that are

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.680
pretty much visionary things,
the core of the company

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.360
behaves like an analytical
company.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.980
That is the process
that you guys do.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.740
Your emphasis on data and
quantification, on

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:32.150
understanding things, that's all
normal behavior for when

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:34.530
engineers are running the show,
because engineers are

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.090
trained in the scientific
method.

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.770
Scientific method says you run
a series of experiments that

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.160
you then evaluate rigorously.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.680
You can have intuition, but
intuition that hasn't been

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.930
tested through experiment
is distrusted by

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.420
the scientific method.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.500
And you see that sort
of behavior

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.690
repeatedly within Google.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:53.500
I'll give you one little tell
that me as a competitive guy

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.480
looks at a lot is just how
do companies talk about

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.630
themselves?

00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:00.780
There's a phrase that the
internet companies developed a

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.110
long time ago, which is, if you
can measure it, you can

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.310
improve it.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.770
That was the whole rationale
behind analytics and all the

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.430
other stuff that we do, looking
at your server logs,

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:10.350
all that other stuff.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.060
If you can measure it, you can
improve it, which makes

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:13.680
perfect sense.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.480
I do not argue with it at all.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.470
Several times over the last
couple of years, I've heard

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.880
Google executives in public
forums flip it around.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.330
So they don't say it that way.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.360
What they say is, if you
can't measure it, you

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.540
can't improve it.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.070
And if you want separately,
I'll go show you the

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.750
references to when
that's been said.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.230
If you can't measure it,
you can't improve it.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.590
Now, what that says mentally
is, that which we cannot

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.370
measure is irrelevant, and
therefore, should not be

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.870
considered.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:46.120
If you had said that to Steve
Jobs, what would he have done

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.740
to you, if you'd been one
of his employees?

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.190
So that's how a visionary
would view

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.820
that sort of statement.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.180
And yet, Google executives
repeatedly say that in public,

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.050
with nobody contradicting it,
nobody noticing anything about

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.640
it, nobody saying, well,
that seems odd, or

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.430
anything like that.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:05.170
It is a reflection of the way
this company's behaviors and

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.240
thinking tend to be formatted.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.680
Now, no companies is ever 100%
visionary or 100% analytical,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.170
and you can't try to be in
the middle, by the way.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.820
That's the worst, because you
never get anything done.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.170
There's nothing wrong with being
an analytical company.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:19.800
But my long answer to your short
question was, to me,

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.670
Google looks like an analytical
company that does

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.190
some experiments with visionary

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:26.660
projects on the side.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.805
That's how it parses to me.

00:47:27.805 --> 00:47:29.074
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:47:29.074 --> 00:47:30.020
MICHAEL MACE: Sure thing.

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.130
AUDIENCE: Michael, you started
off with the nine predictions,

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:36.440
and they had about a 20 batting
average, right?

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.410
So a company that moves over
to this model, what kind of

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:42.310
batting average would you
expect them to have?

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.230
MICHAEL MACE: I would expect it
to be in the range of over

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.780
50%, because you can't be
perfect on execution, and a

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.870
lot times, things will just fail
in execution, even if you

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.570
anticipated everything
perfectly.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:55.940
But if you can at least vet
things so that you're not

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.630
making those major competitive
errors, you're not making the

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.040
major customer errors, you're
not making the major

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.050
technology years, you're going
to at least double your

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.220
success rate, if not more.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.390
So I would say it
went 22% to 44%.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.630
I think the goal should
be to get over 50%.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.740
And if you get it over 50%, the
payoff on the successful

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.600
ones will be enough to be able
to fund the ones that are not

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.210
successful.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.900
The problem is, unless you're
like Google, which has this

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.850
huge financial engine that
supports everything, a 20%

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:25.220
batting average is not
enough to survive

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:25.980
in the major leagues.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.510
You will lose so much money on
the limited number of ones

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.700
that you can do that you simply
will never get the big

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.650
hit that makes you successful.

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:35.750
But I think over 50% is a
great goal to shoot at.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.870
But, by the way, that is
an intuitive, visionary

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:39.590
viewpoint of things.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.080
I cannot prove it, because it's
hard to find a company

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.660
that's actually, in the long
term, put this sort of process

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.160
into place.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.950
I've tried to do it at some of
the places I was at at, and at

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.900
Palm, we actually got the whole
thing in place, and then

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.130
they reorged and completely
changed direction.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.820
It was like, come on, guys!

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.490
But I can show you all the
predictions we made back then.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:58.230
Dead on.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.460
100%.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.350
At least I think so, from
my perspective.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.630
AUDIENCE: When Steve Jobs
released the iPhone for

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:09.546
everyone, what could have been
different at the time?

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:12.480
How could other companies
have been more prepared?

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.760
MICHAEL MACE: Oh,
great question.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.510
OK, so when Steve Jobs did the
iPhone, what should other

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.440
companies have done?

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.610
Well, the first thing is, they
should have been in there

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.280
ahead of time before
Steve got to it.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.650
They should have been looking
at these issues.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:25.390
But that's not a great answer,
because you'll always get

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.300
surprised sometimes
by somebody.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.800
I think they would have been a
lot better off, number one, to

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.480
focus on what their
strengths were.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.560
So what RIM did which was
really, really wrong--

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.870
provably wrong--

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.910
is that they tried to turn their
product into an iPhone.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.080
So they tried to add
entertainment features and

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.850
browsing and stuff, and there
was all this advertising that

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.670
was focused, rather than
focused on their core

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:49.370
customers in the enterprise, it
was focused on consumers.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:52.080
So I don't know if you remember
the Verizon, oh your

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.940
BlackBerry butt dialed me ad,
because the kid had sat on his

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.270
BlackBerry, and now there's a
BlackBerry with a flip cover?

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:00.950
And I thought, man, that is
really appealing to a business

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:02.890
executive, you know?

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.210
And that's really going to
reinforce your core customers

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.180
that you're good at.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.150
If they had really, really
focused on, what

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:10.300
do we have at RIM?

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.710
We have this great
client server

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.130
architecture at the back end.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:14.120
We have email.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.770
Let's focus on enabling all the
other enterprise apps, and

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:18.600
let's make sure that we can
mobilize that stuff better

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.620
than anybody else.

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.830
They might have been able
to hang onto the entire

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:24.630
enterprise market, and then
the iPhone would have been

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.240
niched as a consumer
entertainment device that's

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.780
not appropriate for business,
and it would have been stuck

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.920
in the same position that
Macintosh was in for a long

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.100
time relative to Windows.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.560
Windows is right for
business, Macintosh

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.010
is right for creatives.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.680
Creative market is this big,
business market is this big.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.070
Instead, RIM tried to chase
Apple, made itself a bad

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:44.810
business tool and a bad
entertainment tool at the same

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:46.820
time, really cratered
the business.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.530
So my usual answer is, know what
you're best at, know who

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:53.840
your customers are, stay the
course, do a great job of

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.530
differentiating.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.340
Don't try to own
100% of market.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.360
Own your segment of the market,
and don't worry about

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.410
the rest of it.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.050
And that's what I
would have done.

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:06.510
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering what
determines the company pick,

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.410
either the visionary
or the analytical.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:10.020
Is it because of the leader, or

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.260
because of certain segments?

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.630
MICHAEL MACE: How does a company
end up being either

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.070
visionary or analytical?

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.490
There are different industries
that have different balance.

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:21.250
So for instance, if you look at
the entertainment industry,

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.840
most of them, even though they
try to be analytical, most of

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.190
them are vision driven.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:27.420
They just don't know which
movies are going to make it.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:30.200
And it's their gut feeling
about, I trust this director,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.820
I trust this producer,
or this is what I

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.590
think is a good direction.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.580
Now, they do sometimes behave
like analytical companies in

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.536
the sense that they'll all try
to copy each other if one of

00:51:38.536 --> 00:51:39.470
them's successful.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.680
Oh, Tolkien movie did well.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.410
Let's all do fantasy
movies about elves.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.890
And you get a bunch of things
like that, so you do get some

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.840
of that behavior.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.530
But still, you get some
industries that are much more

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:51.920
visionary than others.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.520
However what usually drives
it is the founders.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.400
And you can have founders who
are very vision driven, like a

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.610
Steve Jobs.

00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:59.290
He's just ego.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.370
Force of will, man.

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.580
He decided he was right, and you
were going to follow him,

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.290
and that's what it
was going to be.

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.120
You get other companies that
have a more analytical point

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.740
of view in their founders, and
that tends to color the

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.170
behavior of the whole company.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.940
Why does Google focus so much
on testing things and

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.420
analyzing things and
stuff like that?

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.800
Well, you've got some guys
who are trained PhDs in

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.080
engineering who have a really
strong science background, and

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.470
that's how they're trained to
think about things and to

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:26.470
approach problems.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:28.910
And like I said, one isn't
better than the other.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.190
The big thing is, understand
which one you are, do a really

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.510
good job of executing on it,
but then watch your blind

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.450
side, which is what this
road map thing's about.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:39.466
AUDIENCE: Something I really
like about Google here is we

00:52:39.466 --> 00:52:43.080
are given the opportunity to
criticize, to say we don't

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.060
like things.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.760
But now, the question
is, how to get that

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.230
into actionable items?

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:55.050
We are good criticizers, but
I'm not sure we change the

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:56.730
road, the path.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.360
MICHAEL MACE: So being able to
criticize well versus being

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.480
able to actually drive action.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.270
So I'm on the outside, and so I
have a blind spot to how the

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.800
details of decision making
processes work within Google,

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.080
because you guys are very
careful to keep that sort of

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.390
internal stuff confidential.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:14.720
So what I'll say in general, and
this is just about dealing

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.280
with human beings in general,
especially if you're in an

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.180
analytical culture, is you
can't just critique.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.530
You've got to be persuasive.

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.300
The more you can flesh out the
reason that you're critiquing

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.960
something, what is the reasoning
behind it, the more

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.400
that people are going to
tend to listen to it.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.300
Now, th e problem is going to
be, if you've got a visionary

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.840
idea that you're trying to
critique from a visionary

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.110
perspective, that's a really
hard thing to get across in

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:40.320
any company that tends to be
analytical, because it's just

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.420
my opinion.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:44.600
It's like, because of the
scientific method, you always

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.760
listen to critiques.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.010
That's absolutely fine.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.420
I would expect Google to be a
great place for people doing

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.180
criticism, because that's
how scientists

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:51.770
are supposed to work.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:53.000
Peer review, right?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.250
We toss our ideas around, we
peer review, you fire away,

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.260
you throw things at me, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:02.160
However, ultimately, peer review
you listen to, and then

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.210
you're allowed to dismiss
it if you're in charge.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.930
A lot of it depends
on the managers

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:10.190
above, and do they listen?

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:12.520
Do they force the people who
are making the decisions to

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.400
actually take into account
criticism?

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.070
And then it's how persuasive can
the person who's doing the

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.230
criticism be.

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:21.670
And part of that is thinking
about this roadmap process.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:24.490
OK, why do you criticize it?

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:25.970
Why do you think it's wrong?

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.110
How much of those perspectives--
if you look

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.710
from all those different
perspectives, can you set up

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:32.055
an intellectual framework for
explaining why it's wrong, as

00:54:32.055 --> 00:54:33.780
opposed to just saying,
here's my opinion?

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.800
The more you can put a framework
around it, the

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.120
better chance you have of
getting people to listen to it

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.150
and listen to it constructively
in the sense

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.410
of, OK, you've given me some
ideas to work on, as opposed

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.990
to, oh, you're disagreeing
with me, you're

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:46.010
messing with my job.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:48.070
I don't want to hear about
that sort of stuff.

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:50.290
So think about how you could put
a framework around things.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.150
I apologize.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.320
I know that's really kind of a
vague answer, but that's the

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.265
best I can do from a distance.

00:54:55.265 --> 00:54:57.600
But I'd be glad to talk to you
more about it offline, if you

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.810
want to brainstorm sometime.

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:02.710
AUDIENCE: First of all, I want
to say thank you for the talk.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.160
MICHAEL MACE: My pleasure.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.690
AUDIENCE: You had a lot of
really good examples of

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:09.740
visionary companies and
analytical companies, but I

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.220
was wondering, do you have any
examples of companies that

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.030
have managed that
transition well?

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.430
MICHAEL MACE: Companies that
have managed the transition

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.240
from visionary to analytical?

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.780
AUDIENCE: Or vice versa.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:20.143
MICHAEL MACE: Yeah.

00:55:20.143 --> 00:55:22.920
You know, I think HP, for a
long time, did it well.

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.110
I mean, it was always an
engineering oriented company,

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:28.740
so it was a little bit
analytical to begin with, but

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.640
the founders had pretty strong
ideas about places they wanted

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.100
to go, and they were willing to
place bets on those things,

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.870
even if they didn't have a lot
of data backing it up.

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.770
And I think for a long
time, HP did OK as

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:39.580
an analytical company.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.540
They've lost their way today,
but if we talked about it 10

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.660
years ago, I would've said
they're a pretty good model

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.620
for how to make that go.

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.420
3M is a really interesting one
to look at, because they're

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.590
the closest to a company that's
both visionary and

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:54.400
analytical, and really, I wish
I knew more about them.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.365
I've talked to some people from
3M about the processes

00:55:56.365 --> 00:55:57.510
that they use.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.050
What's interesting is they
can be very good at being

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:05.200
analytical about understanding
how they identify engineering

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.290
breakthroughs.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.320
They're really good at, for
instance, numerically being

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.200
able to identify the most
creative engineers who are

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.800
likely to produce the biggest
breakthroughs.

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.350
They've done a great job of
getting through that.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.400
Really cool stuff, if
you haven't seen it.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.560
But they will tell you, trying
to figure out who can produce

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.030
the breakthrough thinking on
a market as opposed to an

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:24.610
engineering innovation,
they have no clue.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:26.650
It's like, I was talking
with one of them.

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.520
It's like, we don't know.

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.040
Like, maybe we look at
their track record.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.290
But of course, by the time you
look at their track record,

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.400
they've already done it, and
you haven't grab those

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.480
employees at the time when
they can help you out.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.950
So it's a real tricky one, and
other than HP, I have trouble

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.556
thinking of a lot of other
really good examples.

00:56:43.556 --> 00:56:44.920
But good question.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.450
Thanks.

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:49.550
AUDIENCE: So if you're working
in a strong, visionary

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:53.660
company, right, and if I take
your recommendation on taking

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:58.250
some analytical components to
balance it out, or at least to

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:02.740
look at the other side of the
coin, right, what are the top

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.810
talking points if you're talking
to an executive or

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:11.000
whatever to basically make them
consider the other side

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:11.400
of the coin?

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.560
And again, vice versa, right?

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:16.280
So if you're talking to an
executive in a company where

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.080
they're very analytical, but
you're trying to basically

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.830
sell this idea of incorporating
the other side

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.720
of the coin, how
do you do that?

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.080
What are the top three selling
points for each of those?

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.040
MICHAEL MACE: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.800
OK, so trying to convince a
visionary company to listen to

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.460
your analytical type thinking.

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.990
Number one, you need to get a
read on the character of the

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.450
CEO of the company--

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:41.600
of your visionary.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.340
Whoever the CEO is.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:46.130
They might be the CEO, they
might be the general manager

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:47.590
of a business unit, if
the business units

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:48.790
have a lot of autonomy.

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.755
You've got to get a read on
their personality, and how

00:57:51.755 --> 00:57:53.310
insecure are they?

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.250
Because what you can get is
you can get people who are

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:58.410
visionaries who have a fair
amount of personal insecurity,

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:01.320
where they view any challenge as
a personal threat to them.

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.340
And that's just not a good place
to try to feed ideas to

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.640
them, because they don't have
enough self confidence to be

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.960
able to listen to dissenting
ideas.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.710
If they feel secure, though,
what you can do is you can

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.700
feed it to them as this
is a way to make

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.640
your vision even stronger.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.370
I'm not trying to replace
your vision.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.260
What I'm trying to do is test
it out against some things

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.990
that will help you spot
potential blind spots.

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:27.050
And by going through this
process of roadmapping,

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:29.420
thinking through these things,
what we're going to produce is

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.240
something that we will bring
straight to you-- we're not

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.060
going to take to the whole
company first, we'll bring it

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.290
right to you.

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:38.380
And what we'll do is we will let
you think through it, and

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.800
you can look at, oh, I hadn't
thought about this issue.

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.260
Gee, I've got to reconsider
this.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.630
Or, yep, I've got to
work that one.

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:45.530
Or no, here's why I think
you guys are wrong.

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:48.580
But you will have a higher
percentage chance of success,

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.660
because it's been tested.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.950
It's just like exercise.

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:53.370
And usually these execs are
really into exercise.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:56.160
If you sell it like exercise--
this is mental exercise to try

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.980
to make your ideas stronger--

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.380
they'll tend to go for that,
as long as they have enough

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.480
self confidence that
they don't feel

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.430
threatened by that thing.

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:03.170
Now, let me flip it around.

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.730
Analytical companies tend very
often to be rather than top

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:08.650
down, they tend to
be bottom up.

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:10.620
So it'll be, I want
ideas to come up

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.460
from within the company.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.680
I want those to boil up to us.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.150
I want to create processes by
which we get ideas internally,

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.120
and we vet them, and other
things like that.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.010
To those executives, you sell
this roadmap thing as an

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:24.920
additional process that will
produce better quality

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.330
thinking around long
term opportunities.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:28.960
And you sell them on,
you know what?

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.150
We prioritize short term easy
stuff much higher than we

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.370
prioritize the long term
difficult stuff that might

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:35.720
produce the big returns.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.870
That's a logical, analytical
view of the problem that they

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:39.930
can buy into.

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:42.060
And then what they'll say is,
OK, Mr. Smart Guy, what do we

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:42.770
do about it?

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:44.530
Well, we're going to run this
run this roadmap process that

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:47.970
brings out those intuitive vague
ideas that people have

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:50.720
that vets them and helps to
draw out scenarios of how

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.000
things could develop in the
future so that you can view

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.910
them as a more realistic
thing.

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:57.760
You can get a better sense of
what might be possible, and

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.200
you'll be able to think
ahead of where

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.450
competitors are thinking.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:01.440
That's a way to hook them.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.480
OK so going by this process, I,
Samsung, can get someplace

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.040
faster than the Nokias
of the world.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.870
And therefore, I'm going to have
a bigger advantage in the

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:11.290
marketplace.

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:11.530
Great.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:11.990
Let's do it.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.240
Let's go try it.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.530
And then it's a matter of
executing on it and making

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.960
sure that they can see the
benefits of it over time.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.150
So work from their angle.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.920
Visionary companies tend to be
top down, so sell it from the

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.580
top down as a way to
improve their own

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.150
thinking through exercise.

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:29.970
Analytical companies tend
to be bottom up.

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:32.980
Sell it to management as a way
to get better quality thinking

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:33.990
coming out of the company.

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:35.610
That's the short answer.

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:37.430
And there's more details
in the book.

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:39.810
So I'm trying not to pitch the
book, but if you want look at

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:40.700
that, there's some stuff.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.475
But also, if you want to talk
about it some more, I'd be

01:00:42.475 --> 01:00:43.870
glad to chat about it offline.

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:44.260
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:44.650
Thank you.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:45.540
MICHAEL MACE: Thanks.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.010
So thank you very
much for coming.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:47.900
I really, really
appreciate it.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.020
I'll stick around for a few
minutes, if you've got other

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.980
questions and stuff.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.340
You also can contact me there.

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.350
I would love to get
feedback from you.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.860
And thank you so much
for your time.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:56.760
I really appreciate it.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.368
