improving Android studio is not just
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.720
improving Android studio is not just
about fixes it's also about improving

to go through this to chain we're gonna

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
to go through this to chain we're gonna
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010
to go through this to chain we're gonna
go through a typical user journey

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
go through a typical user journey
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870
go through a typical user journey

day out that you see here thank you very
much so first of all we're going to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
much so first of all we're going to
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800
much so first of all we're going to
build the first screen of our Google

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
build the first screen of our Google
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.310
build the first screen of our Google
traits app using the layout editor so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
traits app using the layout editor so
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080
traits app using the layout editor so
upon opening the layout editor this is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
upon opening the layout editor this is
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.340
upon opening the layout editor this is
the kind of screen you're going to see

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
the kind of screen you're going to see
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.510
the kind of screen you're going to see
and here it's just a blank layout the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
and here it's just a blank layout the
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.859
and here it's just a blank layout the
first thing we're going to do is switch

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
first thing we're going to do is switch
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.649
first thing we're going to do is switch
to blueprint mode as it is faster and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
to blueprint mode as it is faster and
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.280
to blueprint mode as it is faster and
it's just less distracting when trying

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
it's just less distracting when trying
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.620
it's just less distracting when trying
to just build the constraints on your

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
to just build the constraints on your
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.899
to just build the constraints on your
layout and you don't want to be just

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
layout and you don't want to be just
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.240
layout and you don't want to be just
looking at what the components actually

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
looking at what the components actually
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.060
looking at what the components actually
look like so I'm just going to from the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
look like so I'm just going to from the
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.850
look like so I'm just going to from the
palette just dragging all the components

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
palette just dragging all the components
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249
palette just dragging all the components
that I need for my layout more or less

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
that I need for my layout more or less
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.969
that I need for my layout more or less
in the definite place and once I'm done

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
in the definite place and once I'm done
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.190
in the definite place and once I'm done
with that comes the time to build the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
with that comes the time to build the
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.230
with that comes the time to build the
constraints so as a way to be a bit more

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
constraints so as a way to be a bit more
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.270
constraints so as a way to be a bit more
efficient building constraints I could

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
efficient building constraints I could
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.330
efficient building constraints I could
build them like one by one but using the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
build them like one by one but using the
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.370
build them like one by one but using the
contextual menus we

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
contextual menus we
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.240
contextual menus we
can build several constraints in one go

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
can build several constraints in one go
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.400
can build several constraints in one go
for example here I want to Center the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410
for example here I want to Center the
 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.300
for example here I want to Center the
recyclerview within the layout so one

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
recyclerview within the layout so one
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.460
recyclerview within the layout so one
thing I can do is right clicking on the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
thing I can do is right clicking on the
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.560
thing I can do is right clicking on the
recyclerview and in the contextual menu

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570
recyclerview and in the contextual menu
 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.540
recyclerview and in the contextual menu
there is the option of centering

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
there is the option of centering
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.780
there is the option of centering
horizontally what that does is it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
horizontally what that does is it
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.730
horizontally what that does is it
creates both a left on the right

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740
creates both a left on the right
 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.100
creates both a left on the right
constraint in one click ensuring that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110
constraint in one click ensuring that
 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.540
constraint in one click ensuring that
the recyclerview will be centered

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550
the recyclerview will be centered
 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.520
the recyclerview will be centered
once I'm done building all my

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
once I'm done building all my
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.100
once I'm done building all my
constraints this is what my layout looks

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110
constraints this is what my layout looks
 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.920
constraints this is what my layout looks
like in the blueprint mode obviously

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
like in the blueprint mode obviously
 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.350
like in the blueprint mode obviously
doesn't really tell me right now if I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
doesn't really tell me right now if I
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.060
doesn't really tell me right now if I
build the right thing compared to the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070
build the right thing compared to the
 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.550
build the right thing compared to the
design that I was given so I'm going to

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
design that I was given so I'm going to
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.260
design that I was given so I'm going to
go back to design mode and see what it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
go back to design mode and see what it
 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.590
go back to design mode and see what it
looks like and in the design mode you

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600
looks like and in the design mode you
 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.460
looks like and in the design mode you
can see that it looks not very much like

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
can see that it looks not very much like
 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.700
can see that it looks not very much like
the original designer was given and the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710
the original designer was given and the
 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.830
the original designer was given and the
reason for that is that the recycler

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840
reason for that is that the recycler
 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.770
reason for that is that the recycler
view is pretty much empty as you know

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
view is pretty much empty as you know
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.490
view is pretty much empty as you know
recycle views usually get the data

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
recycle views usually get the data
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.100
recycle views usually get the data
populated at runtime but that's not very

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110
populated at runtime but that's not very
 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.970
populated at runtime but that's not very
helpful when you're trying to build your

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
helpful when you're trying to build your
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.030
helpful when you're trying to build your
layout and make sure that it displays

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040
layout and make sure that it displays
 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.890
layout and make sure that it displays
correctly with the data that you're

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
correctly with the data that you're
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.920
correctly with the data that you're
going to see so to solve that problem

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930
going to see so to solve that problem
 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.480
going to see so to solve that problem
you can use design tools attribute so

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490
you can use design tools attribute so
 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.510
you can use design tools attribute so
design-time attributes you can simply in

the email client doing that creates a
 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.520
the email client doing that creates a
layout recycler view item for that

your item to something more appropriate
 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.750
your item to something more appropriate
to my project and then I can start

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760
to my project and then I can start
 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.600
to my project and then I can start
editing it double-clicking on the layout

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610
editing it double-clicking on the layout
 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.540
editing it double-clicking on the layout
in the resource manager will simply open

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550
in the resource manager will simply open
 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.810
in the resource manager will simply open
that layout in the layout editor as you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820
that layout in the layout editor as you
 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.300
that layout in the layout editor as you
can see on screen I pretty much have all

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310
can see on screen I pretty much have all
 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.390
can see on screen I pretty much have all
the right components right there for my

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400
the right components right there for my
 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.390
the right components right there for my
trip card like an image view couple of

trip card like an image view couple of
 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.790
trip card like an image view couple of
text views but they're obviously not

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800
text views but they're obviously not
 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.040
text views but they're obviously not
having the right constraints so I'm

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050
having the right constraints so I'm
 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.600
having the right constraints so I'm
going to start by deleting all the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610
going to start by deleting all the
 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.220
going to start by deleting all the
constraint clicking that button in the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230
constraint clicking that button in the
 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.520
constraint clicking that button in the
in the toolbar and once that's done I'm

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530
in the toolbar and once that's done I'm
 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.800
in the toolbar and once that's done I'm
going to just reorganize all those

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810
going to just reorganize all those
 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.440
going to just reorganize all those
constraints one issue here is that we

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450
constraints one issue here is that we
 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.100
constraints one issue here is that we
have quite a few confuse overlapping a

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110
have quite a few confuse overlapping a
 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.760
have quite a few confuse overlapping a

trouser
in a small area that can be a bit

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660
in a small area that can be a bit
 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.690
in a small area that can be a bit
cluttered and we've heard from you that

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700
cluttered and we've heard from you that
 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.480
cluttered and we've heard from you that
in this situation building constraint

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490
in this situation building constraint
 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.450
in this situation building constraint
can be a bit difficult it can be

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460
can be a bit difficult it can be
 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.640
can be a bit difficult it can be
sometimes difficult to drag the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650
sometimes difficult to drag the
 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.160
sometimes difficult to drag the
constraint to the right target on the

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170
constraint to the right target on the
 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.860
constraint to the right target on the
right components especially when

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870
right components especially when
 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.900
right components especially when
components are overlapping

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910
components are overlapping
 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.820
components are overlapping
so what we're now allowing to do is

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830
so what we're now allowing to do is
 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.310
so what we're now allowing to do is
dragging the constraint directly on to

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320
dragging the constraint directly on to
 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.010
dragging the constraint directly on to
any place in the component that you'd

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020
any place in the component that you'd
 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.470
any place in the component that you'd
want to attach it to and then a pop-up

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480
want to attach it to and then a pop-up
 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.140
want to attach it to and then a pop-up
menu opens asking you what type of

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150
menu opens asking you what type of
 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.620
menu opens asking you what type of
constraints you want to set it gets

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630
constraints you want to set it gets
 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.930
constraints you want to set it gets
really interesting when you're dragging

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940
really interesting when you're dragging
 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.870
really interesting when you're dragging
a constraint into a location that has

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880
a constraint into a location that has
 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.340
a constraint into a location that has
overlapping component in that situation

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350
overlapping component in that situation
 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.490
overlapping component in that situation
we are offering not only what like

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500
we are offering not only what like
 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.070
we are offering not only what like
several types of constraints but you can

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080
several types of constraints but you can
 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.900
several types of constraints but you can
also select which of the overlapping

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910
also select which of the overlapping
 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.790
also select which of the overlapping
components you want to attach that

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800
components you want to attach that
 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.860
components you want to attach that
constraint - and that should makes it

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870
constraint - and that should makes it
 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.320
constraint - and that should makes it
much easier to build constraint layouts

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330
much easier to build constraint layouts
 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.230
much easier to build constraint layouts
in the cases where you have overlapping

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240
in the cases where you have overlapping
 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.909
in the cases where you have overlapping
and small components

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919
 
 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.180
 
one final way that can be helpful for

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190
one final way that can be helpful for
 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.060
one final way that can be helpful for
you to build constraints efficiently is

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070
you to build constraints efficiently is
 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.370
you to build constraints efficiently is
using the componentry so in the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380
using the componentry so in the
 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.909
using the componentry so in the
componentry if you do multi selection of

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919
componentry if you do multi selection of
 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.610
componentry if you do multi selection of
components like here we selected two

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620
components like here we selected two
 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.250
components like here we selected two
text views you can again with the

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260
text views you can again with the
 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.040
text views you can again with the
contextual menu right-clicking and

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050
contextual menu right-clicking and
 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.310
contextual menu right-clicking and
selecting one of the constraint

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320
selecting one of the constraint
 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.620
selecting one of the constraint
available you can create that one

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630
available you can create that one
 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.159
available you can create that one
constraint over the multi components

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169
constraint over the multi components
 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.830
constraint over the multi components
that are selected so here we create two

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840
that are selected so here we create two
 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.719
that are selected so here we create two
constraints at the same time on those

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729
constraints at the same time on those
 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:22.090
constraints at the same time on those
two text views once we're done building

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100
two text views once we're done building
 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.310
two text views once we're done building
all our constraint it's time to

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.320
all our constraint it's time to
 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.250
all our constraint it's time to
customize our views a little bit and for

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260
customize our views a little bit and for
 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.659
customize our views a little bit and for
that we're going to use the attributes

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:28.669
that we're going to use the attributes
 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.520
that we're going to use the attributes
panel on the right-hand side of the

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.530
panel on the right-hand side of the
 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.270
panel on the right-hand side of the
layout editor we have redesigned the

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280
layout editor we have redesigned the
 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.670
layout editor we have redesigned the
attributes panel to show a new section

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680
attributes panel to show a new section
 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.029
attributes panel to show a new section
at the top called declared attributes in

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039
at the top called declared attributes in
 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.420
at the top called declared attributes in
that section we put all the attributes

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.430
that section we put all the attributes
 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.650
that section we put all the attributes
for the selected view that have been set

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660
for the selected view that have been set
 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.900
for the selected view that have been set
specifically for that view so right

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:49.910
specifically for that view so right
 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.330
specifically for that view so right
there you can edit an attributes that

drop-down clicking on that button opens
 

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.699
drop-down clicking on that button opens
a resource picker where you can pick a

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:45.709
a resource picker where you can pick a
 

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:47.740
a resource picker where you can pick a
dimension that is that you've already

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:47.750
dimension that is that you've already
 

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.990
dimension that is that you've already
defined in your project or you can

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000
defined in your project or you can
 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.850
defined in your project or you can
create a new dimension right there

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:53.860
 
 

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.579
 
one final thing that needs to happen

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:57.589
one final thing that needs to happen
 

00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:00.670
one final thing that needs to happen
looking at that layout you see that the

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680
looking at that layout you see that the
 

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.590
looking at that layout you see that the
image view is populated with sample data

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600
image view is populated with sample data
 

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.260
image view is populated with sample data
but it's just default sample data coming

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:05.270
but it's just default sample data coming
 

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.630
but it's just default sample data coming
from Android studio so that's not really

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640
from Android studio so that's not really
 

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.579
from Android studio so that's not really
representative of the kind of data that

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:09.589
representative of the kind of data that
 

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:11.560
representative of the kind of data that
your recycler view will receive at

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:11.570
your recycler view will receive at
 

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.360
your recycler view will receive at
runtime so what you can do is set your

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:16.370
runtime so what you can do is set your
 

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.170
runtime so what you can do is set your
own sample data to that image view we've

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.180
own sample data to that image view we've
 

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.480
own sample data to that image view we've
added images of cities into directory

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:25.490
added images of cities into directory
 

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.700
added images of cities into directory
called cities in the sample data folder

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:27.710
called cities in the sample data folder
 

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.790
called cities in the sample data folder
of our project and you can see that it

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800
of our project and you can see that it
 

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.790
of our project and you can see that it
appears in the result in the sample data

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800
appears in the result in the sample data
 

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.210
appears in the result in the sample data
picker and we can select it to set that

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:37.220
picker and we can select it to set that
 

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.960
picker and we can select it to set that
sample data and going back to our

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:40.970
sample data and going back to our
 

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.170
sample data and going back to our
original layout we can now see that it

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:44.180
original layout we can now see that it
 

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.460
original layout we can now see that it
looks much more like the original design

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:47.470
looks much more like the original design
 

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.950
looks much more like the original design
that you got and from there you can

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:50.960
that you got and from there you can
 

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.590
that you got and from there you can
really see if the design has been

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600
really see if the design has been
 

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.320
really see if the design has been
implemented properly and will work when

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:56.330
implemented properly and will work when
 

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.019
implemented properly and will work when
receiving real data once the application

00:09:59.019 --> 00:09:59.029
receiving real data once the application
 

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:04.570
receiving real data once the application
is running on the device so now we are

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:04.580
is running on the device so now we are
 

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.640
is running on the device so now we are
done with the navigation with the

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:06.650
done with the navigation with the
 

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.160
done with the navigation with the
building of the first constraint the

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.170
building of the first constraint the
 

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.140
building of the first constraint the
first screen and we want to move on to

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.150
first screen and we want to move on to
 

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.790
first screen and we want to move on to
building our next screen in our

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800
building our next screen in our
 

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.510
building our next screen in our
application but instead of just going

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:16.520
application but instead of just going
 

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.480
application but instead of just going
back to creating a layout file and

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:19.490
back to creating a layout file and
 

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.519
back to creating a layout file and
building it from the layout editor we

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:21.529
building it from the layout editor we
 

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:23.260
building it from the layout editor we
want to start right there thinking of

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:23.270
want to start right there thinking of
 

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.500
want to start right there thinking of
the navigation flow of our app and how

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:26.510
the navigation flow of our app and how
 

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.500
the navigation flow of our app and how
the first screen will transition into

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:29.510
the first screen will transition into
 

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.440
the first screen will transition into
the second screen and to do that we're

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:32.450
the second screen and to do that we're
 

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.940
the second screen and to do that we're
going to have a look at the navigation

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:33.950
going to have a look at the navigation
 

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.019
going to have a look at the navigation
editor so the navigation editor is a

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:38.029
editor so the navigation editor is a
 

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:41.410
editor so the navigation editor is a
visual tool that makes it easier to use

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.420
visual tool that makes it easier to use
 

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.329
visual tool that makes it easier to use
the navigation architecture component

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:43.339
the navigation architecture component
 

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:47.740
the navigation architecture component
from the jetpack library the way to

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:47.750
from the jetpack library the way to
 

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.630
from the jetpack library the way to
navigation architecture component works

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:49.640
navigation architecture component works
 

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.010
navigation architecture component works
is it relies on having a navigation host

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:54.020
is it relies on having a navigation host
 

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.400
is it relies on having a navigation host

first thing we're going to want to do is
 

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.220
first thing we're going to want to do is
add our first screen as the starting

we want to select to add the second
 

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.610
we want to select to add the second
screen but because we haven't created a

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:30.620
screen but because we haven't created a
 

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.280
screen but because we haven't created a
layout for it already we can simply

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:34.290
layout for it already we can simply
 

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.490
layout for it already we can simply
create a new destination from the

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:36.500
create a new destination from the
 

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.680
create a new destination from the
destination menu and doing that will

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:39.690
destination menu and doing that will
 

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.380
destination menu and doing that will
offer you the possibility of creating a

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:42.390
offer you the possibility of creating a
 

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.510
offer you the possibility of creating a
new fragment class and its associated

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:44.520
new fragment class and its associated
 

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.280
new fragment class and its associated
layout and that's the layout that's

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:46.290
layout and that's the layout that's
 

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.110
layout and that's the layout that's
going to be used as the second screen

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120
going to be used as the second screen
 

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.690
going to be used as the second screen
once the two screens are in the

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700
once the two screens are in the
 

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.860
once the two screens are in the
navigation editor comes the time of

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:56.870
navigation editor comes the time of
 

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.810
navigation editor comes the time of
linking them together and that can be

00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820
linking them together and that can be
 

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.850
linking them together and that can be
done with actions so you can simply

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860
done with actions so you can simply
 

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.880
done with actions so you can simply
create an action as shown on screen and

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:04.890
create an action as shown on screen and
 

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.640
create an action as shown on screen and
in addition you can directly in the

information about the attributes that
 

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.470
information about the attributes that
are set on each view but right now it

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480
are set on each view but right now it
 

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.390
are set on each view but right now it
has a number of limitations and this is

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400
has a number of limitations and this is
 

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.310
has a number of limitations and this is
due in part to what data the android

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320
due in part to what data the android
 

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.320

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:23.190
adopt the new api's and see what we can
 

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.670
adopt the new api's and see what we can
do with them and we've started work on a

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:25.680

preview builds but as Chad said
 

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.030
preview builds but as Chad said
yesterday and the developer keynote we

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:41.040
yesterday and the developer keynote we
 

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.190
yesterday and the developer keynote we
love previews we love developer feedback

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200
love previews we love developer feedback
 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.470
love previews we love developer feedback
and so we're going to get it out into

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480
and so we're going to get it out into
 

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.290
and so we're going to get it out into
your hands as soon as possible now let's

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:48.300
your hands as soon as possible now let's
 

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.170
your hands as soon as possible now let's
see how it works well start with the

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:51.180
see how it works well start with the
 

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.730
see how it works well start with the
google trips app that we've been working

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740
google trips app that we've been working
 

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.710
google trips app that we've been working
on and you can see now that it's running

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720
on and you can see now that it's running
 

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.300
on and you can see now that it's running
in the emulator and we've hooked things

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:56.310
in the emulator and we've hooked things
 

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.860
in the emulator and we've hooked things
up so that it's running on real data

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:57.870
up so that it's running on real data
 

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.410
up so that it's running on real data
from a user rather than the sample data

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:00.420
from a user rather than the sample data
 

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.650
from a user rather than the sample data
that we were using at design-time now as

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:03.660
that we were using at design-time now as
 

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.570
that we were using at design-time now as
we scroll down here you can see that

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580
we scroll down here you can see that
 

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.250
we scroll down here you can see that
some of the trip descriptions in the

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260
some of the trip descriptions in the
 

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.380
some of the trip descriptions in the
real data are significantly longer than

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:09.390
real data are significantly longer than
 

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.380
real data are significantly longer than
what we had in sample data to a point

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:12.390
what we had in sample data to a point
 

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.300
what we had in sample data to a point
where the text is sort of dominating the

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:14.310
where the text is sort of dominating the
 

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.540
where the text is sort of dominating the
images in a way that we hadn't intended

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:16.550
images in a way that we hadn't intended
 

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.680
images in a way that we hadn't intended
let's take a look at this in the new

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:18.690
let's take a look at this in the new
 

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.550
let's take a look at this in the new
layout inspector

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:22.560
 
 

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.170
 
you can see that the new layout

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:24.180
you can see that the new layout
 

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.120
you can see that the new layout
inspector gives us a view similar to

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.130
inspector gives us a view similar to
 

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.650
inspector gives us a view similar to
what we have in the layout inspector

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:27.660
what we have in the layout inspector
 

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.770
what we have in the layout inspector
today if we select the textview in

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780
today if we select the textview in
 

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.050
today if we select the textview in
question here and then look at the

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:33.060
question here and then look at the
 

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.440
question here and then look at the
attributes panel on the right we can see

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.450
attributes panel on the right we can see
 

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.550
attributes panel on the right we can see
that there are a few differences

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:37.560
that there are a few differences
 

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.080
that there are a few differences
compared to what we have in the current

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.090
compared to what we have in the current
 

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.170
compared to what we have in the current
layout inspector first of all we have

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:42.180
layout inspector first of all we have
 

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.600
layout inspector first of all we have
the actual attribute names here whereas

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:44.610
the actual attribute names here whereas
 

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.880
the actual attribute names here whereas
previously we had a collection of getter

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:46.890
previously we had a collection of getter
 

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.680
previously we had a collection of getter
methods that may or may not have

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:48.690
methods that may or may not have
 

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.450
methods that may or may not have
correspond it very well to the actual

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460
correspond it very well to the actual
 

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.090
correspond it very well to the actual
attributes they should make it much

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100
attributes they should make it much
 

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.890
attributes they should make it much
easier for you to map back from what you

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900
easier for you to map back from what you
 

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.900
easier for you to map back from what you
see here to what you have defined in

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:56.910
see here to what you have defined in
 

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.230
see here to what you have defined in
your own layouts and styles secondly we

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240
your own layouts and styles secondly we
 

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.270
your own layouts and styles secondly we
have nicely formatted attribute values

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280
have nicely formatted attribute values
 

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.920
have nicely formatted attribute values
for a number of different value types

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:03.930
for a number of different value types
 

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.900
for a number of different value types
and we couldn't always get that before

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:05.910
and we couldn't always get that before
 

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.300
and we couldn't always get that before
so for example you can see we have an ID

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:08.310
so for example you can see we have an ID
 

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:14.180
so for example you can see we have an ID
an enum value a color etc thirdly we

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.190
an enum value a color etc thirdly we
 

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.160
an enum value a color etc thirdly we
have some information now about where

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.170
have some information now about where
 

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.070
have some information now about where
that value is being set so you can see

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080
that value is being set so you can see
 

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.750
that value is being set so you can see
that we have this declared attribute

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760
that we have this declared attribute
 

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.880
that we have this declared attribute
section here similar to what we have in

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:22.890
section here similar to what we have in
 

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.790
section here similar to what we have in
a layout editor for those attributes

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:25.800
a layout editor for those attributes
 

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.950
a layout editor for those attributes
that are set directly on the view that's

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960
that are set directly on the view that's
 

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.220
that are set directly on the view that's

change it to make a little bit smaller

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720
change it to make a little bit smaller
 

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.420

our change in the emulator without

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.150
our change in the emulator without
 

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:15.200
our change in the emulator without
having to redeploy our app and in fact

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.210
having to redeploy our app and in fact
 

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.390
having to redeploy our app and in fact
we'll see the update right away in the

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980
new layout inspector as well and this is
 

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.010
new layout inspector as well and this is
because layout inspector is mirroring

were to scroll back up here would see
that the layout inspector Scrolls right

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:29.430
that the layout inspector Scrolls right
 

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:37.040
that the layout inspector Scrolls right
along as well

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.050
 
 

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.440
 
let's take a look at another scenario

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:39.450
let's take a look at another scenario
 

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.760
let's take a look at another scenario
let's say we want to implement a dark

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:41.770
let's say we want to implement a dark
 

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.910
let's say we want to implement a dark
theme for our app now here you see we

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:44.920
theme for our app now here you see we
 

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.130
theme for our app now here you see we
have a light background color let's find

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:47.140
have a light background color let's find
 

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.510
have a light background color let's find
out where that background color is

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520
out where that background color is
 

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.940
out where that background color is
coming from if we look in the fragment

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:50.950
coming from if we look in the fragment
 

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.220
coming from if we look in the fragment
XML we have here we don't see it set

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:53.230
XML we have here we don't see it set
 

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.560
XML we have here we don't see it set
there directly let's take a look and

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:55.570
there directly let's take a look and
 

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:00.120
there directly let's take a look and
layout inspector so if we select the

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.130
layout inspector so if we select the
 

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:04.350
layout inspector so if we select the
background here you can see if you can

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360
background here you can see if you can
 

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.870
background here you can see if you can
see really well that we don't have the

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880
see really well that we don't have the
 

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.000
see really well that we don't have the
background color set directly on this

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.010
background color set directly on this
 

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.510
background color set directly on this
view now why might that be well we've

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520
view now why might that be well we've
 

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.020
view now why might that be well we've
only selected the topmost view here and

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.030
only selected the topmost view here and
 

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.490
only selected the topmost view here and
the background color might be set

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:17.500
the background color might be set
 

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.110
the background color might be set
somewhere lower down in the view

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120
somewhere lower down in the view
 

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.050
somewhere lower down in the view
hierarchy but which view is it being set

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.060
hierarchy but which view is it being set
 

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.350
hierarchy but which view is it being set
on well the new layout inspector gives

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360
on well the new layout inspector gives
 

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:36.840
on well the new layout inspector gives
us an easy way to find out

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:36.850
 
 

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.790
 
so in the 3d view it's easy to see which

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:39.800
so in the 3d view it's easy to see which
 

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.580
so in the 3d view it's easy to see which
view is drawing what here now if we

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:42.590
view is drawing what here now if we
 

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:47.800
view is drawing what here now if we
select that view you can see that the

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:47.810
select that view you can see that the
 

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.620
select that view you can see that the
background color is indeed being set but

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:50.630
background color is indeed being set but
 

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.560
background color is indeed being set but
in what file is it being said it's not

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:53.570
in what file is it being said it's not
 

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.030
in what file is it being said it's not
in at the top and the declared

in at the top and the declared
 

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.830
in at the top and the declared
attributes section so we know it isn't

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840
attributes section so we know it isn't
 

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.740
attributes section so we know it isn't
being set on this view directly but

00:26:59.740 --> 00:26:59.750
being set on this view directly but
 

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.540
being set on this view directly but
again if we select the property in the

again if we select the property in the
attributes panel we can navigate

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:03.770
attributes panel we can navigate
 

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.250
attributes panel we can navigate
directly from there to where it's being

directly from there to where it's being
 

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.890
directly from there to where it's being
set and in this case it's being set in a

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:08.900

and we're SELEX plural here so for

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200
and we're SELEX plural here so for
 

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.440

example it might be useful to just focus

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:29.450
example it might be useful to just focus
 

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.560
example it might be useful to just focus
on one view and it's children or it

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:32.570
on one view and it's children or it
 

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.960
on one view and it's children or it
might be useful to group views together

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:34.970
might be useful to group views together
 

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.970
might be useful to group views together
based on what layout file they're

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:36.980
based on what layout file they're
 

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.930
based on what layout file they're
defined in so example for this screen

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:39.940
defined in so example for this screen
 

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.310
defined in so example for this screen
you can see that at the top we have the

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320
you can see that at the top we have the
 

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.860
you can see that at the top we have the
recycler view items and then the

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:44.870
recycler view items and then the
 

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.500
recycler view items and then the
fragment and then the activity and

behind that the various views that are

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:49.700
behind that the various views that are
 

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.540
behind that the various views that are
defined by the framework we have a lot

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:52.550
defined by the framework we have a lot
 

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.890

more plan for the Lite new layout

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:53.900
more plan for the Lite new layout
 

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.200
more plan for the Lite new layout
inspector and I'm excited to see what we

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.210
inspector and I'm excited to see what we
 

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.980
inspector and I'm excited to see what we
can come up with now to talk about the

00:27:59.980 --> 00:27:59.990
can come up with now to talk about the
 

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.540
can come up with now to talk about the
framework changes that were needed to

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:01.550
framework changes that were needed to
 

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:10.859
framework changes that were needed to
enable this here's Ashley thanks Joe

00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:10.869
 
 

00:28:10.869 --> 00:28:13.629
 
so for Android q we've added three new

00:28:13.629 --> 00:28:13.639
so for Android q we've added three new
 

00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:15.519
so for Android q we've added three new
api's to enable these new inspection

00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:15.529
api's to enable these new inspection
 

00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:18.549
api's to enable these new inspection
features we have the ability to take all

00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559
features we have the ability to take all
 

00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:20.229
features we have the ability to take all
the drawing commands current that went

00:28:20.229 --> 00:28:20.239
the drawing commands current that went
 

00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.079
the drawing commands current that went
into building a frame on the screen and

00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:22.089
into building a frame on the screen and
 

00:28:22.089 --> 00:28:24.009
into building a frame on the screen and
serialize them and send them back over

00:28:24.009 --> 00:28:24.019
serialize them and send them back over
 

00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:25.810
serialize them and send them back over
to studio so it can replay them and

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:25.820
to studio so it can replay them and
 

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.139
to studio so it can replay them and
build that lovely 3d view we

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:29.149
build that lovely 3d view we
 

00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:31.239
build that lovely 3d view we
significantly sped up how long it takes

00:28:31.239 --> 00:28:31.249
significantly sped up how long it takes
 

00:28:31.249 --> 00:28:33.279
significantly sped up how long it takes
to get the properties of views in the

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:33.289
to get the properties of views in the
 

00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:35.379
to get the properties of views in the
view hierarchy as well as adding

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:35.389
view hierarchy as well as adding
 

00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:37.060
view hierarchy as well as adding
additional metadata to that and making

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.070
additional metadata to that and making
 

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.979
additional metadata to that and making
it more correct and we added some new

00:28:38.979 --> 00:28:38.989
it more correct and we added some new
 

00:28:38.989 --> 00:28:40.869
it more correct and we added some new
api's to the resource framework that let

00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:40.879
api's to the resource framework that let
 

00:28:40.879 --> 00:28:43.029
api's to the resource framework that let
us see where an attribute value came

00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039
us see where an attribute value came
 

00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:45.249
us see where an attribute value came
from as well as some more insight into

00:28:45.249 --> 00:28:45.259
from as well as some more insight into
 

00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:47.829
from as well as some more insight into
the decision process of which themes

00:28:47.829 --> 00:28:47.839
the decision process of which themes
 

00:28:47.839 --> 00:28:48.999
the decision process of which themes
were applied when reaching that

00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:49.009
were applied when reaching that
 

00:28:49.009 --> 00:28:50.979
were applied when reaching that
attribute value so to talk about the

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:50.989
attribute value so to talk about the
 

00:28:50.989 --> 00:28:53.019
attribute value so to talk about the
skia picture skia is our 2d graphics

00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:53.029
skia picture skia is our 2d graphics
 

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:56.229
skia picture skia is our 2d graphics
library that underlies the UI toolkit so

00:28:56.229 --> 00:28:56.239
library that underlies the UI toolkit so
 

00:28:56.239 --> 00:28:58.329
library that underlies the UI toolkit so
this is a simplified view to actually

00:28:58.329 --> 00:28:58.339
this is a simplified view to actually
 

00:28:58.339 --> 00:28:59.979
this is a simplified view to actually
fit it on the slide but it's a list of

00:28:59.979 --> 00:28:59.989
fit it on the slide but it's a list of
 

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:01.359
fit it on the slide but it's a list of
drawing commands that go into building

drawing commands that go into building
one of our trip cards from earlier so if

00:29:04.689 --> 00:29:04.699
one of our trip cards from earlier so if
 

00:29:04.699 --> 00:29:06.149
one of our trip cards from earlier so if
we look at it's composed of shadows

00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159
we look at it's composed of shadows
 

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:09.430
we look at it's composed of shadows
rounded rectangles images text all of

that along with the meta along with the
assets needed to render it the image

00:29:14.139 --> 00:29:14.149
assets needed to render it the image
 

00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:17.559
assets needed to render it the image
data the font data etc and we get this

00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:17.569
data the font data etc and we get this
 

00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:19.599
data the font data etc and we get this
from skien natively it's very quick it

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:19.609
from skien natively it's very quick it
 

00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:22.479
from skien natively it's very quick it
allows us to do our live preview because

00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:22.489
allows us to do our live preview because
 

00:29:22.489 --> 00:29:24.489
allows us to do our live preview because
we can get this well a few times a

00:29:24.489 --> 00:29:24.499
we can get this well a few times a
 

00:29:24.499 --> 00:29:30.689
we can get this well a few times a
second and it's generally very small but

00:29:30.689 --> 00:29:30.699
second and it's generally very small but
 

00:29:30.699 --> 00:29:33.099
second and it's generally very small but
the problem with this is if we want to

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:33.109
the problem with this is if we want to
 

00:29:33.109 --> 00:29:35.499
the problem with this is if we want to
zoom in on the switch here it's composed

00:29:35.499 --> 00:29:35.509
zoom in on the switch here it's composed
 

00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:38.049
zoom in on the switch here it's composed
of a text a rounded rectangle and a

00:29:38.049 --> 00:29:38.059
of a text a rounded rectangle and a
 

00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:40.149

from so we look at the render node API

00:29:50.499 --> 00:29:50.509
from so we look at the render node API
 

00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:53.979
from so we look at the render node API
which is a organization tree that

00:29:53.979 --> 00:29:53.989
which is a organization tree that
 

00:29:53.989 --> 00:29:55.930
which is a organization tree that
underlies both views and draw bowls and

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:55.940
underlies both views and draw bowls and
 

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.589
underlies both views and draw bowls and
we add a unique ID to each render node

00:29:58.589 --> 00:29:58.599
we add a unique ID to each render node
 

00:29:58.599 --> 00:30:01.449
we add a unique ID to each render node
we then exposed this unique ID on the

00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:01.459
we then exposed this unique ID on the
 

00:30:01.459 --> 00:30:05.289
we then exposed this unique ID on the
views and annotated the skia picture

00:30:05.289 --> 00:30:05.299

hierarchy so we look into a approach of

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:03.510

brittle if you add a new attribute to
 

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.720
brittle if you add a new attribute to
your view it's not updated so we added

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:11.730
your view it's not updated so we added
 

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.740
your view it's not updated so we added
in any annotation processor which allows

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:15.750
in any annotation processor which allows
 

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.320
in any annotation processor which allows
us to retain the flexibility that the

reflection provided us all you have to

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.130
reflection provided us all you have to
 

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.580
reflection provided us all you have to
do is add an annotation if you add a new

might look like for a custom view

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.040
might look like for a custom view
 

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.010
might look like for a custom view
because this will be relevant for anyone

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020
because this will be relevant for anyone
 

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.710
because this will be relevant for anyone
who's building library view soon so we

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720
who's building library view soon so we
 

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.350
who's building library view soon so we
have a color view it's a property as a

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360
have a color view it's a property as a
 

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.390
have a color view it's a property as a
color and we annotate it with

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:35.400
color and we annotate it with
 

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.760
color and we annotate it with
inspectable property and this gets us

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:37.770
inspectable property and this gets us
 

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.680
inspectable property and this gets us
when the annotation processor looks at

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:39.690
when the annotation processor looks at
 

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.030
when the annotation processor looks at
it this gets us a little bit more

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.040
it this gets us a little bit more
 

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.640
it this gets us a little bit more
context than we had before of just

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.650
context than we had before of just
 

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.620
context than we had before of just
looking at the gutter so we're in Kotlin

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:45.630
looking at the gutter so we're in Kotlin
 

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.200
looking at the gutter so we're in Kotlin
and we can see the at color int

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:48.210
and we can see the at color int
 

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.170
and we can see the at color int
annotation as well as the integer type

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:51.180
annotation as well as the integer type
 

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.300
annotation as well as the integer type
which we know that we've packed a color

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:53.310
which we know that we've packed a color
 

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.430
which we know that we've packed a color
into the center and it's not just a

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440
into the center and it's not just a
 

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.230
into the center and it's not just a
numerical value and we've we got the

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240
numerical value and we've we got the
 

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.120
numerical value and we've we got the
name of the property which we can use to

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:02.130
name of the property which we can use to
 

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.980
name of the property which we can use to
make inferences about its attribute ID

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:03.990
make inferences about its attribute ID
 

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.810
make inferences about its attribute ID
what to call it and of course we can

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820
what to call it and of course we can
 

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.450
what to call it and of course we can
override any of the inferences using

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460
override any of the inferences using
 

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.000
override any of the inferences using
properties on the annotation itself so

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.010
properties on the annotation itself so
 

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.300
properties on the annotation itself so
what the code generation for this looks

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:14.310
what the code generation for this looks
 

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.220
what the code generation for this looks
like is it builds a companion object

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.230
like is it builds a companion object
 

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.560
like is it builds a companion object
that will sit alongside this view so

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:18.570
that will sit alongside this view so
 

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.730
that will sit alongside this view so
let's take a look at what one those

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740
let's take a look at what one those
 

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.300
let's take a look at what one those
might look like so this is an inspection

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:23.310
might look like so this is an inspection
 

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.340
might look like so this is an inspection
companion it's a new API for queue and

of Giffen a class here the properties
 

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.650
of Giffen a class here the properties
defined on that class so in this case

defined on that class so in this case
 

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.120
defined on that class so in this case
we've defined color

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.130
we've defined color
 

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.860
we've defined color
if you look into the call to map color

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:36.870
if you look into the call to map color
 

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.760
if you look into the call to map color
please we have the type there since it's

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:40.770
please we have the type there since it's
 

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.890
please we have the type there since it's
a color we have the property name color

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:42.900
a color we have the property name color

here's what there attribute IDs are and
this allows us to name well that part of

that jump to code completion function
the next step is when we actually have

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100
the next step is when we actually have
 

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.640
the next step is when we actually have
an instance of the view we want to read

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:10.650
an instance of the view we want to read
 

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.350
an instance of the view we want to read

it's very fast and this enables us to do
the live updating of the view hierarchy

additional overhead we did previously so
 

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.890
additional overhead we did previously so
we're all that gets us is to a current

we're all that gets us is to a current
 

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.160
we're all that gets us is to a current
value so we can say here's a this lovely

where in this case it's defined in your
 

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.870
where in this case it's defined in your
widget so we added an API to resources

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880
widget so we added an API to resources
 

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.120
widget so we added an API to resources
that lets you say I've gotten this value

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.130
that lets you say I've gotten this value
 

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.820

tell me where it came from we tracked

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:07.830
tell me where it came from we tracked
 

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.500
tell me where it came from we tracked
that data and we store it through the

additionally we wanted to get some

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:13.290
additionally we wanted to get some
 

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:16.700
additionally we wanted to get some
insight into how Styles affected this so

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:16.710
insight into how Styles affected this so
 

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.950
insight into how Styles affected this so
the resources framework when it's

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.649
resolving an attribute value has to make
a decision about which style to apply so

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659
a decision about which style to apply so
 

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.169
a decision about which style to apply so
we took the decision tree and we added

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179
we took the decision tree and we added
 

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:28.460
we took the decision tree and we added
an API to expose that

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:28.470
an API to expose that
 

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:30.440
an API to expose that
so it's essentially the list of styles

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:30.450
so it's essentially the list of styles
 

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.750
so it's essentially the list of styles
that were considered while but

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.060
that were considered while but
eventually maybe used or not used while

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:35.070
eventually maybe used or not used while
 

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:38.210
eventually maybe used or not used while
resolving that attribute value the

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220
resolving that attribute value the
 

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.690
