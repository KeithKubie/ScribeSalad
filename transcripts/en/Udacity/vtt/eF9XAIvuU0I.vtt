00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.213
Three y plus two divided by y plus eight is correct. Great effort if you got

00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:10.270
this one correct. Here, the L-C-D is y plus two. These are the only factors that

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.243
appear in the denominators inside of our complex fraction. We know we need to

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:20.500
multiply by the L-C-D divided by the L-C-D. So we really just distribute this to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.310
each of our terms and our complex fraction. Next we simplify the common factors

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.810
from a numerator and denominator. This leaves us with 1 times y plus 2 here, 2y

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.655
here, 4 times y plus 2 in our denominator, and a negative 3y also in our

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:43.672
denominator. We can clean up this fraction by adding our light terms here to get

00:00:43.672 --> 00:00:48.565
3y plus 2. We can also distribute this 4 and our denominator. Giving us 4y plus

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:54.208
8 minus 3y. We add like terms one more time to get our final fraction. You're a

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.336
pro. Way to go.
