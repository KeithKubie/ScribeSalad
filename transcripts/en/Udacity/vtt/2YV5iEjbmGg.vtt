00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.130
Suppose our goal was to pull out the
reddish pixels, so here's one example.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.760
All right?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.210
So let's suppose we filter this, and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.280
we say, we're going to pull out all
the pixels where the red value can be

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.980
anything at all, the green has to be
low and the, the blue has to be low.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.602
What do you get?

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.420
All right?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.630
Well, you'll see that you get
bunch of stuff where like, look.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.640
Here's a green value, that's dark green,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.260
which is perfectly reasonable because it
might not have very much red at all, but

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.700
it has got, you know,
a certain amount of green.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.060
Suppose well,
I want it to be even more red.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.087
Okay?
So you might say well,

00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:41.540
let me require that the green and
the blue be even more, me be lower.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.360
You know,
you start to see that you've lost,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.470
first of all you've got these edges
here, these pixels on the thing, and

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.930
you've lost some of the red pixels
that you wanted in the, in the apple.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.170
And basically,
it's kind of hard if you're building,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.860
these are essentially box filters,
right there.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.810
There's certain range in red,
certain in green, certain range in blue.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.130
And it would be hard to build a box
filter that pulled out all your red,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.580
your red apples.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.260
And the reason for this,
and we've seen this before,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.200
is that, here we're plotting
three different shades of the,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.070
three different intensities
of sort of the same green.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.940
In the RGB space, right, so in,
in a nice sort of green in the middle,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.520
we get this nice separation
between these values.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.540
But as things get darker, they get
closer, and as they get brighter,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.160
they get closer.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.300
Why is it as they get
darker they get closer and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.180
if they get brighter they get closer?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.332
Remember that cube, right?

00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:34.691
So as I get closer to white, right?

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:38.611
The I, I have no choice, but
to sort of get closer in RGB space, and

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:42.530
as I get closer to black I have
no choice, but to get closer.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.330
So to try to do this separation in
RGB space is kind of difficult.
