[GOOGLE LOGO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.796
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:10.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.315
So I'm going to open
the conversation today

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:15.880
with the 14th Amendment.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.990
150 years ago, 14th
Amendment was passed.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.570
And we are in a juncture
that some people

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.900
are asking, how relevant is
14th Amendment to our situation

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.840
today?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.420
So I wanted to ask
you, how far have

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.310
we come since the 14th Amendment
then to [? effect ?] and what

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.920
else--

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.040
how much do we have to go?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.430
How many areas do we
need to invest and then

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.907
push for progress?

00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:44.740
ABDI SOLTANI: Great.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.170
Well, thank you so much
for having me here--

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.720
and for the people in
the room and anyone who's

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.432
watching the live stream
or listening to this later.

00:00:53.432 --> 00:00:55.390
You know, the Constitution
of the United States

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.240
is one of the most
powerful legal documents,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.270
one of the most durable.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.700
It has qualities
that make it last.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.610
But it also has the
ability to change.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.920
And the way that the
Constitution changes--

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.530
you know, one is through
the formal amendments.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.990
But it's also in the
way that the people

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.840
embrace the Constitution--
whether we defend it,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.250
whether we stand for it, whether
we apply its principles fully,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.490
or whether we step back from
it and let it be taken from us

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.160
or used against people's rights.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.540
So the original Constitution
of the United States

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.050
basically created the separation
of powers between the Executive

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.920
Branch, Congress, the
Judiciary, and then

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.400
the basic structure of
federalism with the states.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.060
But the Constitution originally
had very few protections

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.350
for individual
rights, and those were

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.840
enacted through the
first 10 Amendments

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.140
to the Constitution, which
we call the Bill of Rights.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.830
So when you think about the
Constitutional amendments,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.590
I think the Second Amendment
is obviously very famous.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.280
It's always in the news.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.190
People can associate
the Second Amendment

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.310
with whether it's collective
or an individual right

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.840
to bear arms.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.290
The First Amendment also gets
a certain amount of attention,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.540
and rightly so.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.000
When people ask me what's
my favorite Amendment

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.950
of the Constitution,
though, my answer

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.760
is the 14th Amendment
of the Constitution.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.350
The 14th Amendment
does a few things.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.360
First, it says that all
persons born or naturalized

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.690
in the United States and
subject to the jurisdiction

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.720
thereof are citizens of the
United States and of the state

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.390
wherein they reside.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.150
That's a profoundly
important sentence.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.090
What it says is that there's
two paths to citizenship--

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.910
citizenship by birth
and citizenship

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.430
through the naturalization
or immigration process.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.150
The reason the 14th Amendment
is my favorite amendment

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.970
is that I am a
citizen because of it.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.160
I was born in this country--

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.770
when my parents are
both from Iran--

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.080
I was born in this
country in 1973.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.840
And that's what
made me a citizen.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.540
Because of the fact that
my parents were Iranians,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.870
I associate my citizenship very
squarely with this Amendment

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.440
of the Constitution.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.290
But every one of us who is a
citizen, every last person who

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.090
is a citizen, it's
either by birth

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.630
or through naturalization.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.770
So the 14th Amendment,
that's one core plank.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.000
After that, it goes on
to say that no state can

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.690
deny the privileges or
immunities of a citizen

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.940
of the United States.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.310
And then, from there
it goes on, and it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.690
changes from talking
about citizen to person.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.080
And it says that no state can
deny to any person due process

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.610
under the law.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.940
And that no state can
deny to any person

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.690
the equal protection of the law.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.690
So the people who wrote
the 14th Amendment

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.140
did so in the aftermath
of abolishing slavery

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.220
in the United States.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.140
The 13th Amendment that
immediately precedes the 14th

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.399
abolished slavery.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.110
And at that time, the
thought was, well,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.320
if you abolished slavery,
well, then, by definition,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.080
the people who are
freed from slavery

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.190
should be treated equally as
human beings and as citizens.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.790
But immediately, the states
that had slavery, as well

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.450
as the northern states,
set about a set of policies

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.180
to discriminate against
free black people.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.740
And so the 14th Amendment
was necessary to make clear

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.060
that every person born here is a
citizen, that no state can take

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.920
away the rights of a citizen.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.180
But then they switched from
talking only about citizens

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.700
to also talking
about persons, when

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.560
they said that every
person is entitled

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.550
to due process and
equal protection.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.670
So why would they,
in crafting Section I

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.990
of the 14th Amendment, talk
about citizens and persons

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.520
so clearly?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.860
It's because they
wanted the Constitution

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.230
to be abundantly clear--

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.720
that it applies on
the fundamental rights

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.770
of due process and equality
to every person, citizen

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.260
and non-citizen alike.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.870
So I love the 14th Amendment.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.110
I love it because it was the
path to my own citizenship,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.830
but also because it marks
this country's progress

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.800
in the abolition of slavery
and the extension of rights

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.650
to every citizen
and to every person.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.180
SPEAKER 1: Awesome, thanks.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.170
And I think, from
this, we can probably

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.240
go to the question that
is in many people's minds

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.130
these days--

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.600
equal protection
for all persons.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.040
I want to move to
the travel ban that

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.210
affected a specific
group of citizens,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.430
basically, with
certain restrictions

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.110
and limitations on movement.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.680
Is that something that we
can relate to 14th Amendment?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.810
Do people, visitors from
outside the United States,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.455
are they considered, basically,
subjects to 14th Amendment?

00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:26.940
ABDI SOLTANI: So being
Iranian-American and working

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.260
at the ACLU, the whole run up
in the presidential election

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.410
with the language of the Muslim
ban was quite alarming to me,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.290
to other people
who are Muslim or

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.760
from Muslim-majority countries.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.460
But I think it was
alarming to everyone

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.700
because our country has a
tradition of religious liberty

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.560
and religious freedom.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.900
And the statements
of candidate Trump

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.430
were incredibly toxic in
terms of speaking those words

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.450
about making people of a
religion a suspect class

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.240
or a suspect group.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.240
Already, his statements
as a candidate

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.420
had a horrible effect,
because they gave voice

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.120
and they legitimized the
idea that we can discriminate

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.280
based on religion.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.740
Within days of
becoming president,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.500
I think it's one of his
very first executive actions

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.240
was the first Muslim ban.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.510
So in the design of our
system of government,

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.080
preceding the 14th Amendment
in the Bill of Rights

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.360
is also the Fifth Amendment.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.050
The Fifth Amendment is the
same due process clause

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.440
that says that before a person
can have their life, liberty,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.220
or property taken, there has
to be due process of law.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.080
Due process means
that there has to be

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.170
a rational basis to the
decision of the government.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.700
There has to be notice.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.860
There has to be a hearing.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.550
Usually, in the
criminal context,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.486
that means there
has to be evidence,

00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:01.110
that you have an
opportunity to respond

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.210
to the evidence, et cetera.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.920
Due process is fundamental
to the rule of law,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.860
and by extension, the equal
protection under the law.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.000
So the 14th Amendment--
we don't usually

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.490
have to go to the
14th Amendment.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.010
We can often go straight
to the Fifth Amendment,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.410
where it deals with the
federal government itself.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.730
And we also have the
nation's immigration laws

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.310
that are enacted by
statute that you can also

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.470
protect someone's rights.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.330
So why was the Muslim
ban 1.0 so offensive

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.460
to our constitutional rights?

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.850
First of all, it was the
embodiment of the statements

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.100
that Donald Trump
had made that he

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.550
wants to ban the entry of
Muslims into the United States.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.660
It was the way in which his
government officials could

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.910
give life to that promise.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.170
It wasn't every Muslim
from every country.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.010
They had to cabinet to
what his people thought

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.510
they could pull off.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.700
What was also so
offensive about it

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.590
was that there are
people who were literally

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.640
on airplanes, people who had a
visa in their hand, people who

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.391
were landing on the
shores or in the airplanes

00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:14.890
or airports of the United States
who were being denied entry

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.841
or who were being turned away.

00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:18.340
More than that,
there are people who

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.400
are green card holders who are
being intimidated into giving

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.230
up their green cards.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.770
None of that had any
due process of law.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.430
What I love about the court
decisions of those days

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.610
is that it said
that even if you're

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.650
a person who has
not yet even set

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.110
foot on United States soil--

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.470
that you had gone to a
consulate in Dubai or in Turkey

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.720
and had gotten a
visa, and you're

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.570
in an airplane coming
to the United States--

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.580
you're still protected by the
Constitution of the United

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.890
States.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.780
You might not be a citizen.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.390
You might not be a legal
permanent resident.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.640
But even as a visa
holder, you're

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.130
entitled to the due process and
equal protection of the law.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.720
But what I was the most
inspired by at the time

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.960
of the first Muslim
ban was not just

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.990
that the ACLU
lawyers went to court

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.170
or that the judges made
the right decisions.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.930
It was the way that the
American people responded.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.310
In 1941, after the
attack on Pearl Harbor

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.880
and the executive order for
Japanese-American internment,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.940
the ACLU here in the
Bay Area, the ACLU

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.090
of Northern California, we
represented Fred Korematsu

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.510
in a case that went to
the US Supreme Court.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.160
At that time, the
number of people

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.530
who spoke up on the side
of Japanese-Americans

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.660
was extremely few.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.850
But when the Muslim
ban was announced,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.300
the American people responded
and rallied around--

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.510
not just the people who were
being detained at airports

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.220
or who were being turned away--

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.200
but they rallied
around the core values

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.900
of this country of
religious liberty,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.679
of welcoming people to
our shore as immigrants,

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:05.220
and all of those
traditions that have

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.370
made us proud to be Americans.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.700
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.480
But if we want to go back to
the 14th Amendment itself,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.470
are there areas that the
14th Amendment is under--

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.370
are there areas
where we can improve?

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.510
Where are the places where
14th Amendment is not

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.440
being completely followed
or observed that we

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.190
think we have to invest on?

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.130
ABDI SOLTANI: So the
reason, this year, I'm

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.130
speaking even more about the
14th Amendment is that this

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.300
is the 150th anniversary
of the ratification

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.210
of the 14th Amendment.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.700
It was adopted in
1868, just a few years

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.160
after the end of the Civil War.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.800
And over the course
of this 150 years

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.190
where we've had
the 14th Amendment,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.660
it's remarkable to really
look at that history.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.940
In the 10 years after
the abolition of slavery

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.080
is this period called
Reconstruction, in which

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.770
the United States made
incredible progress

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.860
in advancing the right
to vote, education,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:16.760
economic opportunity for and
by the newly freed slaves.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.990
The way in which the
African-American community

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.320
and their allies among many
other Americans-- including,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.050
at the time, the radical
Republicans in Congress--

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.160
were able to seize that moment
and make very fast progress

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.360
is one of the most inspiring
periods in American history.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.420
I would argue that the period
from the abolition of slavery,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.280
that first decade--

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.970
more was done to advance
liberty than even

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.610
the first American Revolution.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.310
To go from the
condition of slavery

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.370
to the gains of
the Reconstruction

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.230
is the farthest distance in
the advancement of liberty

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.460
in American history, full stop.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.920
The period of the American
Revolution initially,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.430
with the Constitution,
is remarkably important.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.550
But the American Revolution
and the original Constitution

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.070
also strengthened the
institution and the law

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.790
on the side of slavery.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.120
It was written into
the Constitution.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.380
It took the Civil War and
the Reconstruction movement

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.870
to break down the
way in which slavery

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.370
was written into
our Constitution

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.170
and make those advances.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.440
That period of 10 years of
Reconstruction's progress

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.110
came to a very
rapid halt and was

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.230
replaced by a very long
period of Jim Crow--

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.930
is the term for
legalized segregation.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.680
That segregation included the
force and power of state laws,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.970
of federal laws.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.320
It also included
horribly unjust decisions

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.510
of the Supreme Court
of the United States

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.720
in a series of
decisions that took back

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.070
many of the gains of
the 14th Amendment.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.530
It was also backed by violence--

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.910
through widespread violence,
fear and intimidation

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.320
against black people,
as well as whites

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.330
who were involved in
voter registration

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.400
or on the side of
equality, as well.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.440
Although the magnitude
of the attack was most

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.640
pronounced against
African-Americans.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.480
That period of Jim Crow,
or legalized segregation,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.730
lasted for a very long
time until the Civil Rights

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.510
movement.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.070
So I think we have to look
at the long arc of the United

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.600
States.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.170
The American Revolution,
the original Constitution,

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.520
the Bill of Rights--

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.860
they are profoundly
important advances

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.280
for human liberty and
equality, the struggle

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.770
to abolish slavery, the
period of Reconstruction.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.020
The movement to secure the
right to vote for women--

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.110
it's one of the longest
movements if you look

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.850
at the duration of time that
it took from the time that we

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.080
secured the 15th Amendment,
which protects the right

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.140
to vote regardless of race--
the 15th Amendment was one

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.530
of the three
post-slavery amendments--

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.870
that was adopted in 1870.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.980
It took another 50
years, until 1920,

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.740
when the 19th Amendment
protected the right

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.380
to vote regardless of sex.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.780
So I think we have to
take a bit of a long view

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.830
of American history.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.410
We are in a period where a
lot of fundamental rights

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.790
are under attack.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.530
We've been through that before.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.990
And the only way we've
gotten through it

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.710
is by every person standing
up on the side of equality

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.260
and freedom and justice
and using their voice

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.250
for those enduring values.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.810
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.850
Now going back to the discussion
that we started on travel ban,

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.010
and later on, I guess,
family separation falls

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:55.020
into the same category,
we saw extreme support

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.460
from people who thought
that this is unjust.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.320
This shouldn't be happening.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.020
People are going to
airport, very heartwarming.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.590
Although the family
separation issue is ongoing,

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:13.320
we just recently heard that
another 1,500 cases of kids

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.607
that were put under care,
as their cases are missing,

00:16:18.607 --> 00:16:20.190
and they cannot be
tracked, and so on.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.930
So that issue is ongoing.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.670
But the point that
I want to get to

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.260
is that there was this
political atmosphere that

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.330
allowed these two rather
cruel acts to go into effect.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.880
A few years ago, like,
probably, five, 10 years ago,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.420
it would have been unimaginable,
things like this happening.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.910
Like, singling out
Muslims, or separating

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.840
children from their families in
the way it happened and so on.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.530
What happened in our
political atmosphere that

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.110
allowed for things like
this to actually happen

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.251
in the first place?

00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:57.500
So what was the root cause,
and how can we prevent it?

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.440
How can we address the root
causes of this situation,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.339
of anything like this
being even accepted?

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:07.819
ABDI SOLTANI: You know, I think
that there's maybe, like--

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.589
I'm going to simplify
this a little bit,

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.960
but maybe two
categories of people.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.490
There's the category
of people who

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.030
after Trump won, woke up
and were kind of shocked

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.260
that this could happen.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.599
You know, like, how
is it even possible

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.970
that a person who says
the things they do

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.784
could win the election?

00:17:24.784 --> 00:17:26.200
And then there's
a second category

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.200
of people who've been actually
dealing with and facing

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.110
pretty deep-seated
discrimination in the United

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.260
States that has
had very deep roots

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.130
and for whom this was
actually the manifestation

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:44.410
of that exact existing
set of problems.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.030
I think whichever
way one looks at it,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.400
the current situation,
in terms of the policies

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.660
of this administration,
are at a different level

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.930
in terms of their
cruelty, in terms

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:04.400
of how patently they are
designed to carry out

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.130
a policy of exclusion.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.890
Going back to the
14th Amendment,

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.970
of which I'm very fond--

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.860
you know the 14th Amendment
is a chain of words

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.090
that says all persons born
or naturalized in the United

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.440
States and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof are

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.600
citizens of the United States
and of the state wherein

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.670
they reside.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:36.960
This sentence represents a
path from person to citizen.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.350
And I think that we have
to be very clear eyed,

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.690
that the totality
of the policies

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:46.550
of the current administration
is to stop every possible point

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.210
in that path.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.030
So it includes the
mass deportation

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:57.010
of undocumented immigrants
without due process.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.730
It includes reducing
dramatically the number

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.790
of refugees that the
United States will

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.320
permit to come to the country.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.990
A new policy that we have seen
through leaked news reports

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.930
is this idea of public charge.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.390
Historically, the United
States would deny a path

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.500
to citizenship for a person
who was institutionalized

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.420
in the care of the government.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.160
The idea was that you
have to be somewhat

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.280
self-sufficient to be able to
get through the immigration

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.720
process.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.970
They now want to
change that definition

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.610
to include just
about anybody who

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:38.630
has received any form of
services from the government.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.990
So that's another
attempt to limit

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.800
that path to legal immigration.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.820
So I think that that's a major
cumulative set of policies

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.230
that's designed to keep the
United States demographically

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.910
from changing and its intended
purpose is to keep people out--

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:04.570
and very much from Latin
America, Central America,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.780
Africa, Asia, et cetera.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.730
The idea of family--

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.870
chain migration, which
they are also focusing on,

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.330
has been the main vehicle
through which Asian-Americans

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.760
have immigrated to
the United States.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.210
There's really nobody who
is immune to these policies

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.610
of exclusion.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.890
At the same time,
there's a set of policies

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.710
that are aimed at
the rules of the game

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.530
and the way in which power
itself is distributed.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.120
So the attack on the right to
vote with the concerted efforts

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.530
at voter suppression, the
political gerrymandering

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.120
of districts so that it reduces
the influence of each voter

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.250
in their state or federal
government, the inclusion

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:53.180
of the question about
citizenship in the census

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.040
that has the intended
effect both of

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.280
intimidating people
from taking the census,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.310
but also of creating the record
by which then the government

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.510
can allocate differentially
certain benefits by population

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.150
according to citizen,
instead of according

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.620
to the number of persons.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.530
So this is all very serious.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.890
And I think that we
have to be involved

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.770
in speaking up for basic
principles of equality,

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.940
fairness, and freedom.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.770
So the 14th Amendment, you know,
how it itself plays into it

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.640
is very much at the center
of a lot of these debates.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.550
The equal protection
of the law--

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.480
well, who does that apply to?

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.360
Those words, equal
protection of the law,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.940
did not make it into
the Constitution

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.700
until the 14th Amendment.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.650
Those are the words
based on which

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:52.090
we've made a lot of the gains
for lesbian and gay couples

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.660
to have equal access to
marriage or to other government

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.100
benefits.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.490
So our view is that that
principle of equal protection

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.370
needs to be robust
and inclusive,

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:08.250
and it needs to be a force
to combat discrimination.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.240
Other people can view equal
protection very narrowly

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.712
and try to limit
its application.

00:22:14.712 --> 00:22:16.170
And so that's going
to be something

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:21.640
that gets fought in the Supreme
Court in the coming decades.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.172
SPEAKER 1: So I
want to move to some

00:22:24.172 --> 00:22:27.850
of the topics that are more
related to practical aspects

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.900
of ACLU's work.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.810
So we've heard about People
Power, the grassroots efforts

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.400
that ACLU is instantiating
around the country.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.700
Can you tell us a little
bit about People Power,

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.970
and what are the ambitions, what
are the goals and objectives--

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.910
where we are, and
how we can help.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.510
ABDI SOLTANI: So I spoke before
about the 14th Amendment.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.120
But I also want people to know
I'm a big fan of the First

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.610
Amendment.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.020
And you can think about
the First Amendment

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.990
as something that's
a legal protection.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.860
But it's actually an incredibly
beautiful and poetic.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.330
And if you haven't
taken the time

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.040
to read the First
Amendment recently,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.050
I'd really encourage you to.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.260
It says that Congress
shall pass no law abridging

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.270
the freedom of religion
or to establish religion,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:18.810
that Congress can pass no law
limiting the freedom of speech,

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.990
or the right of the people
to peaceably assemble,

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.830
or the right and the
freedom of the press.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.830
And then the First
Amendment culminates in that

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:34.000
the government cannot
limit our right to petition

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.100
the government for a
redress of grievances.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.490
So when you read the First
Amendment as a whole.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:45.170
it begins from the place of our
inner beliefs and our values--

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.720
both the idea that the
government cannot tell you

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.600
your religion nor can
the government deny you

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.980
your religion.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.620
And the case on
the First Amendment

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.350
has evolved to be clear
that religion includes

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.360
your conscience,
in many instances,

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.230
like your secular beliefs
that are deeply held.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.870
And then from there, it goes
to your freedom of speech

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.590
and of the press and your
power to assemble as a group,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.440
and then petition the government
for a redress of grievances.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.410
So it's a chain
from your beliefs

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.930
to your relationship
to government.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.780
And this is a very simple
point that I'm making.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.040
There's a beautiful book written
called "Madison's Music."

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.020
It's about looking at
the First Amendment

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.880
as a holistic principle.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.950
So to your question about People
Power, our view at the ACLU

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.490
is that the kinds of assaults
that we're facing on our rights

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.870
are not ones that we can
secure only through the courts.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.650
They require the
participation of people

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.680
in the exercise of
their freedom of speech,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.800
in their assembling
together peacefully,

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.930
and in petitioning
the government.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.660
That is the First
Amendment itself.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.370
So PeoplePower.org is
a new flank of the ACLU

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.300
that's an online platform
that allows people to organize

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.990
in defense of their liberties,
in defense of equality,

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.810
in association with the ACLU.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.910
And for us, as a long
time legal organization,

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.850
this was a recognition
that, while we're

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.010
going to continue
to go to court,

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.670
the ultimate defense of
liberty is people's involvement

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.620
exercising their
First Amendment rights

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.055
through organized campaigns like
we offer on PeoplePower.org.

00:25:30.055 --> 00:25:30.930
SPEAKER 1: Very well.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:31.840
Thank you.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.450
So you mentioned
First Amendment.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.139
And I want to ask a question
that is a little bit related

00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:36.930
to First Amendment.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.390
So this is a discussion that
these days is being discussed

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.480
in the media to some extent.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.290
Some people are worried
about giving platforms,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.550
unintentionally giving
platform, to hateful speech.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.390
But this is not the first
time that hateful speech

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.460
is appearing.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.290
The incident of William
Shockley and Yale University

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.500
from the 70s, that's
a very famous one.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.090
What happened afterwards,
there was this postmortem,

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.770
this discussion of what
are the boundaries, what

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.830
are the sort of speech that we
have to allow to take place.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.220
And we know that the ACLU
has been on forefront

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.500
of defending First Amendment.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.690
What are your advices?

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.530
What are your
thoughts or mindset

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.090
on how we should
set the boundary,

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:34.470
where should we draw the line
between speech that is not

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.360
going to be tolerated
and something

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.164
that has to be tolerated,
no matter what?

00:26:38.164 --> 00:26:39.080
Where is the boundary?

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.170
What is a guideline?

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.270
ABDI SOLTANI: So this
is a great question,

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:48.120
and one that is the subject of
a great deal of legal thought,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.240
social science thought, and
people's own conversations

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.880
about what is that line.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.090
I think the basic
principle of the ACLU

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.440
is that we do not want to give
that power to the government

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.090
to decide who can say what
and when they can say it.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.510
One of the earliest, and
one of the famous cases

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.240
that the ACLU brought here
in Northern California,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.040
was the case in a poem called
"Howl" by Allen Ginsberg.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.850
So if anyone goes to North Beach
neighborhood in San Francisco,

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.160
you'll come across
City Lights Bookstore.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.650
And they were the publisher--

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.720
with Lawrence Ferlinghetti--
the publisher of Allen Ginsberg,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.830
the poet of this beautiful
poem called "Howl."

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.260
The poem talks about gay sex.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.120
It talks about drug use.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.130
It talks about depression.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:43.800
And those things were considered
offensive and obscene.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.100
And for that reason,
that poem was censored,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.430
I believe, by the postal service
that wouldn't distribute it.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.580
So we went to court.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.970
This is the 1950s.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.640
And won a ruling on the side
that this poem can and should

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.790
be published and the government
cannot censor something

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.660
because someone
considers it obscene.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.350
I think as time has
passed, a lot of people

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.510
have kind of lost track of that.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.460
And there's a sense
that if there's

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.140
language that's
hateful, if there's

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.230
language that's discriminatory,
that we should give

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.260
the government the power,
in one form or another,

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.000
to limit the expression
of that view.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.840
And the ACLU-- we still
stand by the principle

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.980
that that would be a really
dangerous path to go down.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.270
It is dangerous for
a number of reasons.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.140
One is that we don't believe
that force or government

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.440
power should be used to suppress
the ability of a human being

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.000
to express a point of view.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.160
Beyond that, once you create
that basis and legal precedent,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.800
or in other places, that
will be used in all manner

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.100
to restrict all forms of
expression that someone

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.480
finds offensive, or
discriminatory, or the like.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.970
Now what are the limits to that?

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.660
One is the limit of
a threat of violence.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.700
If there's a
statement that is made

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.930
that's targeted an individual,
and it's a threat of violence,

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.730
that's different.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.850
Another would be, like, sexual
harassment or racial harassment

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.480
in the workplace or in a school,
where a person should have

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.510
the right to free
employment and education,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.010
free from discrimination.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.980
So there are places where
there's a limit to it.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.160
You know, Google being
a technology company,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.170
one of the big challenges
is on platforms like YouTube

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.420
or social media
platforms, which is

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.480
an inordinately complex area.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.390
But we're mindful of
how do you make sure

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.180
that you don't hand that
power to large corporations

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.400
to then be the deciders
of what can be said

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.350
and what can't be said.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.640
But some of this language does
cross the line into threats.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.930
And so how do you manage that?

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.650
That's the problem that the
ACLU is concerned about and one

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.570
that I know companies
are also dealing with.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:00.940
SPEAKER 1: So what are the
dangers of overreaction here?

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.610
So that's something that we
see on the progressive side,

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.220
people, like, being
really worried.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.640
Are you yourself worried?

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.930
Is there any sort of advice
that we can make to people who--

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.812
may be studying about past?

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:16.270
Because this is
not the first time,

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.640
this isn't the first episode
of things like this happening.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.014
ABDI SOLTANI: You
know, my advice

00:30:20.014 --> 00:30:24.160
would be let's say there's a
speaker who has been invited

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.590
to come to a university.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.070
And there's a group of
people who object strongly

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.640
to the points of view that that
person has expressed before.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.020
It is equally a freedom of
speech of those protesters

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.000
to protest that
speaker's coming.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.550
At the same time, you can
also just ignore the person

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.370
and not give them the
platform of the conflict

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.810
that they're also looking for.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.470
But I would just
say that I don't

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:56.780
think it's wise to try
to shut down the speaker

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.170
and to use the protest for
the purpose of shutting down

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.370
the speaker.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:05.150
I think that that goes
really into an area that's

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.380
not within the realm
of a free society.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.750
And as satisfying
as that might be,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.700
the way that that
plays out over time,

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.280
it does not lead to
a good destination.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.710
Someone might say, well, giving
these people the platform

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.020
to speak will also not
lead to a good destination.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.960
But I think we have
to be wise in how

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.600
do we make the choices
about how we protest,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.270
how we exercise our
freedom of speech

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.260
to lead us down a path towards
actual freedom and actually

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.840
equality.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.620
So when a person
is coming to speak,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.680
and if you object to
what they have to say,

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.340
you can exercise your
freedom of speech vigorously,

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.440
and you can protest
it, and that, too,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.330
is the freedom of speech.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.280
But I would just
say where it crosses

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.150
a line is where we expect
government authorities to be

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.800
the ones to censor
someone or where

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:04.090
we use our protests in order
to shut other people down.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.395
I think that's a line
that's not worth crossing--

00:32:06.395 --> 00:32:07.270
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:07.769
So--

00:32:07.769 --> 00:32:10.234
ABDI SOLTANI: --or even
appropriate to cross.

00:32:10.234 --> 00:32:11.900
SPEAKER 1: ACLU of
Northern California--

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.820
I want to talk about some
California-specific issues.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.620
In particular,
criminal justice reform

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.520
is one of the areas of interest
that you have been, yourself,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.010
very active in.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.290
Can you tell us a little
bit about the activities

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:30.629
at Northern California
ACLU, taking on that regard?

00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:31.420
ABDI SOLTANI: Yeah.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.690
So you know, when
you get into reading

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.180
the Constitution and
especially the Bill of Rights,

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.450
the original 10
Amendments, a lot of it

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.600
is about the operation of
the criminal justice system.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.910
The Fourth Amendment
is the right

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.390
to be secure in our persons
from unreasonable search

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.650
and seizure.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.650
The Fifth Amendment is
a due process provision.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.110
The Eighth Amendment protects
us from cruel and unusual

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.460
punishment.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.920
So for an organization
whose mission

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.130
is to provide for and
protect constitutional rights

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.890
for everyone, the
criminal justice system

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.400
becomes, by definition, a
central part of the work

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.310
that the ACLU does
today and has done

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:17.440
for the better part of a
century of being in existence.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.980
Beginning in the
1980s especially,

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.840
the set of policies in the war
on drugs and other policies

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.250
really led to this rapid growth
in our criminal justice system,

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.920
what we call mass incarceration.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.530
And that period also marks
a very rapid increase

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.520
in the number of
people of color,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.570
especially African-Americans,
as well as Latinos,

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:48.860
being part of that
system of incarceration.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.080
In the arc of what
we were talking

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.240
about with the 14th
Amendment, there's

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.840
a wonderful book written by
Michelle Alexander called

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.450
"The New Jim Crow" that a
lot of people have read.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.640
It's gotten a lot of attention.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.970
And Michelle makes the
argument that the system

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:09.080
of mass incarceration became
the next manifestation

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.170
of the previous system
of racial segregation

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.290
that was created after the
period of Reconstruction.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.010
And this became the
new, legalized way

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.610
in which to promote inequality
after the gains of the Civil

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.100
Rights movement.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.000
So all of that to say that this
is an incredibly important area

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.199
of work.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:34.929
Over the last eight or so years,
the California legislature,

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.600
California voters,
Governor Brown

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.630
have enacted a set of reforms
to reduce the number of people

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.130
incarcerated.

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.710
Initially, part of the
pressure was the recession.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.409
There was pressure to
cut government, state,

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:48.699
and local government spending.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:51.370
And incarceration is
a pretty unwise use

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.380
of resources, especially
the way we've been doing it.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.340
But it was also prompted partly
by a Supreme Court decision

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.230
in a case called
Plata that dealt

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.480
with the condition of
incarceration in our state

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.250
prisons.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.590
So right now, today,
there are a couple

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.630
of places where we
really urge people

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.030
to be attentive and involved.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.690
The first is our
county prosecutors,

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.890
which in California are
called district attorneys,

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:21.470
they are the most important
actor in the criminal justice

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.890
system.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:27.420
When you think about this
problem, 90%, plus or minus

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.930
of incarcerated people are
held either in local government

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.730
or state government.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.620
This problem of
mass incarceration--

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.510
there are federal issues
that are involved,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.550
but it's very much a
county and a state issue.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:46.110
So every person should know
who is your elected district

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.220
attorney.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.250
If you live in Santa Clara
County, San Mateo County,

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.550
or if you're watching
this anywhere else,

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.690
there is someone in
your county government

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.990
who is your representative,
the advocate of the people

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.110
in the criminal justice system.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.310
And at the ACLU,
we're asking people

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.350
to know who that official is.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.470
Call that office and ask
them to pursue policies

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.100
that reduce incarceration,
that promote alternatives

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.080
to incarceration.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.630
So that's one major area.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.890
And I mean, for the
people in the room,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.280
raise your hand if you know
who your district attorney is

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.010
for your county.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.110
So for the people
watching on the webcast,

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.360
there's a lot of shrugging
and very interesting

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.420
facial expressions that
all say we don't know.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.760
So I would make that
your assignment today.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.390
Look up who is your
county district attorney,

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.900
and make a phone call
to that office and say,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.070
I am concerned about
the fact that I

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.080
live in a country
that is the world's

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.880
leader in incarceration.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.540
And I'd like to know what are
the steps your office is taking

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.240
to dramatically reduce the
number of people who are locked

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.780
behind bars, to find
alternatives to incarceration

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.610
for people with mental
health problems,

00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:00.300
or for people who can be
set on a different path.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.610
And then centrally,
what steps are you

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.450
taking to address
racial inequality

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:10.400
in the decision of who to charge
and what charges to pursue?

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.770
I think for any of
us, whether we're

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:16.370
a citizen or a person
who's not a citizen,

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.850
to abrogate our voice in
our criminal justice system

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:24.350
and to not hold these people
who are elected accountable

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.960
is giving up part of
our responsibility.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.000
Because they are carrying out
these policies in our name

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.960
as the elected representative
of the people in court.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.570
So that's part of our
responsibility to check that

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:40.240
and to rein it in.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.300
A second big area is bail.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:49.430
And I think that that's a space
in which we are very active.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:54.620
More than half of the people
who are held in our county jails

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.890
are people who are not yet
found guilty of a crime.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.340
They've been charged
of a crime, and they're

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.570
being held awaiting trial.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.350
In the United States, when
you are charged with a crime,

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.670
you have an opportunity
usually to post bail.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.760
And the Constitution actually
says that there shall not

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.220
be excessive bail.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.710
But when we live in
a time, in an era,

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:23.830
where there's so much
economic inequality,

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:30.370
most Americans cannot handle
like a $400 car emergency,

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:34.630
let alone have to pay tens of
thousands of dollars in bail

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.260
to await trial outside of jail.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.750
So what you do is, you post a
bond through a commercial bail

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.610
bond company.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.250
The commercial bail bond
industry, the way it works

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:54.620
is that, if your bail is, say,
$50,000, the $10,000 of it

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.600
is nonrefundable.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.920
So even if you show up to
court, you don't get that back.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.420
And so for a lot of people, that
then creates this cycle of debt

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.520
and contributes to poverty.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.240
And so even if you're innocent,
even if you meet every court

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.090
date, you're still left
with that economic penalty.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.820
So replacing bail
requires us to be

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.250
very thoughtful about
what do we replace

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.260
the system of
commercial bail with.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.720
I don't think there's
much to be said in defense

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.550
of commercial money bail.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:34.430
It's kind of hard to justify
the idea that a person who

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:39.080
has money can secure their
freedom through bail,

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.720
and a person who
doesn't languishes

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.550
in jail awaiting trial.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.690
It's pretty hard to
defend that system.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.660
I think we've done a good job
of making the case for why

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.490
we need to make the switch.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.140
But I think that
the alternative is

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.660
one that needs to be very
carefully thought through

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.890
to be one that
reduces incarceration

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.620
while people await trial.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.260
And we could talk about that
some more if you'd like.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.009
AUDIENCE: Didn't the
city of San Francisco

00:40:05.009 --> 00:40:08.990
just pass something that
eliminates the requirement

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.430
of bail, or the--

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:11.180
ABDI SOLTANI: Yes.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.780
So it's a great question about
whether San Francisco voted

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.030
to end bail.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:21.110
There's a movement around the
country to end commercial bail

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.730
and switch to a system where a
person can receive services, be

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.340
out of jail while
they're awaiting trial.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.160
With rare exceptions,
if the person poses

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.480
like an imminent threat
to public safety.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:41.120
A lot of local jurisdictions
are adopting reforms to bail.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.220
There's another related
issue, which is around

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.610
fines and fees that are
charged to criminal defendants,

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.390
or people who've been in jail.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.350
And jurisdictions like San
Francisco and Alameda County

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:54.320
are moving in the direction
of eliminating those.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.730
But California has
not eliminated--

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:02.300
well, the legislature
just passed a bill, SB10,

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.060
that the ACLU originally
sponsored and supported.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.480
But we ultimately withdrew
our support and opposed it.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.870
What SB10 does is it ends
commercial cash bail.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.430
But what it created
as an alternative

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.080
creates too much detention.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.020
There's big categories
of people who

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.480
will be presumed to be
held in jail we just

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.640
felt that that is not the
direction that the bail

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.660
reform needs to go.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.680
AUDIENCE: Data shows that school
segregation is getting worse

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.070
what do you consider as a
successful long term plan

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:38.244
to improve the integration?

00:41:38.244 --> 00:41:39.660
ABDI SOLTANI: Wow,
great question.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.850
That question is from
Anonymous-- good job,

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:44.010
Anonymous.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.160
You know, the relationship
of school segregation

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:52.330
really also goes with housing
and residential segregation.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:56.070
So when it comes to actual
segregation in terms

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:59.280
of schools, after
the Brown versus

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.080
Board of Education
decision in 1954,

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:08.790
which is as important a
Supreme Court as we have had,

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.070
what that said is that
we will not tolerate

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.500
separate and equal schools.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.000
And there was a set
of policies that

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.820
went into place to create
integration and provide

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.060
more access to equal
educational opportunities.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.820
Subsequent Supreme
Court decisions

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.990
said that that
responsibility does not

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.180
cross school districts.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.330
It's only within a
given school district.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:34.110
So to the extent that our
neighborhoods and our cities

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:38.990
are so segregated that people
cannot afford to live anywhere

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.530
in Santa Clara County or Alameda
County because of the cost

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:46.430
of housing or in the vicinity
of a school district,

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:50.240
it's very difficult under
current Supreme Court precedent

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.410
to create more diverse schools
across those school district

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.670
lines.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.860
Within a school district,
school districts

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.870
can actually adopt
a number of policies

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.860
to make sure that the
schools are diverse.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.550
And actually, the
ACLU has had a number

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.010
of cases here in California
that tried to do that

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.950
within the bounds of state law.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.850
There's a Proposition 209, which
eliminated affirmative action

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.340
based on race or
gender, that also

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.500
has this negative
effect on the ability

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.050
to create diversity in schools.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:24.300
But there's ways to do
it still within the law.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.330
On education, though, there's
a whole set of other issues

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.990
that deal with access to
adequate funding for low income

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.030
kids and kids of color.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:37.590
Also, one of the big issues we
deal with is the significant

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:41.550
racial inequality in school
suspensions and expulsions,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.500
where the research shows that
for very similar behavior,

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.850
especially-- the most
extreme is black boys--

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:50.550
face very harsh
punishment compared

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.110
to other kids in the schools.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.800
So those are a set of
issues around education

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.020
in which we're very active.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.970
AUDIENCE: The preamble
to the First Amendment

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.995
says Congress shall pass
no law, dot, dot, dot.

00:44:02.995 --> 00:44:04.620
And it seems that
there is a great deal

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:11.010
of misunderstanding in the
populace about that part of it.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.130
Can you comment on the
legal ramifications

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.600
of, say, the social
media ban of Alex Jones?

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.140
ABDI SOLTANI: Yeah, so the
First Amendment, as you said,

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.620
does say Congress
shall pass no law.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.600
And then it goes on
to fill that out.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:35.250
So that has been understood to
mean that a mayor, a president,

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.670
a sheriff, a school principal--

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.980
that they can not
unconstitutionally

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.890
violate your freedom
of speech, as well.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.460
So the Congress shall
pass no law is inclusive

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.410
of other actors in government.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:54.100
And actually, it's
the 14th Amendment--

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.950
and part of why
it's so powerful--

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.840
is that it's the
14th Amendment that

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.610
took the rest of
the Bill of Rights

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.640
and applied it to local
and state government.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.570
Until that time, something
like the First Amendment

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.910
didn't yet apply to
schools or to cities.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.760
So the 14th Amendment sweeps
in the rest the Constitution

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.110
and applies it to
local government.

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.860
But the First Amendment
itself does not directly

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.100
regulate private conduct.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.160
The First Amendment
doesn't limit my ability

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.800
to speak to you, and it
has limited applications

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.660
when it comes to private
companies or private platforms.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.470
Even its reach in private
universities is limited.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.520
So there is some ways in which
the First Amendment is limited.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.770
But I think the principle
of freedom of expression

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.750
is one that we embrace and want
to apply in as many settings as

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:48.250
possible.

00:45:53.085 --> 00:45:54.960
AUDIENCE: So next question
on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.760
is that what are
learnings and guidance

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.920
we can take from that
period of Reconstruction

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.160
to launch a movement for
equality and renewed commitment

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.870
to constitutional
rights for all?

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.779
How do we not repeat
elements of history?

00:46:08.779 --> 00:46:10.570
ABDI SOLTANI: So thank
you for the question

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.664
about Reconstruction.

00:46:12.664 --> 00:46:14.830
I think for anyone, if you
didn't hear the question,

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.660
it's what are the
lessons we can take

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.400
from the period
of Reconstruction

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.410
that we can apply today?

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.930
And also, how can we make
sure that we don't make

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.480
the same mistakes in the past?

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.690
There's some really incredible
books written on this subject.

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:34.220
In the last three years,
I've read more books

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.874
than I think I did
cumulatively in all of college.

00:46:36.874 --> 00:46:38.540
Because I've been
really trying to learn

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.350
about this period
of American history,

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:44.060
which is full of
important lessons.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.300
I would say the first and
foremost, the bedrock lesson,

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.760
is the importance of
protecting the right to vote,

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:56.480
but also exercising the right
to vote and running for office.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.640
The period of Reconstruction,
in just a few short years,

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.910
there were thousands
of African-Americans

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:06.140
who ran for and were elected to
office throughout the country.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.690
And I am actually
quite heartened to see

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:10.730
how much energy there
is right now in both

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:13.460
protecting voting rights,
but also encouraging people

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:18.890
to vote and people showing
more energy in that area.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.340
But the great
warning of the period

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.350
of the end of
Reconstruction is the way

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:27.790
in which the courts can really
abandon their responsibility

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:31.270
when it comes to
equality and freedom.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:34.270
And that's where it's so
incumbent on all of us

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:38.030
to-- you know, not all
of us can be a judge.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.840
And so we have other branches
of government in which

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.270
we can exercise our power.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:44.980
And for the people
who are involved

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.560
in the judicial system, it
is so important for them

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:52.710
to uphold the rule of law and
the principles of equality.

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:54.640
There's a set of
Supreme Court decisions

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.250
that very quickly came
one after the other.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:01.370
The most famous is
Plessy versus Ferguson,

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:06.520
which allowed for explicit
racial discrimination to stand,

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.430
even though we had just
abolished slavery and passed

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.370
these incredible constitutional
amendments and statutes.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:15.330
So I would just
say we have to just

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:20.680
be super alert, super active,
and do everything we can

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.380
in every facet of our lives.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.220
And on that point,
what I would just say

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:30.910
is we have certain rights and
responsibilities as persons,

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.550
whether we're citizens or not.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.450
We should use those.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:37.260
We have certain rights and
responsibilities as citizens,

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.400
uniquely-- for example,
the right to vote.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.310
We should use those.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.140
We also have rights
and responsibilities

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.690
in our companies and
in our associations.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.890
And so for people
who work in Google,

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.030
you know, your company
has incredible reach,

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.800
incredible power.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.780
And as you're
looking at the future

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.690
of artificial intelligence,
or the applications

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:01.590
of your technology, there
are enormous consequences

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.770
for freedom, for
liberty, for equality

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.650
that you, as the stewards
of this technology,

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:09.090
are actually in
the best position

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:12.450
to see and address
at the source.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.720
Ultimately, policymakers and the
public have to weigh in, too.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.940
But I think you all
have a certain set

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.850
of responsibilities that I
would really encourage you to--

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.970
in many ways, you
already do exercise

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.680
with a great deal
of responsibility.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.710
And I would really encourage
you to embrace that role

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:32.880
as being that guardian, right at
the source of the code itself,

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:38.278
or as the application or
the idea is being developed.

00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:40.620
AUDIENCE: Question?

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.650
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
are there any active efforts

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.330
going on in ACLU to
fight the travel ban?

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.280
If yes, what, and if not, why?

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.380
ABDI SOLTANI: OK.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:59.490
So the Supreme Court
upheld the Travel Ban 3.0.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:03.660
And the Supreme Court's
say is the final say

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.660
when it comes to
the judicial system.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.390
The way in which
we will continue

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:11.300
to fight the travel
ban, ultimately,

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:15.050
will be through
legislation in Congress.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.390
Congress can change that.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:21.860
A future president or a future
administration can revoke it,

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.400
can change it.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.680
Ultimately, there will
also be other cases

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.180
that will go up to the courts.

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.600
So on July 5th, the ACLU
of Northern California

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.800
filed a case on behalf of an
Iranian-American family related

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.550
to how they were being treated
under the waiver provisions,

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:43.210
or under other provisions
that should be in place.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:47.280
So the short answer to your
question is we will not rest,

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:52.170
and we will not give up, until
this policy of the Executive

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.060
Branch of the United
States government

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.500
is changed and replaced with
a system of immigration that's

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:03.120
not based on nationality,
or is not based on religion,

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:07.167
or other aspects of protected
human characteristics.

00:51:07.167 --> 00:51:08.625
AUDIENCE: But there
are no active--

00:51:08.625 --> 00:51:11.950
sort of direct
efforts, [INAUDIBLE]??

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:13.060
ABDI SOLTANI: There are.

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:16.450
Some of the groups we work with
have brought a class action

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:20.230
case on the waiver provision.

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:23.140
But there's not a new
path on litigation

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.780
after the Supreme Court
ruled on the issues

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.930
that the court already ruled on.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:31.160
But I think that's where
the family separation

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.960
issue is so important.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.530
That policy of separating
children from their parents

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:40.300
has many of the same
qualities as the travel ban.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.720
It's incredibly cruel,
inhumane, and unjust.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:48.860
It is motivated by the same
basic prejudice and principle

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.530
of trying to deny that
opportunity for people

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.040
to come to the United States.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.830
And it also has all of
the same characteristics

00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:00.190
of being completely
irresponsibly conceived

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:03.670
and executed, such that they
can't even find these children.

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:07.840
So we may need to move
our fight from one

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.160
arena to another arena.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.700
But it's all still protecting
that same principle

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.610
of due process and equal
protection under the law.

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:19.655
And that's where I will
say, as an Iranian-American,

00:52:19.655 --> 00:52:23.710
and as a person who has
earned his citizenship

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:27.030
because of something
like the 14th Amendment--

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.470
and to the question of
what are the lessons--

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:33.310
that's where we all have
to pool our resources

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:37.540
and pool our commitment
not just to protecting

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:42.310
our individual situation, but
protecting that basic principle

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:46.540
of equal protection under the
law, due process, and the rule

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.650
of law.

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.910
If those ideas are strong, they
can be strong for all of us.

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:55.400
But if those ideas become
weak, or if we abandon them

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.370
for one group, it
is the beginning

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:59.840
of abandoning it for everyone.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.690
So the rights of women to birth
control, to contraception,

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.100
to abortion--

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.340
that is a fundamental
issue of equality.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.440
The rights of lesbian
and gay couples

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.280
to love the person that they
love, the right of a person who

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.820
is transgender to live their
life free of discrimination

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.770
and to be able to live
their life safely--

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:24.040
these are issues
that we have to all

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.620
be in the circle of protecting
those freedoms and rights,

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.260
because we're all going
to be in it together.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.840
I think if there's one
lesson from American history,

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.720
it's that.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.050
It's that when we come
together in defense

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:39.400
of that basic set of commitments
and principles, all of us

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.040
do better, every one of us.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.100
When that right starts to
be weakened or abandoned,

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:49.090
then it starts to take it away
from every single one of us.

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:52.510
So to your great question,
I would say we will persist.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.670
And we'll find every
possible avenue

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:57.220
to address the issue
of the Muslim ban.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.890
But the way we will all do
that is by working together

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.205
on the whole package.

00:54:01.205 --> 00:54:04.750
AUDIENCE: In addition to the
important national issues

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:08.740
that you're working on,
what are the specific things

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:12.010
that Google can help to the
ACLU of Northern California?

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:14.170
How can Google as
a company help?

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:16.300
How can we as Googlers help?

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.330
ABDI SOLTANI: You know, I would
just encourage every Google

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:21.790
employee, whether you
work here in Mountain

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.880
View at the headquarters or
anywhere in the United States

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.050
or anywhere in the world,
to please be involved.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:32.470
I would encourage you to have
a plan around the following

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:33.050
things.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.500
One is your
charitable donations.

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.170
The ACLU appreciates
that support,

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:39.970
and we have many
other organizations

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:43.170
we work with that also
need that support.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.360
So I think one is what do
you do in your charitable

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.370
giving as a person.

00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:51.760
I think second is in
terms of your involvement

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.120
in your activism, in
voting, in being involved.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.940
Whether you're a citizen or not,
you have the freedom of speech.

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.700
The right to vote
is the one part

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:04.470
that only a citizen can
do in the United States.

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.900
And then I would
encourage you as people

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:11.220
who work in one of the most
powerful and influential

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:14.490
companies in the world is to
develop products and services

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:17.970
that can facilitate
human communication,

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:20.940
human participation,
and to be really

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:24.990
watchful of those ways in which
your technologies can create

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:27.570
a backdoor towards
abusing people's rights.

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.020
And I think that's a place
where Google employees have

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.800
a disproportionate role
or influence in terms

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.040
of making sure that your
technology facilitates

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.940
human liberty and equality,
as compared to being a tool

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.362
that can be used for
those opposite purposes.

00:55:44.362 --> 00:55:45.570
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much.

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:46.070
Thank you for attending.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:46.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:48.520
ABDI SOLTANI: Thank
you very much.
