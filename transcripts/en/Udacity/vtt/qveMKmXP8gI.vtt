Thanks Chris, for showing us how to multiply and divide fractions. Now, let's

00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:10.680
practice what we learned. There will be several question videos at the end of

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:15.717
each lesson. Let's try a multiplication of fractions question. The first

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.828
question that we want to do is 3 4th times 5 7th. You can put your answer here.
