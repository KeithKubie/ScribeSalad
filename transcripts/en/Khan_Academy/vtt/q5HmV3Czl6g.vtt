00:00:00.153 --> 00:00:01.901
- [Voiceover] All right,
so grammarians, I want to

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.424
talk to you about the difference between

00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:05.903
subject and object pronouns, but before

00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:08.016
we do that, let's start off with a little

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:12.323
primer on what subjects
and objects actually are,

00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:15.270
Just generally for our
grammatical purposes.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.703
In grammar, the subject is
the part of the sentence

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:21.263
or clause that does a thing.

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:24.331
The subject does a thing.

00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.403
The object, on the other hand, is the

00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:30.853
thing that is acted on,
has stuff done to it,

00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:35.853
so the object has stuff done to it.

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:40.877
The subject acts, the
object is acted upon,

00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:43.397
let's give an example.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:48.397
In the sentence, Reina wrote an e-mail,

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.447
the subject of the sentence,
the doer of the thing

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:57.925
is Reina, right, as the subject.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.465
The thing she is doing
is writing an e-mail,

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:02.883
so Reina wrote an e-mail.

00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:06.012
E-mail is the object of the verb wrote.

00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:09.201
It is the object of the sentence.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.660
Now, there are cases when a sentence

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.118
doesn't have an object.

00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:16.577
For example, we could just say

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:20.149
Reina wrote.

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.018
It doesn't have an object, it's just

00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:25.086
Reina's the subject, and
then there is no object.

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:27.748
This is what we call intransitive usage,

00:01:27.748 --> 00:01:31.283
but you don't need to write
that down or anything.

00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:34.554
Now, understanding the relationship

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:37.317
between e-mail and Reina enables you

00:01:37.317 --> 00:01:41.279
to understand how subject
and object pronouns are used.

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.891
When we're subbing out
these nouns for pronouns,

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.431
we can figure out which
ones we have to use,

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:50.320
because pronouns have different forms

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.320
depending on whether or not
they are subjects or objects.

00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:58.697
Reina is a girl's name, and if
we know that Reina is a girl,

00:01:58.697 --> 00:02:03.086
we can refer to her as either she or her.

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:06.987
These are two of the feminine pronouns.

00:02:06.987 --> 00:02:10.156
One of these is a subject,
and one of them is an object.

00:02:10.156 --> 00:02:15.156
She is the subject form,
and her is the object form.

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:20.155
If we wanted to rewrite this sentence,

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:23.528
speaking of Reina, we would say,

00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:28.528
she wrote an e-mail.

00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:36.582
Not, her wrote an e-mail, you see.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.840
Because her is the object pronoun,

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.701
and therefore is the thing that,

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.634
the object pronoun has stuff done to it,

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.544
as opposed to the doer of things.

00:02:50.544 --> 00:02:53.274
She is the subject form, it's the doer.

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:57.338
For e-mail it's easy, this
just becomes it in all cases.

00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:02.260
The subject form, and the
object form are the same.

00:03:03.758 --> 00:03:05.099
Let's do a couple more examples

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.117
just to shore this up
so you see what I mean.

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:14.715
I give her a present.

00:03:16.124 --> 00:03:20.095
Right now, I is the
subject, her is the object.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:24.504
Subject, object, but
what if we switched it?

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.190
What would it look like then?

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.831
Well it wouldn't be her give I a present,

00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:32.610
because since we're switching
the subject and the object,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.138
we're gonna be switching the
pronouns that we use too,

00:03:35.138 --> 00:03:40.138
so it would be, she gave me a present.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.123
Now, she is the

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:52.206
subject form of her,

00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:55.791
and me is the subject, is
the object form, excuse me,

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:58.682
me is the object form of I.

00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:03.377
Get a little period in there.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:07.388
Same thing with they and he.

00:04:07.388 --> 00:04:11.160
They showed

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.832
him a guitar.

00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:17.674
Why not?

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:22.674
They is the subject,
and him is the object.

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:26.702
Let's give it the old switcheroo.

00:04:26.702 --> 00:04:30.347
He showed

00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:34.356
them a guitar.

00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:39.510
Now, we do the switcheroo, him becomes he,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.989
so we go from the object form which is him

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:45.788
to the subject from which is he,

00:04:45.788 --> 00:04:49.547
and then they, the
subject form becomes them,

00:04:49.547 --> 00:04:51.845
the object form.

00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:57.363
Now when it comes to you and it,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.979
you're in luck, because
the subject and object

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.185
forms of these are the same, so subject

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:08.051
equals object,

00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:11.557
with you and it.

00:05:11.557 --> 00:05:14.267
I could say you give it a present

00:05:14.267 --> 00:05:18.746
just as easily as I could
say it gives you a present.

00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:21.408
I didn't realize I changed
this to the past tense.

00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:24.516
She gives me a present.

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:26.955
There we go, that's better.

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:28.722
That's the difference between a subject

00:05:28.722 --> 00:05:30.632
and an object pronoun.

00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:32.123
You can learn anything.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.555
David out.
