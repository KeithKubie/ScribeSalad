Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Eh,

Speaker 3:          00:00:03       will Harris your live man, this is great. You're on the other side of the camera. Now let me give you an introduction for people who don't know. Will is the man behind the anatomy of the fighter, if you ever seen any of those videos, like particularly the most famous one was when Conor McGregor threw that Dolly at the bus with Khabib. NEUROMAG Madoff was on it and it became a huge part of the promotion, which I thought was weird that it was this shameful act, right? That he did that. I mean really awful caught a bunch of innocent people that were on the bus but they use it over and over and over again. That was your footage. A lot of people didn't even know it, including me.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       No one did. Um, you know, I was telling a friend of the day, what's funny, no one has ever heard this. But when it happened, uh, I show it could be at the back of the bus cause he was, had a smile on his face and I showed him and everybody else on the bus that I actually caught condor doing it. Cause they didn't really know it was Connor. So I remember it could be looked at the footage. I was holding the camera and he was like, brother, you can get paid from this. It's like, Bro, this is worth $100,000. He looked at his manager, Ali, a shout out to Ali and he was like, get this, get him, give him some money. He deserves this. And then I gave it to the UFC to use for embedded and um, I thought it, that was just sit and they promoted the fight with it and I was like, damn, I should've just leaned my head to the right and got hit by the Dolly so I could not have to be doing a, you know, a go fund me's and Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:01:29       Well, what you should have done is asked for money for it. That video footage was, it turned out it was very valuable because it set up the fight, which also set up the post-fight brawl. I mean there was, there was so much that was involved in him throwing that Dolly and you caught that video. They played that shit over and over and over. I was actually kind of shocked that they did that because at the time we were like, whoa, Connor might go to jail. That was, that was like legitimate assault.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       They use it the next day. I'm like, I was like, damn, like WME is when I saw it on like, um, when I saw it on Fox News and CNN, I was just like, that's my footage. You know. Cause you know, when you build in a, like a channel or a series like that, you think, oh, this is my moment. Every, everybody has a moment. And unfortunately the UFC promoted it and shout out to them because they've been nothing but good to me. I can't say anything. Uh, I still wish I would've got shot in front of you should've got it.

Speaker 3:          00:02:26       Some friends put, pull this mic up, but just pull it, just get it up there. This from your face. There you go. Right there. Right there. Yeah. No, you do a fantastic job. I mean, you really do. And I, like I said, until that video footage came out, I didn't know that you weren't even a part of the UFC promotion team. I didn't know. I thought maybe WME had hired you and this was another thing that they're working on. I did not know that you were independent.

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       Well, what was crazy is that I started at almost two years ago, um, I was just sitting at home in Florida. I was living in south Florida and I was, I was hanging out with the guys at the black zillions at Jocko. I had stumbled over there one day at the gym and I seen it when I was grocery shopping and I just stopped in and I was doing stuff for Shannon Briggs. Let's go champ, let's go chill. I was just going yet, I was going to the a heavyweight factory. You would, hey, you do all those. I said, no, I wasn't doing this phone videos. What happened was I reached out to him and he invited me to the heavyweight factory. Holyfield Phil was there. Everybody and I just went there a few times and I created some creative videos for them to working out. He was, when I was there, I seen him.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       He still looks good. He does man. He like what? Crazy. He's like 50 something years old. He's 50 years. I got some, I got some amazing stories about like that I've never released about Tyson fight like crazy things like his, his, oh man, I got some stuff. Yeah. Well initially anatomy, if it was just supposed to be a documentary, that was it. And I was that was it just an hour long documentary? Um, I never knew who it could be was and nothing like I just didn't know. I knew Michael Johnson, all these guys because they was at the black zillion. So I knew the first day I ever went in the gym like Michael Chandler, C'mon ooze mind. Shout out to Kumar, who's my, cause I, the first time I ever saw him I thought he was a bum. What? Cause Michael Cherrella gave it to him and I got it on camera and I thought the Chandler was the stud.

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       Right. And then they was like, oh, he won the ultimate fighter, things like that. So that was almost two years ago. You thought he was a bum? Yeah, just cause I saw the day in the gym, it was sparring, it was just sparring. So I'm, you know, I'm going around filming people and then I just turned to the cage and like Michael [inaudible] just dropped them with like a low shot. And then Michael Chandler like walking around them, like I created this film called the portrait of the black zillions. That was like the first thing I ever made because it was Glenn Robinson rip to him and Tyrone Spong that really pushed me to do MMA. They saw the stuff that I did with Shannon bricks and they called me into the office that same day that I, I gave whoever the manager was at Jocko to the footage and Glen just said, listen, we need this type of work in MMA.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Like this is high quality stuff. And Tyrone spawn was boxing. So I knew he was probably loving, uh, the, the footage with Shannon bridge cause he, he in boxing and that's after he broke his leg against [inaudible] Saki and he decided to just go straight to box. So he, you know, Tyrone, he's very, uh, persuasive and he was like, Hey, this, we need this in the gym. So they gave me a pass to go to a sparring date and really work out with them. And, um, yeah, there it is right there. But uh, yeah, that's how it happened. And I just kept going to the gym every day, put that back up chest and that, okay. Yeah, that's the first thing I ever filmed in my life called the portrait of the black zillions. And that shot of a Michael Chandler, a RP to Jordan Parsons, that was a fighter that, you know, died after getting hit by a car.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       Um, but that's the first thing I ever found for anatomy of fire. That was the sparring match. And, um, yeah, that was it. And from there, uh, everything was born. Um, I still was like focusing on doing like a documentary, um, until I moved to Vegas. Uh, like a summer after that during a condom of Gregor in a Floyd Mayweather fight. I just wanted to, I felt like I needed to move to Vegas cause the energy was taking me there and I felt like, ah, if I'm going to do a documentary I might as well be a Vegas where a lot of fighters is. This is a giant shift for you. Right. So like what were you filming before? Two years ago when you were at the Black Zillions? Uh, before that, like I have a wedding business, so I was doing weddings. My big black ass is doing weddings, which is funny.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       I go to these weddings and people would be like, cause we'll sit down was gigantic six, five. So he's towered over all of these people, little in their wedding. I, I really thought like, man, my life is miserable. At one point I was like, I'm just shooting these a, yeah, after a while, like you win or award, then another ward in another ward and it's all based off reviews. Right. And it was like, man, I gotta I gotta do something more than this. So I did like basketball documentaries in Italy. I live, I lived in Italy for a minute. I went to China, did a basketball document Mentari there because that's my background basketball. But after that I was just like, man, what, what else can I do? And I literally just stumbled. I saw the gym one day Jocko. And I was like, that's where dumb black, zillions train.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       And I went over there and that's how all of this started. Didn't know martial arts training, nothing. I just saw the gym and I was like Das Jocko. I know the black zillions trainer. So I went in there like mid day, nobody was in there. And I just said, listen, I'm a filmmaker. I would love to film some of these fighters. And that's cool for that. Yeah. So I went to college and University of Southern Indiana and Evansville on a basketball scholarship. I was a top senior in America coming out of high school and I went to this top division two school after I tried to wait my senior year to get some division one offers. If people know like division one is the top level of basketball and then division two is right under that. Probably not now, but back then it was, and um, I went, uh, Bruce Perl was my coach.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       He was very persuasive to get me to come to the university. He, he coaches at Auburn now. Uh, they just went to the final four this year if you know anything about basketball. But I played my first year and then going into my second year, I tore my ACL and uh, I, my life was over. All I knew was basketball. Anybody know anything about Carbondale? It's about 25,000 people. People don't leave that town. It's kind of a miserable, you know, thing. I think like the average household median income there is like 16,000 a year for families to use. Yeah. Like, so you come from the bottom. Did you get it repaired? Yeah. So I had surgery, I had the red shirt. So when you're in college and you set out in your red shirt, so one day I was dating this girl and she was going to Walmart and she literally was just like, Oh, you want to come to Walmart with me?

Speaker 1:          00:08:45       And I was like, yeah, I had some pell grant money and I was addicted to the, the, you remember the MTV show, road rules and real world. I used to be addicted to that stuff. So I used to watch it all the time and I went to Walmart today and bought a camera. That was my, a Sony handycam the one you used to put little mini DV Ds in. And that was the birth. I literally, my life changed soon as I bought that camera and I was like, Oh, I'm gonna just film my Rehab and uh, come back. More ferocious than all I was doing was like filming girls at parties, doing bongs and shit like that. Literally for four years I had a camera every day. So you just stopped playing basketball? No, I can, I continue to play basketball. I, I came back a year after my red shirt.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       Um, I finish at one of the top five scores in school history and university history, top four rebounds all time leader and field goal percentage, all American. And my senior year we went to the national championship, played on national TV. Everything. After that was done, I wasn't the same player after I told my ACO. I can just admit that like I was this high flying super freak, athletic, 45 inch vertical type of player to, I couldn't do that anymore so I had to adjust my whole game. What was wrong? I don't know. Maybe I just, you know, it was different back in 2001 right. So as far as surgery and the Patella tendon and Patella. Yep. That's, and they don't do that anymore. They still do. They do.

Speaker 3:          00:10:08       Yeah. George Saint Pierre had that done. Yeah. They do that sometimes because they think that the Patella Tendon, I had it done in 90 no. Yeah, 93 I haven't done on this leg. And then this one I had the cadaver, which was way easier. Cadavers like a six month rehab and I was back to Jujitsu a hundred percent

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       I was always like slightly knocked lead. Right. And it's like that surgery made my left knee even more knock and it's like, that's why I was telling Jamie like I need that cause I feel like I need to like strengthen my teammates. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       Crazy roller thing. What is that thing called again? Jamie? No role here. So pull it up Ra. Yeah, I need something like that. Jamie's showing everybody. There you go. That's crazy heavy. Clamp that thing down your thigh. It didn't seem that good for my, my cow. While you were like standing on it, you gotta like you can't have any tension on it or whatever. You're like, oh but your thigh, it seems like it would be a lot of pressure because it's for sure like a spring. Get a thicker your muscle. Yeah, it's like a, it's hot. I don't know how much weight is pushing on it, but it's a lot. And you could also push with both side for sure. Yeah, you can call it that. Our eight roll recovery, it's like it said medical grade on the box. I was like, okay, it's a medical grade. Like weed. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       I feel like I need that to like wake up my left leg still to this day to two decades later. Did you go through Rehab and everything? And I did. I did all that work. So listen, I recovered fine. Like my college career was totally fine, but you just didn't feel, I just did. Honestly, I lost the love of basketball, honestly, after filling girls, that's all I had in my life was basketball. So once that was gone, even when I came back it was, I wasn't the same. So even though I had games where I was 25 points, 15 like x, great games, winning all these awards, all regional, I, it just wasn't there anymore. And I hacked this camera that I love to just have because that year off I was able to, I like my first ever film I ever did was I went around campus and film like girls asked them who the hottest athletes was and I felt like they gave me power, gave me power, like just to be able to cause back then that's when girls gone wild was popular.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Oh Wow. Yeah. That was 2000 gone walk man, Girls Gone Wild Duck. Stan hope hosted that at one point in time. Yeah, that's funny. But, so I graduated college in 2004 and um, I moved to Phoenix where my best friend, Mr Organic and uh, he was out there just living and I wanted to get out of my little town. So I went out there and I, I kinda wanted to like take a year off and then try to play professional basketball because you either play in the NBA or you go overseas to play basketball. So I went to Phoenix with no idea what I was going to do with my life and I, I literally started working at a call center, Amir. Uh, it was uh, what was that? O f a phone company that went out of business. I can't remember what it was called, but uh, I used to just call people collect, uh, and try to get them to sign up for long distance and then you get caught.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       Like I, I got caught every word in the book every day. But it was funny like people's calling you the n word and everything and you're just laughing cause they bad. Right. And then you like convinced them like 90 year old lady to sign up for long distance knowing that as illegal as hell. Like you just convincing, convincing this lady to sign up for a long distance. But I was good at it though. I was good at it. So that was like my first job I ever had in my life. So it's like one of them shady phone, they call you up like I get those Robo calls calls you, you did that. Like do you want unlimited long distance? Do you feel guilty? A little bit. But they went out. They went out of business. I like six months after I uh, had the job and I from there I just didn't know what I was going to do and I had a, um, he's not my cousin but he's like somebody we all call our cousins, like black people.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       We call everybody I cousins but he played in the NBA. His name was Troy Hudson and he was from my town. So he was like the most successful person that ever got out of our town. He was playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves and I reached out to him cause I basically was like, listen man, I need help cause I want to play basketball again but I don't know how I'm going to, I don't have an agent, I don't have anything. So he kind of invited us up to Minneapolis. That's the first time I lived. I literally went from Evansville, Phoenix to Minneapolis to try to pursue this whole basketball career. And I did that for like three years. Like chasing it, going to try outs, things like that, sending tapes to agents and things like that and it just didn't pan out. Nothing stuck. You know, I had opportunities, they just, I just wasn't the same player and I can admit that and I'm comfortable that because I know I had a successful basketball career, just didn't go to the level where I made millions of dollars.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       So after that man, I was literally stuck after traveling around the world. I ended up in Malaysia, I was in Australia trying to Asia, you don't want to know how I ended up over here, man. This is funny. Only a few people know this story. So when you were at your bottom you try to find something for comfort. I've never done weed or anything in my life, but I, I was addicted to like online dating back then. Yes. I was like trying to meet girls, like just to try to find some situation. I felt like, Oh, I feel incomplete. So let me like online date or whatever. And I met this girl, like one of my friends in Phoenix played basketball in Kuala Lumpur. So obviously you need a visa to go over there. So I'm thinking to myself like what's stuck the way I could get over there to Kuala Lumpur and try to play basketball.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       So I was like, oh online dating. I don't even remember what website or see you're a good looking guy. I know how you not getting girls in America. I do but I'm just saying I was just listen, my whole point, my point was I literally met this girl in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She was from Canada, she was a singer over there singing in little military bars over there. There's little hot blind or whatever she was. And um, I remember talking to her for about a month and I convinced her that I wanted to come visit her, but my whole intention was let me get over there, try to find out what this team is and see if I could like try out for him some crazy shit. You don't do that today. I did it back then. So I went over there to, I'm laughing cause I know people that know me is dying.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       Listening to this right now. This is a true 100% store. I get over there to Malaysia with no money. I may have $400 I got people to pay for ticket here. I'm going to Malaysia to play basketball. Just lying to people, right? So I get over there. This girl, I only want to say her name, she might sue me, but she picked me up at the airport. She looked exactly like her pictures. Beautiful from Canada, everything. So she take me to her apartment. She got this nice apartment. It's like in a jungle chair. Like I'm talking about the balcony. I seen like little monkeys on the balcony. Oh yes. It was crazy. And then it's like a rain forest. Right? And then in Malaysia, if you ever been to Malaysia, I don't know if it's like that now the doors are high off the ground, like two inches.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       So it's like anything can crawl under the doors or whatever. So that's the first thing I noticed when I got to Malaysia. I was like, this is some crazy shit, right? We in the jungle and the dude like, what about snakes or bugs? I remember asking these little kids when I first got to Malaysia, I was like, have you ever seen a snake like in this area? And he was like, yeah, I seen the Cobra and all that stuff. And I was just like, Holy Shit. But the back to her, she turned out to be a sex addict. Yes. Congratulations man. Listen, Yo, this is crazy. Like, because this is way before I ever decided this, I'm going to do film for a living. Right. I was over there, um, the first day I got there, like I had a good time with her. Then I, you know, ended up having relations with the lady and she turned out to be a sex addict.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       So, you know, as a man, I just flew all the way across the world to see this girl. The sleeve would air and then all of a sudden she wanted to do it again and again and again. And then when you like slow down, like, you know, I just got her shit bro. She started crying and going nuts. And I'm in Malaysia, I'm like, I don't know who this girl is. Oh No, listen, she's crying cause you won't fuck her again. Yes. How many times you fucker about two times that you wanted to yeah, you too long. The time still like shit. It was crazy. So then I even listen, I am in Malaysia. This, I'm not in America, I'm in Malaysia. So the crazy thing is probably after a week she started to go crazy and complain about I'm not sleeping with her. I'm a, I'm in my, I'm in my prime, my sexual peak and you don't want to sleep with me.

Speaker 1:          00:18:50       And I'm just thinking of myself like I don't know what the fuck am I doing over here in Malaysia? Like what? This lady. So I ended up meeting this black guy, uh, that she introduced me to. There was like a hustler in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And I started hanging out with him just to get out of the house and he was like living with, you don't have any money to go home. Oh my God. I'm just stuck in Kuala Lumpur and La with this beautiful girl that you have to fuck all the time. First of all problems, right? Serious. And then she started getting even bitter. Like, I hate Americans. You Americans are so ungrateful. And I'm just thinking like, damn, wow, you're representing America. It was crazy. I was like, damn, I must've just didn't do a good enough.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       Sorry. I thought our girls be lined in right. Maybe she was just extraordinary. And she was like in her late thirties and I was in my early twenties so some girls in their late thirties, they hit this itchy peak man all the time. She ended up skiing or kicked me out her house in Malaysia. I went out with Bobby one night. This dude, his name was Bobby too, and m w I came home and she shit, um, your stuff is outside. Like she texted me, I had a little international phone. She was like, your stuff is outside. I'm thinking like, she was like, yeah, this is not working out. So think about that. Imagine being in another country and this is not working out. No money, no money, zero oh not a dime. And I see the guy that I was with, I told him what happened. He was like, I'm gonna take you over there and get your stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       He could stay with me until you figure it out. I get there and all my stuff is outside, everything. She's not there, she's done left or whatever. And I had some brand new timberlands. Remember the boots templates? I am poor shit. I need them timberlands. They in a house. I had more on brand new. So I kicked the door down. Boom. Oh No. Yes. Like I was trying to get into the door. I just kicked it and it broke like the little handle broke. I got in and got my timberlands left. I remember she texted me, she was like, Hey, did you break my door? I was like, Nah, I don't know what you're talking about. I just left. So from there I was, I stayed with Bobby for like three weeks in Malaysia. I was hanging out with him everyday going to parties and I'm like, Bro, I gotta get home to America.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       So I contacted my, one of my, uh, mentors growing up, uh, in Australia, he was playing pro professional basketball in Melbourne name Rashad Tucker. Shout out to him and I convinced them to get me a ticket to come over to Melbourne because I was like, Bro, I need some money to go home. And he was like, Nah man, I just get you a ticket to come to Melbourne. I was like, Bro, literally like I'm trying to go back to America. I don't know what to. But then when he, he sold me on, I was like, damn, I really ain't going back to nothing, so let me go. He was like, man, you can come over here and try out for the team. You can try practice with us. And I was like, oh, that may be my opportunity to play professional basketball if I, he's one of the top players in Australia.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       So I ended up in Melbourne and I was in Melbourne for three months, not doing shit, but going out practicing with the team. They was mid season so I couldn't like make a team because they was already, you know, they think and then I ended up getting stranded over there too because he left me cause he cheated on his girlfriend and uh, he had to go make up with her. So he left me talking about I'm going to be back. And then I was just stuck in Australia. Like, Yo Bro, I need to get back to America job. No job, no money, nothing. He was like, uh, I'm glad I was young when I did all this stuff. He was like, hey man, tell her, tell one of them girls a sob story. They'll get you a, I'm like a sob story, Bro. You have money. Buy me a ticket to go home, man.

Speaker 1:          00:22:25       I can't do it right now. I'm like, man. So I had to tell this girl a sob story. Her name was Deanna, Deanna Casar. I'm giving her a shot out because she saved my life. She bought me a ticket home. She, she went in her savings and bought me a ticket back from Melbourne to Ho Honolulu to Los Vegas. And, um, I didn't know why I chose Las Vegas, but I just chose to go to Las Vegas. So you literally had zero money, zero micro job. How were you eating? Shit. Her people that I was around right. They just fed you. Yeah man. Sometimes you have angels in your life and I guess these people were angels to, cause I was just telling Jamie like I just seen a documentary on homelessness. It was like four out of five people in La County paycheck to paycheck. I think it was like eight or it's four out of five people are like one $400 emergency from being broke or it was like 80% of people live paycheck to paycheck.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       So I always tell people like when, when I'm inspiring people now I'm like Bro, I was homeless once. Cause that's essentially homelessness. Yeah. If you ain't gotta address, you can't pay bills. You're homeless no matter if you got a roof over your head. And I think, I feel like people, you see all these beautiful moments that I do now or what anybody does does, and they don't see the, the story that ultimately led, like what, what ultimately turn to you doing what you're doing now. So after Australia I went to Vegas. I was living with two strippers. Yes. I live with two strippers. Graduations again. Yeah, I'll live in Vegas with two strippers that worked at the Rhino Despair Rhino. I met him on Craig lists for rooms to rent Jesus Christ. And I had enough money, like $600 to move into a room. So I literally moved in with these girls.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       And one day, have you ever been in a Vegas casinos? Cause this is like the climax you ever seen like the mega bucks slots. So one day it was flowy Mayweather versus Oscar de la Hoya. So that was the year I was in the, the Mirage and I seen these two hot black girls and I had like some money in my pocket car haunted or something. So I wanted to sit down next to him. So I went over there and sat next to him and was just, you know, trying to shoot the shit and I put a $20 in the slots cause you know you can get free drinks if you put in a slot. So I just hitting it, talking to him, where y'all from? Y'all going into fight, blah blah blah. And then one of the girls was like, hey you won. I was like, Oh okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       You know you thinking he ain't went in those slots. Guess how much I want? How much? Nah Thousand Dollars Whoa. Swear to God. $9,000 till somebody broke. Wow. Yes. $9,000. So when they give you that, do you pay taxes on it later or they all gave him a wrong social security number though. You're getting the wrong. So yeah, I gave him the wrong stuff. They can, you can do that. Yeah. Cause they just actually your name, your social security number. Okay. Maybe you shouldn't have just told everybody that they aren't, they can't prove that I want anything. They can. That was like 12 years ago. They didn't have records back then. Now. I don't think so. I hope not. Nah, me too. Ain't nobody gonna Watch this. Nobody's watching them. And I know this, this is nobody's gonna want nothing. So after that, I literally lived off that, um, nine grand for about the rest of the summer.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       And uh, I ended up moving to San Diego after that. Like I'm skipping some stuff, but I moved to San Diego and that's when my life changed because I lived in San Diego and was just partying. What brought you to San Diego? I met a guy in Vegas during the, the night of the Floyd Mayweather fight and just party with him that night and I just got his phone number one time and then I was just staying in touch with them or whatever. And then he was like, I live in San Diego. He was in the Navy, Dr Bill. And um, I literally said, let me come out there one weekend. I was like, let me just come out there and kick it with you or whatever. Cause he was telling me how great San Diego was and I'm, I went out there and I didn't leave for four years. San Diego was pretty awesome. Yeah. I love San Diego but I, I essentially was doing the same thing I was doing for the past couple of years lost cause you gotta understand like athletes go through this now.

Speaker 1:          00:26:34       Like I just did, I just released the episode where Ryan Bader on my channel and I talked to him about that. Like when, when your sports career is done, a lot of people go to something else they lost and things like that. And I was for about four or five years and it wasn't until I lived in San Diego that I figured, I was like, man, I gotta really do something with my life. I'm literally a failure. I got, I have a college degree. I graduated from college. So it wasn't like I just didn't want that responsibility of having to do a nine to five or and things like that. So it wasn't until I live in San Diego that I literally talked to the guy that I was living with him and was like, Bro, I, I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life bro, but I gotta figure something out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       I was like nearing 30 and um, I ended up moving to Minneapolis back to Minneapolis and I got a job as a teacher, like a teacher's assistant and they called it behavior system. I was like working with kindergarten kids to Jesus. Literally crazy life. Right? What a crazy life ended up where I'm at now to be on Joe Rogan. Right. So it, it was March 3rd to 2011. Um, it was like negative 20 degrees outside. I was living with my guy, my best friend, and I'm, I went to work that day and it was freezing outside and they literally still went to recess that day. I'll never forget that. They was like, Oh, put your coats and gloves on kids. It's time to go to, to recess. And I was like, what do you mean we going into the gym or outside? It's like we're going outside. I was like, man, these people in Minnesota, crazy hard.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       Those are hard people, Bro. That was the last day I ever worked in my life. He said, fuck this. I can't do it, man. I was like, Bro, that whether it was just the fact that I was like, what am I doing with my life? I'm working with Kenneth, the great, rewarding job. I'm like, what? It's nothing wrong with me. I'm physically able to do anything. I'm intelligent enough to do anything. I'm qualified enough to do anything. You're a victim of circumstance. Victim just kept happening. Things kept happening. Um, and a lot of it is my fault. Like, because you're just lazy, right? So March 30 2011 is the day I, I said I'm quitting my job. I went back to my apartment when my roommate, he was pissed. He was like, Bro, you always quitting jobs. And he was like, Bro, what you going to do?

Speaker 1:          00:28:42       I was like, Bro, I'm, I'm Finna figure something out. I'm going to buy a camera to do something. He was like, yeah, yeah, whatever. And, and we literally was sitting in the kitchen in this little kitchen on the floor talking about life. Cause I would just tell, I literally mentally broke. I was like, Bro, I'm just Jack. Like I got to figure something out. I had pell grant was coming up, I was getting my tax returns back and I had enough to buy a camera and the first camera I ever bought was a canon t to die. It was like $800 and I bought a lens and that was it. That was it. It changed my life. And I literally spent like the next year shooting videos in garages, like cars coming up, filming the wheels. And I was just really literally hone in myself because back then when I had a camera in college, digital cameras wasn't even out until 2008 like these little new style cameras.

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       So I had to relearn everything. And I, I really learned a lot from youtube and Vimeo and I was watching the, I had a creative eye and a mindset. So I was just like, I got to get the skillset. So I started doing rap videos for $50 a hundred dollars free. You know, I tell all these kids, they messaged me now like, Bro, I spent two years on videos for free, just trying to learn how to do this stuff. Everybody want to get paid for something. And I'm like, you probably don't deserve to get paid yet. So I, I had friends shout out to Matt, Irv, Mr Organic, like I was shooting a videos for free and I was just getting better. I was getting better and better and better and better. And then like three years into it, I shot a music video called Saks fifth avenue and I'm see you're editing these as well.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       I'm editing, I'm doing them all you editing on, uh, at the time I was editing on Sony Vegas, uh, uh, old program. Now it's, it's, it's, it's popular now. It's pretty easy to use and um, it was cheap to buy like 90 bucks. So I was able to use that. Um, like the movie studio version that was, you don't get all the little tools, but you got enough. And I had this cheap laptop, uh, that this girl bought me a, she lied and told me she was gonna buy me a camera. They ended up buying me a laptop. I was pissed off and I was like, she was like, listen, like the most popular a camera back in like 2011. It was like a canon five d mark two. It was like $2,000. I couldn't afford that. So I met this girl online literally from Denver, Colorado, from Denver, Colorado.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       And you know, you start your little love affair or whatever you talking and you promising and I want to see you. So one day she was like, I'm gonna come see you in Minnesota. This is around the time I started. And uh, she told me she was going to buy me that camera cause I was telling you that's like my dream camera, my Jean Camera. And I remember my roommate, uh, like I'll run in his room like, look bro, look at his short film that was shot with this camera. I'm Finna had his camera, Bro. We Finna do all types of things. So she like kept telling me she had the camera, kept telling me he had the camera. So like the day she came, I picked her up. I had this little use nine 1992 for tours. It was blue and uh, I picked her up at the airport.

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       I remember I was like, where the camera at? As soon as soon as she picked me up where the camera, she was like, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. And I'm like driving thinking like, man, she ain't got this camera. She lied to me. She just wanted to see me. Right. So we get to my apartment and my boy, he anticipating it too. He like, man, he finna get this. Can we finish? Shoot all their music videos, right. Cause if you get this camera at this time, you, oh you shooting at a five d. So I remember she like pulled, she was like, here's a gift. It's like she pulled out the gift and I was like, this ain't no camera box. It was a brand new laptop. And I'm sitting here complaining, I'm complaining about a laptop and I already have a camera. But she like gave me this laptop and I was just like, all right, cool.

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       So she gave me the laptop and I, I get the Sony Vegas program and then I started editing with that and I had that camera for about two years. I was in the girl, I don't know, there's a lot of that in my life and I don't blame them. Girls. Listen man. Yeah. I used to be one of those guys, you know, Dum, Dum girls, this materialistic and he all about nice things and he liked to travel or you ever dated a girl and you like see her previous boyfriend and they be like, damn, they don't want to like Napa Valley and fucking Vegas for her birthday or a New York. And you're like, damn, I can't even take you to the movies. I'm like, Damn. So for me, if a girl get tired of you, now they call it ghosting, right? They call it ghosting. But back then ghosted, that's what ghosting was.

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       It's like, oh, this guy ain't worth nothing. Let me get rid of him. So she left, she left. I had a summer job. My last ever official job was at 43 hoops in Minnesota was a basketball academy where I was there with a lot of pro basketball players or semi-pro or guys that had college experience and we just taught kids all the time. And um, I was getting paid, you know, $20 an hour or $25 an hour per session to teach kids. And I kind of made a Ruckus. They're two complaining about just Bro, we teach in 20 kids and I'm only getting $20. How much are y'all getting for all these kids? Right. But I mean that's just work, right? I shouldn't complain about a job, but that whole summer I was just telling everybody in here, I'm going to do film. I'm moving back to California.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       I'm about to just do film about to do film because I had enough, like I was doing videos at that point, but now I have a part time job that I'm able to do videos and I never forget. One day I was telling a group of guys in there, I'm quitting this job and I'm Finna go do film. And I just remember the look on their face like you know like the boy that cried wolf, whatever, man, you ain't going to do anything but that drove me and St Joe doubt, doubt drove things out, people doubted me. That's what I needed. I needed that fueled where people could tell me I couldn't do any. You needed haters. I needed haters and it drove me insane and I went nuts and I started shooting a lot of music videos that any videographer out there that didn't knows this industry, they know like music videos feed you, you make a lot of money.

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       It's a recession proof business. People always going to need music videos, especially rap videos. And I got good, I got very good. I did a lot of high profile videos. I made a lot of money. Who did you doing for? I did a music videos for like rappers, like chief Keef, you know? Yeah. Yes. He did his videos. Yeah. It seemed like you'd have to wear a bulletproof vest to be around that. There was a video called traffic. You got to check that out. Oh, okay. I think I've seen that. It's that you wild on the streets. Oh, I would imagine. Wow. They're legitimately wild. That was real gangster shit going on with your Chicago rappers and stuff like that. Well that dude is like the king of that Shit. Right? It's only like 20 right. I think now he's getting 20 Nah, he probably like 2124 now.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       Yeah, they was kids man. But I was shooting a lot of music videos in Minneapolis and I got popular cause that's a huge music scene. It's a very indie, you know, prince made it popular, but I think the hip hop scene is very in rich at. They just don't, they haven't had anybody like explode out of there. So I made a living just in Minneapolis, like shooting music videos. But after a while, I remember I was dating this girl and this one lasted a bit. And I remember I used to brag to her like, look at his music video, this music video. And she was like, you want to just be known for doing music videos? You want to be a guy that just do music videos, you need to do other stuff. And that's what woke me up. I was like, let me see if I can tap into my creative side and do other things.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       So I did like a film called like the confessions of skid row. I would literally went to skid row and filmed homeless people I don't want Yup. And I'm not available yet. It's somewhere on the line. Online. Real freaks me out. Yeah. It was called the confessions skid row. And then I did, it was cool. I was like, I'm gonna make this, this series called the confessions. And then I did the confessions of Gay Pride and I literally interviewed this guy in San Diego about how, when Obama passed a don't ask, don't tell. Like I, I interviewed this guy, um, and he told me how he came out to his parents and I'm like, I know my boys just look at me like what the Carol do you doing? Like these types of films. But I was fascinated by documentaries so I was like, let me just do this type of documentary content doing the one on skid road.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       Did that have like an extra impact on you because you were basically home? Yeah, 100% I told, I told the guy I was like, I was literally homeless so I know what she feels like and I don't think people understand that. Like if I look at my life now, I live in downtown l a view of the staple center, things like that. Like they don't understand. Years ago I didn't have, I couldn't afford to live in a $400 a month apartment. You see what I'm saying? Cause you didn't have any guaranteed income and that's how it was. Even the beginning of my film career I lived out at like you know them shitty hotels I why are they not shitty to everybody but like extended stays. Yeah. I lived in extended stays for like two years. Literally. Like I say I was getting a $400 for a music video from a rapper or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       I will use 200 of that for six days in extended state. Cause you know there was like $30 a night. It'd be nights where I'm like damn, I got one day left. I got to convince somebody to give me like $200 to shoot a music video. So I was hustling, like reaching out to people on Facebook. Hey Man, you try shooting music video, you're trying to day not knowing I need this money to just live somewhere. Wow. So once I was able to sustain enough income because it's just too long of a story, but I was able to really get myself to a point where I was making some money. I moved to Florida where my best friend tone from Macedonia, six foot nine Macedonian mercenary. That's where he wanted to be. Like he a crazy guy. Like he wants to like go around the world and kill like drug dealers. That's literally he from Macedonian man. They crazy man. They crazy. So brother tone. I moved in with him in Boca Raton and that's literally has started. That's how all of this and that email fighter stuff started. I moved to Florida, live with him. I had a roommate, so it was cheaper to live. I went to Italy that year and shot a documentary. So I got some money from my Guy

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       Bobby Jones. And um, I was able to have a life. I felt comfortable. I wasn't like, felt like a, a a monkey was on my back at that point. Um, you getting momentum? I got momentum. Um, I had a lot of momentum at that point. About 2014 I was making money. So when you were doing these documentaries, like confessions of skid row and confessions at Gay Pride, like what are you doing with them and how are you getting paid from them? Just releasing them online for free will and then I didn't get paid for anything I paid. I paid like I paid like the homeless guy to let me talk to them. They gotta be on Vimeo. They gotta be in. You put them on Youtube and get the ad revenue from. Yeah. That was back in the day though. But there, are they out there right now?

Speaker 4:          00:39:15       Like no, I have, I have a great one. If you know Alan Watts. Yes. So it's called the beauty of nothing is by Allen Watson. If you put the beauty and nothingness by Allen Watson Will Harris, you'll see one of the most beautiful homeless films you ever seen. That was like three years ago. I went to New York. I was here in La, I was in Florida. I was just sitting on the streets for homeless people, talking to them for a, for two days. And is it Alan Watts narration? He is the beauty or nothingness. It like won the award in New York. Well, when I first saw, I don't remember what video I saw of yours. That was first, but I was like, this guy has got an eye for shit. You, you, it's not the stamp. You know, sometimes you can see videos and you're just watching a video. Like okay, this is cool.

Speaker 4:          00:39:54       I'm seeing how these guys are training. I'm seeing their lifestyle, what I'm seeing. You know their family, but then you see one and you go, oh whoever the fuck is filming us, they know what they're doing. Yeah. That's what I got from you well was cause I look at all the Shit I've been through. Yeah, you shut. That's also your focus. Like you, you, you have a vision. Like it's very clear that you're an artist. Like when you're doing these videos, it's not simply you're filming things like you're thinking about 100% about the angles, how to edit it, what, what, you know, how to have a vote. People talking, you hear their voice while they're there, mounts not moving because they're talking from another, you know what I'm saying? Then when you did narration? Yeah. When you see things that where someone puts it together and like it makes it richer, makes it more interesting.

Speaker 4:          00:40:40       And did you ever hear of a documentary called Hoop Dreams? Yes, it was a, that was my high school life. Like they were older than me, but when I was in high school that film came out, uh, that fascinated me and I was like, I want a documentary and documented somebody for five years, followed a life. I was obsessed. And then my favorite documentary of all time is pumping iron. Oh, of course. So when I saw that in college, I was like, I want to shoot documentaries. Ah. So I was always obsessed with documentaries. Like, I don't know if you remember back, you remember banging in Little Rock? Yes. Whew. Yes. That was an HBO, right. Banging a little. All those, that's what I like. I don't like movies. I like documentary on me too. So for me, I've always was obsessed with docs. I'm like, if I can ever shoot a doc, I know where that passion come from. So when I literally moved to Florida, like I literally just reached out to Shannon Briggs one day. I was like, cause I was doing weddings and music, Saas make money,

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       especially with weddings. I would make a lot of money with weddings cause that's just, I mean, people get married every weekend. Right? So I mean you can get, and if you get good enough you can get three, $4,000 a wedding video. So, I mean I'm booking two a week. I started to get to a point where I'm, let's go chair. That's one. Yeah, that's the one of him. That's the one. So that was, that was three years ago. The podcast I did with him. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Here's court called portrait of a boxing gym. Ah, yeah. So like he's a fucking care. Who is the guy. Dot. Deontay Walder knocked out Bur Berman. Starvation. Uh, yes. The Vern stubborn. Yeah. That was the, I remember he was in there that day. So I would, I used to do stuff like this before I ever decided to do anatomy and fight daunted.

Speaker 5:          00:42:15       Deontay wilder knocked out. You've got to say everybody fought. Yeah, that's true. 40 knockouts. 41 upon the craziest fucking records. Tyson fury too. Well, basically 10 seconds. Yeah. No you didn't. That's my drink. Listen, if you ask me who my dream guest is on anatomy of a fighter Deontay one, I would love to do a behind the scenes fight companion with you guys. Just being here with the camera filming y'all motherfuckers talking. That's what the fight companion is now. Now, now, but out in the hallways because Eddie Bravo, bring them here. Bring some crazier seasoned. Well, hopefully Eddie tried to get away from hopefully. Hopefully I get any bravo on the day with cheeto. Veryyeah you'll get him on. Yeah. More Cheetos fight is canceled. Right? I know. So they tried to give him a replacement opponent. I was hoping that they shot up to cheat over there.

Speaker 5:          00:43:01       Yeah. He love your show about I love him. Uh, he, I'm tough motherfucker. He is. He a, I was hoping he got to not love sugar shine. I love both of them. I love how he taken it to. Yeah, he taken it because you know, I seen a lot of people online talking about, you know, are they gonna move the car to enter harm now? He was like, Nah, they ain't doing that for chicken shine. Don't know. He got a, he got a tainted supplement. It's, it's these new studies or these new tests that they have. They are so fucking extensive. They catch shit that you did years ago. That's crazy. And if you took a tainted supplement with something that has zero performance benefit years ago, it can still show up in your system. Whereas they used to have like, oh, it'll be out of your system in six weeks.

Speaker 5:          00:43:45       Like especially talk to like a gym professor. Like there's a lot. Look, there's a lot of cheating in professional sports. There's a lot of cheating for sure. Like a lot of cheating and MMA a lot, but less than they used to be because of you Sada and Novitsky and what the UFC is implemented 100% there's a lot of less, but supplements are a dirty business. I know this firsthand firm on it from being one of the owners of on it and not even supplements tainted with things that are illegal. When we first started making Alpha brain, we had it independently tested. We get all our shit third party tested and we were like, what the fuck is this doing in there? We had stuff in there that's not supposed to be in there and well it turns out when you get stuff made, like say if you have a, you put together some sort of a, a pre-workout trick and you want to have vitamin B 12 and all these different things

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       in it, you get those mixed by a third party lab. This lab mixes it all for you, but you don't know what the fuck they're doing. They're [inaudible], they're not cleaning out their shit. So they might've been doing steroids right before they do your shit and you're having to make mix. You have some creotine and your creatine has Austrian in it, which is like, well what is it? Some kind of steroid, I don't know what it is. It's some kind of steroid. I was talking to a bodybuilding micro sheet about supplements cause you know, obviously he a bodybuilder and he has a company, I think he, he works with trifecta too or something like that. And I was just like, how do, how does that happen? Like these tenants supplements. And I interviewed him about it. I'm gonna release it one day, how he goes into it.

Speaker 4:          00:45:15       But you know, with bodybuilders they catch flack because they bodybuilders, you've gotta be on something. But these guys know they shit. He has a legitimate business. So I'm sure he does go. Most of them are on something like if you want to get to the size of like a Lee Haney, you don't get that big without steroids. It's not a human size. You know when you get to like, um, you know, just go back and look at like Franco Colombo. Oh Man. Oh my God. You know, but, but then you look at like Frank Zane, Frank Zane. You can get that body without steroids. What about possible? What about a Francis, Francis and Ghana. If he started to be a bodybuilder, he gotta be gigantic. Yeah, there's naturally, there's natural Komatsus. Mine is a freak. Yeah. Woodley's they freaks. Rock listeners are freak. There's freaks. There's, look, there's girls with giant tits.

Speaker 4:          00:46:03       They're born with triple f tits. Does that works? Some guys have 20 inch decks. This is just how the world works. Some people have big noses. The world's weird. I wouldn't want to have a 20 inch dick though. No, it's too big. Imagine saying that. I'm too big. You can't complain though. You can't complain. Eight and nine is good though. You know how many dudes are crying out there with a three inch deck? They'd be like, oh no. 17 more inches. Yeah, that's better off having a 20 inch stick than a three inch deck. Did you just find a girls had like eight kids and just record. It'd be weird like, listen, we want to know another, another funny online story of my life. These was all in the past, but I remember dating this older lady and she was like, Oh, I'm a freak. I'm a freak. I'm a freak. And I was like, how much? Like she went in her drawer and pulled out like a Dildo that was like 20 inches. I was like, Oh, like a horse cock. And I was just like, what the fuck am I do with this? I did everything in my power drop.

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       She didn't feel shit. I got mines though, Joe. I believe you. I believe. Hey, some weirdos out there, man. Oh, we all weird. In a way. Yes, everyone. We all listen. Vegans are weird people that say they don't drink or weird, uh, people that only eat nuts and berries, a weird, we always aware Christians are weird. Can't judge nobody. I'll be like, oh, I never smoked a weed in my life. But then I'd be online dating. That's when Weirdos, she's never smoked weed ever. Never.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Not one time, I'll come drink a little bit, maybe five times a year. How come you never smoked weed? Um, I had an addictive family. Uh, like I seen it and it was, it was embarrassing and, and struggling. Like my mom was 14 years old when she gave birth to me and my mom was born the same month I am. So she was born May 3rd are born May 19th. So she could have had me at 13. My Dad was the same age so I didn't grow up in any parents. Right. I mean you know your parents, I hate hearing it but I don't know my dad, um, at all. I may have two on either. I may have talked to him twice. And the only, the last con, you know, the last conversation I ever had with my dad, he had got out of prison and I was living with his mom.

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       My Grandmother, the one that raised me and he like overtook the room that I was living in cause it's his room again. Like, I'm a grown ass man telling his son, oh Jason and I found his porn tapes and me and my best friend, like I knew, I was like, Yo, you want to watch some porn? So I like went up in the closet, took out the tape, put it in, and then I heard them coming in the house. So we ran and put the tape back and this is how precise he was with his porn. Probably. He noticed some clothes moves. So we like left the house. He came out the house, hey, stay out of my room. I said, man, shut up. You're a grown man watching porn. It was my dad. That's like the last conversation at Radford. Wow. He had been in prison in and out his life.

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       That's the thing. It's like, listen man, everybody can pick, make a picture out to be poor me. Yeah, I don't, that's not me. You, me telling you all this stuff ain't poor me. It's just real. It's just life. Right. Where I'm at now is beautiful. You know, I was filming videos to survive and then I finally found something that stuck. I never in my fucking life thought it was going to be MMA. Never easy. Never. So you, you saw people with addiction problems and you just didn't want to have anything to do with it? Nah, I just, yeah, I just thought it was luckily for me, man, I found sports and in the fifth grade and I just was upset. I have an addictive personality, whether there's masturbation or anything. Right. It was very similar situation. You know what's crazy? I've seen when he like what's fascinating about this podcast is that if you go to your channel on Youtube and you go to click oldest videos, that's why I'm not in a rush for anything because everything takes time.

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       I looked at like one of your podcasts with Eddie Bravo like three hours long. He got like 11,000 views. Oh yeah, yeah. Like 20,000 views. I want to say like, hey, how do I get paid from podcasts? I'm like dude, them for six years. Yeah. I didn't get paid at all for years. I mean this podcast is almost 10 years old and I didn't really start getting paid like five years ago. And it's fascinating to see that, like you go look at your oldest videos, 20,000, 30,000 views. Yeah. And that's the thing, like MMA fans are fickle, right? They like who they like, they don't like, they like, it's only about three or four fighters. They could get a lot of views, but then you tense. It's that way with everything. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. And people are fascinated. Like I'm lucky enough to know a Khabib.

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       Right. Or somebody like that. Like I didn't know who this guy was until Rashad Evans was like, Yo, let me introduce you to my Guy Ali. And then I met Ali filming some Henzel Gracie stuff for him. Um, and he was like, Yo, I like you man. Let me put you together with my fighter. You know, who could be. And I was like, is that they kind of fought Michael Johnson. I didn't know who could be was. He was like, I think y'all would be a good fit because the way you do stories and stuff like that, I think you'll hear like you and you're like him. I literally met him of January of last year of 2018 in Boston. Um, and when Francis Find Steve Pay and Vulcan was fighting DC and that was the first time I ever met her. And the rest is history. I, I filmed him up there. He was Finna fight Tony.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       Um, then I found them during the whole Connor fiasco, Al Quinta. Then I went to Dagestan. I went to Dagestan. What's that like? Intense. But it was, it was beautiful because people tried to scare me when I was supposed to go to Dagestan who like I got people in the UFC, they was like, Yo, be careful over there. I'm thinking like people that work for the UFC just stand like, be careful. Like, and I'm thinking to myself like, am I dms on Instagram? Like Bro, just be careful. They don't fucking play over there. I was going through, I went during Ramadan last June at the end of Ramadan. And uh, did you have to observe while you were there? So, uh, could be wanting me to come during like the last tail end of Ramadan. Right. So I went over there, um, by myself. Went and got my visa in Miami and went over there, just got my ticket.

Speaker 1:          00:52:03       And um, I went over there. I remember the first day I got there, I was in like customs for like two hours cause they couldn't speak English at this little airport in, in Dagestan and Cubby was outside and he wouldn't come into the airport cause he too famous. Right. And this is in the middle of the night. And I remember when I first got there, uh, it was just checkpoints everywhere when I got there. Like we like drive down the street person with some guns. I'm like, alright cool. We're, I don't know where we at but this is Dagestan. And um, I ended up getting to this, this, I stayed at his uncle house I think. And from there it was, it was just a beautiful moment. The Dagestan chronicles is my most popular thing on my channel obviously, cause it's Sean could be even a way no one's ever seen them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       Um, I observed Ramadan the whole time I was there. I didn't eat, I didn't drink. I did exactly what could be and them did because I think a problem with us a lot as Americans is we take our culture somewhere else and I wanted to observe their culture and really see what it was like and I was fascinated. I wanted to know why women covered themselves and I asked all those questions. All of that stuff is in the documentary and now when I get all these millions of people watching these videos, the most common thing is like where is the women at? And I'm like, why are these people so obsessed with where the women at? And I literally went into that. Like I asked like when you, when these women are married, you don't point a camera at these people. Like I've seen women, you just don't point a camera at them.

Speaker 1:          00:53:23       It's rude. Right. And that's like then their culture and their culture. Did they explain this to you? Did, what did they say? They literally just said, they look at w like I talked to a couple of them, a couple of people over there, and he was just like, we look at our woman is women as Queens and we cover him because in, in, in, in the Koran is, you know, the man is weak to the flesh. So they don't want their woman to be, you know, looked at by other men things. Yeah. That's the word I was looking for. So you just covered themselves up. Um, and in our culture that's, you know, they may be weird, but I respect it. Like what they told me, it made sense. It literally made sense where it was just like, listen, we don't let another man look at our wife.

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       Right. I'm not going to bash on that culture because I feel like that's silly. I want, we can do whatever they want to do. That's just how they feel. Like I don't, you know, so, but I seen women, I seen some beautiful women too while I was in Dagestan. So it wasn't the fact that I didn't film any women. I seen women, but they explained to you when you go here, you cannot film the women. No, no, no. It was just, yeah, in a way, like just don't film another man's woman. Like I think I talked to Chris Weiman once a, when I was at his gym, when I was doing I laquinta he, he went to Chechnya. Yeah. And uh, he told me a story, I think him and four of them went to Chechnya and he was telling me a story of like, he accidentally touched on woman's hand and uh, they like literally got on like you don't touch another woman, you don't touch a woman's hand over here cause that's bad on her.

Speaker 1:          00:54:57       Right. And I was like, damn, that's crazy you came. Cause he said he was just like reaching out, shaking people's hands, you know, human instinct, you reach and grab somebody's hand. And he just said, man, that that's different culture over there. You see a woman can't touch another man's hand. So yeah, that guy from Chechnya, the, the leader of Chechnya, he's like really into MMA. Right? He flies no people out yet. You know, what's crazy is that I don't know anything about the guy or his politics or anything, but I know that he obsessed with fighting. Right. I know Tyler Spong been over there and why men and all these guys, I just met nick the tooth the other day and they went up, they went over there to Chechnya, him and amended his brother's a there. That's the injury too. Yeah, they had, I think the men, his brothers had like a seminar or some seminar.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       I, I did like a preview of Cheeto Vera and he was talking about it and they're like, they did a Jujitsu match in front of some oligarch over there. Like it's crazy. Right? Like they flew him over there for that. Yeah. That's got a lot of money. Yeah. OP, Hey, I'm not even fighting these sponsors. Didn't need to give, could be like some crazy Mercedes when he won. I think I started an Instagram. You got like a gift. I think he gave him some crazy s-class [inaudible] getting that Dubai money now though, he always in Dubai. Listen, I mean, since it's fight, even in Dubai, how many times, what's he doing over there? Speaking, things like that. I mean, when you one of the most famous, I think he's like top 15 and most famous athletes now. Both for sure. And definitely the most famous Muslim athlete.

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       Yeah. Yes. So I mean he the only UFC champion that's undefeated other than John Jones, who should be undefeated if it not for that one. Listen, fucked up disqualification. I have to spend a time what could be been daggy Stan like me and his father going into the mountains and things like, I just don't see nobody beating him. I'm sorry, what you throw at them? You don't walk away. I just feel like just his pedigree of where he from, it's nothing that's going to break that guy. It's you can't, what are you going to do it? I just don't think there's nothing you can do. After going to Dagestan and seeing how those people live and how that Derrick, their code and their values and how they live. What was so convincing? Well, just how strict that faith is over there. Right? And they tie in everything they do to their faith.

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       It's sort of like how Ali was like, I'm not going to lose because I lie and things like that. And I truly believe that after seeing like just the camaraderie over there, the gyms they train in the mountains, everything that makes this guy, it's nothing in the octagon that someone is going to do like this is going to beat. Could be like everything can happen, a fluke can happen. We see it all the time. But I just feel like mentally there's nothing that's gonna Break Khabib. Like if, I feel like if he was ever in a situation where he had to tap, he wouldn't like he would, he would just have to put him to sleep. Cause I just don't think that's possible. Like to beat him. I honestly feel like it could be, you can't lose, I just don't see nobody beating him. I just, I've been in locker rooms are fighters and you got a butterfly.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       I fell in and things like that. Like when he fought Connor and I was in a locker room, could be, was facetiming his people in Dagestan laughing and Javier Mendez is like, let's get focused, let's get focused, let's get focused. Could be, he was not caring. Wow. Could be just ready to go. Right. When, uh, Tony Ferguson was fighting pedis, he like hitting Mitts with Javier and I could be just looking up to the screen. Javier is like, let's get folks like his focus can be, you don't care man. It's a different level. He always said that's like his favorite thing. This is a different level and that's what I love about him, man. It's like people are obsessed with the fighter. I like to beaver as a person and that's the thing that I get out of this anatomy of a fighter. It's like just hanging out with his guy.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       But like if you ever watch my series, I never really talk about a guy's fight coming up. Like if you ever watch anatomy and fight, it's not about your opponent, it's just about your life. Because I felt like when I created it, I felt like these organizations wasn't promoting fighters all the way and not, yeah, they gonna promote the top fighters and things like that. But what about the guys that are two and one in the UFC not ranked like they in the UFC. Like they may get cut after a couple of fights, like what did they have left after that? And I was just like, let me create the series instead of a documentary and just continue to build this and follow these guys' lives. And that's all I really wanted to do. It was no hidden incentive where I was like, I'm gonna make millions of dollars off this.

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       I'm going to end up on the Joe Rogan podcast. It was like, I love following these fighters and telling their stories because it's sorta like similar to my journey, you know, these guys are, what was the guy that just fought, um, Dhahran win in Greenville? Eric Spicy or spice Lee or whatever his name was. He tweeted like, oh, I had, he just got, they got fighting in the night. He was like, I had two minus two 70 in my bank account. Yeah, I been there Joe. So that's why I, I'd get the passion out of doing it cause I been there with these fighters. I at this point in my life, I've paid for fighters, flights and hotels because they couldn't get a hotel. Like these fighters know that some of these fighters know that to where I'm able to help them. And I, I'm finding this all on my own breaking myself.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       So I'm to me, I'm just thinking about myself like you doing this for a specific reason, you passionate about it and you want to tell these guys' lives and I just really want it to offer another glimpse into fighter slots other than fight week. And Are you getting paid from Youtube revenue? Yeah, my account is moaning to not Mona Tonies and verify. Yeah. Monitor, monetized and verified. And depending on a month, it can be a good month. It can be a bad month. Um, it's surprising to me. I haven't got a sponsor yet. Like it's popular as the channel is, but it is what it is now. Probably. Who knows. I mean shout out to like people like eight minutes strong like you know, then that's Ryan Bader. Stephanie. Yeah, that's Ryan Bader. Shout out to Adam, the owner of it and his brother, like they was the first people to ever send me stuff like t shirts.

Speaker 1:          01:00:57       I was just happy. I was like, damn, I got some free gear. Right? Like man. Finally I remember seeing they shirts back when I first started with Kamala whose mom was wearing stuff. And you know, companies like that, you get money here and there from them, but like to sustain this like member fight land, remember to show white land. I heard they went out of business because the funding wasn't advice. It's something like that. It's company because out they went out of business because of funding. Vice probably just decided to stop doing it. Listen Joe, you travel. But vice's a billion dollar company. That's true. What they believe. Fight landers advice show, isn't it? What's fun up? Yeah, pretty, pretty sure fight. Lynn was vice. If you flew to Phoenix for three days to do comedy, um, and get a hotel and you know how expensive flight and like, so imagine me funding this on my own if I want to go somewhere for three days, especially Dagestan yeah, shit like that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       And where are you staying when your entire staff? I was staying with US state. It could be Eve's family house. Oh Wow. Yeah. So I stayed a, they put me like above a store and he told me, he gave me a key. He was like, brother locked this door at night, brother Jesus Christ. He was like, don't go outside. I still went outside. Did you? Yeah, I still went outside. You Go. I just was roaming like walking around, just filming stuff. What's it like out in Dagestan when you're roaming the street? They never really seen black people over there. So I was like a little celebrity over there and you're a big one. And they know I'm from, I'm Waco Beach, so I was cool with that. So they knew that. Yeah. You know, you get me. Yeah. They was Chitlin. Did they speak English? A couple people did.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       Yeah. A couple people did. Did they ask you questions? Yeah, they asked me questions. They, you know, they, they obviously I had already been with Khabib at that time, you know, I was, that was past the Conor McGregor fiasco. So you know, my channel get popular cause it's something like that. And they just watched anything could be related. Could be, you've got some crazy fans, man. How many people live in Duggan style? Man, I don't know Jimmy. Pull that up. I said, just want to say that I saw some of the videos of people celebrating when he wanted it was fucking crazy, man. It was treats are honking their horns and when he won the title or when he econ or would it be Connor? And that was crazy. 2.9 million. Yeah. Okay, cool. So, um, so it's your, you're, it's a city, but it's essentially like this big, the mountains.

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       Yeah, it's big. The mountains are like right next to it or something like sorta like when we went to his mountain village, we had to drive like two hours to get there. Oh really? Yeah. Like we had to go on the borders of Chesney. I had to get another visa. Oh Wow. Just to get through that checkpoint. I'll never forget like we got to the checkpoint and they like, we had the all give them my stuff and it could be a, it could be, it was like get out and the dude was like get out the army guy with his gun and then I get out and I come around the car and could be, he was like get your camera brother. Right. And then he was like, they want to take a picture with you with the camera. I was like, God what the Hell Y'all about to do?

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       Yeah, I call it like a bad case of diarrhea while I was over there cause I eat nothing but meat. I was trying to do Quito, I was over there and listen, the toilets are just a hole in the ground. Do you have to squat? Yeah, you got to squat and pull the string or whatever. So I remember like we was driving from his village at the, that was like my last night there and I called like I was always destroyed. I was like, we got two hours and we like stopped a couple of times to eat and pray and all that stuff. Like, you know, and I remember like I was suffering and could be like filming me with his phone, laughing, looking at his brother, look at his brother, he's about to shoot and said, and I remember getting back to the place where I was standing Dagestan oh my God, I probably lost like eight pounds. It was crazy, man. It was a crazy experience, man. It was a crazy experience in Dagestan. That's life changing. It changed my life. How long were you there for?

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       Nine days. Wow. It changed my life. Really? Yeah, because when you, in this type of industry, everybody materialistic. We all want nice things. We want to live in Nice places, on to drive nice cars. I do. Most people do want to live nice and comfortable and I saw just how happy these people was just living their lives. Like, went to his village, I went to his mountain village and I was in a city and I saw these people were just happy and maybe on, on the outside they was happy and maybe they was dealing with other things that we don't know about. But I saw familiness brotherhood and I, I had a little bit of respect for their culture. Like obviously with Islam and things like that, there's so many different sex that makes it bad. Just like with Christianity and, and people in the Catholic community and the priest and everything.

Speaker 1:          01:05:48       And that's my experience with the Islamic community being around cubby. So that's the only thing that I can go off of. And obviously everybody see Muhammad Ali and he praises and things like that. But um, I had a new found respect, uh, for just the simpleness of, of that, like a beep. I thought honestly it could be, it was going to retire after he fought Connor cause I talked to him a little bit about that and cause he don't want much. What did he say after the color fat? No, no, before the kind of fight before he was, he was just like, what do you think about, uh, me retiring after the Conor fight? I was like, man, you do what you want to do. I can't tell you. He was like, I mean, I'm gonna have money. What else do I need to do? Right.

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       Because he obviously knew that was going to be the biggest, the biggest fight ever. So at the IFC make for that fight, I don't know. Well remember they took his check, right? But obviously he got a lot money for that. They gave him a con counter. I think Conner had $4 million check and it could be, had a $2 million check and then obviously they had the paper viewpoints. Right. So I was like, damn, where my money yet? I promoted the things match. You should've definitely unpaid for that. Listen, you know what's funny is that, uh, somebody asked me a long, it was like, if you got anything out of this whole thing, what would you want? I'd be like, I camera, let's go get a new camera so I could shoot some movies or something. Right. That's literally the low expectations I had out of making the series.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       Right. Especially when there was a documentary. I was just like, man, maybe I'll make this documentary, put it on Netflix or Amazon for free about fighters and now looking back on it, the stuff that I have captured on him, hard drives, I can sell a documentary for millions of dollars. I think I got Mazin footage I got, I got the whole Connor thing that I got like that. That tape is like 20 minutes. Nobody's ever seen it. I have it. No one's really seen the whole thing. Like I got Connor when he first ran down the tunnel like, cause I seen him from a distance. I wonder if the UFC would be against you putting that out or pro you put nothing out because well I put it out on my channel a snippet and then at the end of it going to happen. I was like watch the full episode on embedded right.

Speaker 1:          01:07:58       I, I gave them their just do and then they literally told me like all we'll give you credit. I never got credit. Uh, I was just hoping they put shout out the anatomy of a fighter for helping us get this footage. I never got that. They should have either way. You're getting it now. Yeah. So here we are man. And Yeah, you know like going from the first day I walked into that gym and saying C'mon Ooze my toe filming him for two years and all the way to the title when I used to post videos of Camarillo Guzman on the channel and he'd get 4,000 views and people like, why are you posting this bomb? I'm thinking to myself like these fans are crazy. He can't pay attention to that. Those are just, it's hard John. Even the fans, it's hard. It's trolled. It's a tiny amount of lose.

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       It's crazy. Cause I love the MMA fans. I'm close to the line that the last time you were here we were talking about the comments. You can't read it. You can't, it'll drive you fucking crazy. Cause the people that want to comment and want to fuck with you. It's the smallest number, the loudest, the most vocal. And they have the shittiest lives. No one with a good life wants to do that. No one, no one is happy and healthy wants to fuck with you and say it's crazy when you put your time and effort into something, like say for example, I flew to Phoenix, film shine and film Bader and then you spend all these hours, 10 hours editing something and then you put it on and then somebody like this. That dude sucks. It's like damn man, you appreciating what I'm doing. Are you just trolling you talking tomorrow?

Speaker 1:          01:09:23       I mean you're reading the thoughts of morons. You're reading the thoughts of limited minds. That's all it is. It's really that simple. Yeah, it's nuts. Anybody who thought the come out loose mine was a bum. I knew whose mom was a murderer years ago. I just saw him fight years ago. I want, nobody wants to fight that. I know I used to put your, I used to love taking snippets of your podcast, your voice cause you just that narration voice and putting it with stuff and like you can be like, oh that was a universe pulling us together. But no, I just was like this goes with this. Like I like when you and Shab are together. I love that because y'all able to bounce ideas cause obviously his experience with the fight game and then your experience with the fight game, y'all able to bounce a debate and things like that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       And I'm like that's a good mix. Like a lot of people go in on a episode I did at a weigh ins with Connor and Khabib and it was like you and shop talking and that's just the narration shot of how I do film because that's what I love about document sports documentaries is narration and that's how I get it. I get so many people that like, oh I want to, I'm trying to do the same thing you're doing. And I'm like, don't try to be anatomy of a fighter. Right? Like, if I, if I'm filming one fighter, this a thousand other fighters, not just, I don't want to just do UFC, I want to do better. I want to do one, I want to do boxing. That's why I was, I was trying to say earlier, my goal, I would love to do it anatomy or Deontay log.

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       I bet you could do it. I bet you I tried to get, I had Andy Ruiz and, and they did. So what happened was micro, she reached out to me and was like, Hey, do you want to do Andy Ruiz? I was like, I'm thinking John Ruiz, right? So I'm like junior, junior, or senior, right. And he was like, no, the guy that replaced big baby Miller and that's one of my good friends, big baby Miller. And uh, he was like, yeah, man, he's fighting Joshua now. He got a good chance. I had posted on my Instagram like a text message from him. He was like, man, it'd be a good opportunity because I think he can really beat, uh, Joshua. And he did. And I missed out c those are the moments like the Connor Dolly thing is key moments in film like this viral nation that you need to, that's why I film everybody. I found these guys. It's not popular. Things like that because these guys may be the champions one day and I want to be like I was there at the beginning and that's the, that's the thrill you get out of it, if anything. Right? Yeah, and I've, I filmed the pseudos, I filmed the ooze. Mine's a film that could be, I've been in locker rooms with the title winners. I've been in there when invoking loss.

Speaker 3:          01:11:50       Well you were telling me some great footage that you got that you wouldn't have gotten that store wouldn't have got out about pseudo about. So Hutto coming back from the Olympic gold medal, winning the Olympics in wrestling and then fucking living in the gym to, to win the golden.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       That's crazy. Crazy. I never knew that. That's the ecstasy I get out of filming these guys. Like you hear these little stories and I was like, you never talk about that. Right? Like, you know, he's running with the whole heel of the gold metal thing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:17       Well, he's doing some weird shit now. He's like, he's calling himself the king of cringe. What is that about?

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       Well, because people was calling them cringy like just, you know how they, they, they rake on Luke Rockhold

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       the triple c now, now triple c, he'd run away. He liked the Mexican Colby. Covington. Well, you better be careful what he is. Is he a beast though? His mind is just unstoppable. The fact that Marlon fucked him up like that in that first round and was chewing his legs out. I mean, I did not think, and it looked like he was going to get k out. It looked like he couldn't close the distance. Marlin looked calm and comfortable and super professional and then a flip switch switch, flipped. And then the second round came around. And so who knows, just walk at him down and closing the distance. Then. Then he gets him in the clinch and lands knees. I'm like, this is like a fucking movie.

Speaker 1:          01:13:05       That's Eric Albertson and Santina and the Franco and all those guys over there. Uh, that fight ready has something to do with those guys. You know, when he lost it, I did not know when he lost the DJ. So who though was lost? He went on a whole world tour to find himself. He went to Thailand. He went to Brazil. He was trained in everywhere after he lost it the first time. And that's those little stories right there. Like he felt like as he needed to get better as a martial artist,

Speaker 3:          01:13:33       he said, I mean with DJ at the time, it's arguable now. Who's the best? It's like him or John Right now he's at one FC. It's a totally different ballgame. But with DJ was, was the most complete package we'd ever seen the most. The, the guy who you couldn't hit, you could hit you, he could wrestle you, he could submit you, he could strike with you. He had incredible footwork and speed. I mean, DJ was just perfect. And that night he just found that opening just fucked him out with these, the body. I mean, DJ man, there was moments in DJ's career where I remember watching him and calling his fights. I'm like, God damn this dude special. It's like something about what he's doing. He's so far ahead of everybody in the division

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       so far. I'm about to go up to Seattle or Kirkland [inaudible] sample for one FC. Concentrate on mad. He man, human's a bad mother fucker. Oh my God. He's got such a deep knowledge and understanding of the sport. You ever see him fight? No. Mad Him stopped, uh, Pat Miletich back in that day. He saw pat, he, he, what did he, who did he submit? Kenny Johnson. He, I forget who it was in one of those. Um, they, they used to have, they had a professional submission, grappling pay per view event. At one point in time. Frank shamrock submitted Dan Henderson and um, Matt Hume was a fucking straight up killer. I mean, he was a really, really good world-class mixed martial artist back when nobody was, he had excellent Moitai excellent submissions. He was good at everything. How has, how has this Seattle MMAC well, I mean, there's been great guys to come from it.

Speaker 5:          01:15:01       Like Josh Barnett and of course mighty mouse being the biggest one. It's not as big as say like Miami, like where you're at in south Florida. That's, that's the biggest problem I live in south Florida. That was that, I mean Blackzilians and American top team on one spot and then a plethora of world-class Jujitsu around that area. I mean, and then also world-class boxing obviously mean that's where I'm, I mean, I'm, what the fuck is his name? Sugary linens trainer. Muhammad Ali's trainer. I'm the old guy. Custom model. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The older guy who said to us, no, no, no. You're blowing it son. Fuck is his name. The old Italian guy. Fuck this. I remember saying, I can't believe I can't remember his name. This is embarrassing. Um, sugarrae Leonard's boxing trainer. Angelo. Angelo. Dundee. Yeah. Angelo Dundee. Yeah. Blowing it kid.

Speaker 5:          01:15:56       When he comes out and stops Tommy Hearns the next round. That's crazy. That was, that was a, that was Miami. Denver said, I'm not going to be in la long like la or not. You're a gypsy man. So my whole thing is, honestly, Joe, I need to, I want to settle somewhere though. What do you want? Settle Danvers. This is that. This is all was going to ask you. So these are the three cities I'm thinking about to settle for maybe a few years, four years back. The San Diego, Denver, and Seattle. Which one should I choose? I would say San Diego or Denver. I love Seattle. But that went or that rainy season can suck my deck. You can't do it. It'll drive you crazy when it rains for seven weeks in a row and you look out the window, you're like, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. Isn't not enough online dating. Be sitting in there swiping left, right? Nah, it's just vitamin D man. It just say it really is not good for your health. San Diego, San Diego. Love it. Well, I love Sandy. I live in a, a nice apartment complex now and the good thing about it is I can transfer, they have a relocation program. Like if you want to transfer 30 miles away, that you can do it for free. So I can

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       choose those cities. Oh. So like I can just transfer it to them cities. I'm thinking like, man, I got to get out of downtown La. Man, that's crazy. Girls rose, it's not a real downtown. Sounded like downtown New York. It's like the walking dead around. Yes. Ah Bro. Listen, I live there all the time. It's gross. I went in there the other day and I was going to get like some quest bars and I seen like this dude in the aisle like and he, and he was like, what's up man? And he had like a basket full of stuff and then I look at him again. He just like open enough stuff eating it. Like you go to another aisle, somebody just roaming with a cart and these is all homeless people just putting stuff in carts and this didn't get kicked out by security. And then you see them in check out and you're like, this is crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:17:54       It's every day downtown is insane. It's infested with homeless people. You can't fix it. Like the only way to fix it is bad. You'd have to take them, arrest them, put them in a plane and fly them somewhere and drop them off. But that's what I heard they doing. I heard they did that to la, like dropping people off in the late. Didn't we go over this? We went up and someone got sent to like Indiana. What? We looked this up and in fact they'd been doing that forever. Sending people all around the country. This whole flight paths of what they did with homeless people. They just send homeless people and let someone else deal with it. Shit. They need to drop them off in Denver. It's hurting our Denver getting bad too. Of course it's getting bad with that weed money. The weed money and now mushroom money cause now Denver decriminalized mushrooms.

Speaker 4:          01:18:38       Prostitution next. Whoo. Probably cheaper than dating djs. Hey man, La boys tough. I don't, I don't, I'll probably just spend a lot of money on first dates. Yeah, I'm sure you want to repress realistic cause it sucks to be a man and dating because you got to impress. Well, if I remember the precedents, listen, when before I started making money and having money dating was fun cause you was broke and you can do smoothie dates and Starbucks dates and then you know he was going to spend five, six bucks. I have a conversation. I'm 37 yeah, that's you're too close to 40 to be doing that. I know you can't do that no more. You gotta you gotta take chicks to palm springs for the weekend or things like that. Well they want to knock me and stuff now though. Sure. Yeah. Like this guy could take them to a nice dinner.

Speaker 4:          01:19:21       Yeah, I'm nice. I don't fault any woman that wants a man that has his shit together. Yeah. Because for so long I didn't and now I do. Now I want to have some fun of course. Yeah. For, forget that. I ain't trying to complain no more. But as far as like cities of the Vibe, I love the vibe of San Diego and I loved the vibe of Denver. I love those cities. Yeah. I'm, I'm leaning towards back to San Diego because it's still close to like, I just drove the Irvine other day. I was like, that was a simple drive as long as you do it earlier. Yeah. He tried to do that shit at four o'clock in the afternoon. You want to shoot yourself? You want to, there's the Irvine Improv. I workout all the time, dude. When I have a seven o'clock show, I leave here at fucking noon and whatnot. Not playing games. I leave here at noon. I get there early. I check in, I have dinner. I don't fuck around with that 4:00 PM traffic. It's

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       insane. It took me six hours to get down there once. When you went to shop show, when he had his special, how early do no known. Known Damn. Got a hotel just to put my shit in. Checked in, checked out. I didn't even stay there. My daughter had an event the next day that I had to go to for school, so I drove back. I said, yeah, I drove that back that night after the show, after the second show, I say easy. That's an easy drop though. I remember some bad. Yeah. Especially late, late at night. Yeah. You get a couple of red bulls and you have your phone. Yeah, I got to La quick once a from when I lived in San Diego, I used my boys truck. I met this girl online in the middle of the night. It does draw a girl online in the middle of that, listen, I know if I ever was going to end up on a Joe Rogan podcast, I thought it was going to be for me writing a book about an online dating, real professions of an online data. I swear I do that. My Ex, you don't need a book, but just do a video about it. Do documentaries about how crazy that I used to film girls and interview them and everything about dating. Like what sucks about dating and things like that. I'm lying. Dating is only existed for like, like at its raw form 20 years. Right. Ross forum was 20 years ago. That was like AOL. That was you as a Weirdo then though. Oh Wow. Everybody listen

Speaker 1:          01:21:28       if you, if you do Tinder or bumble in La, you see and celebrities and everything on it. I'm ready. Yes. Chicks like Ollie, successful chicks surgeon for love. Wow, that's scary. Justin, why is it scary? Because you don't know who you really meet him. Like

Speaker 5:          01:21:43       for a woman, imagine being a woman and you're gay. I was, it was sucked to be a woman and trying to be weird. A successful celebrity woman trying to meet dudes.

Speaker 1:          01:21:52       You want to hear this story and this is crazy. So I met this famous online female trainer, beautiful here in La. She's very pop lang. I'll say her name. I met her on match.com and I got her Instagram and she, we, you know, we exchanged our Instagrams or whatever. So I re I looked at it, looked at her, are her Instagram and she was doing like, you know, content but own her phone, like in our living room doing like squat jumps and things like that. And I reached out to her like we set up a date, we going to go hike him, run and do everything. And I was like, listen, I looked at your, your, your, your Instagram page and your content. I would love to be able to help you out and give you better content. She lost it. I don't need your help. I don't need your help. You look like you need to help yourself. Like I'm like, I'm just telling you that I could help. I'm like, why? Like I am a filmmaker. I could help you do some content. Like she, she took it the wrong way. Like I probably tried to take advantage of her millions of followers and things like that. I was just like, boy, I was like, man, I'm going to be single forever.

Speaker 5:          01:23:01       But I think sometimes that's also, there's a very limited communicating with on in a text. Yep. It's any ticket the wrong way. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You got to kind of meet people. Like if you, but I bet if you met her and you said, hey, you know, you're, you are, you're beautiful. You got a gray body. These videos are great and everything, but I think I could make them even better. She still wouldn't take it the wrong way. Oh, she was like in her 40 forties probably still get set, but she was a female. You know those Alpha females that you can, some girls have been fucked over so many times. They think everyone's gonna fuck them over. It's like a dog's been beaten. You ever pick up a dog from the pound? Oh yeah. I've had dogs in the past and you're like, Hey, I love dogs. Come on, I'm not going to beat you. This is nuts. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       I would probably think San Diego would be to move. Or Denver.

Speaker 5:          01:23:47       I like both of them. Man, I'm going to go wrong and you can't go wrong. Well you can't go wrong MMA wise. Like San Diego has a alliance. You know San Diego has a ton of Great Jujitsu. Shout out to my man, Boogie at 10th planet and then it's close to here. Yeah, it's real close to here. But then Denver's the fucking Shamberg on a lot of gym. Denver also has really good vibe. I liked the people in Denver a lot. I liked the people at San Diego too. I would it look, I'd flip a coin if I had to move out and no kids. So I would just click on San Diego. That's it. Everybody, that's how I'm going to do. I would be happy either one, they said you can't go wrong. And they're both a good size city. You know what I'm saying? Like not too crazy. Yeah. Like San Diego is a great size. Cities kind of going out got like, I'm not, I don't do clubs. You know, I'll go to a bar here and there. Cutting your online dating right. Gets in the way. Well, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:24:41       I think in the early days I was in the clubs every day. Yeah. That's a waste of time. It's, yeah. A lot of years I wasted just partying, not trying to get my shit together. So I feel like now when it's different, when you, you find a passionate man and you get obsessed with it. Yeah. And I'm obsessed with this anatomy of a fighter thing. Like I have a, um, a post in my phone that I was going to show you where it was. Uh, it was like August 22nd, 2017 and I had four 54 subscribers and I was like 46 till my first hundred. And I was like, listen, it's not a lot, but I appreciate all the supporters, uh, that I have. So this is going to be one of the biggest MMA documentary channels in the world. And that was August 22nd, 2017 when I first started the channel, I couldn't even name it anatomy of a fighter yet you have to wait till you get a hundred subscribers. So like looking back on that journey in a sacrifice that I, I've made to like I went from south Florida to Vegas, Vegas to Florida, Florida to Vegas, Vegas to Florida, Florida to here and now here we are. How many subscribers you have now? How many dog got Jimmy a I think to 238,000. Beautiful.

Speaker 5:          01:25:53       I have a little thing in the back from when we had a thought, 100,000 subscribers. We got a little award. Yeah, I got one too. I was like silver creator, 1000 a hundred thousand subscribers. I was my only goal

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       with anatomy of fighter. I have a, my, my friends have youtube channels. Uh, and I seen what they was doing and that was a goal, like the silver creator award. If you get 100,000. And I was like, maybe I get it in two or three years. That's what I thought like, and I can just do this on the side. And then once, once I started getting some traction, I was like, let me ease back on weddings and that I'm leaving guaranteed income and comfortability that put my time and effort into this because now I'm like, I can't, I got 200,000 people following me. I can't go back now. I've got to continue to build this. Well, it's to be

Speaker 3:          01:26:39       giant man. You really talented and it's really shit. And what I like about this podcast, what I was hoping this podcast was going to be is exactly what it was. I love to hear people's stories. I love to hear. That's one of the reasons why I like documentaries because I think we can all relate to moments in our lives where we're lost or we just didn't have it or it wasn't we, you know, it was a halt, wasn't, it wasn't where we wanted it to be and trying to figure out how the fuck do I get it together? How the fuck do I make it happen? It's the real, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:27:08       It's like Instagram is fake. Like you make it look whatever you want, but documentaries won't lie. Exactly. And that's the reason why I love doing that, that, that form of content because it's just like everybody, listen, one thing I've learned about the whole series is that everybody's not gonna like a certain fighter. One fighter is not gonna get a lot of views, a some people, and not even going to care about that fighter because that's just the way momentum in popularity is. But I, that's what I love it the most. Like somebody asked me the other day because I had posted a picture on my Instagram of the NBA draft. It was one player sitting by herself while they was interviewing Zion Williamson, all the media. And you know how it is immediately in the UFC, everybody got their name or this guy was sitting by herself and nobody was trying to talk to them.

Speaker 1:          01:27:55       And I said, Yo, if you ever in this position, use this as motivation. And I think like C'mon Guzman posted, like I've been there where nobody wants to pay attention to you. So somebody comment and was like, would you rather film Khabib or a regional LFA guy? I was like, the regional LFA Guy, I take pleasure in the connecting with people just like me. I'm not popular. It was that picture right there. Like nobody's paying attention to them. And that's how I just clicked. No thanks to the pop up ad. That's essentially what they're saying about him. No thing. So that's, that's how I feel even in the media circuit with what I do is with

Speaker 3:          01:28:31       everything. Yeah. I mean I've been there as a comedian, I've been there in the early days of podcasting. You know, it's, it's how it is. It's just life is a journey. And what I love about your story is that people can relate to someone struggling and then figuring it out and then it gives them hope. Like, okay, I'm struggling now, but if I just make the right moves and put the right amount of effort and focus and dedication to something, I can make something happen. Everybody can. I've really believed that and I love that. It's one of my favorite things. I'm a, I'm a success

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       junkie. I love watching other people's success. I'm a big fan of other [inaudible] well yeah, it's helping people. Yeah. Listen, um, I've been in locker rooms when they lose and I'm in there when they, they win and it's the same for me. I feel bad for the other opponent. Like I, people always ask me, do you get any type of excitement out of filming guys when or not really? I'm just telling the story. You have to be like that. Like Colby Covington, C'mon ooze mine. I would love to be neutral and film both of them and do a story on Colby in a story on Uzma. Like people always get mad was like, why don't you post about this fight? I'm like, I'm finding this myself. I'm not, I can't, first of all, again, stop rules, fucking comments. They'll change perception. So I've, I've met people that have gotten mad reading comments, they go crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:29:55       They think the world's out to get them. I'm like, Hey, you got like a hundred people that are talking shit to you and then you've got a thousand million or whatever the fuck it is. They love, they love you. Don't, don't do this man, don't do that. But I, but I do wish I, I get, I can't wait till I get to a point where I can have the resources to go film a lot more content because I love doing this. Like I would love to go to when you had colonial Roundtree on and I had commented on it on a comment on Youtube, like I would love to do anatomy of Kahlil and Thailand. I'll hook it up. I would love to just go there to Thailand. I couldn't, you know, collegial. Nah, I never met him. He's amazing. Just go out when I send you on the edge in no damn buildings like he was doing.

Speaker 5:          01:30:34       He crazy for that. He's crazy. But the, the transformation that guy's made as a fighter from when he went to Thailand, he's back there now. He's in Bangkok. He's a beast man. That Eric Anders fight. I was like, Holy Shit. And Aaron, he's a tough dude. He's as tough as that. He did. That was one thing Kahleel said he never even winced. I mean, he is eating leg kick after leg kick from a guy who kicks as hard as anybody I've ever seen. That's crazy. Khalila is so fast. When I was watching him throw those kicks, I was like, well, who is this guy? He was weird. How did you turn into this guy? Like you see as earlier fights and you see this, he beat go guns go, wasn't it? He not go concentrating loss, right? Yeah. He lost the Johnny Johnny Walker. Johnny when he went and reinvented itself again, Johnny caught him with an elbow in the clinch man.

Speaker 5:          01:31:21       He caught him with one of these of these elbows in the clinch and he kao them and you know, he would just said, okay, I have to really learn Moitai and so fucking I'm going to Thailand. I know he went to Thailand and I followed his Instagram journey, you know, watching all his training footage and that and he just fell in love with Thailand. And then he came back and I'm like, this is motherfuckers fight like a tonight looking like Saget from street fighter but like a jacked muscular 205 tie too crazy. That's crazy man. The nicest guy. Yeah, he couldn't get a nicer guy. It's nuts to to see that transformation. Like to see him go from like this guy that was chubby

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       and then this world class fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       Well does that too. But the difference between him in, well it's hard to say, right because the goal, Khan Saki fight was real quick. He just cracked him in the left hand and Khalila is very fast. And then see him getting Kao by Johnny Walker. But then to see, I've saw his other fights. I've seen many fights of his, but see that the transformation, I'm like, what the fuck the kicks man it was the kicks that he put it all together and he was fighting tie style. It's like he was one more of the most representative of Moitai I'd ever seen in MMA cause he, he just, he just absorbed

Speaker 4:          01:32:37       was, was better that the Thai style kickboxer

Speaker 3:          01:32:40       Dutch. There's no better man. The thing is like, look at Ramon Dekkers. Ramon Dekkers went over there and he fucked everybody up in Thailand and he was their size. It's the athlete, but it's also how they incorporate it in, you know, this look, there's some great tie fighters. Like I'm a w who the fuck is, I forgot how to say his name. That just a doom bages knocked him out. Um, big time tie fighter, uh, be had like 200 pro Thai fights. He had so many do make caught him with a in glory, caught them on the right hand. The clinch k owed him. It's like everybody sty and doom bays. More of a kickboxer. It's everybody. It's, it's the athlete, but everybody style has merits. Like there's merits to just being that wrestler who ground in pounds and doesn't throw many kicks. There's merits to being that Jujitsu guy that doesn't care that if they get taken down, it's just like, who are you though? Are you, are you Damien Maia on the ground? You know? I mean if you're Damian, my on the ground, there's merits to that style. Damien Maia has strangled a whole lot of world-class killers that never even got a punch off on him.

Speaker 4:          01:33:48       Uzma I got out of that wizard, they broke up,

Speaker 3:          01:33:51       they fucked it in Maya Naba. Lev is the guy he knocked out in his last fight. Doom, Doom Bay's a beast. Well, set your doom base and interesting guy man, because he reinvented himself. He was more of like a runner, not or, I want to say a runner, but more of a mover and he would win on points and he would, but then he'd just let the last few fights. It was a couple fights ago, two or three fights ago. He fought a, I forget, I forget how to say the fuck his name said. I don't remember how to say that. His name. Thai guys have those crazy names.

Speaker 4:          01:34:21       I uh, but I want to do this. I'm Finna do some stuff with uh, glory to glory is amazing. Gory does not get the respect that it deserves. No, I'm a giant fan. I watch all the glory. That's, that's what fascinates me about what I can do. Yeah. Cause people just think it's UFC. No. And Anatomy of a fighters. Everybody, anything. It's all of that. So what you're doing babe, if cops are on that dude, he's my favorite. Cedric Doom Bay. Poof. Yeah. Sox's man.

Speaker 3:          01:34:47       He flat lines. Everybody he's gone to. There it is. Sit. Sit Song peanuts. That's it. Tongue ties sits on penal. Say that real quick. Great. Don't Chas sing songs? Sing them. Go but go back to as a, is that so that guy that he fought, Tom Chai, Tom Chai had like, I mean hundreds of fights. I don't know how many fucking fights yet. Total. It was more than a hundred type fights and then a shit ton. Look 136 wins 175 fucking fights take 39 losses if I've won 136 times. Yeah, he fought 175 times. That is insane. So I mean he's got that Todd style. We're doing base more of a kickboxer style. A lot of times people say, well they prefer the Thai style because the elbows and the clinch and the knees, but doing bay flatline, Tim, it's the athlete. It's the way they incorporate their style competing against the other style and there's merits to kickboxing. I prefer the Thai style because I think there's, there's a real benefit to being really good at the clench. Yeah. To be in, especially when it comes to MMA. Real good at the clench the knees to the body, the elbows in the clinch and kickboxing does not allow elbows or knees to the body. But we've seen world-class kickboxers that have come on like like cro cop. You've had tremendous success in MMA going from kickboxing and to MMA.

Speaker 1:          01:36:11       I always wonder where like somebody like race, EFL Nim would do is prime in MMA like,

Speaker 3:          01:36:17       well, look at Mark Hunton and mark. Hans had a tremendous run and Mark Hunt. He fought race fri. Yes he did. Yes, he fought race at fault. Um, I mean when you go back to Mark Hunt, Mark Hunt really, I mean when he won the k one Grand Prix was probably when he's in his prime as an athlete and then he fought a lot of fights and prides. By the time we got him in the UFC, I mean Mark's in his forties now, right? I mean, I think his mark still is he retiring? It just lost his last fight, right? Who We lose to Willis? Um, yes. Yes. He lost a wills. Yeah, I think so. I think he's, he's retired though. I don't know, but he's probably close. You know, I mean, he's had a long, long,

Speaker 1:          01:36:58       well, not when I'm, when I was living in flood. Like my home gym is hard. Knock street 65. That's where I started. That's Henry hooves chip. Right. I love that guy. That's like my big brother, man. Love like a trainer. He needs a platform to tell his life story because it's crazy. Henry Rufus, he just got back from Thailand. He went over there, he told me, he's like, I just got away from the game for a couple of weeks and then I came back refreshed. Um, cause you know he, he's a beast. Like I wouldn't want to like get caught in the alley with Henry Hoof Dog. He's a big fellow too. Yeah, he told us me don't kick your damn knee out. Like that's just how it is. I didn't pissed him off a couple times. He didn't kick me through the cage. Why? I just complaining like complaining like, Hey man, these people didn't pay me enough and he like quit complaining like fell back. I was like, Damn. I was like holding on to the case. I'm like, hoof is a bad man man. You don't want to get on his bad side. He's a great trainer. He isn't. He a great guy and I'm happy.

Speaker 4:          01:37:57       AFS, listen star in his journey. I've seen so many people say, Oh, who've is a great coast, but he just can't coach a champion and just to see him grind in finally. But he has champions. He has ong and one fc two double champion. Yeah. Michael Chandler done one to build a couple of times. How do you say on this first name? I'm honest. I learned in songs how you pronounce it. I don't know. That's why I call him and he's a beast man. He's a B. People are sleeping on one fighters and I think when you see guys like Eddie Alvarez go over there and get KOD and you see a lot of fighters go over there and have real mighty mouse had a real hard fight. He did. That wasn't an easy fight. I love Chautry too. It's a d. I love Traci as well, but it's a different world where you're not cutting weight.

Speaker 4:          01:38:39       It's a different world. You know those advantages that you have of being big, they don't exist anymore. You're now fighting someone who's your size. I think it's better. I'm a gypsy. Hey, I would love to go live and seeing the pool and just in a just film one fc guy, maybe cha treat Chautry if you listen and if he hears this, maybe you'd have you come down and I talked to, I talked to uh, the executive producer of content. They want me to do some stuff for them though it is, it's changing the landscape of MMA because it is literally larger than the UFC worldwide because of Asia. All the millions of views. 1 million. Oh my God. Millions and millions. Every. Imagine if I got the Asian market on anatomy of fight over them, subscribing it all my God. And then we'll, the good thing is you wouldn't be able to read the contents comments. The comments would be all in Asian. You'd be like, I don't know what Tom was saying. Great. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       Don't fucking read them man. It's tough man. It's the hell it is. It's, it draws you in. Yeah. You'll be healthier and happier. You get it. They're like, I had got addicted for a minute. Like the Khabib effect and kind of our effect is real. And you post the video and you get 100,000 views within the four hours you'd like, it's going to be like this all the time. Then you post, you know, shout out to my God, Desmond Green, uh, a video of him and this insightful and it's talking about some stuff and he'd get 5,000 views and it's kind of like that. It's like a high, right. And it's like I got away from it though. That's the reason why I was like, you know what? I started thinking about a lot of stuff in the past month. I was like, man, I just need to move somewhere.

Speaker 4:          01:40:09       Live a normal life and film and I can, I can go fly somewhere, come back home, live in Denver, live in San Diego, and just be away from popularity and materialism. And, and that's the thing. It's like, I just want to stick to building this however long it takes. And like I said, if I look back on your channel on it, I see. I can't imagine where this could be in six years, I imagine, where it could be. Yeah, no. And then it can be gigantic. Especially when you think about the fact that you have so many different arts and different disciplines to study more. Thai kickboxing, Dutch kickboxing, uh, boxing, Jujitsu, Jujitsu. I mean there's so much you can study in so much you can watch and so much you can learn, but you're going to train yourself. Kamala, who's my told me I should go over to a undisputed and uh, or unbreakable, unbreakable and glazer. Why not? And just throw some hands. We'll just do some, oh no, you're fine. You've built for it. [inaudible] get that long dusty shirts man. Make you look good. Pants drunk. Well you obviously work out. Yeah. Yeah, I'll work out every day. Yeah, every day. But I kind of, you know what I, I I did, I did a, I read a whole thing on runners high yesterday cause I was like, I want to get back into running for endorphins. Yay. Yay. How much do you weigh? Two 30. Yeah. That's

Speaker 3:          01:41:24       the thing about running. Like, I really think that a lot of people overdo it when they're, whether larger people in the beginning, and I think you really should make sure you, you get someone

Speaker 4:          01:41:34       Mala Day is fine a couple miles a day. Yeah, sure. But make sure you don't run on concrete, man. Hell Nah. Treadmill. Yeah. Try not to swim or do, I haven't since I've been in La, but in Florida I swim every single day, every day for now. We use one of those life runner treadmills. Those ones you self-propel [inaudible] we have one all yeah, they have them at the institute too.

Speaker 3:          01:41:54       Yeah. What is it called? Not Rife runner. I made the wrong word. They have them at the institute? Yeah. Yeah. Air Assault. It's like an air assault. The air assault bike. The same company. They make that treadmill. It's the shit, it's literally 13 something like 13% harder than regular running. So it makes you better at regular running. That was called salt air on her assault air runner. Yup. Okay. Yeah. I want to get back into run into, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll show it to you when we get done here. It's really good because you can, you, it's self propelled. You're, you're pushing it rather than keep cause with a treadmill, all you're doing is like lifting your leg up and putting it down. You're not really propelling yourself forward. You know what I'm saying? Like the belts moving. But this, you have to make the belt move and so when you're making the belt move, you're actually pushing with your legs and strengthens your legs up. I prefer it.

Speaker 4:          01:42:46       I'd be, I'd be afraid to do anything at my age where I'd be seeing these basketball players just tear tyranny, Achilles by just stepping. I'm thinking like, yeah man, that's tough. Yeah. I wouldn't want to get kicked in my left knee right now, but I have like I, I study things that I film right? And I'll just be like, specially like Henry Hoof, I'll look at all this leg kicks when they teach and leg kicks. I'm like, if I ever get in a street fight, I just need somebody to properly teach me how to kick in that leg. I'm disabling whoever in my face. That's the first thing I want to do is kick you in your leg. I'll punch in your face. I'm athletic enough to beat your ass. But I'm just saying like the kid, it's the wrestling that's gonna get you, cause most fights end up on the ground. So you got to know what, what to do when you tussling with them. When you go to Ted's planets tonight, just ask them to show you some shit. Yeah, I'm gonna get any Bravo

Speaker 3:          01:43:36       orange choke. What a choke with long arms. A great for chokes, pat, great for chokes and Darcy's and Armin chokes.

Speaker 4:          01:43:44       Cause let's look at John. John my height. Sure. Like I've been around China. I just think like you see John Jones on TV and then you see them in person. You're he alone.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       Mother fucker. As long as he will fuck you up the best at using it. No one's better at using distance ever than John. He did. Did you ever see the video? He uh, do you know Dr Bow hightower is yes. Like when he let John Kick him? He did? Yeah, he just left. He, I guess he like why he just let them kick them in and John kicked him in his leg and he just buckled. I was just like, oh my wouldn't let him kick him. I think he had uh, reached the number of subscribers on youtube. So for the to be crippled. Yeah, true. Crazy. John is a beast. I met John a few times. I haven't done that anatomy at John Jones yet. Um, oh yeah. Watch this. It's crazy. He's putting his weight on to John is crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:44:36       Oh boy. He deal to another doctor too. Oh my God. It's crippling doctors and he bit didn't even hit him.

Speaker 1:          01:44:43       Nah, but you know how weak that leg can be if you don't train that and strengthen, how do you even strengthen that part of your leg?

Speaker 3:          01:44:51       Get used to getting kicked there. You're, you develop all these weird veins too. It's real strange. Here's he, Kevin Randleman his leg after he fought Pedro,

Speaker 1:          01:44:59       him around him. Him with the hair he had. Didn't he have his hair blonde or something?

Speaker 3:          01:45:03       Sometimes some fights. He had crazy blonde hair, but he had big legs. I was jacked Super Jack, but he fought Pedro [inaudible] and Pedro his own fucked his legs up so badly. These giant like veins, like weird, like broken veins all over his leg. Randy couture had them too. Also from patriotism. I like Randy all the years I've seen people kick legs. Randy Prob, I mean Pedro, his are probably kicked harder than anybody I've ever seen. I remember I watched him at Beverly Hills Jujitsu in the 1990s he was kicking a heavy bag and I was just like, what in the fuck? His leg kicks were preposterous just cause it would just bend that fucking bag in half and you just think about what it would do to your leg. Pedro fucked a lot of people up. Pedro Hippo was a fucking beast back in the day.

Speaker 1:          01:45:49       I've seen a lot of people get fucked up in the gym. I just don't release it. Yeah, I got a lot of footage that I can't ever embarrass people. Right. And that's the thing, like I appreciate all the fighters that have let me document, they lost because they trusted me with the intimate parts of their lives. Like I'm getting invited around these guys, kids, they wives like you just don't do that. So that's the respect level they've given me to where they trust me that I'm doing well with the story. So I appreciate all to take care of them. Yeah, you have to hone it. Listen, when I first used to come into the gym with hoof them at the Black Zillions, I remember who it was like, who the fuck is you? Who are you? Right? Like what are you doing here? Right? Like you have to gain that.

Speaker 1:          01:46:31       Like I get so many fans, like fans be like, Hey, do you think I could be with you at a fight week? And I'm thinking like, Nah man, you have to build your way to distrust this is these managers have to trust you. Like the gyms have to trust you. These coaches have to trust you. You know, some people you real picky about what you film and you know, maybe it's a one week after the fight, they know a lot of people watching the channel now we can't release. That's the how they was with so Hutto when, so Hudl followed a Marlin, I had released a snippet of the episode I was going to release and it was like they was on the opposite sides of the cage at the gym and it was like fight. And then he came out exactly the way he was going to come out with Marlin, but I wasn't paying attention.

Speaker 1:          01:47:14       It was slow motion. He was just coming out. So, so Hutto freaking out fight week. He like, Bro, did you post this shit? I'm like, no. He was like, man, you got to take that down because that's exactly what I'm doing with Marlin. And I was like, aw man. Was he doing that was so unusual. You know, like as soon as the fight started, he was Finna come out in a certain stance. He was gonna come out in a certain stance, like a look, you know, his little karate style. And then he was gonna actually do, I don't know what it was, but he was freaking out and I was just like

Speaker 3:          01:47:39       that. The thing about Marlin is Marlin is a giant one 35 yeah, I mean Marlin is so big. I don't know how much weight he cuts, but I know the California won't let them fight one 35 again because California has that room where you can't hydrate more than, I think it's 10% or so. You can't blow back up. You can't blow it back up. So he did blow back up in a fight in California, said no more, one 35 few cars. So it's very obvious that he's cutting a tremendous amount of weight. He's huge. He's huge. So it like a comic book character. Yeah, he is. So I think that he cut way too much weight and I think that that contributes to his demise in the second round because he couldn't take Henry out. Henry was a lot done with the needs, the knees.

Speaker 3:          01:48:20       I was like, it's 10 days in a row. What was ridiculous? And he didn't. He let him clinch with him like that in a way that you, you don't do unless you're tired. And it just, I think he compromises himself. I think there's two things going on. One, I think Henry has a force of will that very few, few human beings can ever possibly understand. I mean, Henry has a self belief and, and just a stainless steel will, that motherfucker just puts it on you. And I think Marlin outclass him in that first round, but I don't think it's sustainable. I don't think you can keep that pace with that dehydration level and with what he's doing to his body to make 135 pounds. I think he cripples. So where does the division go now? Since Henry goes out, here's the problem. If he goes to one 45 right?

Speaker 3:          01:49:03       If marlin goes to one 45 then he doesn't maintain the same advantages that he has in cutting all that weight. Then he's the size of these guys, Leo. Okay, so he goes to one 40 foot. Just think about guys like Calvin cater that can flatten Ryan, you know, crack flatline you and he's tall and long and that shit is not going to work on him the way it works on those 135 pound guys. It's a different, it's a different world. You got Josie Aldo, you know you got Max Holloway who's walking around at one 80 and get down to one 45 and that's his teammate though. What's as a beat. As a beat. Yeah. I'm like my God man. It's a beat as a mother fucker's a shot. That's a Shalane monk. Woo. He's amazing. They go make a movie Jack Stan Guy.

Speaker 1:          01:49:42       They're gonna make a movie of him. Yeah, he got a crazy store. Yeah. Like monk type

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       stuff. Send them off as a kid type thing. Yeah, they listen. Xa beat up. I've never seen it likes a beat. He's filming him and training him. His English getting better too. It is good. That's a good thing for him. Like I think he is. He's the next, well man, there's so many stars. Bruin and Dagestan. It's, there's so many of them over there. And sure, well, if they have that mentality and they're that tough, I mean there's just that that breeds more people like that. You know, killers breed killers. You look at like Jim's like Aka, right? You know, you've got Cain Velasquez, Daniel Cormier, age, you know, go down the line. You know Luke Rockhold, John Fitch and Josh Koscheck. How many fucking killers have come out of that gym? You got to see a, they could be even and play basketball, uh, in Dagestan when I was over there.

Speaker 4:          01:50:39       It's like one of my most popular videos where they train, they play basketball, full game hours of basketball and then train for two hours and they no dribbling but doesn't compete. You have fucked up knees. What do you mean by no dribbling? It's called Dagestan basketball. Just hold onto it like rugby, basketball. Come on, look at this. Look at, what the fuck am I looking at? It's the craziest thing is hold onto it. No, they trying to wrestle. They throwing you down. Like people are getting choked out. Like it's the craziest thing ever. This is the most ridiculous. I could be so sorry. In basketball. JV. Jamie loves. This is the look, look, JV. This is crazy. White Russia basketball audit. Look, look, it could be what happens.

Speaker 4:          01:51:23       It gets intense too. Oh my God. I play with them once. Why don't they dribble? I have no clue. Let's look at his dad. Look at his dad. Look at his dad. He and he intents to yelling at him. They probably play with a medicine ball now they playing with a red. You said a medicine ball heavy as hell. That is so ridiculous. Watching people run around and play basketball. Look at him dribbling. Look, that is hilarious. Look, it could be look, be scored. Look, look. He looked at me. He pointed it to me. He pointed to me like you had have you traveled? This is not reasonable. And they play for hours. That's, and then they're like, oh, it's coming to train. It's time to train now. So that's their warm up. Yup. That's the gym. Could be trains in Riley. That's it. That right there.

Speaker 4:          01:52:07       That's crazy. The fact, look at these guy. Look, the fact that they, they play a different from version of basketball. Did you just get killed? What happened there? It man, this look trip at the end of this could be even going like choke somebody out like it's really, yeah, it's crazy man. They they not and they run on the mats with their shoes on. These motherfuckers are going to get staff look, look, look, look where it could be. What is happening here. This is so ridiculous. Running back playing rugby. It's like rugby, basketball. That's what I called it. But they call it a different thing in Dagestan and I found that they call it, it's something, it's like Australian rules football. Right. And like Dagestan goes bad literally. And I'll play, I'll play with them. And my knee was swelled for two days in Dagestan because they tackled you. Oh, they was killing me. [inaudible] look after, after I was trying to dribble or scoring and everything, but when I kept getting my knee started hurting, it could be, it was like brother, you too big to be sorry.

Speaker 4:          01:53:09       I was like, Hey, I can't move in. Is Wrong with you? Like you twisted your knee. Yeah. They all, they was all arguing about picking me up. Cause I remember that when I dumped on Khabib, I sent you that, that, that, that image of me Duncan on can be like, he's trying to guard me. Yes. They really wanted to pick me up. Then it was like, oh, we getting him. So I'm thinking he is going to be easy. I'm gonna just hold the ball up and jump board. They was taking my knees out. They was taking it easy on each other until they saw the black dude.

Speaker 4:          01:53:34       When they saw the black dude play, they was like, oh, we really knocked out the guy who actually had the potential to play professionally. Yeah. And they, and they go on cray. Look, look at this. This is hilarious. This serious. They take you serious to skip ball. That's fun. Look at the balls. Look at it. Every time it hits the ground, it's got no bounce. Well he, he dimed him though. Well it looks like the floors are regular boss stadiums. Look how happy days, looking at the debt like that. It is running with the fucking ball like this. It's little and this is slow motion. So you see, look, push you out of bounds. They do all that. They did that to me a couple times, but they run on that fucking beat. Let's look at this. Look at this. Watch this. Look at this.

Speaker 4:          01:54:13       Here it is right here. Watch this. Look, look, look. Could be bang. Stopping. So he's wrestling with this dude. Why is he doing that? Because there's the hold them down like and now the wrestling wrestling look could be may stopping and they're doing it on the mat. Look, look, look, babies are mad man. Oh my God, he's taking his back. He's choking him out. He never easy in tab. That is crazy. So they wrestle all their playing points. Yes they will tackle you down to there's no rules. No rules. That is hilarious. Look, the guy tapped already and now he's got him. Was I already tapped? Ah Man, he's bringing back memories. But wait a minute. So you look man, people trying to get cookie Boffo why is his teammates cause cause you free up another opponent so you can play. But that it could be, look at the beach.

Speaker 4:          01:55:05       He thought his jockey Jay right there. He got even thought the right there. Oh Man. That is crazy. Seeing the MMA fighters playing basketball, that's the worst thing. This is not basketball and this is something different. I mean, when you're not ever dribbling. Did you see the video of Francis [inaudible]? He paid an Amish design Williamson and then he was out there shooting basketballs. ESPN just did it, bro. For instance, the worst athlete. He's not athlete, Bro. I'm sorry if you can't, if you six foot five and can't dunk a basketball being well, don't you remember when Mike Tyson was in his prime? I remember you saying that basketball with the, with the overall, what's his, he's got dedication to one thing. One thing. Yeah, that's the thing. I mean, oh my God. Well, I'll tell you the little, little, little look.

Speaker 4:          01:55:53       He's laughing though. That's probably the first time he ever tried to do that and he will punch you a pinkie and your soul will come out your body. It's so fucking hard. When he hit Alister, there's another kickboxer made it big in MMA right now, stir over him. But when he, but Alister was already a real Allister's, very, very well rounded. He's not just a kickboxer, but k one grand Prix champion. You've got to call him a kickboxer. But when he hit Alister with that left hook, I was like, Jesus Christ. He said he saw it the other day. They did a free fight. They did a free fight on a a UFC channel and I just watched it over and over and over and I was like, Danny was the follow through punch. Yeah. Oh Jeez. That's the scariest, the scariest moment I ever, I wouldn't say scariest, but the most intimidating moment I ever have.

Speaker 4:          01:56:39       I was filming Francis eating a banana and he didn't like it. He didn't like you following him. I was in the elevator with him and ooze mine. We was in Pittsburgh when we did USC. Pittsburgh when Rocco fought David Branch back, Dan and Francis came to support come morrow. So they going to do Jujitsu in a little workout room and Francis was like talking to ooze. My opening and a banana and [inaudible] and I'm like, he put the bit in his mouth. He stopped eating it and I'm filming. He looked a he like slapped the camera away. That was my boy though. Friends, my boy. But that was before I really, no, no, I'm eating. You've maybe just tying in with bananas in a mouth. They might not like the banana in the tailpipe.

Speaker 4:          01:57:21       That was funny. For instance, intimidating man. Oh, he's terrifying. When he clipped Cain Velasquez, here it is. There's that uppercut uppercut left hook, like a shovel hook. Look at this. Boom. Before right before that, his swagger, how he was, he had the confidence bouncing his shoulders like he was ready to, he believed he was the greatest in the world and then his sleep, a fight changed his fucking trajectory, man. It really did change his life. Huh? That's a really interesting fight because Steve pay was a real champion. You know, it's crazy. I was in the room next to Francis in Boston and he didn't go. He never went to sleep and I had my door open like so my room was right next to Francis and I had my door open cause I was like, if fighters come by I'm gonna just catch them with a camera with your door open.

Speaker 4:          01:58:06       I kept in the middle of night editing because that's, you know, doing fight week, you know how embedded releases they series. I'm filming all of these fighters and then I'm going back up to my room and I'm editing but I'm already editing in my head. That's how I'm able to get stuff out. You clean what program you had anyway, premiere now premier just doing it. Just slapping it up as quick as you can. But see my method when I film is I'm already knowing what I'm gonna use. Okay, so you making your cuts. I know the opening shot, I know everything. Are you writing all this stuff down? I'll keep it in my head. Just keep it and people will be like, how can you edit and release it that fast? It's like it's already done before I go to my room. I just have to go up there and put it together.

Speaker 4:          01:58:39       Music, everything. I'm able to just, I don't know how I'm able to do it. It's just something natural. I've been doing four hours. See you have a deep passion. Yeah I have a deep and I've developed the skill set to is easy. You know they always say oh well you put in 10,000 hours and something, you become an expert. I feel like I put in my 10,000 hours doing all types of different types of shoots to to survive. And now this is my arena. This is my big stage. Right. But I remember that week France has never went to sleep. I be like Bro, go to sleep. What are you doing with your door open trying to catch you. And then he would come in, sit on a bed and look at what I was editing. Cause obviously I was filming him as well. And it was just funny, like just doze type of memories.

Speaker 4:          01:59:21       That's like what time was it that he wouldn't, he never went to sleep all night. Well, you know you get there Monday, Tuesdays, right? Saturday. So it may be Wednesday and you still up at three in the morning cause you fighting late. He know because think about it, think about it. The last fight is what time? 10 o'clock. Yeah. Nine o'clock. Well La time. Boston Times midnight. Yeah. Midnight. Yeah. So he up, cause he can't go to sleep early because he got a fight and that's one thing I discovered about the fight game. Like Dan, that does make sense. You know you fighting at 11:00 PM yeah. You want to keep yourself, you gotta say so he just walking around the hallways, big ass Francis in Boston. It's crazy. It's like looking back on that stuff and it's like, man, I've captured a lot of stuff already. What's crazy is with him, you watch him and then his next fight against Derek Lewis and neither one of them through anything.

Speaker 4:          02:00:09       Derek had a fucked up back. He really pillar like the Polly Polly and Artem fight. They, nobody wants to do anything. I thought it was terrible. Oh my God, I watched it. The fact that Artem beat him in a boxing match. It shouldn't have been even no contest. But Paulie's never had power. He's never been him hands is brittle, you know what I mean? Hands is brittle, but he's also, it's never been a guy that could just stop, keep you all kind of really beat the hell out of him. I firmly believe it now. You think so? Yeah. I don't, I don't like after watching that. Well also after watching Paulie's examination of that fight afterwards you're like, well you thought you lost lost. You made me thought you wanted a decision. You thought you got to shit decision. Like you didn't do anything. Nah. Connors, what'd you think?

Speaker 4:          02:00:48       Kind of gone do whatever he wants. Probably do a lot of coke. You know what's crazy? Before? I was kidding. Before I ever, he's going to have some fun man. I think if you find a fight that's fun. He's got $100 million in the bank. If he finds a fight, that's fun, he's going to do it. But the problem with him is eight mean they wanted him to do cowboy and there was some talk about him doing a cowboy fight but he wanted it to be a main event and the UFC wants main events to all be big time championship fight, anything kind of do as big time. That's what I said. But they think that somehow or another having no championship title online, I would love to spend a day in the life with Dana White. Well Justin Gait, I don't think you'd let you do that. You don't think so? Conflict of interest. Yeah cause he's got, they've got their own thing that the UFC and best sucks cause I really wanna do the anatomy or Dana white just hanging out with them for a day. Who knows? But around with the help embedded and maybe would help the

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       Tuesday night contender series. It would help pump that up. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       Air Guy Barris has said the perfect thing. He said, why would the UFC be worried about you? You like eliminate stand and they Coca-Cola. Well I think

Speaker 3:          02:01:50       that way but some people don't. Some people don't want to help other things get going, but I'm promoting them [inaudible] if you stop promoting them and just really concentrate on a belter and the channels gigantic now because you did so much UFC contest. True. That's how people look at things.

Speaker 1:          02:02:03       Well, you know, my first idea was to tell the UFC, let me just film all the fighters. Y'All not going to promote this fight week. So embedded is 10 other fighters. Let it anatomy on fire to get them. Give me a credential and let me just filming them all week. So I'm around film. These fighters that y'all never gonna post. What did they say about that? Not Interested. Never. Nah, I didn't get a, not interested, but I don't know. It's, it's weird because I, I much love to the UFC because they gave me a lot of access and I love every single person over there. Like Dean Klein and Heidi Dean, all those people, I love them. They treat me like a knowing cousin. They're great people. I'm an annoying cousin when I'm at five and that's the thing. I haven't been to a lot of fight weeks, but it seems like people think I go to every fight weekend. It's like I only go to ones that I can afford or they make sense. Like if I had the funds, I'd be at every fight. Week filming.

Speaker 3:          02:02:55       Are you going to be in Vegas for the Jon Jones Taco sauce?

Speaker 1:          02:02:58       Yeah, because I'm nominated for award against you. Oh really? For what? The World MMA awards. Best MMA programming. I what? What am world MMA awards that Cari MMA show. Yep. Now you're on it. So I know that's so weird that it's so, well I told you confessionalism and online data was done with the way I thought I was going to end up on here. Well I hope you win cause I want a bunch of those. [inaudible] it's me. You embed it. Dana Weiss con Tuesday. Can Siri continue to series and then a MMA hour? I hope you win against me. How about that? Had be a, had to be. I smoke weed. If I did I'd be like, I'm done. I'm done. I understand you. Your

Speaker 3:          02:03:41       reluctance to smoke weed. I smoked weed maybe five, six times until I was 30 years old, like a handful of times ever. Like a couple times in high school, you know, a couple times afterwards at parties. I get it. I mean I get it. The whole personality thing. I when I, when I was 30 years old, that's when I started smoking, like really started smoking weed and I don't think, I don't think anybody should do anything. If they have an obsessive personality and they're worried about getting locked into it, I mean I don't think you should drink, I don't think, but if you can handle it, a little bit of weed I think opens up these doorways of creativity and I think that it's very valuable. Boy told me, cowboy telling me about mushroom, mushrooms, mushrooms as well, I think. I think a psychedelic drugs with their marijuana or mushrooms there.

Speaker 3:          02:04:31       They're tools and the way I've always described it as like you could take a tool and you could build a house with it, right? You could take a hammer and you could build a beautiful deck or you could just hit yourself in the Dick if you're fucking crazy. Sure you could. You could abuse a tool, but it doesn't mean the tools bad. It means the application's bad and you don't give a hammer to a two year old, right? You don't give a little kid, we'd tell them to smoke it every day. But I think for a grown adult it's good to participate in something that gives you an altered state of consciousness because it allows you to look at yourself in a fresh way. And for someone who's always like trying to be self assessing and objective and always trying to analyze who you are and your thinking and your behavior, I think something like marijuana is very important because it allows you to see yourself in this way that maybe you don't ordinarily do, allows you to drop your blinders and get a glimpse of how other people see you, which is very hard to do.

Speaker 3:          02:05:24       It's very hard for especially people that you know, you put up your barriers, your defenses, you have an ego. It's hard for you to look at yourself to find the things that you're doing wrong. So if you can't find the things that you're doing wrong, it's very difficult to grow. So a lot of people call that paranoia, that effect, that marijuana produces in a small pot. I don't like smoking pot, man. It makes me paranoid. That paranoia I think is awareness. And I think you, you close those doors of awareness in order to get through your life. But the, the subconscious is always aware of these things. The subconscious is always aware of these things that are fucking with you. Uh, marijuana just finds all the problems and just turns the lights on.

Speaker 5:          02:06:01       So if I moved to Denver, I'll probably end up smoking weed. Everybody smoked at all. If you do it just to, what about an edible little edibles kit? Careful can't hurt like a cookie and fuck you up. I heard a cookie will destroy you. I got some quick shot. Rashad Evans, that's like my big brother. He always told me about the toad. Oh, five minutes. Oxy dimethyltryptamine yeah. Yeah. That's that. That'll fuck you up to. Oh, he's done that. And I said, yeah, you can go into another dimension or you literally can, I might, I might be the president of the United States and other dimension. Who knows? There's no United States and that other dimension. There's no states, there's no people. There's souls go into like a well of souls. That's crazy. Disembodied entities and told, I remember when I kept it, what the Hell is you talking about?

Speaker 5:          02:06:48       The toad that told nobody gets it from a toad though. They're really five minutes. Oxy done metal trip to me and again from usually from laboratories synthesize with a bunch of precursors. But the, um, the, the, the other one, n n dimethyltryptamine is the one we see the visuals. It's all really, yeah. How long had lessons? 15 minutes. Unless you eat it. If you eat it, what if you did it in the float tank? You could do that and you'd have to do it quick. Like you'd have to, have you seen the full tank here? Yeah. Remember? Oh, that's right there. Yeah. Um, have you done it yet? Nope. You got to you gotta I seen how extension they was online. How expensive. I've seen some, yeah, like the by one by one. But you could always this a, the float lab, they have a,

Speaker 3:          02:07:29       it's in Westwood. They have a place in Venice and then there's a giant place that opened up in Pasadena that uses all the float labs.

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       Was the name of that place again? Yes. Just float. Just that place has that. That is the biggest float, uh, establishment on earth. You do it for how long? Well, last night I did two hours. Damn. I like two hours. Yeah. I like to just get in there and find, find out what the fuck I was when I was with Cheeto Vera Verda that day when his teammates did it for like an hour and he was just like, I didn't, I ain't know where I was. I sleep in a dream or even just crazy. You're disembodied, you know, Charlemagne trauma and the gun, he a was on last week and we were talking about it because he's doing this whole mental wellness retreat sorta center. He's like establishing these mental wellness centers. He is. Yes he is. Cause you know Charlemagne is his new book or shook one is all about his mental health.

Speaker 5:          02:08:25       His anxiety is issues with anxiety and um, you know, anything that allows you to relax and just to center yourself can help you with anxiety and, and you know, that's one of the things that he said about the, the tank was that he's never felt stillness like that. That's crazy. Yeah. Cause you're not, you're not feeling your body. You know, your body is just, you can do it. You try it out. He had a crazy life. Yeah. He's had a crazy life. Yeah. He had a crazy life. And then also like I said to him about he's the last Samurai in terms of radio. Radio is a dying industry. He's the last guy I think to get famous off of radio. Yeah, that's it. Charlemagne, the God is like, I saw a little bit of it and I remember he said that he was literally, he got fired at 31 he was 31 no job with a two year old.

Speaker 5:          02:09:13       And that's what people like when stuff is inspiring because people beat, I wasn't unemployed, I was like 29 when I was lost and then I was turning 30 and that's when I got my shit together. So to hear Charlemagne and God say I was 31 I had a kid and I was no job. Like I think so many people in life are so obsessed with getting somewhere fast and the understand that takes time. And just to see somebody like that be open enough to say like I was at a low moment in my life, like at my age now. I used to think when I was 25 37 with young or old, old as fuck, you're young as hell. You're not old at 37 no more. Yeah, you never been there. It's just, we always talk if you're a healthy 37 when we were kids, our parents were attendant at 37 they're working 12 hours a day.

Speaker 5:          02:10:00       We felt they felt 50 probably felt a little, it felt 50 that's, I mean thank God to the Internet. I mean, cause if it wasn't for the Internet, I wouldn't be able to put up these amazing videos. I would have to go work for one of these companies. It's also the Internet allows you to get all this information and allows you to stay healthy. You get up, you get a better understanding about diet, nutrition, mental health, relaxation, how important meditation is. You know, and I think one of the other things that Charlemagne did that's very important as he talked openly about anxiety and he's a famous cool guy. He's like a famous guy known for his opinions, known for being Brash,

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       for him to say, Hey, I've struggled. I've had real mental struggles and mental health struggles. That's, that's a very fragile conversation in a black community. Um, mental, mental health issues and in anxiety and things like that. People don't want to admit it, right. Cause when we all but know even tough it out. Yeah. You want to feel brave and not for me, man. I, I felt hopeless and defeat many times in my life. Sure. Me Too. And Luckily for me, sometimes I say, damn, I don't have kids. Luckily, you know, I've been able to, to, to figure it out on my own without having a responsibility to take care of somebody. Right. So I've been lucky in that sense where I haven't, you know, had a child, a son or daughter. And I was like, and that's, it gives, that gives me youth, it feels like every day I wake up, I'm like, I can do what I want to do because only person I'm responsible for is me.

Speaker 4:          02:11:27       Yeah. And that gives me the freedom to be a gypsy. I couldn't be a gypsy if I had it. No, nothing like that. You have na the life button. But you know what, if you had a kid, you would just alter that life and you would have, you would take great comfort in the fact that you love someone deeply like a child. It's a, it's a crazy thing. The love you have for children. Yes. It's changes people lives. It changes. Like I see how you are, whose mind went up and he had his daughter when he's carrying his daughter. And that was crazy, man. So hard for me not to cry so hard for me not to cry when people win and they, they, they start thanking their mom or you know, the parents hug them or it's like when he was holding his daughter up, I'm like, oh Jesus, here comes back. That was crazy. Listen man.

Speaker 4:          02:12:10       W you know, remember when he got in trouble for like the 30% or people you're going in on him cause he was like, I'm 30%. I was 30%. Yeah. Like I, the thing that I can say about being around these fighters, I see all the injuries and everything and then people don't understand what they do in the fight. Well how about the fact that it was my to that fight with a broken foot? I know I seen him crazy. I seen that he had a broken foot when he fought Tyron motherfucking Woodley and he never stopped coming. Never stopped moving forward. You would never been able to guess by any stretch of the imagination that he was injured. Yeah, I did. I did. Cause I filmed it all. You knew it. I knew it. I just can't release it. You see what I'm saying? I'm not going to, now after the fight, I can say, yeah, he was injured, but I have that on so many fighters.

Speaker 4:          02:12:52       So who though? Everybody like, wow, who those ankles. I know. How crazy is that? That was Kudos angle. The week of the fight was giant, black and blue completely fucked up where he couldn't walk and then he goes in there and fucks up. Marla morale could be Conor fight. Didn't they say he had like a Conor and something wrong with his foot too or it could be had a problem with his weight cut? I heard. Did he? I think so. It was a bad way. So big. He other, he's a mountain man. What is his diet like?

Speaker 4:          02:13:26       It's clean from what I see, but he's had problems making weight in the past, but that was two oh nine think about that. How long ago that was? Yeah, UFC two oh nine yeah. That was the last time he ever had a problem, but it's, you know you had problems before that though. I didn't know. Yeah, I didn't even know. It could be at two oh nine. Oh um, yeah I that was when, uh, the first UFC event I ever went to. Does he have a nutritionist like in, in Dagestan? Does he have, I don't know cooks for him. I don't know. But you eat with them? Yeah, but that was Robin. Now he's eating all meat, meat and potatoes and I sat with everybody and he does he train during Ramadan? Yes he did. That was the whole Dagestan chronicles. People couldn't believe it.

Speaker 4:          02:14:06       He trained, trained too. So he trained trains during the day without eating, without drinking water. Crazy man. Why I'm talking about really hard to like that. That's the initial, oh I want to turn. Yeah. I want to turn that whole series into a movie. Understand kind of being able to work out like fast workouts. Nah, fucking no water. Like training Jesus Christ, implant that basketball lightly with no water. No nothing. That is so crazy. That's what I'm, that's what I'm saying like that mentally, that's what I'm saying. That mental toughness like and then when I seen the face off with him and Dustin, cause Dustin, I would love to, to document Dustin cause he's a good guy. Um, I thought Dustin was huge when you just see him with everybody else. And then when he did the face I would, could be, if I'm like damn, could be taller than him.

Speaker 4:          02:14:55       Everything I'm thinking like, man, he's gonna have to keep that guy off him. It could be, it was just such a good wrestler. His said he's going to grab him, put him on the ground mount. I'm like that double dummy and smash them. Now I'm out of fire so I can't say it, but I kinda feel like that's how I always call ooze amount of black could be because as soon as he grabbed you to fight over, that's how I feel. As soon as he grabbed you, it's over cause you're not going to get away from him anymore. I'm like, I'm latched to you. So, but that Damien Maia fight, that referee saved his, I know I was in a blocker room like cussing and never known. You know, he would just, we don't know what happened cause the world can change if that referee, whoever the fuck he is, I don't even want to know his name.

Speaker 4:          02:15:36       Last Maya fight. He see how he took the back. That's what he does. Yeah, against the linemen. Good. That's what he does to everybody, man. And that referee, that referee separated them. And I was sick and Matt, Sarah went fucking crazy about it and I was, I was with a tough one. But still it's, you don't do that. I said what you would, what would have happened? He said, I would have just held it there the whole time. But you just never know. Well if that's how he lost his first fight, he lost the first five again. Choked out. I know, you know, you know this is something that people don't know. So Uzma got one fight that he's lost. Colby Covenant has one fight that he's lost. That's what this, I'm all about stories like the storyline. So the only fight that Colby Covington lost to was what?

Speaker 4:          02:16:18       Leon Edwards? Yes. He choked him out. Right. Short notice fight. They took in the UFC and he was injured at something fucked up with ribs. So he lost by via choke. Who's my beat? Leanne? The God that [inaudible] lost too early on Colby covers him beat. So BofA day losses are two people that that's just a weird storyline. Yeah, but that's MMA. Math. Yeah, I know, but no and I, I'm not comparing them, I'm just saying that the fact that they both got one loss and eight supposedly hate each other and is two people they've beat it is crazy. Ho fighters careers just changed. They become a different person and whoever they are like four years ago, you really can't compare them to whoever they are now. The Colby Covington thing is interesting because he really did beat the shit out of Damien. Maya, you know, and you know, he really did hot failed Los Angeles.

Speaker 4:          02:17:04       I don't know if Damien Mayan was three rounds. I feel like it was a main event. You might be right though. Three rounds. Three rounds. Cause he was in Brazil. This was five rounds. Yeah. Yeah. But Don Dosantos one, two rounds. Right. Three to two. Did he think on score cards? He took them down and everything. Yeah, he did. Yeah. Now with tomorrow Kamara, it was brutal. They level change that Kemal do with that level, like threatened to take down. He will piece you up. Cause Henry who's got his striking crazy and is getting better. Yup. Oh for sure. Well he did fantastic against Woodley Woodley in real trouble. From striking. Yeah. Well it looks good in this comeback trails though too. All the oily managed that he's doing. He really got married, dedicated Willie didn't want me to film him the week of the fight by this game and shit.

Speaker 4:          02:17:50       Uh, Dean Thomas came over to me and said, hey man, I willy don't want you to film him. It's another distraction. If I get it, I get, I was mad. I was, I was kind of, I wouldn't say mad. I was butt hurt cause I like willing, I'm like, come on man, I've been filming you all week. And then all of a sudden day before the fight, hey, his head, he doesn't want anything there, you know, just wants to see, I mean he had so many distractions. He released the fucking album with Wiz Khalifa. You know, he was touring, he was doing a rap videos, slept masses. He's, yeah, and he's doing this fucking TMZ, Hollywood shit that he does. He does a lot of shit. But I like that he does a lot of shit because he's recognizing that he's going to have a time outside of fighting.

Speaker 4:          02:18:31       You gotta have you gotta have a post line? He's got a real opportunity to make something happen forever. I mean, he's a smart guy. Inspirational guy. Yeah, I lot, listen, I have none, but listen, I love after the fight with, you know willy mom, that was amazing. I love, I like Willie, his team, his mom, his, his, his mom was talking to me and it was more both tearing up cause like we were talking about and we played it when, I mean his mom just goes over and we're braces Comoro and Kamara was crying and who his mom was like, she, she coming for you, baby coming for you. You better be prepared for Mama Willie. Look got tears in your eyes right now. Yeah. That, listen, that's the sport man. This sport is this, this, this emotions and soul in this sport. It's like, it's not just the winning and losing. It's like your life is on the line. So imagine what I feel when I'm documented. You're right next to them because you know, like say it like a journalist, right? That got to work for a show. They reporting, they interview

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       and guys, I'm in the gym with these guys every day. Like I'm, I'm literally in it sweating in a gym with these guys. Go on with them to eat, going to stay tonight, sleeping on a couch. Like I'm doing all of that stuff to be next to these guys to tell them,

Speaker 3:          02:19:44       why are you doing that? Well, because it's yours. Yeah, this is all your, your doing this, you know, working for some fucking company and we got some asshole producer who's telling you what to do. It wouldn't be the same. You wouldn't, you wouldn't [inaudible] I wouldn't do it. Not only would you not do it, you wouldn't be as motivated. You wouldn't, but more importantly, it wouldn't be the singular vision that you get when you know that it's coming from one person. When you know something's coming from one person, you get this, like you get a feeling like this is, this is will Harris. He's there, he's filming this, he's admitting it. He's putting it together. He's putting it out. Here's the video. That's a beautiful thing about the internet man really is. It's amazing. It really is. It doesn't exist in any other media. There's nothing like that. There's nothing like that ever in the history of the world. If you wanted to put out something like you've done, you need a gang of people behind. You needed a network, you needed a deduction, companies, someone to choose you, you need to someone. There's probably four of the guys that wanted to do what you're doing with five of the guys, 10 a dozen. Everybody wants it and they have to pick you and then these other guys would be trying to like fuck you up from behind. And it happens. It happens.

Speaker 1:          02:20:47       And I, and that's what I listen. I try to portray that message to every single person that messaged me. This is not easy. Like it's a lot of sacrificing this, you have to be willing to put in years to do this. I'm going on two years in August 14th will be full, two years of committed to an anatomy of a vita and I'm, it's, it's a baby stage to me like I could because of what I know it can become. You know, millions of subscribers are firmly, firmly so to me, I'm like, you know what? I'm not going to stop no matter what. I'm not going to stop. I want this to be the biggest thing ever. I want a guy that's not even in on the radar right now. I want to discover on him and then he become a heavyweight champion or world or UFC champion or Bella torque champion.

Speaker 1:          02:21:30       And that's the thing that I get out of it all is the fact that I can just create what I want. Yes. With whoever you know. You know I I thought about it though there I was like, man, I need to put more women on a channel of women fighters and promote more women because I feel like they don't get promoted as well. I want to get Amanda Nunez, um, Ashley Yoder. I was supposed to go with her and Dan Henderson and Temecula. I wish I could've got them on. But that's the type of like, cause it's the freedom to do it. Yes. They don't have to pay me. Yeah. I just go do it and make it and put it out there and hopefully somebody latches on and say we want to be a part of this, this movement and anatomy. [inaudible] Valentino Schiff. Chenko and her sister, they are some beasts. She scares the shit out of me. I just want to film her doing that little dance shit. I know. It's crazy, right? That fucking head kick on Jessica. I like woo. I was supposed to go get her. Uh, Eric Nixon, her coach. She was like, Oh, come down to Vegas and get Jessica. That was a tough

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       one. I liked a Jessica was, you know, she took it well though. She took it well, but she was a severely outclass. That was a, a bad level. It's levels, levels, but I don't think there's a level higher than Valentina there. There, there's people on her level, but there's no level higher that that's, that was a, a little a debatable match against Nunez. The second one, right? Yes. The one that people say she should have won very, very close fight, but Nunez is a bigger girl. New Nana's is a legit one 35 or she's not going to make one 25, you know? And when she knocked outside bark, everybody was like, what in the fuck she follow that line. Cyborgs. And she's Cha. Excuse me. She's chomping at the bit to do it again. Listen. She's like, set it up again. I'll do it again. What do you think if Cyborg left the UFC, where do she go?

Speaker 5:          02:23:17       One FC maybe, but who's what? Fighters is over there. They'll get some fighters for, they'll find some. There's some Moitai champions that'll fight her. She was at ask women, I talked to sideboard. She wants that fight bad. The Amanda Nunez Fire. Yes. She wanted a bench or she does. It might happen since it was Ryan rock 'em sock. 'Em Robot. It was rock 'em sock 'em robots, but only one person was rocking. That's what I'm saying from her. Yeah. She was. She was moving towards and Amanda was just doing the perfect thing to deal with that style. I thought it was going to be a harder fight. I thought if Amanda was going to beat her, it's going to be by decision. Oh really? I really did. I was shocked. I didn't think she was gonna flatline or we'd never even, Cyborg always gets up. She felt during a barge in in lion fight, who's, you know, world class, top of the food chain Moitai fighter and she didn't have a single Moitai fight and barge knocked her down twice and Cyborg was chasing her till the last second that's called the bell and she just seemed so durable.

Speaker 5:          02:24:13       I just never thought I would see our face plant Amanda Nunez hits like she's got bricks in her gloves just wow. She just drops those fucking things. Nicest person in the world. You would never think she fought so nice. And you know when when her and sidebar were talking on that Shit, you know, she seemed like cool and calm and like just you wait and just you wait. She just knows man, she hits when she fucked up Ronda Rousey like that. I was like, good Lord. That was a fight where I remember the, the run up to that fight. That was one of the first fights that when WME bought the UFC and they were really promoting the shit out of Ronda rousing. Ronda was like walking around some big mansion looking at the TV and they were going to say, this is the big comeback fight.

Speaker 5:          02:24:59       And I was like, you guys should be paying attention to your first ever openly gay UFC champion who happens to be a fucking murderer. Happens to be a chick that Merck, Misha Tate, happens to be a chick that flatlines people. She's probably one of the hardest punchers in the women's, in any women's combat sport. I mean, fuck man, she hits fucking hard music. You know, you've got to go back to an wolves, one punch Kao and boxing to see a woman wolf beast. But you got to go to that to see a woman who hits that hard. And Amanda loves to fight, man. You see, she loves it. She fucking loves it. She, she feeds off of it. And when they were setting that fight up and they weren't giving Amanda Nunez any credit and they were promoting her at all, I'm like, you guys are crazy.

Speaker 5:          02:25:49       This is a bad fight for Ronda. This is a bad fight because first of all, that chicks, a Brazilian jujitsu black belt Ronald's not gonna submit her and she's probably not going to get a dominant position on her and when they're standing up on the feet, this chick is going to throw bricks and it's not a good place for Rhonda. That was like, it looked bad. Like why did she second stumbling how she was stumbling? She's out. I'm on, you know, there was a lot wrong there. A lot wrong. Their motivation was a lot wrong there to go from the Holly Holm Kao to that to that should've had a warmup fight. Right, for sure. What is the reason why boxing has warm up fights? What is the percentage do you give Holly home and chance against Nunez?

Speaker 5:          02:26:30       Well, Holly Holmes are world class fighter. You know, you got to give her a chance, get anybody, she survived against Germane Duran domain, knocked her down and germaned around me is a legit world champion. More Times that the fight with the late, the late after the twice she got she, she got though hind taken and she would have won. I think she won that fight. I think she won anyway. Anyway, she dropped her twice. She dropped her with a straight left and she dropped her with a question mark kick. Um, I thought you won that fight, but man it was just fucking murderer man. It's hard to, it's hard to pick against the magic of Holly shocked the world twice. She could look, she couldn't, I like her too. She's, she's an amazing person. Hey she, she hates the cameras, does she? She won't let me film her.

Speaker 5:          02:27:11       Why? She won't let nobody film her. Just distractions. She just don't like, she don't like it. And that's one of the girls I would love to do. Like, you know, cause this is like fun for me. So I'm like, Oh, I would love to just get this person on it. Let the world get to know this fighter. Right. Like I get it from their perspective though, cause it is a distraction. It's another thing, another factor to consider in. Some people don't mind it like something. I Bet Henry Udo probably likes it. Yeah. In a way. Some some I've gotten away from going to fight week cause it's Kinda the same thing. I've done it a lot. So I like to just go away before a fight and just document this stuff and then release it during the fight week. What is it like at a bad motherfucker ranch? Donald Cowboys place? I haven't been there yet. I've only been a Jackson. Oh okay. Listen, I got to go there for like a week there. Just be with him and Schilling and that's the place to go cause they're all doing mushrooms and fucking jumping jetski fresh eggs and stuff like that. I would love to do that. Cowboy is a, is cowboy. Don't want them people like if you see his face you think he's mean like sometimes. But he's the coolest dude I ever seen. Nice man. He's so nice. Like

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       that's crazy. Like when him and when him and Mike Perry fall, I had access to my period at fight week and I reached out to cowboys team and said I want to be neutral on this and film both of Y'all that week in cowboy. I said yeah, no problem. So he let me hang with him. I was with Perry after the fight. They met, they talked, I had that little famous moment where they met and you know, cowboy was like, you lit the fire in me and repair. He was like, what? He was like, you talking all that shit lit the fire in me that Instagram videos, like I'm coming for you. All that stuff. So that's probably one of the, if people asked me what my favorite moment is, is probably the Mike Perry week because of just, I had both of them and then I had the raw emotion of Mike Periatt that he lost in a locker room. Like where he, he looked at the, he looked at the sky, I was like, Damn God, you can let me out the first round. He like, Damn. It was embarrassing. But it was a funny guy, man. He is. He is a just start. He can do anything. I feel like, I mean he, he's gonna get better and fighting. He can be in movies.

Speaker 5:          02:29:29       Well he's gotten better since the move to Jackson's. He really has. He's got more embedded. Went back where? To a fusion XL in Florida. He went back to his original team after the cowboy fight. Interesting. Yeah. And wonder why? I don't know. I don't know. Cool. But he's not a Jackson's anymore. He's at a Fusionex thing. I'm not aware of fusion. I don't know if they have good trainers or anything like that. That's what Jack or a train. Oh, okay. Yeah. I liked what they were doing for him know that Jackson's, I like how they were giving him a more measured Lester man calculate. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Frank the tank, they give them a more calculated approach, making them fight more intelligently, more, more of a game plan. Cause he's always going to be wild and he's always going to have that power that Paul failed to fight.

Speaker 5:          02:30:09       Yeah, that was wild. That was why. But if I wanted to see that fight a Felder, first of all, Felder is a different way class, but it felt it didn't throw that spinning back fist and bounce it off his forehead and snap his arm in half. You know, they should run that back. Huh? Um, well I don't think Felder should be fighting one 70, you know, because I don't think Perry has a chance in hell and making one 55 no, that Felder can till versus Perry is a good one. That's a great, but, and they hate each other. I liked that, especially after till coming off, getting knocked out by mom's Vidar, two losses in a row. So that's a great fight for two losses in a row. But the big one, the big one was a Mazda dog cause Monzo dog flatlined them. That was a d I thought that was disrespectful.

Speaker 5:          02:30:50       Um, uh, the way the, the, they had set it up where um, the bookies had set it up where Tyron Woodley was the underdog. I was like, you guys are out or your fall, you're in Dallas. I mean, you're out. You're out of your fucking mind. I don't know what hype you're buying into them. We've never seen this guy on the ground. We've never seen this guy with a guy like Woodley and like Woodley hits hard, tasty, hard. He's so fast and wrestling wise, I mean it's not even close. I thought that was, I'm like, yeah, he beat

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       cowboy. Yeah, he looked great. Yeah, he beat Wonderboy. But you know, I mean it was a fight where he clipped and Wonderboy boy was one really good shot. You know, he, he hit him with one really good shot and a good five rounds, one column, a high train. Uh, but I feel like promotions, they did it with Pico, now he got two straight losses. Well you get excited about a guy because the guy has some something special and sometimes those guys that have something special, they never, like Uriah hall never really became what everybody thought he was going to become. We saw Uriah Hall and the ultimate fighter. We're like, Holy Shit, this is the next Anderson Silva. Like, look at this guys. We'll kick in. People in the head. Yeah, he is built like a Greek God. He moves like a fucking gazelle. He just had this perfect style.

Speaker 3:          02:32:02       Like Holy Shit, look at this guy. But never quite became who we thought. And then the Paula Kosta Phi, you seem to getting beaten down by Kosta. He was fucking him up though. At first with this shit at jabs. Yeah, the Jabs Kosta can take it. I was just like him versus yellow or marrow. Good googly Mooglie. Is that a crazy fight that's here. That's going to be in California and, Huh? Yeah. Woo. With Nate and Pedis. That's the bottle about battle of the best bodies ever goes to. Yes. He inspired me. How you look like that still at 40 something. He's got the freak genetics man. He talked about it on the podcast. He was like, go look Cuba. Everybody looked like that. He was saying that everybody looked like that. It's just amazing. Genetics and then Costa. Well, it's also like when you think about what UL has gone through, that Cuban wrestling program, man, they, they, they, they just call everyone who's not an elite five star.

Speaker 3:          02:32:57       Super a plus athlete. You ain't making it. He was telling me that the people that are the best, they eat more, they get better food and they eat more and they sleep in better places and they set it up. Who you're training with, all these other people that want what you have. So you're around them all the time. If you see that podcast, it's amazing cause deli joy was really has to translate later with DOL. Did he speak some English? Yeah, he speaks a little, but you know he needs help and Joey would help them. You know, I never met him. Yo Man, I haven't met him yet. He's a great guy. He's so super friendly and he's man, he does shit to people inside the AUC. You think he going to get any of that money? Oh, the 27 million from the supplement company. He for people don't know what we're talking about.

Speaker 3:          02:33:39       He won a lawsuit against the supplement company just like we were talking about before with Sean O'Malley. Um, they gave him tainted supplements and he won $27 million. It's a big company. See we, we thought that it was a smaller company. They would just go under. But this is a big fucking company and you know, their company makes $100 million a year and they, they, they owe him 27. Can you settle out of a settle? Like the judgment was 27 million, but could they be like, oh we gave you 10 that's a good question. I don't know how that works. If they do, you probably could take that and assume for the other 17 cause you have it. Yeah, you gave me 10 I think they're supposed to pay

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       27 million. I just don't. I think they have to go bank. He Shit never fight again. Well maybe wants to though. He wants to be the champ. You know he's got a legit shot. I think he beat with a criminal. I think he won that second point. I think you won. I think he won. What about Rockhold going a light heavyweight? I Dunno man. The way he smashed rock holding that fight. I was like, good Lord. And he kissed him. Well Brock. Yeah, he kissed it after he flat light and Rocco was talking about kinds of shit. But Rockhold said he was like hitting someone's made out of steel. You said he was so fucking hard lit. Rocko told me that. I've never felt a human like that in my life. That's super five-star elite athlete. That's what that is. That is is elite as you get when that guy goes into the cage and you see him move around and it's like, Jeez, all you got neck, no neck.

Speaker 5:          02:35:05       You go, how the fuck is he 185 pounds, dude, I weigh 200 pounds. How the fuck is your Elvin Marrow? 185 pounds. That's crazy. Sane, insane. I seen this a side by side with him. It could be be like when they were younger and I was just like, man, this dude is massive. He's just Khabib as a bear. Yeah, he's could be mystic as fuck. Yo Wells on another level. Freaking like a he a gargle. He like built like a little gargle or something like, but when he knocked up Chris Weidman with that flying nail, I was like, Jesus Christ, he's just, he has this like slow move and he sets these traps on you and explodes. Where do you feel like, like these veterans, that sport is changing so much. So now you starting to see all these, these vets try to figure it out. Like why am I going to light heavyweight?

Speaker 5:          02:35:52       Look this, why am I going to lie to him? Healy man. So it's like is these guys like, because obviously this, this with Dana White's contender series, all these fresh guys are starting to, the sport is changing so fast. It's like now these guys are starting to become the Tito Ortiz, chuck Liddell [inaudible] of the, now it's like this new fresh cause. Thinking about it, it's like Jordan said, it's going to all, it's going to be somebody better than me one day. Michael Jordan. It's going to be somebody way better than Jon Jones one day. Wow. Think about that. The evolution of the sport. Well that's what we've seen, right? When you go back to the old days, the tank, Abbott days, and then you see what you see today means that's unrecognizable and you're talking about 1993 to 2019 what is it going to be like in 2030 the field baroni days?

Speaker 5:          02:36:39       Oh my God. I mean what we're going to look at in 10, 15 years from now, it's probably just me. You're seeing it now with the Tuesday night contender series and with these guys coming out of one that you never even heard of before, the Johnny Walkers where you come from exactly that knots. You can guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez, like who the fuck is he like is a monster. Never heard of him before. Right? There's so many guys coming up right now that no one's heard of that are just dedicated and driven and focused and they also have a higher benchmark. You know, they've seen the mighty mouses, they seen these guys and they know that this is, this is the level they're trying to achieve.

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       Instead of, you know, looking back at the early days, you know, we're, we're guys just weren't as complete as they are now. That's great. Do you think, what is the, Dana has said plenty of times there will never be a cross promotion when you think it is. Will it ever be po? Would you like to see that one versus UFC champion? Like I'm the worst businessman of all times. I'm not about protecting any brands. I don't give a fuck. I would be like, yeah, come on, let's fight, let's fight. Let's all make money. I don't care. You know, I'm not, I'm the wrong guy for that. Like if I was the, I would, I would make the UFC lose money. I get paid people more. I mean I'm not the right guy for that job and I think that I would have a lot more weight classes.

Speaker 3:          02:37:57       First of all, I wouldn't have a jump between 85 and two oh five that to me looks crazy. Like why don't you have 10 pounds every 10 pounds? One 65 is neat. Yes. One 65 is Kevin Lee would be, could be champion easily. Then (556) 057-0580 five all the way on up 95 two oh five to 15 to 25 more fights. Yes. More fights. More champions, and I think it's the right way to do it. Also, I feel like it's weird that we call it welterweight when it's one 70 and now glory calls it welterweight at one 72 welterweight and like in the sugar ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns days, it's one 47 that's welterweight. Yeah, because Mayweather was a welterweight champion at one 40 that's 45 Singh. That's boxing. That's the fucking legitimate original name for that weight class is the boxing name. They called it welterweight. They called it middle mate.

Speaker 3:          02:38:43       They called it cruiserweight. It was their names. So what we've done is some weird thing where we decided why the fuck you want to call it welterweight? It's like, you know, I live on Brown street. They have fuck you brown streets over here now. How can we have two brown streets? That's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't they create one 65 they should. I don't know. I don't like what would be one of my relationships with Dana white is we're very good friends and she got the guy to death of loved him forever. He got me into commentary. If it wasn't for him, I'd never done it, but I don't. I don't do what he does. I don't want that job. I said get it. I don't agree with him on a lot of shit. I don't agree with him on the weight classes for sure.

Speaker 3:          02:39:23       I don't think, I don't agree with 'em on some of the rules. I don't know. There's a lot of shit. I don't agree with it. You know, there's a lot of things I don't agree with in the sport in general. I'm changing my opinion though about bare knuckle. I used to think there would be a, yeah, you like it now? No, you don't. No, this is for MMA. I feel like people would get too cut up. Yeah. I mean I'm, Hallie barely got hit. You see his face? Yeah. What did you see? Krystle evens face. Oh, dad was brutal. The chrysalis. Pull up that picture from Chris Levens a thing today. Dakota Cochran opened up just a fucking river on his head. It's crazy. I just feel like imagine seeing a woman in her face look like we've already seen it. I mean we've seen girls in Moy Times in particular.

Speaker 3:          02:40:04       Look at that Gash Dude. That is crazy. I mean that, that looks like you fell off a motorcycle and hit a tree and these fans just want more blood. Well it's just the knuckles cut your face up so easy. Yeah, and elbows cut your face up as well and you can definitely look. We've seen some horrific gashes inside the UFC, but I think it's harder to hit someone with an elbow and cut them up like that. It's like you're getting a lot of punches in. You're not getting a lot of elbows and not getting as many you can. Especially with ground and pound. There's a real good argument for for bare knuckle. But when you watch these bare knuckle fighters ever, the break breaking their fucking hands, almost every fight. Everybody's getting their hands broken. Him loves it. He's an animal. Harlem is like crazy, you know, they call him the goat and it's this funny trolling with it, but he's a game opponent.

Speaker 3:          02:40:56       He been fought. Michael Johnson, toughest head. That was a tough fight for Michael. He's tough. The Russian hammers a good nickname for that dude. And he's a hammer. Yeah. Look at Paul. And he said, I got only hit clean once. He got hit clean a couple of times. But the point is he didn't do shit. And I was, and that was bad. I'm a fan of Pauling, my NRG as a boxer, you know, and I commentators, he's very, very, very good as a commentator and I think he beat Adrian pruner. I think when he fought Broner I think y'all pointed him, but that's what those big ass gloves. He doesn't have. Uh, no disrespect. He doesn't have a good body for the sport. He's not genetically gifted. It's just not, it's just like he's, he's got an awkward body like athletically in an awkward way. He's just really smart and really tough.

Speaker 3:          02:41:43       And he did the very best with what nature gave him and he became world champion. Yeah. He became a legitimate world champion and he knows so much about boxing but it's a different world when you know the owner bare knuckles like this proves that we have the best combat sport in the world. After that fight I was like the fuck that guy. There's some tie guys because our fight beat a boxer. Yeah. Yeah. But they don't, it's just, you can't say it's the best combat sport in the world cause you can't let them elbow kick and punch a knee. It's like this thing about boxing, right? The sweet science. The thing about it is if you only let a guy box and with boxing gloves you get to see some shit. Like when you see Floyd fight where guys are punching them and they can't fucking hit him.

Speaker 3:          02:42:26       He's right in front of them and he's moving away because his knowledge and understanding of what you can do with those two weapons is just off the charts. He's got it focused like a goddamn laser beam and you just can't touch him. He's better than anybody that's ever been in terms of like his defensive, like he gets hit less than anybody who's ever fought and had 50 wins. There's nobody to get some of that stuff he have after he beat Canelo. That's a good question. He fought Pacquiao after that. Yes. He fought Pat Cardo. He fought Berto. He falls at the [inaudible] fight. They fight. Tim Bradley. Bradley fell out. He followed him on Donna right twice if it was after. No, no. I think the Madonna fight was before and that was one of the things that gave a lot of people that thought Canelo had a shock

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       as my, Donna cracked him in that first round member or not first round the first fight rats right before the bill. Yeah, right before the bell and Womble them a little bit. He stumble. Yeah. Both of them were before. After they were, yeah, so that's what I'm saying. Floyd has some fights after, so, oh, that's right. The Guerrero fight. Canelo record was crazy. Even me. Yeah. Look, man, Floyd is a motherfucker, dude. He's a motherfucker. You might not like the style or the way he fights, but the boxers that appreciate how difficult it is to do what he does. He's a, he's a, a new benchmark. He's a new benchmark in terms of how to get out of that sport with getting the, the very least amount of damage and fighting the most masterfully. And he's really changed the way Canelo fights. You see Canelo against Danny Jacobs.

Speaker 5:          02:44:04       Canals is in a lot of his shit stuff. Yeah. I mean, he's like, that's how you do it, man. [inaudible] crazy when people like Floyd shift, like his version of Canelo is like, no, that was way bigger than that. Come on. This whole totally different thing. I mean, it was a legit middle way. Now you know what the triple g Canelo trilogy reminds me of member when a pack out fault. Um, who was it that knocked him out? Oh, my blankets. Yeah. One when Mel, well Marcus, they fought two, three times a pack. Y'All won twice. Um, and mark has flat lined, they flat line them and I was like, Dang, what if triple g get his third chance? And that happens cause there's similar stories like he won, he won twice. Everybody said Marquez beat him twice. Yeah. And then they finally fought again and then he beat them.

Speaker 5:          02:44:51       Yeah. And Pat, y'all still fighting though? Yeah. How is that pause fighting Keith Thurman? I know that's a tough fight. That's danger. You can win it. Yeah, he can win it. He can just knock out his last appointment. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, PACU is still good. He's still good. And after he got shoulder surgery, you know what I mean? He's, he's as good as ever been. Yeah. I just hate that he keep using that excuse that he has showed her as messed up against when he fought Floyd. Yeah. It would have been interesting to see him 100% healthy against Floyd. But Floyd was smart with him. He's like, not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Isn't it weird that people say he waited till he got old but packout was older than Floyd Floyd's older than pack yet. Yeah, he's older than pack. Yeah. But he did wait until pack.

Speaker 5:          02:45:38       Y'all got a little worn. Hey, I'm sure he got knocked up by mark as like, okay, yeah, let's go. It looks like now's the time. It still wasn't close, but it was also, you know, Floyd is incredibly smart when it comes to promotion. He's not going to let anybody get 50 50 with him. It's like, no, no, no. That's the whole Eddie Hearn shit though. That's what, and then what can happen? Well, that shit is crazy. It's, what did you hear about, um, about him getting hurt before the fight? I heard that he had a pen, uh, anxiety attack. Yeah, I heard it. I heard he got knocked out. That's what I heard. Yeah. We're talking about Anthony. Joshua. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, but for the people, isn't it? We heard that Eddie Hearn is the promoter of Anthony Joshua. And what I had heard was that he got flat line and training or dropped and hurt bad and training and it was like leading up to the fight, like very close to the fight, whether a week or so out.

Speaker 5:          02:46:27       What did you do? You went well, I heard that happened in any went to Miami to finish the rest of his camp after that. Really? So that's what I think his dad was bitching about. Like Joshua, I'm not a hundred percent certain, but his in the ring when they was getting into it and you just, like I told you he wasn't right for the fight. He wasn't, you know, they were supposed to, they was trying to reschedule the fight. Yeah, they probably should have. They probably when you get dropped like that and Tracy high, like the punches he got hit with, they don't seem like punches at wick. He also looked a little out of it, out of it. It's easy to say that the now. Yeah, but Andy releases a bad mother fucker. Dude, that guy throws combinations, man. Andy Ruiz is a bad motherfucker. You know, people just get confused and they look at that belly. If you took all that fat away and you saw what was underneath it and he fought the same way, but he weighed two 20 and you'd go, wow, he's got a receipt on Instagram videos. I'm training how fast his hands is. I'm like, fuck confusing. Listen, when I, when they told me to film him, I think he might've had 20,000 subscribes on 20,000 followers and then in one night he had like a million.

Speaker 5:          02:47:37       I'm like, golly, like, and he seemed like a humble guy. He keep like trying to promote snickers, snickers like every day snickers snick he wanted that sponsorship. Snickers need to give him the sponsors. He likes snickers. He's a big boy. He's a big boy. Like what do you think happens? You're going to do a rematch. And uh, yesterday, yesterday, Ruiz Jr said, uh, I'm a beat him worse cause I'm gonna be in better shape. He can't box. And I was like, hmm, whoa. He, he was an Olympic gold medalist. He can fight, he can fight, he can fight him bucks. He goes, I just, I, it sucks cause I was gonna cover big baby Miller. I think he's fucked if he fights Deontay I think Joshua just can't, he can't hold up under that firepower. Nah. Deontay hits people and it's like he's got some fucking mortal Kombat super power in his glove.

Speaker 5:          02:48:29       It's crazy. Yeah, he got that old slave genetics but he's got that Tommy Hearns frame too. It's like a giant Tommy Hearns. Where's all that leverage? All that. All that torque he hit so God damn hard. When you look at a guy that has, what does he have? Like 40 wins, 39 Kaos it's something like that 41 wins. 40 KLS or something crazy. The only one he didn't Kao is, as we talked about before was Tyson fury. But if you looked at the count, if you had a real clock and you hit stop or you hit start when he went down, instead of relying on the referee to go one and two, maybe Tyson would have gotten up. You would've known that it was eight when it was eight to go with the reverie was saying eight it was already 10 you know it was like one, two.

Speaker 5:          02:49:15       By the time he got to eight and nine and in Tyson sit up, 10 had long been passed. So technically. Yeah, but that was also the case with Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson, you know? Yeah. I talked when Mike Tyson knocked down buster Douglas. Buster dogs did not get up by the count of 10 no, I had a real count of 10 and actual ten second count, but its obligation is to get up by the referees count, not by a clock. This year's a fucking clock. Why don't they use a god damn clock? Early on, I used to document a Tyson's trainer, Stacey McKinley after he got out of prison and he was, I used to always bring that up with holy filled and him like, but he was down 10 seconds. He was, I don't mean shit. They ain't nobody caring about that. Like they, they don't use that as excuse.

Speaker 5:          02:49:55       Like he was true because he could have gotten up at eight or nine if they, they actually have a real clock. Yeah. It's not like he was out cold and he woke up at eight you know, he was, he was just gathering his thoughts and trying to get his brain straight. Imagining if an MMA, if they had standing eight, why the fuck doesn't boxing have a clock? Like would they have a clock when it counts the ring, right? The ring time swing around so soon as somebody fall have a fucking real clock that shows seven, eight not so you don't leave it up to the Goddamn in a wreck. You look in the corner and say, oh, that's it. And he pick it up from there. The rest, I mean we shouldn't be the ref counting. It should be like a voice, like a digital voice.

Speaker 5:          02:50:34       One, two, three like so it's a hundred percent 10 seconds. That's so crazy because one guy can have a fast count. One guy can have a slow count. That's still one guy could have an envelope in his back, his suit coat pocket in a locker room. Just make it a little bit slower. Yeah, so you just never know. I looked this up when we were talking about this a couple months ago, supposedly, that they're the time officials supposed to start the count immediately and then the era and ring referee picks it up once he's got a attention. That is what happens. The problem is the referee does not do it to 10 seconds. He doesn't do it to actual do an actual clock. That's what happens when the guy goes down and says go to a neutral corner and then he picks it up at three full be off by two seconds easily like a golf celebrate men and he like, he spent four seconds trying to get them towards corner, but that's on the guy that's on the guy.

Speaker 5:          02:51:27       That makes sense. But you once a guy goes to neutral corner, the fucking clock should be like a legitimate second clock. Yeah, yeah. That's crazy. Or You flatlined people like water and then they don't get up. Yeah, it comes from a gentleman's rule, so I don't know if it was supposed to be 10 seconds. So it's parked in your horse in front of the fucking ceiling on get outta here. It's 2019 we got clocks, bitch. This is ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense in a shady, but boxing shady as fuck. One thing I like what glory does though, they incorporate five judges. These five jewels. I think the UFC should do that as well. I think three judges is ridiculous. When you see bad decisions, it's a lot like a, I don't know who

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       the lady Angela Hill just fought against. I thought it was a bad decision and I looked at that. I'm just like, why don't they have five judges, five judges who know and have five judges who know what the fuck they're doing. But you said it was even like they named one 70 welterweight. Yeah. What they want to do. Well, boxing uses three judges too. It's, it's, I don't know, more than the better. It's not like it's expensive to have a lot of judges because remember that score, that score card they gave to the draw to Canelo? Yes. Tim Bradley. No. Yeah. Tim Bradley and the one no Mayweather. Kale. Yes. Yeah. That lady, she, she'd vanished and then she did it again, right? Yeah, she did it again with Tim Bradley and many pack. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When Tim Bradley beat Manny Pacquiao, everybody was like, what? Even Bradley knew he didn't win that fight. No, he didn't win that fight, but the Canelo one was ridiculous. That was crazy that to draw, she was, that's one of those weird things where it's like all someone has to do was put a shit load of money on a majority decision, so like you know that Floyd's not going to knock Canelo out. He doesn't really knock him, but he's going to win. I put the money on a majority decision means one person has to be dirty. All you need is one person who is dirty. You can win millions.

Speaker 3:          02:53:22       Boxing is so dirty. It's so old. You can be dirty. UFC No, right. Really the judging, I don't think, I think the judging is incompetent. I don't believe it. I've never had any indication. No one's ever said to me they think it's dirty. I think it's incompetent and competent. There's a lot of incompetent judges, but then it's also we got state judges. It'd be weird with the rest. Sometimes. I see. I was like, who is this ref? Well, like we were talking about with Kamara Rosemont and Damien Maia. That's a ridiculous thing to separate those two. That's ridiculous. Let them play it out. Also, you've got a constrictor, you've got a guy who's whole deal is to get you in a bad position and then he gets you in a bad position and he's working his way. He's trying to work his way. He's got one hook and he's got your back.

Speaker 3:          02:54:02       He was Tom left to that. It's time left. It's time break. Break, break. Fucking break you break. Are you crazy? What the fuck are you here for? What are you here for? You? Just one rock. 'Em sock. 'Em robots. You'd go watch bare knuckle boxing. Get out of here. But I just rewatched the Ashker in a rob. I think they could've stopped it when he'd slammed on me. He could've, could've, could've stopped it. Could've stopped it when he was fucking run in his face. Oh, could've stopped it. But that was a lot of time left. Yup. Could've style was in the locker room where Robin when he came back could have stopped it. But I wanna watch that with herb. Dean had herb in here and we watched it and herb changed my mind cause I was thinking that he wasn't out cause you know, it's like they got to run that back and in Camarillo was saying they got to run that back. That, that he was out or that he wasn't out with the arm drop. Yeah. But then I watched it with her but he's like, this is not a normal way. Your arm drops. I'm like, you're right, your eyes. So he could've just been out for a second if he was out for a second and just woke back up. Yeah. Pop back up. And the way ask her and said it is when herb

Speaker 5:          02:55:03       started coming over to him, he knew he was out. Herb started coming over to him. He let up on the grip a little bit and that's why Robbie poppy gang up consciousness. Yeah. I believe Ben, I believe Ben and I, the arm that is, you don't let your arm just drop like that. I think he was out for it. So soon as he picked his arm up, he woke back up cause he was like, I think thumbs up. Ben Clamped on his head, van squeezing his head, the arm drops, herb comes over, look at him. He thinks he's going to stop the fight. He lets up a little bit because he thinks he's already out. And then he pops back up to life and then herb subs to find rob. He's like, what the fuck? I think that's what it, that's one of the most confuses back and forth.

Speaker 5:          02:55:38       Even during the fight I watched the you and a dominant now he was, no, no, he was, oh no, he's not. Yeah, I believe you're right there. Well you're also looking through this cage, right? It's over there and we're like, what is happening? He's out. He's out. He's out. Oh, he's not out. Herb was in a bad anger. He was in, he was in a bad, and he's the gold standard though. Truth, the best. And he's so calm about how he handles things. Never emotional. Always logical. You Know Zoe, where he breaks things down. He's the gold standard. Especially now that John McCarthy's not an intern anymore. He's doing a great job at Bella Torta. Yeah, I mean look belt belt or he used to be, that was like a clear difference between the UFC and belt. None anymore man. So you know I failed Lovato and Musashi.

Speaker 5:          02:56:23       You see that man, I level fucking fight mass crazy. Especially after Musashi beat Roy McDonald, which Rory probably shouldn't have been fighting him at 185 pounds. It was a wrong way. Class massage is way bigger than him and with saucy is beaten guys. Real top flight guys at two Oh five and then you know you got Lima who just knocked out Michael Van and page Moodle. No promotion on him. And I was sitting there like, man, I wish I could've just got my hands on and told this guy story. Yeah. Cause nobody knew him. Liam as a murderer bro. He's a murderer. His brother in the UFC, right? Yep. Yeah, yeah. Diego. But Douglas is as good as anybody alive at 170 pounds. I really believe that ash crazy man. I like it being called champion and Scott Coker doing. Yep, I do too. I wished that they would do the same thing that one is doing with the weight cuts.

Speaker 5:          02:57:12       Cut All that way. Cut Bullshit out. Just stop it. That's not necessarily Michael. Shannon cut a lot of weight though. He a big boy. So when he got hit heavy that's, I always like when they, when I see him get hit like that, I see how much weight these guys cut cause I'm around it. Yeah. And I'm like damn. He didn't really get hit like that. He got hit on the temple though, right? He got hit the ball, hit him on pit bull, hit him on the temple. It's hard. They both hit hard. It's one of those crazy games where you know whoever connects first can put the other guy out. Especially after channeling knocked out his brother. It was a big deal. Yeah. That was a double champion. A lot of double champions now. Honor started it. Yup. You got Bader heated double champion. You got pit bull. Yup. You got Saludo. Yup. Dude. Amanda noon to Yup. So lot. Yeah. Kind of obviously. Yeah, Daniel Cormier corny. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:58:02       Crazy. It's crazy now. He threatened it to be true. I would say if because they gonna have to do if who, so Hutto is out for a year. They going to have to do an interim at bantamweight. So who you do Aljamain and Peter Yon. You could do that. That's a good fight. Yeah. That's a very good where, where does Cody Garbrandt fit in that picture? That's a good question. I think Cody has to win one. Just get in a fight fight. He got knocked out twice in a row. Pedro, Pedro Munoz, and you know, obviously the TJ Dillashaw one comes into question now the TJ gets popped for EPO, but what did he say on Shale? Sonnen's podcasts took, he had an explanation, the chicken, because he's trying to make the way, he must've been just so drained trying to make that weight. You really do have, I like TJ too, man.

Speaker 4:          02:58:42       I do too. Sad. I was supposed to fill on a week before he lost it. So who though? And then he was just like, ah, let's just do the next camp. He looked like a goddamn skeleton going into that fight. The pitcher when he, all those pills was on the table. Yeah, it was like 500 bottles. I was like, why would you just to maintain his body, keep it alive or he's just basically draining all the life out of it to make to 125 pounds. He's owning up to it though. Yeah. He didn't like that. You gotta face show. True. Sometimes. He also had a really fucked up shoulders. Both shoulders are fucked up and he wound up getting surgery on one of them, you know? And he had the video. He was fat looking and with the mustache I was like, what the hell is going on?

Speaker 4:          02:59:23       Did he just go to get kidnapped by aliens and dropped back off? Well, when you lose that much weight, your body wants to hold your body essentially. You wanted to starvation mode and your body wants to hold on to every fucking calorie it can. It slows your metabolism down. I just think you're doing a giant to service for the rest of your life with your body when you do that. I think it's very unhealthy. Brutal cuts take years off your life. That's what a lot of fighters say, man. It's a Shawn Soriano. There's eight hard knocks. A three 65. I remember when whose mom was getting ready for the willy fight. That's my favorite time to film during fight week cause that's the true raw emotions is the weight cut. Everything else is standard. They gotta do open workouts, media, it's barn stuff. But that weight cut, you see these people, souls and Guzman in there.

Speaker 4:          03:00:12       Uh, Ben Ashker and they all in a pit all cutting weight together. I'm just thinking like this is crazy. And you've seen the picture with a cowboy and Tony Ferguson when they was side by side cutting weight. That's when neighbors, they have respect goes to the all time high with the fighters cause they all in, they're trying to feed their families. Man is showing when money. Dude, Tony Ferguson scares the fuck out of me. That guy don't get tired. He doesn't get tired. Could be respect him. Fights him, looks like they got run through a fucking meal. Break hands, right bricks. What the hell is he doing? Punching. And you've got big ass hands, fire everyday and he has big wide hands. So many people have been screaming for me to please do it. An anatomy of Tony Ferguson. He's so interesting too. That's what I'm situations where it's like, I got to see the how.

Speaker 4:          03:00:57       I don't know man. It's weird. I'm in a weird position because like for example, I like Connor, but damn, that relationship you got with Kobi was horrible. I can't, yeah, I understand. It just sucks because the Connor team, before I ever met Khabib, I was on Roddy. All these guys on the channel, right? Yeah. And now I'm team could be, you know, when you get invited to somebody's country, be around a family, eat the food with their brothers, they sacred. Yeah. Like you gotta respect it. So I respect it. Tony Ferguson's a different one. They talk shit. But I, I would love to get Tony Ferguson on the channel. Do you think that compromises your objectivity or do you think that's just the price that you pay to be that close? I know. I think this the price you pay sometimes, but I ho I wish fighters will understand what I'm trying to do.

Speaker 4:          03:01:43       I'm trying to build. I think they do and they definitely will now. Yeah. I'm trying to build a platform from all fighters. I don't care if y'all fighting it get ugly. You throw a Dolly through a bus, you talk about somebody's family and all this stuff. I get that, ah man, I can't touch that. But when it comes to like somebody like Tony Ferguson versus cubby, I want to have the access to go with Tony and Eddie and film that and talk to them and get inside the mindset of who Tony Is. No one has really promoted Tony Ferguson. I feel like I could do an amazing job spending a day or two with Tony Ferguson and talking about life and I think you could too, but I don't know if Tony be interest into it. Tony is a real rebel. He's a very unique, he may give you a little bit, but not everything you want.

Speaker 4:          03:02:27       Yeah, too. He doesn't want anybody in close with him. He's got secrets too in terms of how he prepares and how he trains. He had one of my good friends, uh, document them. His last fight in Vegas, the one when he fought Petty's he filmed, he documented him the whole whole time. So he had a camera crew with them. Well, I think after his last fight, I think people are starting to understand the cowboy fight, the disguise something truly special. Everybody knew. But if you look at is the last time, I mean Luke Thomas had something on his Twitter documenting the last time or how crazy it is of you look like who was champion the last time? Tony I now lost, I mean he's a monster. His last loss was to Michael Johnson. Yeah. How long ago was that? Long time. I think it was 2013.

Speaker 4:          03:03:12       That's crazy that Michael Johnson beat him. He beat Dustin poor ea. Michael Johnson man does support hotline though. At lightweight. Yup. Kayla and Edson Barbosa. Yup. Yup. And his, his tough losses was to gay t who he, he could've beat gates. He, he had him beat. They're both back and forth. That was in there could be fight that I really, I mean that's debatable that he stung them, but soon as they tagged them, tagged them. But it wasn't like a, no flippy hit him. It's a fight. Yeah, but it could be mauled him. It grabbed him and it was, it just shows how good could be better. You have to give up. I deserve this. Yeah, give up. That's when I was like, who the hell is this? Don't have to be champion. I didn't know who could be bus. I was documented. Michael Johnson for the camp. I know he's telling him to give up boys beating the fuck.

Speaker 4:          03:03:56       I know I deserve this. Right. Like Mike on the bottom and hit him back by like under. He's like, I was about when he was beating the shit out of [inaudible] let's talk now. Let's talk. Boom. He just beat. So you know I, I was backstage when he came back in the locker room. Yeah. After the Malay. People have never seen that for this yet. What was that like? It was crazy. I remember he was like, we'll turn the camera off because it was just too much going on. Yeah. I've never released it yet because out of respect of the courts, so I asked him, I showed us a snippet and budgeted. I just look there. We need him to fight again. We need to get past all that nonsense. Yeah. Trust me. I can't wait to show the world one day how crazy that was in the locker around. But listen, well, we just did three hours, man. Whoa. Leave that look. It's three 10 do the clock. Crazy. Same time weapon, this place. This was everything I was hoping it was going to be, man. I appreciate it. I appreciate you and I think what you're doing with your channel is amazing. Your documentary is amazing and I appreciate. Thanks man. I appreciate it very much. You fire everybody. Woo. Fuck three hours.
