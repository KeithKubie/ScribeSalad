00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.860
This Europe in the 18th Century.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.240
Smallpox is everywhere, 400,000 Europeans
are dying from it each year.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.809
And there’s no cure, but there might be
hope… there’s a doctor who thinks he’s

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.559
found a way to fight the disease.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.150
All you need to do is let him infect you with
some good, old-fashioned, cowpox-infected

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.150
pus.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.592
Of course, there is this other doctor who
says, “Sure, you could do that, but it will

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:23.180
might make your face look like a cow’s.”

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.010
And the debate over vaccines began.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.199
Today, vaccinations are fairly common.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.350
Here’s a quick recap of how they work.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.580
There are a number of different types of vaccines,
but they are all meant to do the same thing

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.020
- give your body the ability to fight a disease
without actually contracting it.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.070
Whether they use a dead or weakened virus
or a toxin, the vaccine will make your body

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.410
activate T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes (T-cells
and B-cells).

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.910
Those are simply defensive white blood cells
that can remember how to battle those infections.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.910
But let’s go back to 200 years ago.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.820
The idea of using a virus to prevent getting
sick is older than you think.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.620
In 10th century China, people would inhale
smallpox scabs in order to contract a mild

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.140
form of the disease and therefore gain immunity.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.830
It was messy and didn’t always work and
also, gross.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.940
Fast forward to 1796, British physician Edward
Jenner discovered something slightly less

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.960
gross but way more effective.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.370
Milkmaids, for some unknown reason, were known
for never contracting smallpox.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.520
Jenner believed they were gaining immunity
from cowpox, an unpleasant but not fatal disease.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.790
Jenner tested his theory by taking cowpox
infected pus and using to to inoculate an

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.790
8-year-old boy.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.030
This wasn’t his son, by the way..

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.710
Which yeah, does sound kind of messed up.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.140
Especially when you realize he then later
exposed the boy to smallpox in order to confirm

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140
his theory.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.940
Luckily, the test was a success and Jenner
began treating more people (his own son included).

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.830
He called the process vaccination, using the
latin word, “vacca”, for cow.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.020
He published his work in 1798, which was met
with...wide ridicule and repulsion.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.070
Big surprise, putting pus from a diseased
animal into your body didn’t really fly

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.320
with everyone.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.350
Another physician, William Rowley, made a
particularly outrageous claim that the vaccine

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.390
caused one boy to take on the features of
a cow.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.300
It didn’t help that the vaccine wasn’t
perfect, either.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.170
The smallpox vaccine has been plagued with
negative side effects throughout its history.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.140
Even the modern day one had some potentially
serious side effects.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.810
Plus, in the early 19th century, everything
is taking place before germ theory and proper

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.030
sterilization, so people would actually contract
other diseases from contaminated vaccines.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.520
But despite its problems, the UK made vaccination
mandatory in the mid 1800s.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.520
Britain actually became quite the fan of Jenner’s
work, with British Parliament eventually paying

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.800
him what now amounts to around a million dollars.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.120
This was the start of the eradication of one
of humanity’s most notorious diseases.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.320
In the 20th century, there were still 300
million deaths from smallpox worldwide.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.350
But this century?

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.350
Zero.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.350
Nothing.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.430
The last recorded case was in 1978.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.770
Today, the disease exists only in protected
labs.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.370
All thanks to a curious scientist, some milkmaid
pus, and one really, really lucky kid.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.760
Getting vaccinated is pretty normal, but what
about checking your poop?

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.740
Its actually more important than you think,
find why out in the is video.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.780
So would you have taken the first vaccine
ever?
