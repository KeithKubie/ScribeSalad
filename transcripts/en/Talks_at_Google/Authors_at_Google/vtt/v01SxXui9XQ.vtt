ELIZABETH CURTIS:
I'm Elizabeth Curtis.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.440
And I'm really excited to
welcome all of you here today.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.120
We're going to be
hearing from Howard Ross.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.580
Howard is a business
consultant who's

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.580
been woodworking
for over 25 years

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.580
in the area of
leadership, diversity,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.320
inclusion, organizational
transformation.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.450
And we're really lucky to
have him here today at Google.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.170
You may have seen his recent
article in "The New York Times"

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.770
or perhaps heard him on NPR
where he's a regular guest.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.534
He's the author of
two books, and I'm

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:32.450
really excited that he's
going to be giving us

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.880
a deep dive today into his most
recent book, "Everyday Bias."

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.440
How the session
is going to run is

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.360
Howard is going to come up,
share a few words with us,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.309
and then we'll open things up to
Q&amp;A. So with that, over to you.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.100
HOWARD ROSS: Great.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.060
Thanks, Elizabeth.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.890
Hi, everybody.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.140
I'm really happy to be here.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.390
I want to start with a story.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.214
I was in Jackson,
Mississippi about a year ago.

00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:58.880
I was working with some folks at
Jackson State University, which

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.407
is an historically
black college.

00:01:00.407 --> 00:01:02.490
And we were working with
the faculty and the deans

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.640
down there, and I had to
fly from Jackson to New York

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.300
City through Memphis that night
to work with another client.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.070
And I got to the Memphis airport
in time for the last flight

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.460
out, and I got to the gate, and
as soon as I got to the gate,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.160
a woman gate attendant
comes on and she

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.535
says, ladies and
gentlemen, there

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:20.119
will be a 45-minute delay.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.910
As soon as the words
came out of her mouth,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.040
I hear this voice boom
out from behind me,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.450
you talking to us, lady?

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.150
And I turn around, and there's
this guy sitting behind me

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.760
who I would best describe as
Santa Claus with an attitude,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.220
older white guy, white beard,
white hair, well fed, wearing

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.370
overalls and a flannel
shirt, carrying a car

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.060
magazine in his hand.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.520
So I had the guy pegged, and
I kind of chuckled to myself

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.603
and went about my business
working on my computer,

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:48.060
preparing a talk that I
was giving the next week.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.830
And it comes time to get on
the airplane 45 minutes later,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.413
and I get to my seat,
and sure enough,

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:54.480
who's sitting next to me
but Angry Santa Claus.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.180
So we did the nod.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.980
Those of you who travel a lot
know what I'm talking about,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.100
this sort of thing.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.839
And we went about our
business, took off.

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:03.130
And I'm working on my computer.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.980
He's reading his magazine.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.370
And that's the way it went
until we got to New York,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.440
and it was time for
our initial descent.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.360
And then we closed computers,
and as travelers know,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.480
this is the time when
airplane chat starts.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.529
Because it's now safe to
get into a conversation.

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.570
You're not going to get
roped into two hours now.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.570
And I turn to him and I say,
what's taking you to New York?

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.700
And he says, oh, I have
a professional meeting.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.150
I said, really?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.775
What do you do?

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:26.860
He says, I'm a radiologist.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.562
So, boom, there
goes that picture.

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:30.270
And I say, well, what
are you working on?

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.045
He says, well, actually,
he gets very animated.

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:34.430
He says, we're doing this very
cool stuff with functional

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.940
magnetic resonating
imagery where

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.856
we're looking at the
brain, and we're actually

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.629
able to watch the
brain and figure out

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.170
how different parts of the brain
respond when people interact

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.540
with different kinds of people.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.290
In other words, he's
studying exactly what

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.456
I'm the most interested in,
and had I not pegged him

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.412
as Angry Santa the Car
Mechanic, I probably

00:02:49.412 --> 00:02:51.870
could have learned more in a
two-hour conversation with him

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.200
in preparation for my book
than in three months of study.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.110
So I start with that as
part of this conversation,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.735
because I'm not here
to talk about you.

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:01.540
I'm here to talk about us.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.620
This is what we do as
human beings, isn't it?

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.550
We all do this.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.220
We come into circumstances.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.840
We quickly evaluate
what's going on.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.990
And then we determine
something about those people.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.109
And usually we don't
even have the time

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.400
to follow up and find out
whether that determination is

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.900
true.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.480
We just simply start
interacting from there.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.910
And I know we've got a very
short time for this talk,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.576
and this is a topic
that we could easily

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:26.330
take 45 days to talk about
rather than 45 minutes,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.270
but I want to-- and
I'm also really aware

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.270
and I want to knowledge
that the folks at Google

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.603
have done some of the most
forward-thinking work on this

00:03:32.603 --> 00:03:34.014
that I know of companies doing.

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.680
So I know some of
this is stuff that you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.263
may have heard in
one form or another,

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:40.410
but my own experience
has been that you can't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.344
hear it enough to continue
to be focused on this.

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:44.760
So i want to just
start by sharing

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.690
just a handful of very
quick studies of what we're

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.500
learning about
how this shows up.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.020
For example, we know
because research

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.370
at University of
Pennsylvania and Cornell

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.050
has found that basketball
referees tend to give fouls

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.420
to players of the opposite
race more than players

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.690
of their same race.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.060
And this is true for
both white referees

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.750
and for African
American referees.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.810
It's different degrees, but
nonetheless still the same.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.150
We know that people
make determinations

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.490
of people's credibility
based on accent.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.200
Researchers at Tel
Aviv University

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.640
at the University
of Chicago found

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.120
that we tend to
believe people more

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.261
if they have an accent
that's more similar to us

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.510
and less if they have an
accent that's more different,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.301
with one exception.

00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:25.806
Anybody want to
guess what it is?

00:04:25.806 --> 00:04:26.660
AUDIENCE: British?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.400
HOWARD ROSS: British.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.983
British, yeah.

00:04:27.983 --> 00:04:31.450
We tend to think people with
British accents are smarter.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.924
They not only make
great villains,

00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:33.840
they are also smarter.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520
One of my clients
in New York has

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.997
a guy who grew up in
Liverpool, which of course they

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:41.830
speak cockney there.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.160
He called it gutter English.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.870
And he said when he goes
home to visit his family

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.920
and then comes back
to New York, he

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.520
says I feel myself getting
smarter every mile I fly.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.790
We also know that hand
dominance is a factor.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.589
Researchers at Max Planck
Institute for Psycholinguistics

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:01.130
in the Netherlands
have found that we

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.100
tend to make decisions
based on hand dominance.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.725
In other words, if
you're right handed,

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:06.400
you may be more likely
to hire somebody

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.750
who's sitting on your
right side than who

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.374
happens to interview
on your left side.

00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:12.724
Makes no sense at all,
just tends to happen.

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:13.890
And this is the study I did.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.360
I've got an artificial
knee, and whenever

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.827
I go through the TSA process,
I have to be screened.

00:05:18.827 --> 00:05:21.160
So I began to notice that
when I was dressed in business

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.057
clothing, I seemed to
be going through faster

00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:24.640
than when I was
dressed more casually,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.740
turns out about 47% faster.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.180
Now, I could go on and on,
because there are literally

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.790
over 1,000 studies in the
last 10 years alone of this.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.640
We know that this dynamic
happens almost everywhere

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.470
we are.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.000
So the question is, when we look
at it relative to height, name,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.650
race, gender, hand
dominance, religion, accent,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.140
in almost every kind of
human identity factor

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.680
that you can imagine,
the question is not

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.050
do we have bias?

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.240
The question is
really, which are ours?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.290
And that's hard for us
to get as human beings,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.970
because for the most
part, we've seen bias

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.430
as a fundamentally bad thing.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.190
For the most part,
we've created this sort

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.130
of bias-equals-badness paradigm.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.500
And that's challenging for us.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.720
The very notion
that we have bias

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.620
challenges us to be able to
look at ourselves in ways

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.770
that are very practical.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.580
So what I want to talk
about is how that happens,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.110
why it happens, and what are
some of the things that we're

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.570
learning, we can do about
this, both individually

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.310
and collectively, to create
organizations, especially

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.100
where we can make
better decisions,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.660
not just so that we can
be nice to each other

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.640
or sing "Kumbaya," but
so that we can actually

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.860
make good organizational
decisions and good talent

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.470
management decisions.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.960
And that shows up in
virtually everything we do.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.810
Now we know that bias is a
function, a natural function

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.480
of the human brain.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.140
And it happens for
a clear reason.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.260
What function does bias serve?

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.760
Anybody?

00:06:52.382 --> 00:06:53.215
Why do we have bias?

00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:54.420
AUDIENCE: It keeps us safe.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.544
HOWARD ROSS: Yeah, it keeps
us safe, exactly right.

00:06:56.544 --> 00:06:58.210
It's a human danger detector.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.710
We have to quickly determine
whether this person is somebody

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.930
we want to go
towards or away from.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.660
It triggers fight,
flight, or freeze in us.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.670
And bias is as natural to
human beings as breathing.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.540
The challenge is
when we demonize it,

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.840
and we start to recognize
bias as something

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.330
that if we have
we're bad people,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.112
it actually puts us
into hiding more.

00:07:19.112 --> 00:07:20.695
It causes us to not
look at our biases

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:23.470
as much but actually
deflect from, find

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.350
reasons for our belief systems.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.850
Now, this is
challenging as somebody

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.140
who's worked in the diversity
space for about 30 years.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.280
This is really challenging,
because for so long,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.980
the diversity space
has lived inside

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.030
of this good person-bad
person paradigm, if you will.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.310
And we're sort of
looking for the bad one

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.637
and trying to fix them.

00:07:40.637 --> 00:07:42.720
This is what a lot of
diversity training has been,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.569
is find-them-and-fix-them
training,

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:46.860
which is why a lot of times,
people come into diversity

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.950
training like this.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.790
And even the
discourse that we have

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.620
reinforces that in lots
of ways, that we advocate

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.130
rather than trying to
build something together.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.089
It's inherently problematic.

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:01.380
And then we build biases into
our institutions as well.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.090
So what do we call
bias, for example,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.094
when we all agree to them
and even write them down?

00:08:08.094 --> 00:08:09.135
AUDIENCE: Qualifications.

00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:10.551
HOWARD ROSS: Yeah,
qualifications.

00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:11.846
That's all qualifications are.

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:14.220
Qualifications are simply
biases that we've all agreed to

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:14.929
and written down.

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:17.261
Now, that doesn't mean there's
anything wrong with them.

00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:18.880
They can be very
helpful sometimes.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.560
If you're evaluating hundreds
and hundreds of resumes,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.390
it's valuable to
have qualifications

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.410
so that you can sort
those resumes quickly.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.010
But it's not necessarily
particularly helpful in terms

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.789
of choosing the best
person, and it intentionally

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:33.909
and problematically
can sometimes

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.510
exclude people who
are, we might call,

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.610
the creative eccentrics,
the people who

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.784
are outside of the
norm of what we do.

00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:41.950
So we're going to look at,
basically, how this works

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.210
and how it plays itself out.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.060
Now we know that all human
beings have built within us

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.920
through our life
experience we might

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.820
an internal book of rules.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.799
It happens all the time.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.590
We pick up throughout
our life certain ways

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.170
that we're supposed to be.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.865
And it's consistent
with the things

00:08:58.865 --> 00:09:01.130
that we've been taught
throughout our whole life,

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.642
various different kinds of
things that we've learned

00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:05.600
are the right way to be
or the wrong way to be.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.889
So for example--

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:08.680
AUDIENCE: I'm Will.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.650
HOWARD ROSS: How did you
know to do that, Will?

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.030
AUDIENCE: You
extended your hand.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.580
HOWARD ROSS: Right, and in our
culture, that's what we do.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.913
And how did that handshake feel?

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.370
AUDIENCE: Not so strong.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.820
HOWARD ROSS: Not
so strong, right.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.730
See, I didn't shake
Will's hand in the way

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.040
that we usually do it
in our culture, which

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.873
is kind of like a
wrestling match, you know,

00:09:26.873 --> 00:09:29.290
glad to meet you, a
little bit softer.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.651
But for the most part when that
happens-- how many people here

00:09:32.651 --> 00:09:34.650
have heard somebody say
if somebody shakes hands

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.816
like that with you at the
beginning of an interview,

00:09:36.816 --> 00:09:39.410
forget it, it's over?

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.550
How crazy is that?

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.560
Think about it.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.479
It's kind of insane,
isn't it?-- that we

00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:44.770
would take one thing like that.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.964
I could have a disability.

00:09:45.964 --> 00:09:47.380
I could have an
injury to my hand.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.307
I could come from
one of the one third

00:09:49.307 --> 00:09:51.640
of the cultures on the planet
where shaking hands softer

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.284
is the norm.

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.950
But that's the kind
of reaction we have.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.887
By the way, your reaction,
Will, was pretty calm

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:57.970
compared to some I've had.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.630
I did that with
a leadership team

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.374
of a major governmental
institution,

00:10:01.374 --> 00:10:02.790
and the guy who I
shook hands with

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.160
was this kind of
football linebacker guy,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.770
and he practically
fell off his chair

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.810
reacting to the handshake.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.660
So we have literally thousands
of rules in our internal rule

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.420
book.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.776
They're unquestioned
for the most part.

00:10:14.776 --> 00:10:16.400
They're not rules we
even see as rules.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.420
We just see them as
the way things are.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.070
And that rule structure
creates in our mind

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.590
what we call schema.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.860
Schema are frameworks
for looking at the world,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.720
that I know you work
with in different ways,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.053
that shape the things that
we see and the things that we

00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:30.610
don't.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.860
So for example, look at
this picture for a moment.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.180
And tell me if you can
see any discernible image

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.320
in this picture.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.072
What do you see?

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:40.572
A

00:10:40.572 --> 00:10:41.170
AUDIENCE: Bunny rabbit.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.503
HOWARD ROSS: A bunny rabbit, OK.

00:10:42.503 --> 00:10:43.784
Anybody else?

00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:45.450
AUDIENCE: I'd say it
was an aerial shot.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.783
HOWARD ROSS: An aerial shot, OK.

00:10:46.783 --> 00:10:47.560
Anybody else?

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.139
a Google Map?

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:50.430
AUDIENCE: I kind of see a bird.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.230
HOWARD ROSS: A bird.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.480
Let me make it easier for you.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.230
I'm going to superimpose
a picture over it

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.380
now so you can see
the actual image.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.797
Now what do you see?

00:10:58.797 --> 00:10:59.380
AUDIENCE: Cow.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.088
HOWARD ROSS: Cow.

00:11:00.088 --> 00:11:01.440
Does everybody see the cow?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.027
Anybody who doesn't see it yet?

00:11:03.027 --> 00:11:04.610
We could always do
a remedial session.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.970
But let me point it out to you.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.802
So here are the two ears,
the two eyes and a nose,

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:10.010
and this is the forehead, OK?

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.810
Everybody sees the cow now.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.690
Now I'm going to remove
the superimposed picture.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.455
And tell me now if you
can avoid seeing the cow.

00:11:19.455 --> 00:11:21.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.700
Something that wasn't there a
minute ago, invisible a minute

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.020
ago, is now impenetrably
in our line of vision.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.270
This is the way schema works.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.560
In this case, I actually
consciously shifted

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.760
the schema to one
in which you can now

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.090
see something that
wasn't there before.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.557
Now we all know this happens.

00:11:36.557 --> 00:11:38.890
We know that it happens from
the standpoint of our jobs.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.770
Everybody here has
certain schema in your job

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.720
that have you see things
that other people don't see.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.410
There are people
who shine shoes,

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.180
for example, who, when
somebody walks by,

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.430
are not looking at the people.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.639
They're looking at the shoes.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.346
You or I would see
the people walking by.

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:54.469
They would see the shoes.

00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:56.260
This is the nature of
the way schema works.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.300
It shapes what we see
and what we don't.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.990
And if this can be true for
something as silly as a picture

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.107
or as seemingly superficial
to us as a particular job

00:12:04.107 --> 00:12:05.690
that we happen to
be in at the moment,

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.100
how can it not be true for
us based on these identities

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.910
with live our whole lives in?

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.095
Our gender, our race, our
sexual orientation, our age,

00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:15.730
the generation we come from--
all of these things are

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.747
fundamentally
affecting the schema,

00:12:17.747 --> 00:12:20.330
affecting the things that we see
and the things that we don't.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.830
And this is why sometimes
we're in circumstances

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.360
where one person
or group of people

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.860
see certain things that other
people just don't notice.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.870
So schema leads to the
formation of background.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:38.450
And I background in the
sense that I shape the world

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.280
by my experience,
that I actually

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.350
see the world
through a filter that

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.470
is governed by the background
experience that I've had.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.290
It's like a lens through
which we filter the world.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.240
And background
creates a phenomenon

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.280
of a coloration of our
world, if you will.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.280
It's like a contact lens
that gets put over our eyes

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.360
before we even realize
that it's there.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.980
And the world actually looks
blue to us or green to us

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.550
or orange to us, depending
upon what that lens is.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.760
And we sit there and
talk to each other

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.460
through different
lenses and often accuse

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.970
each other of not seeing things.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.830
But the reality is,
we can't see them,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.550
or we're not oriented
towards seeing them

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.350
unless we stop and notice
that we have this lens on.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.730
Now, somebody stops and says,
oh, you have a blue lens on.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.600
All of a sudden, I look
at that white wall color

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.740
blue in a different way.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.690
It still looks blue to me, but
my awareness that it's blue

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.600
is different.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.360
So our work in trying to
understand this relative

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.920
to bias is can we understand
how our life experiences have

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.620
filtered the people and the
things we're doing it in a way

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.367
that when we see
that difference,

00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:42.700
it actually gives us the
opportunity to make that little

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.100
mental switch, to understand
what we're putting

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.500
into the conversation
and others aren't.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.590
John Searle, the brilliant
philosopher from the University

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.140
of California says,
background enables

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.610
linguistic interpretation
to take place,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.375
enables perceptual
interpretation to take place,

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:02.250
and it actually structures
our consciousness.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.784
It actually gives us the world
that we see in a profound way.

00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:07.450
And so we're not
talking about something

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.910
that happens to some people.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.670
And we're not talking
about something

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.935
that happens to bad people.

00:14:10.935 --> 00:14:12.310
Were talking about
something that

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.690
happens to people, that
this is the fundamental way

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.340
the human mind works,
and it impacts us

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.100
on an everyday basis, because
background creates context,

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.776
and context is everything in
terms of how we see the world.

00:14:23.776 --> 00:14:25.150
And we know context
shifts things

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.850
quite dramatically
and in funny ways.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.308
For example, if it's in the
middle of winter in Washington,

00:14:29.308 --> 00:14:33.440
DC, where I live, 60 degrees
means take off your shirt

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.120
and lay out and get some sun.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.030
If it's the middle of the
summer when it's 100 degrees,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.010
60 degrees means let's
get a sweatshirt.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.970
It's cold.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.581
So context is constantly
shifting the way we see things.

00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:45.830
So let me switch for a moment.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.742
This is my granddaughter Sloane.

00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:49.450
She has nothing do
with the presentation.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.491
I just love showing pictures
of my grandchildren.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.020
No, but all kidding aside,
my second-oldest son

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.520
and this family
moved to Washington,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.506
where we live, a
couple years ago.

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:01.130
And they lived with
us for a few months

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.040
while they were waiting for
their house to be ready.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.950
And Sloane came in one
night just before dinner,

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.765
and she asked for a cookie,
and I said to her, of course,

00:15:06.765 --> 00:15:09.250
it wasn't a good time to have
a cookie just before dinner.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.620
She made me promise that I
would tell you she's nine now.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.870
And being five at the time,
she still wanted a cookie.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.550
So I put her in my lap, and in
my wisest grandfatherly voice

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.830
explained to her that
it wasn't a good idea,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.370
explained to her all the
reasons why, a little bit,

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.970
in five-year-old
terms, the physiology

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.650
of why it wasn't good for
your tummy and all this stuff.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.066
And she listened
very thoughtfully

00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:29.690
and asked questions
and the like.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.220
And then I finished, and I said,
you do understand, sweetie,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.220
and she said, yeah.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.520
Now can I have a cookie?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.580
Everybody here knows what
I'm talking about, right?

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.470
We wake up in the morning.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.830
Today I'm going to eat better.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.310
And by lunch,
seemingly by itself,

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.730
our hand is going like
this with something

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.220
we're not supposed to be eating.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.600
There's something
about a dissonance

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.560
between what we know
we should be doing

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.119
and what we actually do, what
we know we should be thinking

00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:52.660
and what we actually think, what
we know we should be feeling

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.450
and what we actually feel.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.110
And we're understanding this
more and more in the mind.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.110
So I'm going to talk about five
basic functions and patterns

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.220
of the mind that impact these
things relative to bias.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.470
One is selective attention
or inattentional blindness,

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.925
projection, power and
empathy-- and this

00:16:09.925 --> 00:16:12.050
is something I'm really
excited about, because some

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.466
of the newest
research we're doing

00:16:13.466 --> 00:16:18.570
is around power and empathy--
social primacy, and finally,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.600
the subliminal.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.150
Because we know that a lot of
stuff is affected subliminally.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.420
Now let's start with this
guy, 2,500 years ago to Plato.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.690
Because how Western
thought is oriented

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:33.209
relative to emotion and
reason comes from Plato.

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:35.000
And there are probably
lots of other people

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.460
who were thinking that,
but Plato was certainly

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.740
the one who we remember.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.500
Plato, as some of you know
who remember Philosophy 101,

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.860
in his dialogues of
"Phaedrus" talked

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.150
about how reason was
like the charioteer who

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.540
held the raging emotions
of the horses in place.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.420
And we've built a
culture, particularly

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.980
in Western culture,
that worships

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.276
at the altar of the rational.

00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:57.650
If you think about
it, it's like,

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.710
are you sure you're being
rational about that?

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.450
You sure you're not
being too emotional?

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.200
It's really built into
our way of thinking

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.589
that one is better
than the other.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.700
It's kind of normal for
us to think that way.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.800
The only problem
is, it's counter

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.650
to what we're learning
about the brain.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.780
In fact, over 30
years of studying

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.750
emotional intelligence--
and I'm not

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.250
talking about
studying it at Esalen.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.249
I'm talking about some
of the major universities

00:17:18.249 --> 00:17:18.994
in the world.

00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:20.910
We've learned that
virtually all of the things

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.480
we do, whether making
decisions, strategy, behavior,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.849
performance, relationships,
all of these things

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:28.060
are fundamentally
governed by emotion.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.880
In fact, human beings
are far less rational

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.465
than we are rationalizing.

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:36.840
In other words, we have an
emotional or visceral reaction

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.570
to something, and
we quickly gather

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.334
the data to support
that feeling.

00:17:41.334 --> 00:17:43.750
So if I meet somebody, and I
have this moment where I say,

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.870
there's something about
that person I like.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.680
Now, even that
thought that we have

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.490
after five seconds
of meeting somebody

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.837
is folly if you give
it any thought of all.

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.670
I mean, how could it
possibly be about them?

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.380
I've only known them
for five seconds.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.421
So obviously I'm projecting
something on to them.

00:17:57.421 --> 00:17:59.999
They probably remind me
of somebody from my past.

00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:01.540
But nonetheless,
that's our response,

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.090
and then we act accordingly.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.610
And this shows up in interviews.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.107
So let's say Ana comes in in
the morning, and I meet you,

00:18:08.107 --> 00:18:09.940
and I have that feeling,
something about you

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.530
that I like, so I ask
you the first question

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.170
of the interview, and you
hem and haw a little bit.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.070
Without even
thinking about it, I

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.940
say, look, I know
it's an interview.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.431
Take a breath.

00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:18.680
Let me ask the question again.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.042
You get a second chance.

00:18:20.042 --> 00:18:21.250
Now the interview goes great.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.230
I'm making eye contact.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.160
I'm laughing at your
jokes, whatever.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.870
Will comes in in the afternoon.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.280
Let's say it's not even
one of those times when

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.321
my sleaze alarm goes off,
although that sometimes

00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:31.840
happens, not with
you, of course.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.610
But it sometimes happens.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.318
You meet somebody,
and they turn you off.

00:18:34.318 --> 00:18:38.230
But let's say it's more
that I'm distracted.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.930
I just got off a
meeting with a client.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.947
And it's still on my mind,
so I'm only half with you.

00:18:42.947 --> 00:18:45.030
And I ask you the first
question of the interview,

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.350
and this time, as you hem
and haw, I just sit there,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.430
or even worse, I make one of
those quick glances at my watch

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.410
that you're not supposed to see.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.800
And now you're sweating bullets.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.060
And based on nothing
more than that,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.435
the interview goes
two completely

00:18:54.435 --> 00:18:56.214
different directions.

00:18:56.214 --> 00:18:58.130
Elizabeth asks me the
next day, how did it go?

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.588
And I say, bright,
easy to talk to.

00:18:59.588 --> 00:19:01.380
I think she'd work
out fine here.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.360
He's OK.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.200
I have no idea,
no conscious idea,

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.370
that I had anything to
do with those interviews.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.745
Is there anybody
here who doesn't

00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:10.136
know that you do this to
people 25 times a day?

00:19:10.136 --> 00:19:12.260
Or you pass one person in
a hallway, you say hello,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.510
somebody else you don't.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.060
Subtleties, things that
are influencing us-- you

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.830
interview one person
in the morning when

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.420
you're fresh at your desk.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.390
You interview a
second person, even

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.400
using a structured
interviewing process,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.322
you interview a second
person over lunch,

00:19:25.322 --> 00:19:27.780
and you interview a third person
at the end of the day when

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.760
you're tired, and
you've actually

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.461
conducted three
different interviews.

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:31.960
Even though the
structured questions

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.570
are the same questions.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.749
So we're influenced by things
that we don't even realize.

00:19:36.749 --> 00:19:39.290
Now, we know, and people like
Danny Kahneman and other people

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.900
have taken us way ahead of this.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.145
I know that you've
studied this work,

00:19:42.145 --> 00:19:44.460
so I'm not going to spend a
lot of time talking about it.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.043
But we know that a
lot of this happens

00:19:46.043 --> 00:19:48.750
in the fast brain in
the limbic system.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.210
We see some circumstance
or some person.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.220
It catalyzes a
particular reaction

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.020
as we filter through the
background what we see.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.750
The faster, the emotional
brain, takes over.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.350
The amygdala sends a signal
to the hippocampus and says,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.287
what is this?

00:20:02.287 --> 00:20:03.870
And then to the
hypothalamus, the sort

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.500
of air traffic
controller of the brain,

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.100
which sends the signal to
someplace else and then maybe

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.800
to the anterior cingulate
cortex or the cingulate gyrus

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.547
and says, get that
foot or leg in action.

00:20:12.547 --> 00:20:14.880
If I were to take this clicker
and throw it to somebody,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.660
your hand would
come up to catch it

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.910
before you even had a thought.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.180
And this is all very important.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.240
Fast brain is very
helpful to us.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.250
It's where stereotyping happens.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.130
We see that person.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.879
We make that assessment,
smile-- friendly.

00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:29.900
Fist-- dangerous.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.301
Knife above the
head-- watch out.

00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:33.550
We know somebody comes up
with a knife above our head,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.680
we don't look up and
say, oh, what is that?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.790
I wonder what he's
going to do with it.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.830
It's not a very
practical way to operate.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.950
And similarly, when we
see certain behaviors,

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:47.340
we associate with that
Now, tremendously helpful,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.690
tremendously valuable,
and tremendously necessary

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.380
for our survival, also
tremendously problematic

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.120
in terms of making assumptions
about people at times.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.501
And this is the challenge
that we have that's coming up.

00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:02.000
In those circumstances, do we
really know what we're seeing,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.920
or are we reacting
to what we're seeing?

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.054
And we know times when
the mind and our eyes

00:21:06.054 --> 00:21:06.970
can even be deceiving.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.053
So for example, if you
look at this checkerboard--

00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:13.640
this is Ted Edelson,
who is at MIT.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.220
When you look at Block
A and Block B up here,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.926
which one is darker?

00:21:18.926 --> 00:21:20.222
AUDIENCE: A.

00:21:20.222 --> 00:21:21.930
HOWARD ROSS: Now, A
clearly looks darker,

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.971
and as some of you were
saying, what's the trick?

00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:25.710
But A clearly looks
darker, right?

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.115
In actuality, they're
exactly the same color.

00:21:29.115 --> 00:21:30.490
Now the reason it
looks darker is

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.850
because the eyes align around
a particular expectation.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.130
The cones and rods
actually align around,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.430
and we have an expectation.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.970
Pattern recognition is one of
the most familiar functions

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:41.845
of the human mind.

00:21:41.845 --> 00:21:44.470
And most of us are very familiar
with the light-dark-light-dark

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.730
pattern of a checkerboard.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.760
It's actually the same color,
because the shadowing area

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.672
created by the pillar darkens
B and makes it the same color.

00:21:52.672 --> 00:21:54.380
This is not a computer
trick, by the way.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.850
You can test it out yourself.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.720
Dr. Edelson has this
available online.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.930
So you can look at it.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.412
So we're making this
assumption that they're

00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:03.120
different when actually
they're the same.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.040
Now the fascinating thing
about this one to me

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.340
is even though we now
know they're the same,

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.980
they still look different.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.330
Isn't that extraordinary?

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.580
You would think that if our
rational mind was actually

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.390
leading the way,
that now that we

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.960
know they're the same that we
would see them as the same.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.760
But it's an indication
of how we're

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.356
rooted into these very kinds
of things that trigger us

00:22:23.356 --> 00:22:24.480
in ways that we don't know.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.230
And the same thing can
happen with people.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.910
Now even know I
know that I should

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.000
treat that person the
same as I treat somebody

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.319
else, my visceral
feeling about that person

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:35.860
can still in very subtle ways--
so I know you've been dealing

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.150
with micro behaviors, micro
advantages, micro inequities

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.940
that play out through the
various ways this happens.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.440
Who do I invite to lunch?

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.026
Who do I pay more attention to?

00:22:45.026 --> 00:22:46.650
We know, for example,
from the research

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.900
we're doing with power that
people in power situations

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.680
tend to make less eye contact
when they're listening

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.642
and more eye contact
when they're speaking.

00:22:55.642 --> 00:22:57.600
It shows up a lot in
male-female relationships,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.440
particularly, that men have a
tendency, because societally--

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.620
it's not a personal power, but
societally it plays itself out

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.380
that men will pay
more attention,

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.120
give more eye contact when we're
speaking and less eye contact

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.567
when we're listening to women.

00:23:10.567 --> 00:23:12.650
And I'm talking now
archetypically, of course, not

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.230
about every man and every woman.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.700
So these are subtleties
that can play out in ways.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.527
And then, of course, we then
associate certain things,

00:23:19.527 --> 00:23:21.360
so projection becomes
another piece of this.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.060
Projection is simply
the dynamic that

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.800
has us look out
there in the world

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.640
and determine what that is
based on a prior experience

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.750
or prior knowledge of what
that thing is we're looking at.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.370
To some degree, we project
in every circumstance

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.660
with everything we're doing.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.350
If I look at that form in
front of me, I know it's a man,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.380
because in my mind, I say,
oh, that's what men look like.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.770
Otherwise everything that we
see would be newly experienced.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:51.460
And we know this occurs in
the brain in the hippocampus.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.180
And how it might show up,
for example, when diversity

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.729
is concerned-- I'll
use an example.

00:23:55.729 --> 00:23:57.770
I grew up in the "Leave
it to Beaver" generation.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.212
I know a lot of
you probably don't

00:23:59.212 --> 00:24:00.670
know what "Leave
it to Beaver" was,

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.712
but it was one of those
sitcoms of the '60s and '70s.

00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:04.670
They were all the same.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.030
Dad went off to
work in the morning

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.404
with his briefcase
and a suit on.

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:09.760
Mom stayed home and did
all the domestic chores

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.560
in her pearls and
high heels I thought

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.962
that was bizarre even
when I was a kid.

00:24:13.962 --> 00:24:16.170
Nonetheless, the kids would
do something mischievous,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.503
and dad would come home and
solve the family's problems.

00:24:18.503 --> 00:24:21.020
This was the sitcom
MO of the 1960s

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.530
and early '70s, all
virtually the same.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.650
So if one grew up
in that generation,

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.630
then probably on an
unconscious level,

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.380
you have some association
between the role

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.770
of women and domestic
responsibility.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.670
Now, you're sitting
in a meeting,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.590
and the vice president of
production, Jane Smith,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.780
walks in.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.970
And without even thinking
about it, you turn to Jane

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.720
and say, Jane, can you go check
and see if we have any coffee?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.130
Because at that moment Jane
Smith becomes June Cleaver.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.520
Now, another dynamic of this,
which is really important,

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.740
is to recognize
that Jane may also

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.370
herself say, let me go see if
there's any coffee, because she

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.030
may also have internalized the
responsibility of being June

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.622
Cleaver.

00:25:02.622 --> 00:25:04.080
And this is really
important for us

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.950
to get, that we internalize
these same dynamics

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.290
about ourselves,
expectations about ourselves,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.140
as other people have about us.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.660
We're constantly
projecting on each other.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.930
It's one of the most
foundational pieces of the way

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.480
we look at each other
as human beings.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.000
And so that's all happening
on a fast brain level.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.780
And now we know we
also have this capacity

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.720
for slow brain thinking, the
prefrontal cortex, of course,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.470
this remarkable part of the
human brain, which allows

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.576
us to have thoughts like, hm,
what made me think about that?

00:25:32.576 --> 00:25:34.950
Any of us who have had dogs
and put them out the backyard

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.574
know when they see the squirrel,
it doesn't seem like they say,

00:25:37.574 --> 00:25:39.490
should I chase that squirrel?

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.060
Human beings do
have that capacity.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.780
Now, we don't always use
that capacity, of course,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.340
but we do have the capacity
to have those thoughts.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.120
And this remarkable
capacity of the human brain

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.440
to have this kind of thinking
makes us extraordinary.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.470
However, when we know that
when something triggers us,

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.890
triggers that limbic
fast brain reaction,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.630
that part of the brain
tends to lose its power.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.144
In fact, we can look
at that brain scans

00:26:05.144 --> 00:26:07.560
and see the blood actually
flows back to the limbic system

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.660
and leaves the
prefrontal cortex.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.792
Daniel Goleman called
this amygdala hijacking.

00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:14.250
The amygdala takes
over the system.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.290
And this is where are kind
of fear reactions come from.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.270
Amygdala hijacking puts us back
into fight, flight, or freeze,

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.400
sort of more basic,
instinctive reactions.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.210
Freud said that the conscious,
or the more thoughtful,

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.960
part of our brain
was the iceberg,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.060
and the unconscious, the
largest part, underneath.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.880
But current research shows
that the conscious is more

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.760
like a snowball on the
tip of the iceberg,

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.740
that virtually everything we
do is governed by unconscious.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.945
In fact, the fast
brain probably operates

00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:44.260
a couple hundred thousand times
more than the slow brain does.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.310
So we're constantly making
these determinations,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.100
which we're then rationalizing.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.710
The net of all this is
that as Bucky Fuller said,

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.200
99% of who you are is
invisible and untouchable.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.700
Or as my friend
Sukhvinder Obhi, who

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.729
is a brain scientist
in Canada, says,

00:26:58.729 --> 00:27:01.020
"Our brains seem to have
evolved to be good enough most

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.440
of the time."

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.530
Now, this is a bit
threatening to smart people.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.030
This is why here
at Google, you have

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.140
to be particularly careful
about this, because when we've

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.900
been rewarded our whole
life for being smart,

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.310
we begin to believe
and have confidence

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.020
that our opinion, what we
see, makes more sense than it

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.172
actually does.

00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:19.630
And I'm going to
talk a little more

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.260
about that in just a little bit.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.552
So this creates diagnosis
bias, the tendency

00:27:24.552 --> 00:27:26.510
to spot things and
determine it really quickly.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.100
Diagnosis bias, we might
say, is the propensity

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.490
to label people,
ideas, or things

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.320
based on our initial opinions.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.460
So I want you to
imagine, for example,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.420
that you've got a grown son.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.470
And your son says, I'm going
to bring my love interest home,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.760
my new love interest home,
or son or daughter will say.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.260
And they say, we're going to
bring our new love interest

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:48.899
home.

00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:50.690
And these are the two
people whose pictures

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.145
you see about possibly
being the love interest.

00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:55.020
Who would you be more
inclined to hope it is?

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.952
Well, this on the left
is John Fetterman.

00:27:59.952 --> 00:28:01.660
He's the mayor of
Braddock, Pennsylvania.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.242
That's his zip code on his arm.

00:28:03.242 --> 00:28:04.950
He has a Master's
degree in public policy

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.942
from Harvard, served
in AmeriCorps,

00:28:06.942 --> 00:28:08.900
and he's done amazing
things about transforming

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.380
his community financially,
goes around the country

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.919
now, apparently training
other communities to do this.

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:15.460
This is Ted Bundy,
the serial killer.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.950
[LAUGHING]

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.450
We make these
determinations having

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.840
nothing to do with rationality.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.280
This is just who we
are and what we do.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.224
And this leads to
particular reaction.

00:28:28.224 --> 00:28:30.390
Those reactions come from
a couple different places.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.060
Amy Cuddy and Susan
Fisk and Peter Glick

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.590
have identified
this in two ways.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.100
One is how warmly, how
likable that person is,

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.500
and the other is how
competent we hold them.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.400
And this can show
up in lots of ways.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.480
We can feel very
warmly towards somebody

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.650
and not respect them
and their competence.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.940
This happens, of course,
sometimes with people

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.200
who are elderly people or
people with disabilities,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.470
that sort of thing, also
with certain other groups

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.630
where we like them,
it's just we don't even

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.132
realize because we like
them so much how much we're

00:29:01.132 --> 00:29:01.840
diminishing them.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.550
This is where patronizing
liberalism can come from also.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.930
Or we see them as competent, we
just don't like them so much.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.667
This is a lot what
LGBT folks face.

00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:14.000
It's not that people don't
think that they're competent,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.205
it's just that they
may be competent,

00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:18.697
but I'm just not comfortable
with them, somebody might say.

00:29:18.697 --> 00:29:21.030
So it's important for us to
be able to distinguish that,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.780
because it gives us a
better handle on how

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.720
this might play out
in different places.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.020
Another of these phenomenas
is selective attention.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.160
And selective attention
is one that we all know.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.300
In fact, [INAUDIBLE] and
I were talking recently.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.800
He said, you know, I
noticed when I found out

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.620
my wife was pregnant, all
of a sudden the next day

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.690
I was out and began to
notice baby strollers

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:39.812
in a different way.

00:29:39.812 --> 00:29:41.770
And I began to go up to
people and say, tell me

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.834
how come that baby stroller
has this versus that.

00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:45.250
He said, my whole
life, I've never

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.510
had any interest
in baby strollers,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.020
but one thing happens, and boom.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.320
All of a sudden I see the
world in a different way.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.370
We know that we see that.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.960
Now, we've had some really
fascinating research

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.667
about this.

00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:57.250
We're doing some work with the
American Association of Medical

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.810
Colleges training people
in medical schools

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.230
to be more sensitive to how
unconscious bias plays out

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.090
in things like
health disparities.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.410
And this study came from there.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.950
This guy [INAUDIBLE] at
Harvard Medical School sent out

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.160
to radiologists a
lung scan, asked

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.400
them to check for cancer
nodes, which are tiny,

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.879
tiny, microscopic things.

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.920
But there's something
interesting about this lung

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.420
scan.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.450
Do you see it up here?

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.900
This grill is a
little highlighted

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.691
so you can see it a
little bit more than it

00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:25.310
was in the original picture.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.560
You want to get really scared?

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.450
83% of the radiologists
didn't see it.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.815
Cancer nodes are about
1/50 of that size.

00:30:32.815 --> 00:30:33.940
They were looking for this.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.340
They didn't see this.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.729
It's remarkable
how this happens.

00:30:37.729 --> 00:30:39.270
And it happens in
lots of other ways.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.520
Now one particular
case, a legal case

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.650
that this happened in, Kenneth
Conley was a police officer who

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.470
was convicted in 1997 of
perjury because he was chasing

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:53.120
a perpetrator of a crime,
ran right past somebody

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.000
who was being beaten up,
and denied seeing them.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.580
And the court didn't
believe him, basically.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.830
He was convicted of the crime.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.750
Now, he was
eventually exonerated.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.330
Two researchers, Daniel
Simons and Chris Chabris,

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.706
who some of you are familiar
with because of their gorilla,

00:31:07.706 --> 00:31:10.810
the invisible gorilla exercise
that they were very well known

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.960
for, and they've been
really brilliantly

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.190
out front of this whole
inattentional blindness

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.110
conversation, re-created
the experiment.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.715
They had students
run around a campus.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.220
One student was following
another students

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:24.710
as they were running.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.085
And the student
in front was told

00:31:26.085 --> 00:31:28.270
to touch his cap routinely.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.980
And the student behind
was told to count

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.510
the number of times
they touched the cap.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.490
While this was
happening, they actually

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.849
ran past a simulated fight.

00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:40.390
And then they checked how many
people actually saw the fight.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.270
They found only 1/3 people
noticed the fight at night,

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.670
which was the conditions
the actual crime occurred,

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.237
and only 40% noticed
it in broad daylight.

00:31:49.237 --> 00:31:51.320
In other words, when we're
attentive to one thing,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.910
we always miss other things.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.610
We can't see
everything, so we see

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.090
the things we're focused on.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.360
This is why so often
when we're in meetings,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.040
one person will see
a certain something,

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.206
and somebody else will say,
well, I didn't see that.

00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:04.930
And we have a tendency, because
of that good person-bad person

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.029
paradigm where
diversity is concerned,

00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:09.070
to assume that that means
that people didn't care

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:13.010
about it, when in fact they
just may not have seen it.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.810
So this is the nature
of how it plays out.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.400
Now we also know we're
influenced subliminally.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.560
So for example, University
of Leicester researchers

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.592
recently went into a
wine shop, actually

00:32:22.592 --> 00:32:24.800
a grocery store, the wine
department, cleared it out,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.910
put only French
and German wine on.

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.320
On alternative days, they played
French muzak, German muzak,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.100
or put a French glad
and a German flag up.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.500
And then tracked
buying patterns.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.960
On days that the French flag
was up, 77% bought French wine.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.400
On days when German fly was
up, 73% bought German wines.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.010
Only 14% said they
even heard the music,

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.530
and only one person
in the entire study

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.847
said that they actually
thought it influenced them.

00:32:53.847 --> 00:32:55.180
Another one from medical school.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.260
At University of
Toronto medical school,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.834
they tracked the results of
medical school interviews

00:32:59.834 --> 00:33:01.500
against the weather
reports from the day

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.430
that people were
interviewed, put it

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.970
in parallel, found that the
people who were interviewed

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.980
on rainy days received
scores in the interview

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.521
as roughly equivalent
to as if they'd

00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:12.210
had 10% lower scores
on their MCATs.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.710
Nobody thinks a medical school
interviewer says, it's rainy,

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.950
I'm going to cut 10 points
off, but nonetheless.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.949
So these things are
influencing us all the time.

00:33:18.949 --> 00:33:21.980
The question is, of course,
what's influencing us today?

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.240
What's impacting us today?

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.070
And then, as I said before, lot
of the new research we're doing

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.820
is around power and
empathy, because we're

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.450
learning some
fascinating things.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.450
I'm sure that many of you know
about the findings on mirror

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:38.230
neurons, that back in the late
'90s in Parma, Italy, in a lab,

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.370
they determined mirror
neurons in macaque monkeys.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:44.080
They realized that these monkeys
tended to have the same brain

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.390
experience when they watched
a researcher eating peanuts

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.370
as when they were eating
peanuts themselves, remarkable.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.970
Marco Iacoboni at UCLA later
identified this in human beings

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:54.470
as well.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.110
So we have this
remarkable capacity

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.227
to mirror people who are
around us and to sense

00:33:59.227 --> 00:34:00.310
what's going on around us.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.760
It creates a phenomenon we
call homophily, the tendency

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.230
to love the same, to love
people who are like us.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.350
But we also know that
we have a tendency

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:10.774
for in group/out group bias.

00:34:10.774 --> 00:34:12.440
And we've known this
for over 100 years.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.630
William Graham Sumner,
the first director

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.545
of the department of
sociology at Yale University,

00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:18.920
determined this
way back in 1906.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.489
And we're constantly pulled
between this tendency

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.090
to want to resonate
with people and this

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.550
in group/out group bias.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.750
And it shows up in non-dominant
and dominant groups.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.540
So people in
dominant groups will

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.219
tend to have less
mirroring than people

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.560
who are in non-dominant groups.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.670
Those in power will
tend to mirror less

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.719
than those who are out of power.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.250
And that's true
both individually,

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.290
when we're power holders
in organizations,

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.340
that is, managers versus
non management, for example,

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.989
and it's also true when
we're in power groups.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.880
So the dominant
groups in society,

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.050
for example in American
society, white male Christian

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:58.820
heterosexual, that we'll have
a tendency to mirror less,

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.470
to sense what's going
on with people less.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.850
We also know that where
empathy is concerned,

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.440
that what the research
shows, and this is research

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.440
from China, from
the US, from Italy,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.440
from all over the
world, that shows us

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.247
that we tend to have
less empathy as soon

00:35:13.247 --> 00:35:15.080
as we spot people who
are different from us,

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.407
and the first classification
for that is race, that we'll

00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:19.490
tend to have less empathy.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.150
Now, let's put
this in the context

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.210
of traditional
diversity training.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.530
A lot of the training that
we did over the years,

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.950
and I go back way back to the
time of the early diversity

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.300
training where we used to
do it with a two-by-four.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.580
A lot of it was advocacy work
or letting people understand

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.492
what it's like to be a member
of this group or that group.

00:35:37.492 --> 00:35:39.200
Ironically, what the
brain science is now

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.199
teaching us is that may make us
less empathetic for the people

00:35:42.199 --> 00:35:42.990
we're dealing with.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.880
It doesn't mean that you
can't control people that way.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.650
You can get people to be
careful about what they say.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.410
But to get people
fully engaged, it

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.500
may be actually
counter-indicated

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.430
to what we're trying to
accomplish, maybe well

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.180
intentioned, but
counter-indicated to what

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.049
we're trying to accomplish.

00:35:59.049 --> 00:36:00.590
AUDIENCE: What's
the reason for that?

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.290
HOWARD ROSS: Is because
as soon as I identify you

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.100
as somebody different
from me, my empathy center

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.640
begins to slow down.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.660
I can now be careful around you,
be careful not to upset you,

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.600
but I'm less likely
to resonate with you.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.380
I'm less likely to actually
be fully engaged with you.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.420
And so it may be good for
controlling diversity,

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.875
but may be not so good
for creating inclusion

00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:21.500
in that regard.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.764
It's ironic, because--
at some level,

00:36:24.764 --> 00:36:26.680
it was what we needed
to do in the early days,

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.340
because it's like the sculptor
with the big block of stone.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.620
You take the big chisel
to start to do the work.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.286
But from the standpoint
of organizations

00:36:33.286 --> 00:36:35.872
who really want to create full
inclusion-- and we were just

00:36:35.872 --> 00:36:37.580
talking about this
relative, for example,

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.450
to when you're working, for
example on gender dynamics,

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:43.714
if you only work with
women in gender dynamics,

00:36:43.714 --> 00:36:46.130
you likely are not going to
get the same kind of inclusion

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.020
as if you work with men and
women around gender dynamics,

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.560
as an example.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.272
Sukhvinder and
his research found

00:36:52.272 --> 00:36:53.730
that it turned out
that when people

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.365
were in a powerless
mindset, their mirroring

00:36:56.365 --> 00:36:57.240
system was increased.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.450
They became more sensitive
to external stimulus.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.830
Whereas people who
are feeling powerful,

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.454
the mirror-neuron
activation was lower.

00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:05.030
Power, it turns out,
decreases empathy.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:08.677
Is there anything we
can do about this?

00:37:08.677 --> 00:37:11.260
I want to talk about this on an
individual level real quickly,

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.260
and then I also want to talk
with you about systemically

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.635
what are some things we're
learning we can do about this,

00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:18.510
because we're now working with
companies all over the world

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.390
to try to have them develop
cultures that are more

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.720
inclusive understanding
these issues.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.430
So the first is to understand
that the unconscious is

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.230
remarkably malleable,
that we've got

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.492
this remarkable capacity
for neuroplasticity.

00:37:30.492 --> 00:37:32.700
The notion that you can't
teach an old dog new tricks

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.080
isn't even true for dogs.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.270
We're constantly
learning new things.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:40.000
The first and by far the most
important thing of these three

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.330
six ways that we're finding
for individuals to work

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.580
is to recognize and
accept that you have bias,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.220
to remove guilt
from the equation

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.919
and start taking responsibility.

00:37:47.919 --> 00:37:50.460
Now this is hard, because a lot
of the diversity conversation

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.820
is lived in guilt.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.652
And that's challenging,
this notion if I have bias,

00:37:55.652 --> 00:37:56.860
oh, my God, I'm a bad person.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.990
I thought I was a better
person, but I'm a bad person.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.740
But in actuality, if
we can't choose that,

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.450
if 90 plus percent
of the things that

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.090
happen every day
in organizations

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.350
that differentially impact
one person versus another

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.570
occur more like what I talked
about in this interview

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.910
than they do because
somebody's out to get somebody,

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.750
it's challenging for us to
accept that in ourselves

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.130
and work with it.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.030
The metaphor I like
to use is it's kind

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:22.120
of like the clutch in a standard
transmission automobile.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.870
When the standard
transmission automobile,

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.700
you step on the clutch, the
engine doesn't stop running.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.262
It just stops motoring the car.

00:38:28.262 --> 00:38:30.470
So this is where mindfulness
work can really come in,

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.330
learning self-observation work
can really come in to help us.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.040
We can begin to notice
the bias in ourselves.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.386
But by noticing it with
nonjudgmental awareness,

00:38:40.386 --> 00:38:41.760
we can say, OK,
I have that bias.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.090
I need to watch how that
impacts my interaction

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.000
with this person.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.559
But that is fundamentally
built on the notion

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:49.350
that we can create
environments in which we

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.697
can talk about those biases.

00:38:50.697 --> 00:38:52.780
And we know that we live
in a cultural environment

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.860
where that's not
welcomed right now.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.800
It's dangerous.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.220
It has legal implications,
particularly.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.239
So that can be
really problematic.

00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:02.530
And that's why the second is
most important, to develop

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.280
the capacity to-- well, we
call it using a flashlight

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.840
on ourselves.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.790
My friend Michael
[? Sheeser ?] coined that term,

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.445
to watch ourselves in action.

00:39:10.445 --> 00:39:12.320
Are there certain people
who trigger us more?

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.050
Are there certain
circumstances in which

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.560
we feel a little antsy?

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.410
Are there certain ways
of being that cause

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.810
us to make quick
reactions more easily?

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.769
And by the way, this
piece is really important,

00:39:24.769 --> 00:39:26.393
especially for
Googlers, because you've

00:39:26.393 --> 00:39:27.790
got so many smart people here.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.915
How much does intelligence,
confidence, and success

00:39:29.915 --> 00:39:31.090
matter to this?

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.310
Well, actually what
the research now shows

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.360
is that people who are
intelligent, successful,

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.770
and highly confident are
more likely rather than

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.700
less likely to have blind spots.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.050
The more you feel like
you've got this handled,

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.050
the more dangerous it becomes.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.980
It requires an enormous
sense of humility,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.720
and I say this all the time to
my colleagues in the diversity

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.095
space, that we
have to be careful

00:39:52.095 --> 00:39:54.360
that we don't come in like
our stuff don't smell,

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.792
like we don't have this issue.

00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:59.250
The reason I started
with the story

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.174
about myself and the
angry Santa Claus

00:40:01.174 --> 00:40:03.590
was because even though I've
been doing this for 30 years,

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.419
I'm still just as susceptible
to bias as anybody else is.

00:40:06.419 --> 00:40:07.960
Now hopefully we
can get to the place

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.200
where we can notice it
more and embrace it more.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.480
But as you take this
work out, you're

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.105
going to have to be careful that
all the great work you've done

00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:16.520
doesn't reaffirm, OK, now
that we've got this handled,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.070
we don't have to
keep looking at it.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.260
And this is particularly
challenging in environments

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:20.830
like yours.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.700
It requires us practicing
constructive uncertainty,

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.144
to really take a pause.

00:40:26.144 --> 00:40:27.560
Rollo May, the
great psychologist,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.184
said, "Freedom is
the capacity to pause

00:40:29.184 --> 00:40:31.210
between stimulus and response."

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.970
So we've created
this little mnemonic.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:38.530
The P is to Pay attention
to what's actually

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.796
happening beneath our
judgments and assessments.

00:40:40.796 --> 00:40:43.170
And then the second is to
Acknowledge your own reactions,

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.816
interpretations, and judgments.

00:40:44.816 --> 00:40:47.190
The third is to Understand
other potential reactions that

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.960
might be there.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.335
And then to Select
the one that's

00:40:49.335 --> 00:40:50.950
the most empowering
in the environment.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.116
And finally to Execute that.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.630
So I go back to Will
and my handshake.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.612
He shakes my hand,
and its softer.

00:40:56.612 --> 00:40:58.570
He says, OK, I noticed
his handshake is softer.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.701
I notice that I have
a tendency, let's say,

00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:01.950
to interpret that as weakness.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:02.830
I've got to be
careful about that.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:04.210
He could have an injury.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.860
At that moment, he's now
thinking from here rather than

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.880
from over there.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.619
That's a moment of freedom.

00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:11.910
That's when we have the moment
to make a determination,

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.580
potentially, about what's
going on with that person.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.100
To explore awkwardness and
discomfort-- those times

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.350
when something's off, rather
than to back away from it

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.410
and search to comfort, say,
what's triggering me here?

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.960
What's making me uncomfortable?

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.150
The fifth is to
engage with people

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.800
you consider to be others and
expose yourself to exemplars.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.364
So this is really interesting.

00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:33.030
Brian [INAUDIBLE] and
Calvin [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.030
at the University of
Virginia just last year

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.850
issued a paper
where they studied

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.480
a whole host of
attempts that people

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.070
had to soften the
impact of bias and found

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.740
that this was by far the most
valuable one, the things you

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.920
have on the wall, the
images that you see,

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.680
the various kinds of things
that reinforce what's good,

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.719
what's not good.

00:41:51.719 --> 00:41:53.510
This is why things like
Black History Month

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.930
are so valuable still, even
though they would be a lot more

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.180
valuable if the 11 months
weren't White History Month,

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.760
and if we didn't choose
the shortest month of year

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.551
to be Black History
Month, which has always

00:42:02.551 --> 00:42:04.080
been kind of interesting.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.620
But those kinds of things
do reinforce a softening

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.940
or a shifting of those biases.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.650
And then finally, giving
and getting feedback--

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.150
and I know that you're working
a lot on that in your culture

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:14.234
right now, that being
able to give feedback.

00:42:14.234 --> 00:42:15.900
But it's important
that that feedback be

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.531
given in a compassionate
way, and that

00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:21.030
is with an understanding that
that person's behavior may not

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:24.320
have been intentional,
especially where diversity

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.080
issues are concerned, because
if that feedback reinforces

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.464
the finger-pointing
aspect of it,

00:42:28.464 --> 00:42:30.380
then it just drives it
back underground again.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.280
People begin to go into hiding
rather than simply engage

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.700
in that behavior.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.930
And the last piece as
we look at the group

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.539
is understanding social primacy.

00:42:38.539 --> 00:42:41.080
I mean, we're all familiar with
Maslow's hierarchy, I'm sure.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.380
Abraham Maslow 70
years ago said you

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.070
had to get basic needs met
before you get other needs met.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:47.960
He said physiological
needs met first then

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.240
safety and onward,
brilliant model,

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.630
tremendously helpful to science.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.450
It appears that he
may have been wrong,

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.690
that in fact our need
for belongingness

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.990
may be a key human need.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.830
And it makes sense if you think
about a newborn baby can't

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.340
get their
physiological needs met

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.250
unless they belong to somebody.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.610
The first imprint that
we have as human beings

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.260
is, I only exist because
he or she exists.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.820
And this is core
to us, this sense.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.956
And in fact, what
science is now showing

00:43:17.956 --> 00:43:19.330
is that being
excluded from group

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.871
triggers activity in the same
regions of the brain associated

00:43:21.871 --> 00:43:23.880
with physical pain,
which is why every time

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.620
one of these horrible instances
happen, whether it's Columbine

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.280
or Sandy Hook or this terrible
thing that happened in Southern

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.150
California a couple months
ago, what's the first word you

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.470
almost always hear to
describe the perpetrator?

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:36.310
AUDIENCE: Loner.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.070
HOWARD ROSS: Loner, exactly.

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.302
It also probably
contributes to the fact

00:43:40.302 --> 00:43:42.510
that four times as many gay
teenagers commit suicide,

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.660
because it gets internalized.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.430
And so we have to
recognize that how

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.010
we operate as a group
has a huge impact on us.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.230
And this is why what
you're taking on,

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.049
training the entire
organization,

00:43:53.049 --> 00:43:54.090
could have a huge impact.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.714
We have to change
systems so that we're

00:43:55.714 --> 00:43:57.590
thinking from a
systems perspective.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:00.665
Now, just to give you an
example of that, a lot of you

00:44:00.665 --> 00:44:02.890
know that in 1970,
5% of musicians

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.890
in the major orchestras
in the world were women,

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:08.510
and even after 1980, after 10
years of the women's movement,

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.970
it was still only 12%.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.710
But now it's getting
close to 40%.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.890
And why is that?

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:15.720
Because orchestras
around the world

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.787
put in a whole host
of activities designed

00:44:18.787 --> 00:44:20.120
to change the way they did that.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.350
They opened up
auditions to people.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.976
They changed the way
auditions were calibrated

00:44:24.976 --> 00:44:26.350
in terms of the
numbers of people

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.450
who are on the listening team.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.370
And they also did
something structurally,

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.510
which is to have musicians
begin to audition

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.880
behind screens and on rugs so
that people could only evaluate

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.029
the music rather
than the musician.

00:44:39.029 --> 00:44:40.820
Well, you can begin to
do things like that.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.388
On the other hand, we have
to be careful to understand,

00:44:43.388 --> 00:44:45.846
to track things over time--
how many people here have heard

00:44:45.846 --> 00:44:47.210
if the Scared Straight program?

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:48.000
Anybody?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.430
Scared Straight was
initiated in the late 1970s

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.090
in Rahway, New
Jersey, in a prison.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:56.040
They started bringing in young,
what they called in those days

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.902
juvenile delinquents-- we now
call them youth offenders--

00:44:59.902 --> 00:45:01.360
bring them in with
tough prisoners.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.693
And the tough prisoners would
scare the hell out of them

00:45:03.693 --> 00:45:06.280
and tell them, we'll do
this to you and that to you

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280
if you come into prison.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.680
And they'd leave and you
could see them on film.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.900
"60 Minutes" did a piece on it.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.441
You'd see them and
they said, I don't

00:45:11.441 --> 00:45:13.389
want to go to prison.
[MOCK CRYING] So great,

00:45:13.389 --> 00:45:15.680
everybody started copying
it. "Orange is the New Black"

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.820
even had an episode about it.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.250
25 years later, they
evaluated these programs.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.430
Do you know what they found?

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.280
13% more likely to go to jail.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.020
[LAUGHING]

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.300
Now, my hypothesis
about this, because I've

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.670
worked with a lot of
young people like that,

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.360
is that most of
them feel powerless.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.340
And their bravado is on top of
that feeling of powerlessness.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.550
You put somebody who feels
powerless in with somebody

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.008
who's the toughest
SOB they've ever

00:45:39.008 --> 00:45:41.400
seen before, their
internal mechanism says,

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.799
if I act like that,
then I'll be safe.

00:45:43.799 --> 00:45:45.340
So we have to be
really careful as we

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.595
put these things in place.

00:45:46.595 --> 00:45:47.970
So what we're
starting to look at

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:50.560
is three basic ways of
doing organizational change

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.060
around this.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.330
The first is priming.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.050
What kinds of things
do you have people

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.720
look at before they come
into a circumstance?

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.664
So for example, before
people look at resumes,

00:45:59.664 --> 00:46:01.080
take a few minutes
and say, I want

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.400
you to answer these
eight questions.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.060
Does this resume
remind you of anybody?

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.840
Is that a positive
or a negative memory?

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.080
Is there something
about his resume

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.010
that jumps out at you
particularly strongly?

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.900
Is that really
relevant to the job?

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.080
Does this person remind
you of yourself in any way?

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.840
Is that relevant to the job?

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.690
So questions that
begin to orient.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:20.864
Now there's two things.

00:46:20.864 --> 00:46:22.280
First of all, it
actually gets you

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.210
to look at the resume
in a particular way.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:26.550
And by the way, all of this
follows some basic education

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.750
work around this issue.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.220
But secondly, and
more importantly,

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.630
it reminds me, wait a second.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:32.680
I've got to pay more
attention to the evaluator

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.020
than I do to the resume.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.750
And just that recognition, that
awareness, is really important.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.170
So there are dozens of ways
that we can look at priming

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.878
and have started to
work with our clients

00:46:40.878 --> 00:46:44.600
around priming so that they
come into these questions,

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.070
into these various structures,
in particular ways.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.367
The second way is to look
at systems and structures.

00:46:49.367 --> 00:46:50.950
So we just saw a
good example of that.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:53.230
When you have people
do their audition

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.230
behind a screen, that's a
different system or structure.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.650
Where interviewing is
concerned, for example,

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.350
do you use structured
interviewing but also conduct

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.350
interviews in the same place
or at the same time of day?

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:07.126
Before you do the interviews,
do you give people, potentially,

00:47:07.126 --> 00:47:09.750
the questions that they're going
to be asked so that people who

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.930
are introverted versus
extroverted, or people who

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.638
come from different
cultures, or for whom

00:47:13.638 --> 00:47:15.059
English is their
second language,

00:47:15.059 --> 00:47:17.350
aren't at a disadvantage in
terms of quickly responding

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:18.940
to those questions.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:22.010
So we can look at all
kinds of ways to do that.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.480
The third is, of
course, accountability.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.930
And that is, what
are we tracking?

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:27.310
What are the numbers
we're tracking?

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:28.810
Kohneman said, "The
odds of limiting

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.080
the constraints of
biases in a group setting

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.130
rise when discussion
of them is widespread."

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.090
So that you're talking
about it a lot actually

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.660
will encourage people to
take it more seriously.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.960
Now, if that becomes
yeah, yeah, yeah

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.544
in the background,
that's the problem.

00:47:42.544 --> 00:47:44.126
The problem is, how
do we keep talking

00:47:44.126 --> 00:47:45.650
about it in new
and different ways?

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.441
How do we keep keeping
it fresh for people?

00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:51.292
Because at some point, it
becomes like the wallpaper.

00:47:51.292 --> 00:47:52.750
You look at the
mountains out here,

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.150
these beautiful
mountains, and most of you

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.780
probably don't even
notice them anymore

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.321
if you've been coming
here every day,

00:47:57.321 --> 00:47:59.890
because they become like the
wallpaper in the background.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.140
And even though they were
extraordinary and beautiful

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.860
the first time you saw them, at
some point they're just there.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.150
So we have to keep this
conversation fresh.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.590
So we're looking at a
whole range of things.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.170
We look in talent
management, how

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:14.900
do we recruit, outsource,
interview, hire, onboard,

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.270
mentor, and sponsor,
performance review, calibration,

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.602
recognizing talent, developing,
promoting that talent?

00:48:19.602 --> 00:48:21.060
What are the things
that contribute

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.370
to all of those kinds of things?

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:23.745
We're looking at
the various ways

00:48:23.745 --> 00:48:26.670
that people operate internally,
interpersonal interactions,

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.680
collaboration, leadership,
team functionality, creativity,

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.394
and innovation.

00:48:30.394 --> 00:48:32.560
How does it contribute to
all those kinds of things,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.580
and finally to the external
relationship that we have?

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.170
And in each of
these areas, you can

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.640
begin to put in
place little tweaks.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.477
One of my colleagues in Europe
calls them inclusion nudges,

00:48:43.477 --> 00:48:45.060
a little nudge that
has people looking

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.784
in this direction
or that direction

00:48:46.784 --> 00:48:48.950
so that we can begin to
say, OK, let's stop and look

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.050
at this process.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.300
Now, in order to do that,
we've got to slow down.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.050
We've got to build pauses
into our processes.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.180
We've got to be able to ask,
is this process actually

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.504
doing what we think it's doing?

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:02.420
Are there factors here
that are influencing us

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.420
that we don't know that
are influencing us?

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.720
And this is, of course,
anathemous sometimes

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.370
to most American
business cultures.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:14.640
You see, even if we do all
of this, we're in danger.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.610
Even if we put all the
right systems in place,

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.129
we can be in danger of
not being very effective.

00:49:20.129 --> 00:49:21.920
I've struggled with my
weight my whole life

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.250
up until the last few years.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.429
I've been 30 or 40 pounds
heavier than I am now.

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:27.720
And if you look at the weight
chart for most of my life

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.280
up until about three years
ago when I became vegan,

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.980
it's been like this.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.397
And during all that
time when I was heavy,

00:49:35.397 --> 00:49:37.480
I knew everything there
was to know about dieting.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.910
I promise you, I read
every diet book there was.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.730
I tried every fad diet
there was, and not

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:42.855
like it's that hard anyway.

00:49:42.855 --> 00:49:45.059
You eat less and you
exercise more, right?

00:49:45.059 --> 00:49:46.600
I'm sure everybody
here has something

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.974
like that in your
life, something

00:49:47.974 --> 00:49:50.310
you know you should be
doing but you don't do.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:53.270
There's something beyond
developing strategies.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.740
And that is developing new
awarenesses for the way

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.674
we think.

00:49:56.674 --> 00:49:58.090
This is what you
have the capacity

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.750
to do here in what
you're trying to do

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:01.650
with your unconscious
bias process,

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.650
and that is to really
shift our way of thinking.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.650
It's scary to us
as human beings.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.640
Because if we really understand
what this stuff is teaching us,

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.750
it's that we can't
trust the way we think.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.120
And that's a scary feeling
for us as human beings.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.940
We want to go towards certainty.

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.269
We want to go to thinking
that we know what we're doing.

00:50:18.269 --> 00:50:19.810
So I'd like to end
with this picture.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:22.407
This is a picture of an
Aspen forest in Colorado.

00:50:22.407 --> 00:50:23.990
Because for me it's
a perfect metaphor

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.639
for who we are as human beings.

00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:27.680
I'm sure many of you have
seen these Aspen trees.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.471
They're remarkable.

00:50:28.471 --> 00:50:31.710
They're 80 to 100 feet tall and
there are thousands of them.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.700
They stay ramrod straight on
these beautiful mountainsides.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.600
And there's something really
remarkable about Aspen trees.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.540
And that is they're not
individual trees at all.

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.110
The Aspen forests are the
largest intact organisms

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:45.010
of the world.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.760
The largest one in northern
Utah is 80,000 trees,

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.590
one plant connected by
a common root system.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.530
For me, it's a perfect metaphor
for who we are as human beings.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.170
We can look at these identities
as if we're different,

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.720
and we do have different
content on our identities.

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.560
We do have different experiences
in our life and different ways

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.650
our identities shape our world.

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:07.380
But at an underneath
level, at the root level,

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.771
we basically relate to
the world very similarly.

00:51:10.771 --> 00:51:13.270
And if we can remember that as
we're dealing with each other

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.440
and bring compassion to
each other in that way,

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.940
our opportunity to
really understand

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.640
how we see the world
becomes very real for us,

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.940
and the ability to work
together, create organizations

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.670
where everybody can be
effective, becomes possible.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:25.602
Thanks.

00:51:25.602 --> 00:51:29.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.670
AUDIENCE: So I was
just wondering,

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:38.739
did you stay in
touch with Dr. Santa?

00:51:38.739 --> 00:51:40.030
HOWARD ROSS: No, unfortunately.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.260
I was so stunned
that I didn't even

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.400
think to do-- I was just
sort of-- in fact, instantly

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.840
what I did is I
started judging myself.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.000
I can't believe you
did this after 25 or 30

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.830
years of doing diversity
work.You're still doing this.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:53.288
And then by that
time, he was gone.

00:51:53.288 --> 00:51:58.310
But it was one of those sort
of moments, if you will.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.620
AUDIENCE: So you had
a slide up there about

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.542
how different races
affect empathy.

00:52:04.542 --> 00:52:05.250
HOWARD ROSS: Yes.

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:08.310
AUDIENCE: Have there
ever been studies done on

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:11.410
does the type of like
the differences in races,

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:12.980
like different
types of races, how

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.320
that affects the
amount of empathy?

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.400
Or is it just--

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.140
HOWARD ROSS: How it affects
that what of empathy?

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:17.790
I'm sorry?

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:19.956
AUDIENCE: How much, like
the differences in empathy,

00:52:19.956 --> 00:52:22.340
like how much you empathize
with someone else.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.924
Is there any studies on
the different types of--

00:52:24.924 --> 00:52:26.590
HOWARD ROSS: Oh, you
mean in other words

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:28.450
does one race trigger
empathy less than others?

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:28.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.170
HOWARD ROSS: I
don't know of that.

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.610
But my suspicion would
be, based on my experience

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:34.550
of working with
this in other areas,

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:37.415
is that it probably relates
more to your own background

00:52:37.415 --> 00:52:39.040
and how those racial
dynamics showed up

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.844
in your particular
community or the structure

00:52:41.844 --> 00:52:43.010
around you when you grew up.

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.530
So if you grow up
in an environment,

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.630
let's say in the United States,
where the race conversation

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.570
has most dramatically
been defined

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:52.530
between black and white, it
probably is stronger there,

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.260
which is one of the
reasons why Latinos

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.212
and Asians and Native
Americans, for example, often

00:52:58.212 --> 00:52:59.670
feel left out of
that conversation.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.870
Because we tend to
look at the extremes.

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:05.874
But we do know that race is the
first thing that the human mind

00:53:05.874 --> 00:53:08.540
responds to when we look at each
other, which really makes sense

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.884
if you think about it, because
gender, for example, almost

00:53:12.884 --> 00:53:15.300
everybody has had some intimate
relationship with somebody

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.405
of the opposite
gender, but many of us

00:53:17.405 --> 00:53:19.780
do not necessarily have any
kind of intimate relationship

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.450
with somebody of
the opposite race.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:23.419
So it's the first
identifier that we see,

00:53:23.419 --> 00:53:25.210
and therefore the first
protective reaction

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.470
we tend to come up with.

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.890
The other thing is
that, of course,

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.374
because of
internalized bias-- we

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.040
used to call it
internalized oppression.

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.520
It's now often called
stereotyped threat.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.240
We internalize the messages
about people like us.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.110
For example, when they do the
implicit association test,

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:43.530
they find that if you do
the implicit association

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.960
test between whites and
blacks, that something

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.580
like 75% of whites will
more positively associate

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.889
with whites than blacks,
but a majority of blacks

00:53:52.889 --> 00:53:54.930
will also associate with
whites more than blacks,

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.390
because they've internalized
the same negative stereotypes

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.930
about people like them.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.340
So the key here is to
recognize that even when

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.990
we're good people and we
think we're being fair,

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:06.940
we may have a tendency to
have less identification.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.740
And if we put this in the
context of the Fisk and Cuddy

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:16.330
work warmth and competence,
the way that cam show up is,

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.535
I may have warmth for you,
but my empathetic response

00:54:19.535 --> 00:54:21.660
may not be in being sensitive
to the competence you

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.440
bring to the conversation.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.940
And this is hard
for us, those of us

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.523
who are progressives
and see ourselves

00:54:26.523 --> 00:54:28.190
as really progressive
on this issue.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:29.355
I tell you, my
experience has been

00:54:29.355 --> 00:54:31.479
that working with organizations
that see themselves

00:54:31.479 --> 00:54:34.580
as progressive is sometimes more
challenging rather than less

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.550
challenging around these issues,
because we identify as seeing

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.020
ourselves as the good people,
the ones who have this

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.930
handled, and are
less likely to be

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.600
able to look at
things in ourselves.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.240
Whereas when we go into really
conservative organizations,

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.360
they say, I don't know
anything about this.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.194
Teach me what to do.

00:54:48.194 --> 00:54:49.735
They are very clear
that they haven't

00:54:49.735 --> 00:54:51.109
paid any attention to this.

00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:53.400
And so that's why organizations
in progressive-thinking

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.140
organizations like
Google have to especially

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.580
keep your nose to the
grindstone, so to speak,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.082
in terms of
continuing to develop

00:55:00.082 --> 00:55:01.540
that mindfulness
around this topic.

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:05.320
Because our success,
our competence

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.330
can blind us to the places
we still have work to do.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.930
And this is not a
place we get to.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:12.230
It's a like exercise.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:13.477
You never get there.

00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:15.560
If you build it into your
life on a regular basis,

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.350
you know that it will
maintain your health,

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:18.240
but if you think
you're just going

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.114
to exercise until you
get yourself into shape

00:55:20.114 --> 00:55:22.560
and then stop, you know
how that works out.

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.954
Seems like at my age, two
minutes later I'm out of shape.

00:55:25.954 --> 00:55:28.120
AUDIENCE: One of the largest
concerns with diversity

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.670
training is the
potential for backlash,

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.620
especially among individuals
who feel like they are not

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.900
benefiting from the training.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.608
HOWARD ROSS: Yes.

00:55:36.608 --> 00:55:40.320
AUDIENCE: So given this concern,
what are some recommendations

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.490
that you would recommend
when giving diversity

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.480
trainings to ensure that
it is something that

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.000
is inclusive for all employees?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:47.750
HOWARD ROSS: Yeah.

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:50.020
It's a great question.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:52.140
And it goes back
to the point I made

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.140
before about sort of the
traditional diversity

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.400
training, which has largely
been aimed at people,

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.983
certain groups of
people, particularly

00:55:57.983 --> 00:56:00.092
people who look
like this, frankly.

00:56:00.092 --> 00:56:01.800
Diversity training is
to teach white guys

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.160
to be more inclusive,
more whatever.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.086
I'm Jewish, and I
know Jewish people

00:56:09.086 --> 00:56:10.710
who rail against
anti-Semitism and make

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:11.820
a questionable racial comment.

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.960
I know African Americans who
rail against racism and then

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.910
make a homophobic or
heterosexist comment.

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:19.006
I know LGBT folks who
rail against that and then

00:56:19.006 --> 00:56:20.880
make a questionable
comment about immigrants.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.440
We've all got something
going on with somebody.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.231
And I think one of the
things we need to do

00:56:24.231 --> 00:56:25.935
is to speak to the
universality of that.

00:56:25.935 --> 00:56:30.710
That doesn't mean that all
biases are the same, because we

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:34.240
know that there's certain biases
that are systemically supported

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.720
by society or by an
organizational system.

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.370
And so even though
an individual may

00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:42.084
have prejudice
against somebody else,

00:56:42.084 --> 00:56:43.500
it's different to
have a prejudice

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.180
than it is to have a bias
or an -ism, as we might say,

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.960
which is systemically supported.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.210
But this is why it's
so important for us

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:52.990
to remove this sort of good
person/bad person fixing

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:54.370
mindset.

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:55.990
One of the reasons
that people are

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.050
hesitant to get involved
in diversity work-- there's

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.661
a powerful sense of
diversity fatigue

00:57:00.661 --> 00:57:02.160
out there-- is
because so much of it

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.590
feels like people are having
their finger waved at you.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:08.270
And you're being told
to be a better person,

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:09.920
and I'm here to fix you.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.790
And so things like inviting
people from dominant groups

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:16.414
into these conversations,
building a strong business

00:57:16.414 --> 00:57:17.580
case, getting people to see.

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.830
It's much easier-- when I
started doing the work close

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:22.450
to 30 years ago now,
we didn't have data.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.435
Now we have data to
show that research shows

00:57:25.435 --> 00:57:26.810
that you get more
diverse people,

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.890
you get better innovation, you
get better problem solving.

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:31.100
Research shows that the
market shares are shifting,

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.640
and we know these
demographics are changing.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.820
You need to reach
that market share.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.934
So it's pretty easy to
build a business case now

00:57:35.934 --> 00:57:38.350
and to get people to realize
this is not for those people.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:39.670
It's for all of us.

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:42.790
And that's got to be a
constant conversation.

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:45.350
And then the second piece
of that is, for those of us

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:48.270
who are practitioners, when we
get that resistance, when we're

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.650
sensing that resistance,
rather than point

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:53.856
fingers at the resistors and
say, why are they resisting?

00:57:53.856 --> 00:57:55.480
To start asking
ourselves the question,

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.605
what are we doing to
contribute to that resistance?

00:57:57.605 --> 00:57:59.320
What can we do
differently to invite them

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.740
into the conversation?

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.931
Because it's very easy--
and I've been there before.

00:58:02.931 --> 00:58:04.930
You feel sometimes like
you're beating your head

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.790
against a brick wall
when you're trying

00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:09.200
to get people into
the conversation.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.540
But it's very easy to
make them the problem.

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.230
But the reality is, we must be
contributing something for them

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:15.970
not to be welcomed
into the conversation.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.470
And so to find ways
where we can get

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:20.134
more folks into the
conversation so that it's not

00:58:20.134 --> 00:58:21.550
one group talking
to another group

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:24.890
but rather a collective group
sharing it with everybody

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:26.994
in the organization
or the system.

00:58:26.994 --> 00:58:28.160
ELIZABETH CURTIS: All right.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.870
Well, thank you so much for
being here with us today.

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:31.038
HOWARD ROSS: Great.

00:58:31.038 --> 00:58:31.150
Thank you.

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.660
ELIZABETH CURTIS:
Howard is going

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.120
to stick around
for a little bit.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.890
He'll be signing books right
out here if you're interested.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.219
And thanks for joining us.

00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:38.010
HOWARD ROSS: Great.

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:38.884
Thank you, everybody.

00:58:38.884 --> 00:58:42.130
