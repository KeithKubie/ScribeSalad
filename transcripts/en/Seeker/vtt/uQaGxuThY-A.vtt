00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.060
When you go to get guacamole at a restaurant,
you’re told: “Guac is extra”.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.580
No... guac is not extra!

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.580
Guac.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.580
Is.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.580
essential.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.470
What’s up!

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.170
I’m Sapna here for DNews.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.059
You guys, I have bad news.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.940
No, terrible news.. tragic news.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.230
Thanks to a never-ending California drought
coupled with a Mexican labor strike, we are

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.640
facing… an avocado shortage.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.100
Yes my friends we are running short on our
favorite fruit… no I mean our favorite berry…

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.220
no wait, it’s both.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.350
Even though you might find avocados in a veggie
salad, an avocado is actually the matured

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.100
ovary of a flower: which is a fruit.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.490
Like nearly all fruits, it has a tough outer
layer, and a fleshy-edible second layer encapsulating

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.490
a seed.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.610
Furthermore, it fits all the qualities of
a botanical berry, even though the berries

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.020
we’re most familiar with have a bunch of
seeds, while the avocado only has one.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.320
So while we are temporarily deprived of our
favorite unconventional fruit, it might be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.520
a good idea to take a break from the guac
and see if you should even be eating it.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.129
Are avocados good for you?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.360
Well, for starters, they’re packed with
fat.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.850
In fact, about three quarters of the edible
calories in an avocado are pure fat.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.090
So, will avocados make you fat?

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.659
Actually, most of the fat in avocados is thought
to be good for you.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.649
A little more than ten percent of that fat
is saturated fat, which do you want to avoid

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.000
in excess, but the rest is healthy fats: monounsaturated
and polyunsaturated.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.959
There is still a lot of research ` being done
about these fats and their health contributions,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.259
but besides containing good fat, clinical
trials have shown that diets with avocado

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.329
in them can help lower what we call “bad
cholesterol” because avocados have sterols,

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.170
or “steroid alcohols” -- that’s a subclass
of steroids.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.930
The sterols in avocados serve the same function
as cholesterols in the human body, and when

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.990
you eat an avocado its sterols are absorbed
instead of cholesterol.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.849
Another trial out of UCLA found that avocados
might improve vascular health and even have

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.659
anti-inflammatory effects.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.230
Barring any new discoveries about food, which
ya know happen all the time, as far as we

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.289
know right now, avocados are pretty good for
you in moderation.

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.159
And here’s one last fact, and this one is
crazy.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.310
When most of us think of avocados, we think
of those deep dark green ones with bumpy skin.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.650
Those, are Hass avocados… they are by far
the most commonly eaten variety -- more than

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.680
95% of avocados eaten in the United States
are Haas.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.250
But across the country and around the world,
people eat all sorts of avocados, gigantic

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.090
smooth ones and teeny-tiny light green ones…
there is a crazy amount of avocado variety.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.129
But here’s the amazing fact.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.590
The Hass avocado… originated in one, and
only one tree.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.230
Every single Hass avocado you have ever eaten,
or anyone has ever eaten, they all share a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.500
common ancestor: the mother tree.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.740
All Hass avocado trees are grafted from that
original tree planted by Rudolph Haas.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.549
Since 1926, the mother tree stood in front
of a house on West Road in La Habra Heights

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.280
in Los Angeles County and in September 2002,
the tree was cut down after battling root

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.969
rot for over a decade.

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.380
So the next time you dip your chip into a
bowl of guac, yes I know it's extra- it shouldn’t

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.069
be... think of the Hass Mother Tree and say
a little thank you for the giver of guac.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.739
But what about foods we think of as healthy
that are actually making us fat?

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.459
We have a video about that right here.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.160
What other foods would you like to know more
about?
