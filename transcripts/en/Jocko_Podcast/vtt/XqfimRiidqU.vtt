WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.060
Oh,
also how you were talking about kind of breaking the loop in your behavior.

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:06.090
Like,
oh,
I want to make a change to that one thing,
you know,

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:08.670
to break the Lou and then you start with something small and then it ends up

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.533
affecting more thing.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.790
And you mentioned sometimes it's hard because you don't get pats on the back for

6
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.700
those little things,
you know?
Yeah.

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.130
So small that it's humiliating that you even have to do the,
yeah.

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.410
But in a lot of time to yourself it's like kind of big.
Like I'm like,
Oh,

9
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.320
I'm going to drink eight glasses of water a day now.
You know?

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.380
And then it's almost like you're seeking that pat on the back.

11
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:35.790
Like you want to tell your friend like,
hey,
I drink eight glasses of water now.

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.820
And they're just like,
yeah,
so yeah,
I'm right.
And you're like,

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.740
why do I even party use kind of like,

14
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:44.590
why do I even do it then if no one's gonna care,
you know?
Well,
you know,
there,

15
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:46.740
there's a lesson to be drawn from that too.

16
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.290
In terms of relationships that's really useful psychologically is,

17
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.250
and this is a big mistake that people won't make.

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.270
It's like if you want to have a good longterm relationship with someone,

19
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.230
then you watch them constantly and when they do something that you like,

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.320
you let them know even if it's a small thing because they're way more likely to

21
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:07.380
do it again.
You know?

22
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:11.040
And so sometimes a personal have kind of an inkling about what they might do

23
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.160
that's good or that would be good for your relay,
their relationship with you.

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.520
Or that might even just be pleasing to you,
but they won't say anything.

25
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.730
They're like afraid because maybe they won't get attention for it,

26
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930
but then they do it and you notice it's like,
man,
that's super powerful.

27
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:26.580
Like you have to be really attentive though.

28
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.200
Cause the good things that people do don't stand out the mistakes they make

29
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:34.950
stand out and then you say,
well you made a mistake.
It's like,
yeah,
but to,

30
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:38.790
to watch and to reward someone for doing something small.
Right.
That's,

31
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.020
that's a step in the right direction.
That is a killer strategy.

32
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.680
I found that to be true with my daughter.
She's four and a half now,
but oh yeah,

33
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:47.100
like that.

34
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.090
Some kids really like some kids are tough and they don't respond to punishment

35
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:54.450
at all.
That you just can't,
you can't,
you can't,

36
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250
you can't intimidate them.
My daughter,
if I just pointed at her,
she would stop.

37
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.820
But my son,
it was like that was just round.
It just laugh.

38
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.290
We just laugh and run away.
So,

39
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.510
but he responded to reward like mad if I watched him and he did something that

40
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.870
was good and I told him that it was like he was just,
yes.

41
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.010
So Dan is good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's reward is harder to use,

42
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.710
but it's more effective if you can manage it.
Yeah.

43
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.680
And then that's not like how you say where you're like,

44
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.920
be careful with the reward when you give like too much for you word for these

45
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.310
small things,
you know?
And then they can't really expect.

46
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.110
You can think that that's a problem with the self esteem movement,
you know?

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.710
Oh yeah.
Every,
every kid gets a trophy day.
Yeah.
It's,
no,

48
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:38.400
it's like inflating the currency.
If everything is good,

49
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.720
then nothing is good because their house,
there has to be a distinction.
So yeah,

50
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.950
you want to watch and you want to see when the person's made an effort and you

51
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.760
want to see when they've gone beyond the call of duty and then you want to say,

52
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:53.150
Hey,
I notice that that was really good.
Yeah.
And,

53
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.940
and it is scarcity really matters in those situations because otherwise it just

54
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:01.750
turns into noise.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Patronizing noise even,
which is even worse.
It's like,

55
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.840
oh,
you're doing well or you're doing well.
It's like,
leave me alone.
Yeah.

56
00:03:05.841 --> 00:03:07.210
You know,
it's such a lie.

57
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.500
<v 1>Yeah.
I have a fun time with that actually.</v>

58
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.190
I'll put like if I have to judge all through my kids' lives,

59
00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:17.180
if I had to judge them in their friends and I have three daughters and one son,

60
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.970
usually it was the daughters.
I was being some kind of a judge.

61
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.680
I'm going to judge the dance,

62
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:25.100
I'm going to judge the little play that they put together.

63
00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:26.540
I'm going to judge the,
uh,

64
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.620
acrobatic routine that they're doing in the backyard that always be judging

65
00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:31.454
these things.

66
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.480
And I would have so much fun because I would say they'd do their little

67
00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.120
performance there,
one minute performance,

68
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.680
and they'd come out table how was wasn't and I said,
okay,
first of all,

69
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.440
presentation overall,

70
00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:50.180
I'm giving you a 4.2 I didn't see one smile until you actually got on stage.

71
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:50.720
That's wrong.

72
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.960
And I would just go through and give them these really shrong critique.
Yeah.

73
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.150
And,
and they loved it.
They loved it.
That's a tension.

74
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.990
Mad they would be happy to and they'd go try it again and try the race.

75
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:07.991
That 4.3 to a 4.5 they'd be smiles like you could see from a mile away.

76
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.080
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I just got done.
I was at a,

77
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.690
at a pool party with a bunch of little kids running around and I ended up

78
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.960
judging the diving competition and all the parents were watching and they were

79
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.170
aghast at what I was doing.
Yeah.
That was at my house by the way.
Oh,

80
00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:27.080
I did it there too.
No,
I do it on a regular basis,
but I did it at your house too,

81
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:28.750
right?
Yeah.
You've seen it in action.
Yeah.

82
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.710
I give the kids a little nicknames and then,
and then I say,
you know,

83
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.400
you were completely unbalanced when you left the board.

84
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.480
It was almost embarrassing for me to watch it.
Go try it again.

85
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.290
I'm giving you a 2.2 yeah,

86
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.050
go try it again and see if he can bump that up a little bit.
Yeah.

87
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.010
And the kids get all motivated to go up there and I give him a two,

88
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.960
2.5 or do you want to treat,
treated

89
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.740
<v 0>them like someone who could improve.
Right.
So that's a big deal.
That's,</v>

90
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.010
that's better than,
that's better than a pat on the back.
It's like,

91
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:02.160
because everyone's flawed and everyone needs to improve.
Also,

92
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.570
when my kids were little,
I taught them how to speak in public.

93
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.200
It took about an hour.
That was it.
So I had them,

94
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.680
they had to read something,
you know,

95
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:16.370
and so they'd read it and I was across the room and say,
well,

96
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.790
that's not loud enough.
It's like,
I can't hear Ya.
It's like belted out.

97
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.190
And then they get a little louder and said,
no,
no,
no,

98
00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:26.480
I that doesn't want to mean read it way louder than you think you should.

99
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.760
And so they did that.
And I said,
well,
that's about right,

100
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:32.060
because there's nothing more appalling than listening to some speaker that you

101
00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:35.220
can't hear.
It's like there's just no excuse for that.
And then like,

102
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.170
make it clearer,
put some passion into it,
you know?
And it was,

103
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.520
it was unbelievable how quickly they would pick that up,
you know?
And,
and,
uh,

104
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:44.090
that also made me sad because,

105
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.690
because it took so little time to get them to do that and then they had it,

106
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.640
you know?
And so,
and that,

107
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.650
that like a critic is your best friend if the critic isn't destructive,
cause it,

108
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.260
what a critic does is say,
look,

109
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.430
you did 10 things and like these five things,

110
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.010
you need some work on those.
They're not good.

111
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.170
And here's some things you could do that would make them better.

112
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.510
And here's two things that you got.
All right,

113
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:15.340
and here's three things that you did pretty well at.
And so then,
well,

114
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.540
what's the message?
The message is,
hey,

115
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:22.070
you can handle some actual criticism so you're not some little,
you know,
useless,

116
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.450
wimpy thing that's going to die.

117
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.990
Just because someone isn't telling you that you're already wonderful,

118
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.620
plus you're not already what,
not nearly as wonderful as you could get.

119
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.310
So let's keep that in mind.
And then you know,

120
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.740
you lay out a pathway for improvement and then you treat the kid with some

121
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:37.600
respect and,

122
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:41.990
and you also show that being an adult means that you know more than being a kid.

123
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.900
Cause you,
you know,
the kid does something,
you say,
oh that was really good.

124
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:47.240
It's like,
what are you saying?
Well as an adult,

125
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.280
I don't know any better than you do.

126
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.360
And that's pretty dismal message because the kid is going to be an adult for a

127
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:54.320
very long time.

128
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.490
And one of the things we do really badly in our culture is model.

129
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.990
Why being an adult is better than being a child because it is better.

130
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.560
You have freedom and you have responsibility and you have autonomy.

131
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.700
And so we're always so concerned about making our kids feel good about

132
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:11.211
themselves.

133
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:15.440
It's like they shouldn't be feel good about becoming responsible adults because

134
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:17.420
they're going to be adults for like 80 years,

135
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:22.370
and they're going to be kids for like 20 years.
So
the adults,
the goal.
