00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.820
Welcome back.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.340
Now that we've hopefully,
learned a little bit about

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.670
Newton's law, let's apply them
to solve some problems.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.630
Let's say I have a-- I don't
know-- some kind of vehicle, a

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.390
car, a motorcycle
or something.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.150
And let's say its mass is 500
grams. And let's say that I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.150
can accelerate this vehicle at
an acceleration of-- I don't

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:33.410
know-- 3 centimeters
per second squared.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.500
What's the force that I need
to apply to this mass to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.210
accelerate it at this speed?

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180
And we want the answer
in Newton's.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.976
So what's the force?

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.130
So we're just going to use
Newton's second law and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.820
Newton's second law tells us
force is equal to mass times

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.810
acceleration.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.410
So you might want to, or you
might be tempted just to

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.550
multiply mass times acceleration
and you'd get

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.530
force is equal to-- let's see,
500 grams times 3 centimeters

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.700
per second squared.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.440
And you would get force
is equal to 1,500 gram

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.320
centimeters per second
squared.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.880
And if you did this,
you would be right.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.250
Although your answer would not
be in Newtons and now you

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.670
would have to somehow,
try to convert this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.990
set of units to Newtons.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.020
And what are Newtons?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.850
Well we learned when we did
Newton's laws that a Newton,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.360
so 1 Newton is equal
to 1 kilogram

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.900
meter per second squared.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.250
So somehow we have to convert
the gram to kilograms and we

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.260
have to convert the centimeters
to meters.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.050
We could do it after the fact
here, or what I find it easier

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.150
to do is actually to convert the
mass and the acceleration

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.200
units first and then just
do the F equals ma.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.360
So what's 500 grams
in kilograms?

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.940
Well 500 grams is half-- well,
a kilogram as a thousand

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.010
grams. So 500 is going to
be half a kilogram.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.430
1 kilogram is a thousand grams,
so 0.5 kilograms is 500

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.040
grams.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.000
Similarly, 3 centimeters
is how many meters?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.370
Well, 1 meter is 300-- sorry.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.510
I think I'm dehydrated.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.150
1 meter is a hundred
centimeters, right?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.280
So 3 centimeters is 0.03 meters
per second squared.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.530
Hopefully this make
sense to you.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.740
3 centimeters is 0.03 meters.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.870
And now we already.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.770
We have our mass in kilograms
and we have our acceleration

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.130
in meters per second squared.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.130
And if this is confusing, you
should watch the unit videos

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.710
because this is all I'm doing;
I'm just doing unit

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.660
conversion.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.880
So let's go back to force
equals mass times

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280
acceleration.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.850
So the force was equal to
0.5 kilograms times the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.970
acceleration, which is 0.03
meters per second squared.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.700
And this equals--

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.490
What's 0.5 times 0.03?

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.400
I'll do it down here just
because multiplying decimals

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.370
seems to be a problem for a
lot of people, including

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.980
myself, many times.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.000
So what you do, you just
multiply the numbers.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.510
5 times 03 or 5 times 3 is 15.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.640
And then, how many points do
we have behind the decimal?

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.210
How many digits behind
the decimal?

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.740
Let's see.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.130
We have 1, 2, 3.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.660
So 1, 2, 3.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.240
We have to add the 0 because
we need three spaces behind

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.730
the decimal point.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.190
So we get the force is equal to
0.015 kilogram meters per

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.640
second squared.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.400
And this is a Newton.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.066
So the force is equal
to 0.015 Newtons.

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:03.470
Let's do another problem.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.280
And this one's going to be-- and
actually, I think you'll

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.600
find most of the difficult
Newton's laws problems or

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.120
force problems, they're just
some combination of making

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.120
sure you get the units right
when we're talking about in

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.680
one dimension.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.959
The difficult part is usually
getting the units right or

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.710
just the math, just
the algebra.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.610
So if you have trouble with this
it's usually because you

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.890
have to just brush up a little
bit on the algebra.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.100
The physics itself is just
force equals mass times

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.130
acceleration as we will
see in this problem.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.950
So let's say that when I apply
some force, some particular

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.700
force, I use this
little 0 here.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.360
So I call that force F sub 0.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.820
So this means a particular
force.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.010
This is some value.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.600
When I apply that force to some
mass, let's call that m

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.070
sub 0, I get some
acceleration.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.810
I get acceleration a sub 0.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.720
We could've put numbers here.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.810
We could've said, well, if I
apply a force of 10 Newtons to

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.940
a mass of-- I don't know--
to a mass of let's say 2

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.330
kilograms, I have an
acceleration of 5 meters per

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.170
second squared.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.890
But I'm just doing this because
this could be any

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.790
relationship.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.380
And let's say the problem
tells us that when I put

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.680
another mass with this first
mass, so let's say that, you

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.400
know-- let me draw
this diagram.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.480
So here's my mass, m sub 0.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.610
When I apply a force of f sub 0
to it, I get an acceleration

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.250
of a sub 0.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.390
Now the problem tell us when I
add another mass-- so let's

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.880
says I stack it up and
we're like in an ice

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.670
skating ring or something.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.196
And I stack another mass
up here, and let's

00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:46.990
call this mass m1.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.890
When I stack another mass on
here-- so let me redraw it

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.250
actually down here.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.420
Because it's a different case.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.720
And I apply the same force,
and now I have

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.020
this new mass on here.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.926
I'll do it in red.

00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:03.920
This is m1.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.540
The problem tells us that my new
acceleration is 1/5 of the

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.650
original acceleration.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.070
So it's 1/5 of whatever
this was.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.390
So it's 1/5 a sub 0.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.620
So the question is, what
is the ratio of m

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.610
sub 0 to m sub 1?

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.590
So m sub 0 to m sub 1
is equal to what?

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.990
And I'm going to keep it in
abstract variables just to

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.710
confuse you.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.200
And then I'll show you that you
can actually substitute

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.720
numbers and the problem becomes
a little easier.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.210
And you might want to pause it
and try it for yourself.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.670
So let's work it through.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.590
So we know we have
this relationship

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.250
to start off with.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.760
And just for simplicity, let's
write what m sub 0 is in terms

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.720
of F and a.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.890
So we just divide both sides by
a sub 0 and you get F sub 0

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.250
divided by a sub 0 is
equal to m sub 0.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.580
Good.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.970
So let's just put that
aside for a second.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.340
And let's do that same
relationship here with this.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.160
So here, this relationship tells
us that F sub 0 is equal

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:19.130
to m1 plus m0 times this
new acceleration, which

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.660
is 1/5 a sub 0.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.390
And so, if we divide both sides
by this term right here,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.820
we get-- dividing by 1/5
is the same thing as

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.260
multiplying by 5.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:44.060
So you get 5 F sub 0 over a sub
0 is equal to m1 plus m0.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.370
I just divided both sides
by this term right here.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.910
Well, what's F sub 0?

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:49.490
What's this?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.340
Let me switch colors again.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.910
What's F sub 0 divided
by a sub 0?

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.570
Well it's here's.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.860
It's what we solved for
in the beginning.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.770
We just got it from
this relationship.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.310
So we could substitute.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.780
5 times F sub 0 divided
by a sub 0 is the same

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.425
thing as 5 times m0.

00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:06.790
Draw a line here.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.930
So we have a new relationship.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.330
5m0 is equal to m1 plus m0.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.960
All I did is I substituted
this for

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.980
this, or this for that.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.150
And I used this relationship,
which we got in the beginning

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.370
to do that.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.830
And now what do we have?

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.660
We have 5 m sub 0 is equal
to m1 plus m0.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.460
We could subtract m0
from both sides.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.270
You get 4 m0 is equal to m1.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.460
You could divide both sides by
m0 and you got 4 is equal to

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.730
m1 over m0.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.760
And you could invert this
relationship and you can get

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.210
m0 over m sub 1 is
equal to 1/4.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:54.060
So what we learned is the ratio
of the old mass to the

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.400
new mass is 1 to 4.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.410
And that's a problem.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.750
And actually, I will leave it
for you as an exercise to

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.410
figure out-- to just
do the same

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.500
problem using the numbers.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.650
I will do that actually, in the
next video just to show

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.750
you that that actually
would've been a

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.860
simpler way to do it.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.160
But it's good to get used to
this just so you can solve

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.710
things in general terms. I'll
see you in the next video.
