00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.160
 In this presentation, we will learn how to make 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.410
 Relatively well established 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.440
 How to make the denominator a relative number 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.610
 What do I mean by that, let's assume we have a break 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.570
 Its position is relative, and the simplest fraction 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.400
 I will think is 1 / square root of 2 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.440
 To make this relatively relative, we have to 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.910
 We re-represent this number in some way so it does not contain 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 Which is based on a non-proportional number 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.350
 The first question you can ask is 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.710
 Why should we care about this? 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160
 Why should we make the denominators relative? 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.030
 We are not supposed to do this 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 But I think the reason is because this is found in many algebra lessons 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.230
 And why do some professors ask you, because he is coming out? 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 The numbers are common 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.150
 I also think, it was told to me 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.360
 Before the invention of the calculator 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 People have discovered that it is easier to have a relative number in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.600
 Place 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.200
 I do not know if this is true or not 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.070
 The other reason is aesthetics 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 Some people do not like seeing 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.640
 1 / square root of 2 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.180
 I do not know either 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.900
 As you know, if you want to know the size of the pie 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.330
 I have to set the number relative 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.420
 So, let's learn how to make the place relatively 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.260
 If the method is simple, if we have a simple and non-relative number 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.030
 In the sanctuary, like this, you can 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.490
 To hit the numerator and denominator with this non-proportional number 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.100
 Divided by the non-proportional number 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.670
 Now it is clear that this is 1 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.610
 Any number divided by the number or any number divided by the same 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.410
 It will be produced 1 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.480
 In fact, we do not change the number 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.610
 But we change how to represent it 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.470
 So how much is this? 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.170
 The rugs will have 1 × square root for 2 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.620
 The square root is equal to 2 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.230
 The denominator will be the square root of 2 × 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.640
 Square root of 2 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.180
 Well square root for 2 × 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.130
 Square root of 2 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.460
 It is equal to 2 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.180
 By definition, this square equals 2 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.030
 We have squared it 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.400
 We hit him himself 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.630
 The output was 2 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690
 And so we made the place relatively 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.950
 We did not get rid of the root code, but we did 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.680
 We put it in the rugs 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.120
 Now we have a relative number in the square 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.610
 You can say, I now have a square root for half 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.860
 This is simple, probably longer 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 Justified to make 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.840
 Relatively well established 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.040
 Let's solve more examples 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.750
 Suppose I have 6 / square root for 15 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.320
 The first thing I will do is simplify 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.930
 This root icon 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.250
 To see 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.920
 Square root of 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.530
 15 is 3 × 5 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.570
 Nothing here is a whole square 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.310
 If, this is the simplest image you can get 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.770
 As we have done here, let us strike 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.490
 The square root of 15 / square root of 15 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.720
 This will equal 7 × square root 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720
 For 15 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.590
 I just hit the rugs 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.690
 Divided by the square root of 15 x square root of 15 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.590
 It is equal to 15 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.020
 Again, we got a relative number in the denominator 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.350
 Now this is a relative number 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.840
 We got a radical number in rugs or in other words, we got 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.510
 Non-proportional number in rugs 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.190
 I did not change the number, but I changed 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.700
 Represented 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.920
 Now, let's move to a higher level 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.900
 What will happen if I say that we have 12/2 - 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.080
 Square root for 5? 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.940
 So in this case, we have a two-edged equation 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.460
 In the place 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.950
 This equation contains a non-relative number 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.000
 You can not follow that trick here 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.230
 If you hit the square root of 5 divided by the square root of 5 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.380
 I will get a non-relative number in the place 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.460
 Let me show you this 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.210
 To prove to you that this does not apply here 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.720
 If this square root is hit for 5 / square root of 5 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.730
 The rugs will become 12 x 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.300
 Square root of 5 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.170
 And we have to distribute the place 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.670
 Becomes 2 × square root of 5 - 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.820
 Square root of 5 x square root of 5, ie 5 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.180
 As you see, in this case, the way we followed did not help us 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.570
 Because the square root is 5, although this part has become 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.110
 Relatively, ie, 5, but this part became relative 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.900
 Ie 2 x square root for 5 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.370
 If this is what you should not do if you have 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.120
 A two - edged equation containing a non - relative number in 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.780
 Place 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.019
 What to do is use our skills when 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.170
 Different squares 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.209
 I'm going to write here on this side 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.470
 We have learned for a long time 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.570
 If we have a 2-square root for 5 we hit it 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.900
 2 + square root of 5, to what will lead us to this? 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.670
 You may remember now 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.630
 If you do not realize this quickly, then for this 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.790
 The same pattern (a - b) (a + b) 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.290
 (a - b) (a + b) 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.040
 As we have seen in a number of lessons previously 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.770
 a ^ 2 - b ^ 2 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.470
 This is a simple review 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.900
 a ^ 2 means a × a 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.430
 a × b means ab 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.630
 -b × a means -ab 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.840
 Then, - ab × a 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.150
 -b ^ 2 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.070
 We delete this and keep it to us 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.980
 a ^ 2 - b ^ 2 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.710
 If (2 - square root for 5) (2 + square root for 5) 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.480
 Equals 2 ^ 2, ie 4 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.260
 Let me write this way 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.920
 Equals 2 ^ 2 - the square root of 5 ^ 2 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.690
 It is equal to 5 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.345
 If the whole equation is 4 - 5 or -1 

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:36.920
 . 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.520
 If you know the advantage of different squares 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.080
 Or analyzed squares to their causes, however 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.920
 You want to call them, so you will be able to make 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.240
 Relatively well established 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.840
 Let us do this 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.750
 Let me rewrite the issue 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.280
 12/2 - square root of 5 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.810
 In this case, you hit the numerator and 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.270
 Place with 2 + square root for 5 divided by 2+ 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.600
 Square root of 5 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.580
 Again, I multiply the number by 1 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.960
 So I do not change the value of the number 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.020
 All I change is to represent the number 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.780
 If the numerator becomes 12 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.010
 X 2, ie 24 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.125
 +12 x square root of 5 

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:22.640
 +12 × square root of 5, all this divided by 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.470
 Again, this is like analysis 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.560
 Box to the factors 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.200
 Equals 2 ^ 2, ie is 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.450
 Equal to this 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.330
 Ie 4, -1, or we can - sorry 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.040
 4 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.750
 It's 2 ^ 2 - square root square for 5 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.610
 If 4 - 5 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.720
 Or we can write it -1 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.900
 Or we can put 1 here and put 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.590
 Negative signal in front of it 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.720
 Hence, there is nothing that drives us to put 1 in 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.170
 Place 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.120
 We can say that this equals 24 - 12 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.140
 Square root of 5 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.250
 If in this case, we followed this method until we simplify 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.930
 Not in order to make the number relative 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.770
 This is what makes it look better 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.490
 As you know, it is better to note this from the beginning 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.540
 Because it was not clear 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.190
 If you're me and you're trying to make a rocket, you've got it 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.200
 On this answer and I got this answer, it will not be this 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.260
 Obviously, at least for me, when I see him, I see it 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.500
 Same number 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.450
 But if we agree to make the denominators relative always 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.380
 You'll, awesome ah 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.450
 We got the same number 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.320
 Now we are ready to send the missile to Mars 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.910
 Let us solve another example 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:39.780
 Suppose I have 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.900
 Let's solve an example that contains variables 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.060
 Suppose it is 5y / 2x 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.700
 Square root of y - 5 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.530
 If we follow the same method 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.640
 We have a two-edged equation that contains a non-relative denominator 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.690
 We must make it relatively 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.920
 We do not know what the value of y 

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.020
 But y can take any value, hence it can be 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.570
 Not relative 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.270
 We do not want roots in the place 

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.050
 How much will it equal? 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.180
 Well, let's hit the ridge and place 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.780
 B 2 The square root of y + 5/2 

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.100
 y + 5 square root of 

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.150
 This is equal to 1 

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.690
 I did not change the number, but I did 

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.860
 Hit by 1 

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.260
 Let's start by then 

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.570
 How much will it cost? 

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.940
 The denominator will equalize this value box 

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.409
 Again, the box difference 

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.880
 Ie would be 2 × y ^ 2 square root of 

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.830
 - 5 ^ 2 

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.630
 If we analyze the factors, we get 2 square root of y + 5 

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.630
 × 2 square root of y - 5 

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.440
 This difference squares 

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.770
 And then the numerator is 2 square root for 5y × y 

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.360
 And equal to 10 

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.330
 These are y ^ 1, these 

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.080
 y ^ 1/2 

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.370
 We can write y the square root of y 

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.430
 10y square root of y 

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.380
 Or can be written as follows: y ^ 3/2 or ^ 1 1/2 

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.300
 However you wish 

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:15.820
 Finally, 5y × 5 = 25y 

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.550
 These can be simplified more 

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.250
 So how much will it equal? 

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.490
 We will have 2 ^ 2, ie 4 

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.410
 The square root of y ^ 2 = y 

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.800
 4y 

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.870
 And then 25 

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:40.140
 And rugs is - we can write this 

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.690
 We can keep it in the picture we wrote here 

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.600
 We can come out of common factor y 

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.840
 These are all possible images that we produce 

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.540
 But until we keep things simple, we can leave it 

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.340
 10 

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.100
 Let me put it differently 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.520
 I can type it y ^ 1, and these 

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.970
 y ^ 1/2 

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.200
 It can also be written y ^ 3/2 if you want it 

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.240
 Or even y ^ 1 1/2 

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.650
 Or i can type it 10y × square root of y 

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.900
 All these pictures are equal 

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.010
 + 25y 

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.080
 + 25y 

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.990
 Anyway, I hope you have found it 

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.110
 Converting the place to a relative number
