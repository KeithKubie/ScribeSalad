00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.130
An early example of beneficial government
regulation, to proof alcohol was simply to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.700
test and verify that the contents of a barrel
of liquid was what it was claimed to be.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.840
The process began in England around the 16th
century.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
Its original purpose was not consumer protection,
but rather to ensure that the state (read:

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.610
the King) collected the proper amount of taxes
on the sale of the product (alcohol, called

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.210
proof spirits, was taxed at a higher rate).

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.780
The first method was imprecise at best, and
involved soaking a gun pellet in the liquid,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.350
and then trying to light it on fire; if it
burned, it was classified as a proof spirit.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.510
However, as alcohol’s flammability is dependent
on its temperature (the higher the temperature,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.970
the more vapors the alcohol infused solution
will emit, and, therefore, the more flammable),

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.240
sometimes actual alcohol was passed off as
something less (and taxed at the lower rate).

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.850
Nonetheless, frequently the product would
catch fire, and by that the authorities would

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.170
know that the spirit (usually rum) was at
least 57.15% alcohol by volume (ABV), which

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.390
at that time was classified as being 100 proof.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.740
As scientific skills improved, by the early
19th century, a far more accurate test was

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.700
developed which measured the liquid’s specific
gravity (the ratio of the density of a substance

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.720
to a reference, in this case distilled water).

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.150
Distilled water is actually denser than alcohol.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.740
Accordingly, in 1816 a test was developed
that relied on the fact that at 11°C (51°F),

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.250
a 100 degree proof spirit (~57.15% ABV) would
weigh 12/13 that of distilled water.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.460
As 57.15% is roughly equivalent to 4/7, in
the UK to convert a lower alcohol to proof,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.350
you simply multiply the ABV by 7/4 (or 1.75);
so, if you had a delicious IPA with an ABV

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.120
of 6.9%, in the UK this would be 12.075 degrees
of proof, while a 100% ABV pure alcohol would

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.620
have a proof of 175 degrees.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.600
In the US, this somewhat complicated method
was rejected (in an early example of tl;dr),

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.700
and instead proof is simply calculated by
doubling the ABV.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.730
So, in the States, that IPA would be 13.8
proof, while Jack Daniels, with an ABV of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.800
40%, is 80 proof.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.110
Of course, some spirits far exceed these ABVs,
with a number of neutral grain and rectified

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.240
spirits reaching ABVs of 96% (168 degrees
of proof in the UK and 192 proof in the US).

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.830
In the United States, these alcohols are regulated,
if at all, by the particular states; for example,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.989
Nevada prohibits the sale of alcohol in excess
of 80% ABV, and California prohibits the sale

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.060
of anything over 60% ABV.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.840
Uncle Sam has singled out one alcohol in particular
for regulation, however, – absinthe.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.590
Sometimes called the Green Fairy, this exotic,
strong spirit (ABV 45-75%) infused with green

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.209
anise, fennel, other herbs and most notably,
grand wormwood, fueled Paris’ Belle Époque

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.210
and is credited by some as inspiring a variety
of artistic movements (e.g. Surrealism, Impressionism,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.199
Post-Impressionism, Modernism and Cubism),
as well as the writings of notables including

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.290
Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Ernest
Hemingway.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.840
In the early 1900s, a number of countries
banned absinthe (1912 in the US), due in equal

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.329
measure to a smear campaign conducted by the
wine industry, lurid tales of men under its

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.650
spell committing horrid violent crimes, and
the presumed presence of thujone, a chemical

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.480
compound that is said to be poisonous in large
amounts.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.510
As it turns out, however, most absinthe has
very little thujone and easily meets all regulatory

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.730
requirements (in the US, no more than 10ppm).

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.299
Accordingly, beginning in about 2007, absinthe
returned to the US, both as imports from Europe

00:03:53.299 --> 00:05:51.900
along with domestic producers springing up,
as well.
