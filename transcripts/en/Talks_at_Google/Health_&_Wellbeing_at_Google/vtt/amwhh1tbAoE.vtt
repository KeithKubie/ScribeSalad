[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.350
LAURA MILLER: Thanks so
much, everyone, for coming.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.470
I'm Laura Miller,
a fellow Googler.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.320
And I feel honored and blessed
to be standing here today

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.980
introducing two
personal heroes of mine

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.410
and sharing their brilliant
minds with my Google family.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.500
As many of know, I was
diagnosed exactly one year ago

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.640
with breast cancer
and fortunately,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.820
labeled no evidence of
disease this past July.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.320
After--

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.100
[CHEERING]

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.826
Thank you.

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:31.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.070
After my diagnosis, I
received an outpouring

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.860
of love and support
from many Googlers,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.650
quite a few in Google
Chicago, so thank you.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.680
And unfortunately, I
received too many notes

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.530
saying that they had faced a
similar diagnosis as myself

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.790
not long before me.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.190
So we have quite a
big Google family here

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.380
that is facing this issue.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.510
And my good health today and
the good health of many Googlers

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.840
could be attributed
directly to individuals

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.960
who are pioneering, driving
change, and innovating

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.510
in the breast cancer landscape,
in particular, the two

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.340
that you'll hear from today.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
So Fran Visco is amazing.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.700
She is 25-year breast cancer
survivor and the president

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.890
of the National Breast
Cancer Coalition

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.650
which is an organization not
all unlike Google in the sense

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.500
that they're willing
to make big bets,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.850
and they care first and
foremost about the population

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.350
that they serve.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.840
She served three terms
as one of three members

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.140
of President Clinton's Cancer
Council back in the '90s.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.500
She co-chaired the National
Action Plan on Breast Cancer.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.810
And she was the first consumer
to chair the Integration

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.450
Panel of the Department of
Defense Peer-Reviewed Breast

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.560
Cancer Research Program.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980
She is a member of the board
of directors of Translational

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.810
Research and Oncology, among
many other national boards.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.560
And she is a world-renowned
thought leader

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.240
and a breast cancer landscape.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.430
Alana Welm is also incredible.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.750
She is an associate professor
in the Department of Oncological

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.405
Sciences at the
University of Utah,

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:59.810
an investigator at the
Huntsman Cancer Institute,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.690
and co-leader of the Cell
Response and Regulation Program

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.150
at Huntsman Cancer Institute.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
Her lab focuses on
breast cancer metastases,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.400
which unfortunately,
has no cure today.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.429
And she's made
groundbreaking discoveries

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.720
that are widely-renowned in
the breast cancer community

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.520
and beyond.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.650
Her research developed
lead to new ways

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.050
to treat and prevent
breast cancer metastases,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.280
which she'll talk
more about today.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.560
So without further ado, I want
to give a warm Google welcome

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.400
to Fran Visco.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.160
FRAN VISCO: Thank you.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.275
Thank you.

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:33.775
Sorry.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.910
Thanks very much, everyone.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.490
I'm thrilled to be
here to talk to you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.280
about breast cancer,
how we can end it,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.790
and the National Breast
Cancer Coalition.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.330
So our mission is to
end breast cancer,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.090
and we do have a
strategic approach

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.410
to achieving that mission.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.660
But we all have a role to
play in ending breast cancer,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.870
and we have to use every
possible avenue to get there.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.990
So the National Breast
Cancer Coalition,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.490
which I have the honor
of being president of,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.840
was formed in 1991 as
a coalition of groups

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.370
from around the country.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.510
And we have two arms.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.750
We have an advocacy arm,
a grassroots advocacy

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.040
arm that sets the legislative
and public policy agenda

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.890
and then works to get
it enacted into law.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.640
And we have a program arm that
complements the public policy

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.240
work, and I'll talk a bit about
the programs that we have.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.400
And our goal, really, is
to change all the systems

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.330
in breast cancer.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.490
We weren't formed
to raise awareness.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.390
We do not do direct services.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.750
Many of our member
organizations do.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.600
We are really about
system change.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.810
And again, our mission
is to end breast cancer.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.560
So I'll give you an example of
the advocacy work that we do,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.270
funding for research,
expanding access to care.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.450
Funding for research
is, as we know,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.150
vital to ending this disease.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.430
And the federal government
is where the major research

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.050
funding comes from.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.870
We do a lot of
community fundraising,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.750
or many of our groups do,
raising money for research

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.810
in their communities.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.060
And that is important.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.720
But the hundreds of millions of
dollars, year in and year out,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.590
that are required for
high-level biomedical research

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.260
comes from the
federal government.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.150
Expanding access to care--

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.210
we all know, and we know we've
been a part of this battle very

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.190
much most recently--

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.920
that we can find the
answers to breast cancer.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.330
We can know how to prevent
it and how to cure it.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.060
But we will not have
ended breast cancer

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.080
unless everyone everywhere has
access to those interventions.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.040
And so a main
priority of NBCC is

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.200
to make certain that
the policies are

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.130
in place that will expand
access to the right health care.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.170
We're involved in
education and training.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.650
We educate and train
advocates, lay advocates

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.680
around the country and
even around the world,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.710
to understand these
issues and to understand

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.890
the language, the concepts,
and process of science

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.520
so that they can collaborate, so
that they can sit at the table

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.150
and help decide how research
funds should be spent

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.310
and also what research
should happen.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.070
And Alana will speak
a bit more about that.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.890
But we're about
critical advocacy.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.930
We're about critical analysis
and analytical, informed

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.820
approach to what advocacy should
be, not a knee-jerk reaction

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.890
to issues in breast cancer.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.820
And we are very much about
the importance of leadership

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.330
from the lay public, from
educated and trained advocates

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.040
with a constituency.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.360
They should be leading all
efforts in breast cancer.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.460
So let's talk about US
progress in breast cancer,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.330
because I think we
all think-- the public

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.960
believes that we've made
such strides in breast cancer

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.600
and that we're very close
to figuring this out.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.020
But the numbers tell a
very different story.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.960
So in 2017, in the United
States alone, over 300,000 women

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.900
will be diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.210
And 2,600 men will also
receive that diagnosis.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.340
Now, we know there are two
main types of breast cancer.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.670
There's invasive breast
cancer, and there's

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.290
something called in situ--

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.540
ductal carcinoma in situ.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.560
And that really isn't cancer.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.870
That's a condition where we have
abnormal cells in breast ducts.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.930
And it has not
invaded into tissue.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.050
That is a phenomenon
of mammography.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.150
Before mammography
screening, we didn't

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.970
know there was such
a thing about DCIS.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.460
And DCIS is a very controversial
issue in breast cancer,

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.360
because we really
don't know if any of it

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.010
will progress to
invasive breast cancer

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.980
and if any of that
invasive-- which of that

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.610
invasive breast cancer will
progress to become lethal.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.900
We'll talk more
about that later.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.140
But this year,
breast cancer will

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.260
take the lives of
over 40,000 women

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.257
and 460 men in
this country alone.

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:26.590
And I'm going to show you a
graph in a little while that

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.860
will show you that there is
no change in lethal disease

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.920
and diagnosis since 1978--

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.430
no change in diagnosis
of lethal diagnosis.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.100
And there is no
acceleration in the rate

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.960
of decrease of mortality.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.220
You may have heard
that recently--

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.810
the number 39%
reduction in mortality

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.300
in breast cancer death rate.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.990
Well, that is a correct
number, but it is not a number

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.800
that tells the whole story.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.680
It's a relative number.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.360
The decrease in mortality
has been 1.9% a year

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.280
for a number of years now--

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.310
1.9%, 1.9%, 1.9%.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.420
You add that up, the relative
decrease is about 39%.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.490
But there's no
acceleration in the rate

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.370
of decrease, which there
would be if we were continuing

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.825
to make progress.

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:22.480
But the global progress
is even worse story.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.000
1.67 million new
breast cancer cases

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.310
will be diagnosed in women.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.200
And more than 500,000 women
worldwide died of breast cancer

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.260
in 2012, which is the
most up-to-date year

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.490
statistic that we have from
the World Health Organization.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.490
But it is estimated
that in 2034--

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.380
2035, that number will be
more than 800,000 women

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.960
at the current rate of progress.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.450
So this is really the
reality of breast cancer.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.690
And I think it's important to
look at this particular graph.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.720
You'll see breast
cancer incidence,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.040
which is the diagnosis of
breast cancer and mortality,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.500
across 40-plus countries.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.990
The blue line is incidence.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.600
And you will see that
in developed countries,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.820
that line is very long.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.450
The red bar is mortality.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.030
And you will see
across 40 countries

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.400
not a significant
difference in mortality.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.600
What does this tell us?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.770
This tells us something about
the limitations of technology.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.780
Because the blue
line-- the blue bar

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.150
tells you that is
how many women are

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.670
diagnosed because of screening.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.210
So in developed countries, we
have mammography screening.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.200
So you'll have many, many,
many more women diagnosed.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.170
But the number of women who
are dying of breast cancer

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.730
does not change across
countries very much.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.810
So that tells us that there
are significant limitations

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.660
in early detection.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.090
This is, again, the
reality of breast cancer.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:07.130
This is a graph that shows you
since 1978, actually, until--

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.920
actually, this goes now to 2015.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.430
There has been no change
in the initial diagnosis

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.080
of lethal breast cancer.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.280
And lethal breast cancer is
metastatic breast cancer.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.680
Because if you were
diagnosed with breast cancer,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.250
and it stays in your
breast, it won't kill you.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.700
If it leaves your breast
and goes to another organ,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.960
then it becomes lethal.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.780
And we don't know how to
cure a lethal disease.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.100
So initial diagnosis
of metastatic disease,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.340
that statistic hasn't changed.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.780
Breast cancer is
a political issue.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.190
And what do I mean by that?

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.100
I mean by-- as I said, the
significant sustained funding,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.140
year in and year,
out for research

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.040
comes from the
federal government.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.980
And we can influence
what that number is.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.990
And NBCC has influenced that.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.840
How is the funding
spent, though?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.660
Now we brought about over
3 billion new dollars

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.290
through our advocacy to the
worldwide scientific community

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.520
since 1992.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.730
But it's not just about money.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.450
Although, for many
individuals and organizations,

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.220
that's a goal in and of itself.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.430
But we're also about, how
are those dollars spent?

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.680
And that's where
our project lead,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.090
which is our education program,
Educating the Lay Public

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.820
in Science, that Laura
Miller, your fellow Googler,

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.020
took this past summer,
understanding language,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.540
concepts, and process of
science so that you can sit

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.110
at the table, help decide what
a research agenda should look

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.230
like, and actually collaborate
with individual scientists--

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.810
and Alana will
speak to that also--

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.760
in designing research.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.640
Access to care--
a political issue.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.620
The Obamacare; the
Access to Care Act;

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.840
the FDA, the Food and
Drug Administrations,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.310
those are all political
entities that we can influence.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.400
And the quality of the care
that you get access to,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.320
there are many
federal agencies that

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.500
actually have a great
deal of influence

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.570
over what that quality is.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.970
And we can influence
those agencies.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.240
And we educate and train
people and set an agenda

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.920
so that the influence is
the correct influence.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.240
But I want to talk a little bit
about 21st century advocacy.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.460
NBCC has had an
incredible impact

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.060
in breast cancer in terms of
funding for research, access

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.940
to care, changing
how research is done,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.890
working with scientists.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.020
And we've done a lot
of our work through--

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.260
in the early days,
petitions and organizing,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.650
collecting 2.6 million
signatures standing on a street

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.110
corner stopping people,
going door to door,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.540
delivering those signatures
to the president,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.230
resulting in a national
action plan on breast cancer.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.230
But that doesn't work anymore.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.840
Because now, petitions
and signatures

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.820
are collected
through technology,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.270
through social media.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.810
And now, it is not that
difficult to get millions

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.090
of signatures on a
petition, and when

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.040
it's not that
difficult to do, it

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.080
doesn't have as much meaning.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.180
So how can technology
help us in today's world

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.830
in organizing a meaningful and
influential grassroots network

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.850
and having our voices heard
in a way that sets us apart

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.230
from the crowd?

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.730
Well, we can certainly
use your help

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.480
in having that conversation
and figuring that out.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.880
But I've laid out a
number of statistics

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.590
and a number of issues
in breast cancer

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.260
to tell you how we really
haven't made progress.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.970
And as an organization, we
were very frustrated by that.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.970
And in 2010, we decided
to do something about it.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.810
We were going to launch
a deadline campaign,

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.560
that we will know how to
end breast cancer by 2020.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.810
And we developed a
strategic approach

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.570
to that question, a
strategic plan of action

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.400
that is set out in
a blueprint that you

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.350
can see on our website.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.930
And I won't go into
a lot of detail

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.020
about that, except to talk
about the research arm of that,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.760
which is the Artemis Project.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.680
And our focus here is--

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.540
we looked around the
world of breast cancer

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.240
and said, where is--

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.612
where are we on breast cancer?

00:14:18.612 --> 00:14:20.570
What are the questions
that need to be answered

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.610
that aren't being addressed?

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.660
And there were two.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.290
One is primary prevention.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.310
How do we stop women and men
from getting breast cancer

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.570
to begin with?

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.600
And the second is this
idea of metastasis

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.480
and the spread of breast
cancer outside the breast.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.440
We know if it's in your breast
and doesn't go anywhere,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.040
you'll live.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.400
And we know if it goes
to an organ, you won't.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.750
So what's happening in between?

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.330
No one was really
looking at that.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.387
They were looking at what to
do once it's in that organ.

00:14:50.387 --> 00:14:51.470
But how does it get there?

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.950
How can we stop it?

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.220
And so those are the two
areas that we decided

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.380
to focus on with
the Artemis Project

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.070
as part of our
deadline campaign.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.390
The Artemis Project is
a model for leadership.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.890
It is advocate-led, incredible
collaboration with scientists

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.490
from across the country
and other countries,

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.480
different focus.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.570
The one thing we ask of
the scientists we invite

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.090
and the advocates is
that you're innovative.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.730
You know how to be disruptive.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.420
You're a critical thinker.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.770
You are brave.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.895
You are willing to go
against the status quo.

00:15:24.895 --> 00:15:26.270
And you want to
come to the table

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.009
and work with patients
to make a difference.

00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:30.800
And so we have an
infrastructure that we've

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.430
created to launch and
maintain the Artemis Project,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.760
and it has been
incredibly successful.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.450
But it would not be
successful without someone

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.060
like Alana Whelm, who
is a scientist, who

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.900
meets all of those criteria,
and who comes to the table

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.010
willingly to work with
advocates to really achieve

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.950
the goal of ending
breast cancer.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.600
And so I'll turn this
over now to Alana.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.120
Thank you.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:01.954 --> 00:16:03.120
ALANA WELM: Hello, everyone.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.260
I would like to echo Fran in
thanking you for having us

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.460
here today.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.040
My job today is
to tell you where

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.350
we are in metastatic
cancer research

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.120
and in breast cancer research.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.480
I want to cover, again,
a little bit more

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.030
on the real issues
in breast cancer,

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.370
update you on research
and therapeutic advances,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.410
and then really try to convey
this urgent need we have

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.870
for new and
innovative approaches

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.360
that I think can be best
served through community

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.540
engagement in research.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.340
So I'll start by
another statistic.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.120
And Fran touched on this
already to some degree.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.260
So breast cancer awareness
has been a huge campaign

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.590
over the last few decades.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.950
And it's been successful.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.010
Breast cancer awareness is
not really the issue anymore.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.050
We're doing more
mammograms than ever.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.570
There's more early
diagnoses than ever.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.230
And yet, as Fran told you, we're
not making the kind of progress

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.580
we need to end this disease.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.579
And so the statistic you
can see on the screen

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.670
here is mortality.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.690
This is the number of people
who die per population

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.349
since the mid-1970s until now.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.069
And you can see we've
made some progress.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.440
So there are better treatments.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.359
There's new knowledge that
has led to better outcomes,

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.530
like reduction of hormone
replacement therapy use

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.822
has led to a decrease in
breast cancer mortality.

00:17:26.822 --> 00:17:28.530
But you can see on
this slide two things.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.550
One is we still have racial
disparities in breast cancer.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.440
And you can see that the rate
of progress, as Fran mentioned,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.920
is pretty steady.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.000
So we're not making these
big, monumental advances

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.880
that we need to make
to end this disease.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.110
At the end, we still have more
than 40,000 deaths per year

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.860
just in this country.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.365
That means just in the US,
there will be five deaths

00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:54.740
to breast cancer just in the
time that we're in this room

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.550
together.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.306
So we really have an urgent need
to make substantial progress.

00:18:00.306 --> 00:18:02.180
Now, why is it that we
haven't made progress?

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.670
So part of my job here today
is to try to convey to you

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.720
the complexity of breast cancer
and why it's so difficult.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.710
So the reality is that 90%
or more of deaths from breast

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.040
cancer-- again, half a million
in the world every year--

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.690
are caused by metastasis.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.570
That's when the disease
spreads outside of the breast

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.160
to other organs.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.340
Breast cancer likes to
live in all different parts

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.550
of the body.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.180
It starts in the bones--
that's the most common site--

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.385
but then spreads to other
organs and, unfortunately,

00:18:31.385 --> 00:18:32.960
is incurable.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.000
The trick though,
is that it's not

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.120
so easy as catching
the tumor early

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.610
and thereby preventing
metastasis, getting it

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.470
before it metastasizes.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.620
Those 20% to 30% of breast
cancers that eventually

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.760
come back as metastatic
disease do so probably

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.280
before they're ever
diagnosed, probably when

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.900
the tumor is developing.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.930
So there's a biology there
where early detection doesn't

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:01.640
seem to be helping whether
or not these tumors can

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.520
spread and recur later.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.530
Breast cancer is not
a single disease.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.850
That's another complexity.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.670
We think of it as one
disease, but probably, there's

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.860
at least 15 different
types of breast cancer.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.630
Every tumor is different.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.430
Breast cancer is not
one of those cancer

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.600
that's driven by a
particular genetic signature.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.850
The heterogeneity is
incredible, so that

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.450
makes it very difficult.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.010
So as I mentioned, some of
these tumors, that 20% to 30%,

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.770
have the ability to metastasize
while they're forming,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.720
before they're even diagnosed.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.170
And then what happens is they
hide out in the body, typically

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:36.710
the bones.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.330
But that's also an easy
place for us to look.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.150
So our data is a bit skewed.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.870
They hide out undetected.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.190
There's no evidence of
disease, and then in some--

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.100
for some reason,
they can grow later.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.430
And this can happen one year
later, three years later,

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.300
or even decades later.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.180
So it's this of
clinical dormancy

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.040
that that really is a mystery.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.550
Because we can't
see these cells.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.710
We know nothing about
what makes them grow

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.150
or what makes them not grow.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.350
Again, this is only 20%
to 30% of cases in which

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.750
these cancers come back.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.670
When they grow, for some reason,
the disease is incurable.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.670
And we don't know why.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.320
We don't know why that is.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.780
And so we really
need research that's

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.370
focused on how to treat these
metastases when they arise

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.110
and also how to
personalize therapy.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.260
Because as I said, every
breast cancer is different.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.390
So I think that the ability
to treat metastasis,

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:39.920
it has been a growing effort
in the breast cancer community.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.250
Most clinical trials
that are started

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.430
are done in patients
with metastatic disease.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.800
But we still need to
make a lot more progress.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.220
I wanted to talk just
for a second about sort

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.280
of a state of the art
in personalized therapy,

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.790
where we can actually now take
patients' tumors as they're

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.330
harvested at surgery and
grow those in different model

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.630
systems in the lab in
order to actually test

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.340
the genetics of the
tumor, as well as

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.410
what drugs it might respond to.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.080
So this would give a
more personalized view

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.980
of the susceptibilities
of those cancers

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.990
to, hopefully, direct therapy.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.160
The challenge is
that this takes time.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.720
And once a tumor is metastatic,
sometimes the disease

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.919
progresses too quickly
to have that outcome.

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:30.460
The reason I'm
telling you about this

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.250
is because I wanted to
give you a little bit

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.270
of a personal story,
because this just gives you

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:42.280
a view of how metastatic breast
cancer most typically arises.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.810
And it's too typical.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.580
So I'm going to tell
you about Mandi.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.970
Mandi was a young woman
diagnosed with breast cancer

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.870
at age 29.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.340
She had a very small tumor.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.060
It expressed the
estrogen receptor,

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.790
so it was the good kind to have.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.640
Because it means it could be
treated with hormone therapy.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.610
She had surgery.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.870
She had radiation, chemotherapy,
all the usual breast cancer

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.330
treatment, even
though no one knew

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.690
if her disease would come back.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.600
So those are all
just-in-case measures,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.660
because again, we don't
know who are the 20% to 30%

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.700
whose tumors might
come back later.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.166
She endured that therapy,
and she was a survivor.

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:18.040
Unfortunately, three
years later, her disease

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.100
did recur, initially in the
bones, and then the lungs.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.850
But now, it had changed, so it
had lost the estrogen receptor.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.040
But luckily, it had turned
on another gene, called

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.970
HER2, which made it susceptible
to another very famous

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.792
treatment, called Herceptin.

00:22:32.792 --> 00:22:34.250
And that worked
for a little while,

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.520
but then disease started
popping up in other places,

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.250
like the brain, the
ovaries, and other places.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.620
Eventually, it lost the
HER2, so the Herceptin

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.420
was no longer effective.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.080
The whole point of this is that
the cancers are heterogeneous.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.430
They're changing.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:49.670
And we can't see them.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.710
So we don't know how to
treat these metastatic cases.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.600
Unfortunately, her
disease progressed

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.730
before we could get her on any
other experimental therapies.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.530
And she couldn't
tolerate more toxicities.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.680
These therapies can
be very, very toxic.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.380
And unfortunately, she
passed away earlier this year

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.460
at the age of 36.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.940
So Mandi used to
say to me, I feel

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.520
like I'm playing whack-a-mole.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.130
She used to say that, the
therapies that are given

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.870
are just-- they do work.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.040
They're FDA-approved.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.980
But they're trial and error.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.750
So another tumor pops
up, and then we treat it.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.750
And then another tumor
pops up, and we treat it.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.960
But it's just like whack-a-mole.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.610
And this made me start
thinking about this.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.040
And you know the
whack-a-mole game.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.010
But really, this is so much
more complex, where you have--

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:43.170
essentially, this is a picture
of a 3D whack-a-mole game,

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.620
where these moles
are popping up,

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.000
and you're trying to whack them.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.190
But you have to be
careful that you're not

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.046
killing the host tissue as
well with these toxicities.

00:23:52.046 --> 00:23:53.420
So that's something
that I think,

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.900
it's always a balance between
finding the best therapy

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:02.350
and trying to not
have as much toxicity.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:07.210
So why or why haven't we made
enough progress against deaths

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.560
from breast cancer?

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.690
To date, I'd say the
main focus on research

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.840
has really been on that primary
tumor that's in the breast.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.500
The reason?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.610
It's easy to get.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.450
We can't do much research
in humans, obviously.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.090
And these metastases
that arise in patients

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.250
are typically very, very
difficult to obtain.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.030
So in lieu of that,
we have to try

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.001
to develop sophisticated
model systems,

00:24:30.001 --> 00:24:31.750
like the one I told
you about before where

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.300
we grow patients' tumors in
the lab to try to figure out

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.400
what drugs might work.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.520
And it's not that there
has been no progress.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.840
New therapies have
been approved.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.300
We have new CDK4/6
inhibitors, and there's

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.310
excitement about immunotherapy.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.140
It's just that each
of those therapies

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.610
typically helps
for a little while.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.120
But then, ultimately,
there's resistance,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.540
and it doesn't extend life
as long as we would like.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.050
So really, to prevent
death from breast cancer,

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.100
we have to figure out
how to treat metastasis

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.190
and how to prevent it from ever
happening in the first place

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.630
or, as Fran
mentioned, of course,

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.020
prevent breast cancer
from arising at all, even

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.910
in the breast.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.420
So there is a fair amount of
excitement about immunotherapy.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.050
And I get asked
about this a lot,

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.390
so I thought I'd just
give you the overview.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.150
That the concept
here is that you

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.700
could use your immune
system and activate it

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.770
so that it would hunt out
those cancer cells that

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.340
are hiding in the body.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.160
And that's really
attractive, because then,

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.980
we don't have to know
anything about what's

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.210
driving those tumors.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.000
What is the genetic propensity?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.370
Or which ones are
going to grow where?

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.530
What targeted therapy
should we use?

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.960
Just think of any
virus that you've had.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.770
You can't see that.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:48.670
You don't know what it is.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.690
You know you're sick.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.270
But then, you can actually--
your immune system

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:57.220
will target that virus and
kill it, and you get better.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.470
So immunotherapy has
had amazing advances

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.570
in diseases like melanoma,
in metastatic melanoma,

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.910
and certain types
of lung cancers.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.850
It's not working very
well yet in breast cancer.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.340
The response rates are
still pretty small,

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.760
around 10% to 20%, with
eventual progression

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.040
in most of those cases.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.540
But because of the
excitement, there

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.600
are thousands and thousands
of clinical trials now

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.200
that are testing immunotherapies
and often combining

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.970
those with other therapies
that already exist.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.210
So we really need more research.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.400
It's really important
that we understand

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.330
the biology of how to make these
combinations so that we're not

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.660
just combining therapies,
essentially, blindly

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.780
and causing unnecessary
toxicities in order--

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.800
for the hope to have
better outcomes.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.660
The attractive
thing if this works,

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.170
though, is that immunotherapy,
such as a vaccine, for example,

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.310
could be applied to either treat
metastatic disease, prevent

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.830
those metastatic cells
from growing out,

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.420
or primary prevention.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.520
So that brings me back
to the Artemis Project

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.670
that Fran mentioned.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.770
She emphasized that
this really was

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.290
an advocate-driven initiative.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.930
So this is breast cancer
patients and survivors

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.900
have gotten together and said,
here's the urgent issues,

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.930
and asked the scientists
and clinicians to help work

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.280
toward this problem.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.940
I have found it just incredibly
transformative, actually,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.070
in my science to be
involved in this project,

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.250
so I'm very happy
to be involved.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.290
As Fran mentioned,
there's two key areas.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.440
I thought I'd just give you
a little tidbit as to where

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.380
we're going in the scientific
direction of those areas.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.870
The first area is to
prevent breast cancer

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.840
from-- in the first place,
so primary prevention.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.480
And the group has really come
up with a vaccine strategy

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.260
to try to do that, where we
would be immunizing against six

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.110
particular proteins
that get turned on

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.430
only when cancer cell--

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.310
only when breast cells
are turning into cancer.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.470
The idea is that
your immune system

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.590
would be primed to recognize
expression of those proteins

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.330
and kill those cancer
cells before they

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.730
can form an actual tumor.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.292
Initially, this is intended
for high-risk individuals.

00:28:07.292 --> 00:28:08.750
There are people
who know they have

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.330
a very high risk of developing
breast cancer because

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.670
of the family
history, for example.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.350
The other area,
as Fran, mentioned

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.760
is preventing metastasis.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.100
If we can prevent
cancers from coming back

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.520
outside of the breast, we
would essentially prevent death

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.180
from breast cancer.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.580
So the goal here is
to try to figure out,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.210
how do we know who
has dormant cells?

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.700
As I said, only
20% to 30% of cases

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.170
have these cells
that have spread

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.430
and will eventually recur.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.280
But we do not know how to
identify who those people are.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.970
We don't know how to treat
something that we can't see.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:41.900
We can't detect it.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.817
We can't measure it.

00:28:42.817 --> 00:28:44.150
We don't know anything about it.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.850
So how can we possibly treat it?

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.600
The idea would be to eliminate
these dormant cells before they

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.840
become incurable,
after they've grown,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.300
or to find ways to
keep the cells dormant.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.620
If somebody lives with dormant
cancer cells in their bone

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.890
marrow their whole
life, so be it.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.960
That could be a
perfectly good outcome.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.930
Of course, these two efforts
in the Artemis Project

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.900
are orchestrated alongside
all the usual scientific

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.510
and clinical research that's
going on in breast cancer.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.150
As Fran mentioned, we
have to take all avenues.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.540
We have to continue to figure
out how to treat breast cancer,

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.400
how to treat metastatic disease.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.070
But we think taking these
two approaches could

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:29.120
have major long-term
impact in the disease.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.860
So the big question,
then, is how

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.050
do we know who has
the dormant cells?

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.320
And how do we treat something
we can't see or measure?

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.270
And the challenge
really is that we

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:42.540
don't have these kinds of
samples to be able to look at.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.710
So this is where I think
advocate engagement

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.999
and community engagement can
be really transformative.

00:29:48.999 --> 00:29:50.540
This is something
we've been thinking

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:54.020
a lot about in the Artemis
Project, where we really

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.320
have to re-prioritize
the agenda and focus

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.190
on the urgency of the problem.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:02.330
If we really need to understand
this particular question,

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.980
we have to figure
out a way to do it.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.790
And so we have to
think outside the box.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.950
And I think we need to
engage our whole community,

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.500
because we've all been
touched by breast cancer

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.180
in some way or another.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.510
We all are responsible
for ending this disease.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.520
So in the Artemis
Project, one example

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.090
is we identified the
questions related

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.550
to how to prevent metastasis.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.250
Who has the dormant cells
that are going to grow?

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.900
And what do they
look like so that we

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.200
can try to treat those
or keep them dormant?

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.530
We work together through
a series of workshops

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.500
and think-tanks, where
we have breast cancer

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.080
advocates and patients
working directly

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.860
alongside the researchers
and scientists

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.500
and really designed
approaches that we think

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.840
could answer these
questions and could give us

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.710
the key to what is the
transformative therapy

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.590
or therapies that could
prevent metastasis.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.700
And now, really, our job
is to try to execute.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.130
Of course, that's
easier said than done.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.940
We have-- just as
example, we have an idea

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.960
for a really global
patient-advocate driven

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.080
network or partnership,
where we could potentially

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.370
try to engage people to acquire
those specimens that are needed

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.730
to look at those dormant cells
and to try to determine what

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.090
might be their Achilles heel
that we could target in order

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.020
to prevent them from ever
growing or to kill them.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.230
I think we need
a unified effort.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.670
Everyone, as I said, is
affected by breast cancer.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.860
But we all need to be invested.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.570
So there are a lot
of different groups.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.250
Some focus on awareness.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.810
Some focus on early detection.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:46.390
Some focus on access to care or
disparities in breast cancer.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.970
Some want to focus just on,
how do we treat metastasis?

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.310
Some want to focus on, how
do we prevent breast cancer?

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.800
We all need to work
together so that we

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.560
can have a unified
effort to this problem.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.100
We need to use every
avenue, as Fran said.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.950
And I also want to emphasize
it's not as though we

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.540
aren't making any progress.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.390
We are learning a lot about
the biology of breast cancer.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.420
But it's incremental.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.147
It's too slow.

00:32:11.147 --> 00:32:12.730
We understand more
about the genetics.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.896
We understand more about
the tumor microenvironment.

00:32:14.896 --> 00:32:17.350
But we really need to just
all come together and try

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:22.820
to figure out a new approach to
make this more transformative.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.530
And I think these innovative
partnerships between advocates,

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.810
researchers, clinicians,
and the community

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.340
is really the key,
the way to go.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.270
We need to think big,
and we need to be bold.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.930
The Deadline Campaign
is very bold.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.549
It was heavily criticized
for being so bold,

00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:40.840
but this is what we have to do.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.090
If we don't challenge
ourselves to do this,

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.650
we won't make the
progress we need.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.800
And people will keep
dying of this disease.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.860
I would say that we really need
to stop thinking that we're

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.960
limited by what we can do.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.760
Well, I can't study
those dormant cells,

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.500
because I can't get the samples.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.180
Or I don't know
what they look like.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.950
We have to start
just figuring out

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.500
how to do what we can't do
yet and make it possible.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.070
So I think that being able
to engage in the community

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.700
and put our heads together,
very innovative people,

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.730
such as Googlers, might be able
to help us with that problem.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:14.919
So what can you do?

00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:16.960
Working with the National
Breast Cancer Coalition

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.240
has been, as I said,
transformative for me.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.730
I'm very passionate
about this work.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.660
I think that the mission to
end breast cancer is spot on.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.220
And this is the
way to get it done.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.670
I think we need to use
innovation and think about,

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.860
how could technology
help us in this issue?

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.010
How can we organize
this grassroots movement

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.390
and get people
involved in science

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.990
and really tackle this problem?

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.550
You can get educated
about breast cancer.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.730
Fran talked about the
Project LEAD program

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.800
that the NBCC holds.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.570
It's an excellent program.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.820
And just think about how
to join the collaboration

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.020
with researchers and advocates,
such as in the Artemis Project,

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.820
whether you're a
scientist or you just

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.000
want to advocate for
the end of this disease.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.910
We have the website there for
Breast Cancer Deadline 2020.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.100
And I think we're prepared
to take questions,

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:06.850
if there are any.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.360
AUDIENCE: My question is
on the prevention side.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.940
I read a lot about
environmental causes,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.400
and it's really hard for
me to parse out what's real

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.739
or what's fake-- fake
news, fake science.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.610
So I'd love to hear
a little bit from you

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.480
both in terms of the
environmental potential impacts

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.820
or anything that's not
potentially part of this.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.710
FRAN VISCO: So the one thing
we know environmentally

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:41.370
that causes breast cancer
is radiation, but radiation

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.790
at a certain level.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:47.130
So for example, individuals
who had a type of lymphoma

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.219
when they were young and
had whole body radiation

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.469
and heavy doses
of radiation, they

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.440
are very likely to be
diagnosed with breast cancer

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.090
later in life.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.810
In terms of the external
environment chemicals and that,

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.990
we really don't have
high-level evidence

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.480
that there is a
direct relationship

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.200
between exposure to
an environmental toxin

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.660
and getting breast cancer.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.220
All of the information
that we have

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.620
is pretty low-level evidence.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:21.060
They're weak correlations,
except maybe DDT was something

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.740
that had some strong evidence.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.310
So what NBCC has tried
to do in the past,

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.840
unfortunately, unsuccessfully,
was develop public policy

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.670
that we would have
a grant program that

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.940
would create a collaboration
between institutions

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.020
and community groups
across the country

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.910
that, together, they could
develop a strategic approach

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.950
to addressing these questions.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.990
Because too often,
we've seen people think,

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.190
well, it's pesticides.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.410
And then you run down
that road before you

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.990
have the evidence that that's
actually the right road

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.010
to take.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.430
And so we want to be more
analytical and critical

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.040
about it, and make
sure that we're using

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.330
our resources in the right way.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:06.360
So what do we know?

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.870
And it's not much.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.160
But again, there is no
high-level strong evidence

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.131
of a direct connection between
environmental toxins and breast

00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:15.630
cancer.

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:20.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you both.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.836
This was really
interesting and motivating.

00:36:22.836 --> 00:36:24.710
You talked about how
the internet has changed

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:27.140
the impact of petitions
and gathering signatures

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.320
and really, the
ability for that to be

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.120
leveraged in conversation.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.130
Can you also talk a
little bit about how

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.960
the internet has
changed your ability

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.250
to get sustained funding?

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:41.330
I think about GoFundMe and
really like raising money

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:45.110
for individuals in their moment
of need versus organizations

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.740
or research.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.694
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:36:47.694 --> 00:36:49.610
FRAN VISCO: Well, we
haven't figured out a way

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:57.314
to use the internet and social
media to fund our organization.

00:36:57.314 --> 00:36:59.480
And I think others would
agree with this, the people

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.190
that I speak to in other
groups significantly.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:05.780
I think, yes, if
there's a disaster,

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:12.110
like the earthquake in Haiti
or a flood in Louisiana,

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.740
people respond to the
disaster and give money.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.850
If there is an individual,
as you mentioned,

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:23.210
people respond, GoFundMe,
as an individual

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.430
with an emotional appeal.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.340
But using the internet
and social media

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.990
to raise money for a complicated
organization with a pretty

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:36.770
complex agenda but a
pretty clear mission,

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.790
we haven't figured out
how to do that yet.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.540
And I don't know anyone who
has, outside of the ice bucket

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.340
challenge.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.800
Outside of that, I
haven't seen or heard

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.267
of anyone being successful.

00:37:47.267 --> 00:37:49.100
And if you have ideas
about that, boy, would

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.930
I love to hear them.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.360
ALANA WELM: I could also try
to add about research funding

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.120
as well.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.020
So the kind of scale
of research funding

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.540
that we really need to
do the kinds of things

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.420
that I'm talking about, which
is really change the agenda

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.480
and try to do things
we've never done before,

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.130
that kind of
funding really needs

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:11.270
to come from larger sources,
like the federal government.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.950
There are organizations who
do crowdsourcing campaigns.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.560
And everything helps
to some degree,

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.580
but I think we're talking
about trying to really make

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.810
this a movement,
where we can all

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.780
come up with a strategy
that would be really big.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.850
It's bigger than any
one research project

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.370
or another research project.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.720
It's a movement that I think--

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.430
again, ideas of how we can use
technology to stimulate this

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.664
are welcome for sure.

00:38:43.664 --> 00:38:45.080
FRAN VISCO: Well,
I think you also

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.490
see GoFundMe for an
individual scientist who

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.510
starts a GoFundMe page
to fund research--

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.980
their individual research.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.060
And if you don't know,
it all sounds good.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.930
So if you want to be careful
about what you invest in,

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:05.180
and if you want to invest
in something that's actually

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.270
going to make a difference,
it's not an easy thing to do.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.220
Because you really
have to understand

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.620
the complexity of
the issues in order

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.550
to make that kind of decision.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:18.620
And that's one of the things we
educate and train people to do.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.120
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple questions.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.440
I'll try to separate them out.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.084
The first question
is, here at Google,

00:39:23.084 --> 00:39:25.250
we hear a lot about machine
learning and the ability

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:31.940
to manipulate genes to use data,
to identify trends, and then

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.040
scale those learnings
more quickly than we've

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.860
done in the past.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.280
I wondered if you could
comment on how, if at all,

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.930
that's affecting
your research today.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.460
And then on the
flip side of that,

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.510
I also wanted to understand
when you were talking

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.970
about your strategies, how you
think about things like BRCA

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:51.380
and how you approach
individuals who already have

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.480
a predisposition, or
if you sort of see that

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:59.590
as a separate strategy that
is maybe over-utilized.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.690
ALANA WELM: Well I can take
the first one, I think, first.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.714
So with regard to
machine learning

00:40:05.714 --> 00:40:07.130
and how that's
affecting research,

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.540
I think that, really, it
comes down to big data.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.630
So I think we all
kind of thought

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.050
that the genetics of breast
cancer and many other cancers

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.430
would solve the problem.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.260
We just had to sequence
a lot of tumors,

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.980
and then we would understand
what is the Achilles heel.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.259
And we would develop
therapies for those things.

00:40:23.259 --> 00:40:24.800
And what we learned
in breast cancer,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.510
unfortunately, was very little.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.450
What we learned is every
tumor is different.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:36.460
There's not another
BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.500
But we still need to
try to integrate--

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.050
what that leads to is
really bigger data.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.720
And maybe we have even more of
a need for machine learning.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.080
Because what we know is we have
to integrate that genetic data

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.310
with also tumor microenvironment
data and maybe even lifestyle

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:56.660
data in order to really make
algorithms that could predict

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.970
not only whether the
disease will spread

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:01.730
and who needs to be
treated, but with what.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.520
So it's an credibly
complex challenge.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.300
We do have one research
project in my lab

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.060
where, as I mentioned, we try
to take personalized approaches

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.260
in growing patients'
tumors and testing drugs.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.384
If we can do that on
a large enough scale--

00:41:17.384 --> 00:41:19.050
I think we're past
the point of thinking

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.210
that we can do that
for any one individual,

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.860
because it just takes too long.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.330
It's infeasible.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.090
But if we can do this
for enough tumors,

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.430
then we can use machine
learning to try to figure out,

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.740
what are the features of
the tumors that respond

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.320
to a drug A and not drug B?

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.664
And then take that and apply
it, now, to the population.

00:41:37.664 --> 00:41:39.580
So that's kind of where
we're going with that.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.430
But breast cancer
so heterogeneous

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:47.077
that it's been much, much more
difficult than we ever thought.

00:41:47.077 --> 00:41:48.660
FRAN VISCO: I think
one of the issues,

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.350
as advocates, we have
with the focus on data

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:56.370
and accumulating data,
that someone's used--

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.850
people use those
data prematurely.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:04.890
So you see a trend or a
pattern in a population,

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.190
and you decide that's a place
to intervene before we really

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.640
understand if that trend
is meaningful in terms

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.980
of mortality or
lethality, or if it's just

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.470
going to add to
the over-diagnosis

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:20.160
and over-treatment that we have
now, which is not a good thing.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.330
And we do a lot more of bad than
we do good for the population.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.020
And so we're very
concerned about data

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.620
and how it's used well.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.030
Just very quickly-- one of
the projects that we have is

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.070
called DNA Land.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:39.740
And I know you all know about
23andMe and Ancestry.com,

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:40.820
et cetera.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:46.110
So we're asking individuals,
who have had the sequencing done

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:50.310
from, by, through one
of those programs,

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.170
to send their data to
DNA Land and answer

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.250
a short clinical questionnaire
about breast cancer.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:03.510
And we're going to try to see
how the data links to a risk--

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.130
higher risk of breast
cancer, but more importantly,

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.880
how it relates to
progression of breast cancer.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.210
And the advocates are going
to control the database.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.850
And we're going to make it
available to any scientists who

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:17.470
want it, if they meet
certain criteria.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.680
So to that extent,
we thin data is

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.180
important as a research tool.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.580
But as an intervention,
we're pretty concerned

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.460
about the abuse of
that information.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.480
In terms of the
BRCA1 and BRCA2--

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.730
as an organization, we
don't focus on any one

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:33.960
type of breast cancer.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.310
We focus on all breast cancer
and ending all breast cancer.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:42.420
What we have done in the
area of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.789
we work very hard to--

00:43:43.789 --> 00:43:46.080
ALANA WELM: Does everyone
know what BRCA1 and BRCA2 is?

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.450
FRAN VISCO: So if
you don't, that

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:53.130
is a gene that was cloned
back in the '90s that puts you

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:57.570
at higher risk of
getting breast cancer--

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.160
significantly high risk
of getting breast cancer.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.070
And it's linked
to family history.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:06.570
And so that particular
gene, we work

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:09.600
in terms of making certain that
public policy, that everything

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.150
that's done in that
area, that there

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.490
is a connection to
genetic counseling,

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.917
that people understand the
importance of genetic--

00:44:16.917 --> 00:44:18.750
that there's funding
for genetic counseling,

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.120
that there are enough
genetic cancers.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:26.220
We work on clinical trials,
like the PARP inhibitor trials.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.660
We work on those trials.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.250
Clinical trials
is another project

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.420
that we do that I didn't
have time to go into.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.140
And we work on telling
the world that if you

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.580
have a genetic test, and you
see that you're BRCA positive,

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:45.960
your choice right now is
to cut off healthy breasts.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.610
And that is not a
choice anyone should

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.844
have to make in
order-- so this is not

00:44:49.844 --> 00:44:51.510
a good-- it's not
like we have an answer

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.160
if you have a genetic test.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:57.450
So we think, to a large extent,
that it is a research tool.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.770
And we should
understand it as such.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.420
So it's about
education, training,

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.450
making certain public
policies, and working

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.660
on treatment and interventions
for that population.

00:45:09.717 --> 00:45:11.300
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming in.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.050
And thank you, Laura,
for setting this up.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.880
My question is around kind
of maybe on the heels of Jen.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.930
I was pretty surprised to
see the very slow movement

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.360
of progress to find a cure.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.490
How often do all of
the different breast

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:27.320
cancer foundations
and associations get

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.140
together to-- obviously,
everybody's goal

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.030
is to save lives.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.910
But is there a lot
of stepping on toes?

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.170
I don't understand how that--

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.270
the organization
world works when

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.760
there are so many that
are striving, it seems,

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.210
to the same goal.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.090
So can you explain a
little bit on that?

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:45.423
FRAN VISCO: So it's interesting.

00:45:45.423 --> 00:45:48.830
When I was diagnosed with breast
cancer, I was 39 years old.

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.020
I was a partner in a law
firm in Philadelphia.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.360
My son was 14 months old.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.000
I sat on nonprofit
boards, mostly

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.010
to do with women's issues.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:00.290
And here, then, I come
into this whole new world,

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.950
the nonprofit at a different
level and breast cancer

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.130
advocacy.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:10.280
And I was stunned
by the politics

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.290
of that world and
the competition

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:16.340
and the, what is
your real mission?

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.420
What is your real goal?

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.040
I was stunned by that.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.880
So the reason why I got involved
in the beginning of NBCC

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.900
was because it is a
coalition of organizations.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:31.670
Our board of directors
of our policy arm is--

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:35.810
they're representatives from
25 organizations that are

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.790
diverse in every way possible--

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:39.410
I mean, even
politically diverse.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.600
They're really diverse.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.690
Because we believe that if
we're going to change systems,

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.570
we have to have the very
diverse perspective that

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.800
is breast cancer.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.730
It shouldn't be what five
middle class white women think

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.424
should happen in breast cancer.

00:46:55.424 --> 00:46:56.090
It shouldn't be.

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:59.630
So so we do work
with a coalition

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.930
of very different organizations
to do this system change

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.030
type of work that we do.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:09.530
In terms of funding, we
don't directly fund research.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.890
But the organizations
that do, do come together

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.050
at least once a year
with the government

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:19.790
funders to look at portfolios
and see what's happening.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.620
But in terms of
other issues, it's

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.840
impossible to really
work together,

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.340
because we really don't
all have the same goal.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.580
And some organizations,
their goal

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.430
is very narrow
and very specific,

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.010
and it can be at odds
with a broader approach

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:38.190
to breast cancer.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:39.920
So if your goal
is to make certain

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.120
that everyone has a mammogram,
that is not our goal.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.490
Because we understand the
significant limitations

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.230
of that, and that is not
going to end breast cancer,

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.740
so we will not work together--
not that we choose not to.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.670
We just don't have an
opportunity to work together.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:58.730
But our coalition is a
very diverse coalition

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.710
of different organizations.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:04.280
ALANA WELM: I would like to
see, on a much broader level,

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.480
more acknowledgment that
it's true we don't all

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.040
have the same goal--

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.400
immediate goal, right.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.910
But I think we all want
to end breast cancer.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.100
That's the overarching goal.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.120
And I think that we could
use a more unified effort

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.350
in that area.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:26.970
And I think if we could unify
around just the acknowledgment

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:30.110
that we have to
do better, then I

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:34.765
think that that would be a
step forward in progress.

00:48:34.765 --> 00:48:36.140
LAURA MILLER: How
well-researched

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.720
has breast cancer been
studied in populations,

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.860
such as transgender
women, intersex folks,

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.951
or on men who have
(STUMBLING) gynecomastia?

00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:45.950
ALANA WELM: Gynecomastia

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:48.230
LAURA MILLER: Gynecomastia.

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.150
ALANA WELM: Not well enough.

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:55.820
I think these are rare
cases of breast cancer.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.520
Even male breast cancer,
which, as Fran pointed out,

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:03.830
is more common than most people
are aware, is understudied.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:06.560
There are certain subtypes
of women's breast cancers

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.670
that are understudied.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.040
And that really is because
breast cancer is not

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.160
one disease.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.820
It's many, many
different diseases.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.890
And so we don't have good
research representation

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.750
in these sort of
small subsets, in part

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.960
because there's probably
not as much funding

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.340
for that type of research.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.270
And also, there's not
the samples available.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.150
It would be very hard to
study even male breast

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:36.070
cancer, for example,
if your institution has

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.650
one case per year, for example.

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:42.200
So it is a challenge for sure.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.460
AUDIENCE: What's different
in October 2017 than, say,

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:50.840
October 2015 in terms of your
challenges in getting funding

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.150
and unifying a coalition,
getting the support you need

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:55.130
from the federal government?

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.170
FRAN VISCO: OK, so two things.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.780
Let me answer a
different question

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.010
first about what's different.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:05.660
Because I was diagnosed in 1987.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:10.430
If I were diagnosed today, I
would get the same treatment.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:16.520
So not much has changed in terms
of interventions and therapies.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.070
In terms of what's
different a year ago,

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:23.386
it's harder and harder and
more difficult to raise money.

00:50:23.386 --> 00:50:25.010
Is that your question,
raising funding?

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.220
So it's much more difficult
to raise money, I think--

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.960
in large part because of the
proliferation of breast cancer

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.160
groups.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.550
So when we started the
coalition 25 years ago,

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:40.340
there weren't very many groups.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.810
There was one group
in Pennsylvania.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:46.010
Now, I say, I wake up every
day, and there is at least 1,000

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.360
more.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.020
And some people think
that's wonderful.

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.430
Some people think it's not.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:56.000
Because it dilutes the
message, and it also

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.490
dilutes your ability
to really raise funds.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.550
Because it's being spread
around so many different places.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.700
And so for us, it's
become more and more

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.590
difficult to raise funding.

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:10.100
We do not take government money.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.430
So none of our funding come
from the federal government.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.000
We lobby for a government
appropriations that

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.550
go to the worldwide
scientific community,

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:24.200
and we have a seat at the
table in those federal programs

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.020
to help influence how
the funds are spent.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.790
But none of that
money comes to us.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:31.340
And I always say if it did, we
would have ended breast cancer

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.390
already, but it doesn't.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.890
You

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.681
We have a limitation
on the amount of funds

00:51:35.681 --> 00:51:37.360
we'll take from drug companies.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.440
It's only 15% of our budget.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.470
And we're very careful
how that money is used.

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:44.750
So it's very difficult,
because we have never

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.660
spent time marketing ourselves.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:48.650
We don't spend time.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.480
We don't spend
financial resources.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.450
We've always just
focused on our mission.

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:54.830
Does that answer your question?

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:55.790
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.380
ALANA WELM: On
the research side,

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:01.280
funding is just getting tighter
and tighter and tighter.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.940
Right now at the National Cancer
Institute, it's around 10%

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.210
of grants that are
submitted get funded.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:13.340
And it's not as though
90% are not worth doing.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.340
We have a very important
breast cancer research program

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.710
at the Department of Defense.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:20.995
It's also extremely
competitive to get funding.

00:52:20.995 --> 00:52:24.540
And unfortunately, that program
this is really in jeopardy,

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.090
I think, right now.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.760
So yeah, it's getting it's
getting harder and harder.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.030
FRAN VISCO: I think, though, you
have to ask the question, what

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.550
should get funded?

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:39.650
It's not only 10% get funded.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.110
Which of those
100% of proposals,

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:43.970
which should get funded?

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.620
Because it really
may be that we have,

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.200
maybe, too many scientists
and too many people

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.760
asking duplicative, old,
not important questions.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.720
So what's the strategic
approach to figuring out

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.620
the right amount of funding,
looking at it really critically

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:05.060
and saying, what do we need
to do to end breast cancer?

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.100
Who is doing it?

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.930
Who can do it?

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.420
How much money does that take?

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.837
And we don't ask the question
that Way I mean, we do, but.

00:53:13.837 --> 00:53:16.128
AUDIENCE: And how do we
[INAUDIBLE] those organizations

00:53:16.128 --> 00:53:18.740
to take the risk on the
out-of-the-box thinking when it

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.710
may be perceived as a more
conservative approach to invest

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.960
in tried and true same
questions over and over.

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:24.770
FRAN VISCO: And
that's what happen.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.270
ALANA WELM: But
that's where I think

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.090
that the community and advocate
partnership with research

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:30.980
can make a huge difference.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.980
Because then, we can set the
agenda and the priorities of,

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.210
what is the most impactful
way to address this disease

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:39.740
and end it?

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.320
And maybe that's different
than the way we've normally

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.040
been funding research.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.720
So I think that that's the kind
of thing we're looking for,

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.580
is this kind of
big thinking that

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.910
could make a big difference.

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:54.920
Not saying we have to stop the
science the way it's going,

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.712
but we have to do more.

00:53:56.712 --> 00:53:58.670
AUDIENCE: I know we're
out of time, but maybe--

00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:59.211
I don't know.

00:53:59.211 --> 00:54:00.500
This is a quick question.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.180
Just kind of
heartbroken to hear you

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.310
say that the treatment
hasn't really

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:07.920
materialized since you
were diagnosis in '89.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.840
And for any of us women who've
had to have a mammogram or, god

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.240
forbid, a needle
biopsy, you sometimes

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.490
think, if a guy had
to go through this,

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.290
I think this would have changed.

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:20.450
I think this all the time.

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:24.740
And I'm just wondering if the
reason we haven't experienced

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.410
the change has anything
to do that this

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.540
is a women's,
predominately, issue,

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.810
or if it's really a
lack of the answers?

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:36.230
FRAN VISCO: I think that
it's a complicated disease

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:38.000
because it's in women.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.600
And we have pretty complicated
bodies and biology.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.720
I think that, yes,
for a long time,

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.200
women were not included in
clinical trials at the NCI,

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.450
because they were more
difficult to study.

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:53.324
There wasn't a lot of
funding in breast cancer.

00:54:53.324 --> 00:54:55.490
But there wasn't a lot of
funding in prostate cancer

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:56.640
either.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:00.770
And we really haven't come
much further in prostate cancer

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:03.790
as we have--

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:05.930
it's same almost
as breast cancer.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:10.920
So it is-- yes, because it's in
women, for a number of reasons,

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.320
but not completely
because of that.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.080
But I do want to say
one thing that there

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:19.730
have been some new therapies,
for example, Herceptin.

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:23.150
That's a therapy that is a
targeted therapy that-- we were

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.640
involved in the clinical
trials for that-- that

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:30.540
treats women who have HER2
over-expressed breast cancer.

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.810
And that's about 20%
of breast cancer.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:37.790
Before Herceptin, that was the
most aggressive breast cancer.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:41.810
Now, after Herceptin, it is one
of the least aggressive breast

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:42.330
cancers.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:47.390
So it has proven to be
effective in the adjuv setting.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.910
That's not in the
metastatic setting.

00:55:53.387 --> 00:55:54.220
LAURA MILLER: Great.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.790
Well, thank you so
much all for coming.

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:56.750
I really appreciate it.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.997
And thank you for sharing your
minds with my Google family.

00:55:59.997 --> 00:56:02.080
FRAN VISCO: And thank you,
Laura, for inviting us.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:02.770
ALANA WELM: Yes, thank you.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.103
FRAN VISCO: Thank you very much.

00:56:04.103 --> 00:56:06.420
