00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.730
So I have this
rectangular prism here.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.270
It's kind of the shape of
a brick or a fish tank,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.280
and it's made up of
these unit cubes.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.330
And each of these unit
cubes we're saying

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.400
is 1/4 of a foot by 1/4 of
a foot by 1/4 of a foot.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310
So you could almost
imagine that this

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.690
is-- so let me write it
this way-- a 1/4 of a foot

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.440
by 1/4 of a foot
by 1/4 of a foot.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.060
Those are its length,
height, and width,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.740
or depth, whatever
you want to call it.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.970
So given that,
what is the volume

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.524
of this entire rectangular
prism going to be?

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:42.190
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.270
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.754
You could first think about
the volume of each unit cube,

00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:48.920
and then think about how
many units cubes there are.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.790
So let's do that.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.580
The unit cube, its
volume is going

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:03.270
to be 1/4 of a foot times 1/4
of a foot times 1/4 of a foot.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.390
Or another way to think about
it is it's going to be 1/4 times

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.750
1/4 times 1/4 cubic
feet, which is often

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.840
written as feet to the
third power, cubic feet.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.560
So 1/4 times 1/4 is
1/16, times 1/4 is 1/64.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.800
So this is going to be 1
over 64 cubic feet, or 1/64

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.520
of a cubic foot.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.270
That's the volume
of each of these.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.950
That's the volume of
each of these unit cubes.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.410
Now, how many of them are there?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.780
Well, you could view them
as kind of these two layers.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.340
The first layer has 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.395
That's this first
layer right over here.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.150
And then we have the
second layer down here,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.970
which would be another 8.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.090
So it's going to
be 8 plus 8, or 16.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.400
So the total volume
here is going

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.039
to be 16 times 1/64
of a cubic foot, which

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:20.641
is going to be equal to
16/64 cubic feet, which

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.390
is the same thing.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.480
16/64 is the same thing as 1/4.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.220
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 16.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.540
This is the same thing
as 1/4 of a cubic foot.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.790
And that's our volume.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.210
Now, there's other ways that
you could have done this.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.430
You could have just thought
about the dimensions

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.680
of the length, the
width, and the height.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.330
The width right over here
is going to be 2 times

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.380
1/4 feet, which is
equal to 1/2 of a foot.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.110
The height here
is the same thing.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.850
So it's going to be 2
times 1/4 of a foot, which

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.640
is equal to 2/4,
or 1/2 of a foot.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.890
And then the length here
is 4 times 1/4 of a foot.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.800
Well, that's equal to 4/4 of a
foot, which is equal to 1 foot.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.610
So to figure out
the volume, we could

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:32.940
multiply the length times
the width times the height,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.150
and these little dots here,
these aren't decimals.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.140
I've written them
a little higher.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.056
These are another way.

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:38.610
It's a shorthand
for multiplication,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.270
instead of writing this
kind of x-looking thing,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.120
this cross-looking thing.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.100
So the length is 1.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.940
The width is 1/2 of
a foot, so times 1/2.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.710
And then the height
is another 1/2.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.540
Let me do it this way.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.740
The height is another 1/2, so
what's 1 times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.520
Well, that's going
to be equal to 1/4.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.386
And this is a foot.

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:06.010
This is a foot.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.840
This is a foot.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.670
So foot times foot
times foot, that's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.380
going to be feet to the
third power, or cubic feet.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.890
1/4 of a cubic
foot, either way we

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.829
got the same result,
which is good.
