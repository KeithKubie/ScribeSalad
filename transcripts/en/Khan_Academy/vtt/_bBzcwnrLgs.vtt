00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.700
- [Instructor] A satellite of
mass lowercase m orbits Earth

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.270
at radius capital R and speed
v naught as shown below.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.480
So this has mass lowercase m.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.880
An aerospace engineer decides
to launch a second satellite

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.840
that is double the mass
into the same orbit.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.280
So the same orbit, so this radius is still

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.760
gonna be capital R.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.510
And so this satellite,
the second satellite,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.220
has a mass of two m.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.210
The mass of Earth is M.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.480
So this is Earth right here, capital M.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.650
What is the speed, lowercase
v, of the heavier satellite

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.940
in terms of v naught?

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.840
And speed you can view as
the magnitude of velocity,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.380
and so that's why it's lowercase v

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.870
without a vector symbol on it.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.150
And so what we're trying to figure out,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.740
the magnitude of its velocity,
in order to stay in orbit.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.440
What is lowercase v going to be equal to?

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.400
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.742
on your own.

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:54.413
All right so to tackle this,
remember the whole reason

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:58.060
why something stays in
orbit instead of just going

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.100
in a straight line through
space is because there is going

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.090
to be a constant magnitude
centripetal acceleration

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.560
towards the center of
Earth that keeps turning

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.400
I guess you could say the
satellite in this circular path.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.890
And we've seen from other
videos that the magnitude

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.600
of our centripetal acceleration
is going to be equal

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.200
to the magnitude of our velocity,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.570
and I'll just use this first satellite,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.876
so the magnitude of its
velocity squared divided

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:29.863
by our radius, which in
this case is a capital R.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.740
But what determines our
centripetal acceleration?

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
Well we can explore Newton's
law of gravitation there.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.340
So if we think about the
magnitude of the force of gravity,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.720
well that's going to be equal to G,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.210
which is the universal
gravitational constant,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.278
times the product of the two masses

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.340
that have the force between them,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.830
so the product of the
mass of Earth, capital M,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.010
and the mass of this satellite,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.777
I'll just focus on this satellite for now,

00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:04.010
divided by the distance
between their center

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.120
of masses squared.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.730
In this case that is
R, capital R, squared.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.170
And if you wanted the
centripetal acceleration,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.350
you would just divide
force divided by mass.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.070
Remember from Newton's second law,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.733
we know that F is equal to ma.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.990
And so if we're talking about
centripetal acceleration,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.500
it's the force of gravity
that is causing it.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.390
And so if you wanna solve
for centripetal acceleration,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.680
you just divide both sides of these by m.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.760
And so our centripetal acceleration here,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.170
if you divide our force
of gravity by lowercase m,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.730
by the mass of the satellite,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.130
our centripetal
acceleration is going to be

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.700
the universal gravitational
constant times the mass of Earth

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.750
divided by the radius squared.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.270
And so we could then
take this and substitute

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.600
it back over here and solve

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.130
for the magnitude of our velocity.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.280
So what you're going to
have is the universal

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.350
gravitational constant
times the mass of Earth

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.200
divided by the radius squared is equal to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.927
the magnitude of our
velocity or the speed squared

00:03:07.927 --> 00:03:10.130
divided by capital R.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.940
Now you can multiply both sides by R,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.590
and I'll swap sides as well,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.380
and you're gonna get v
naught squared is going to be

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.320
equal to capital G times capital M over R.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.980
Or if you take the square
root of both sides,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.600
you get v naught is
equal to the square root

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.060
of the universal gravitational constant

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.070
times the mass of Earth
divided by the distance

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.190
between the center of masses.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.960
Now what's interesting here is,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.410
we see this speed we need in
order to maintain this orbit

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.670
in no way is it a function of
the mass of this satellite.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.440
I don't see a lowercase m
anywhere in this expression

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.960
on the right-hand side.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.750
And since this is independent of the mass

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.480
of the thing that is in orbit,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.940
if you double the mass,
if you go from lowercase m

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.880
to two times lowercase m,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.290
it does not change the
needed orbital speed.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.830
And so what is the speed
v of the heavier satellite

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.663
in terms of v naught?

00:04:08.663 --> 00:04:10.120
It's gonna be the same thing.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.730
We could write v is going
to be equal to v naught.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.820
Doesn't matter what you
do to the mass here,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.313
you're going to need
the same orbital speed.
