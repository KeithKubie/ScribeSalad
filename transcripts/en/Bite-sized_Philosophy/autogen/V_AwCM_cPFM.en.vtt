I don't think anybody debates that you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
I don't think anybody debates that you
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740
I don't think anybody debates that you
wouldn't recommend that someone that you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
wouldn't recommend that someone that you
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.590
wouldn't recommend that someone that you
love have one

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600
love have one
 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.600
love have one
okay now having clarified that that mere

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
okay now having clarified that that mere
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890
okay now having clarified that that mere
statement doesn't eliminate the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
statement doesn't eliminate the
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.450
statement doesn't eliminate the
complexity of the situation the first

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
complexity of the situation the first
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730
complexity of the situation the first
question is is should everything long be

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
question is is should everything long be
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.810
question is is should everything long be
illegal that's a tough question

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820
illegal that's a tough question
 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.210
illegal that's a tough question
everything that's wrong isn't illegal

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220
everything that's wrong isn't illegal
 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.740
everything that's wrong isn't illegal
then there's the additional complication

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
then there's the additional complication
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.760
then there's the additional complication
of the difference let's say in gravity

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770
 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.780
regarding the problem in relationship to

regarding the problem in relationship to
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090
regarding the problem in relationship to
men and women and we don't know how to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
men and women and we don't know how to
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.649
men and women and we don't know how to
deal with that having said that I would

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
deal with that having said that I would
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.910
deal with that having said that I would
say that it's actually the wrong

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
say that it's actually the wrong
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.420
say that it's actually the wrong
question there's a something Leonard

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
question there's a something Leonard
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.039
question there's a something Leonard
Cohen said once he said that in a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
Cohen said once he said that in a
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630
Cohen said once he said that in a
massacre there's no decent place to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
massacre there's no decent place to
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.499
massacre there's no decent place to
stand and what he meant by that was

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509
stand and what he meant by that was
 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.330
stand and what he meant by that was
sometimes you're where there is no good

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

sometimes you're where there is no good
decision left no matter what you do it's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
decision left no matter what you do it's
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.140
decision left no matter what you do it's
wrong so then the question is how did

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
wrong so then the question is how did
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.190
wrong so then the question is how did
you get there

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
you get there
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.540
you get there

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
well let's say you're in a position
 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.880
well let's say you're in a position
where you are inclined to seek an

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890
where you are inclined to seek an
 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.750
where you are inclined to seek an

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
abortion the question is how did you get
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.900
abortion the question is how did you get
there now we have a lot to straighten

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
there now we have a lot to straighten
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.930
there now we have a lot to straighten
out about sexual relationships between

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940
out about sexual relationships between
 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.080
out about sexual relationships between
men and women in the modern world

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090
men and women in the modern world
 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
they're bent and warped and demented out
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.170
they're bent and warped and demented out
of shape one of the things I see with

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
of shape one of the things I see with
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.390
of shape one of the things I see with
young people for example is that they

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
young people for example is that they
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.890
young people for example is that they
will engage in sexual acts with one

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
will engage in sexual acts with one
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.390
will engage in sexual acts with one
another that they would not talk about

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
another that they would not talk about
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.320
another that they would not talk about
with one another

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330
with one another
 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.720
with one another
I mean couples will do that for that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
I mean couples will do that for that
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.160
I mean couples will do that for that
matter like married couples will do that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
matter like married couples will do that
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.290
matter like married couples will do that
but they're married that's that's a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
but they're married that's that's a
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.449
but they're married that's that's a
different story it seems to me that if

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459
different story it seems to me that if
 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.190
different story it seems to me that if
you are willing to engage in a sexual

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
you are willing to engage in a sexual
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.050
you are willing to engage in a sexual

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060
act with someone with whom you would not
 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.059
act with someone with whom you would not
discuss that act you probably put the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069
discuss that act you probably put the
 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.830
discuss that act you probably put the
cart before the horse so the discussion

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
cart before the horse so the discussion
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.430
cart before the horse so the discussion
regarding the legality of abortion is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440
regarding the legality of abortion is
 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.699
regarding the legality of abortion is
nested inside a larger discussion about

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709
nested inside a larger discussion about
 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.090
nested inside a larger discussion about
the morality of abortion and that's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100
the morality of abortion and that's
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.250
the morality of abortion and that's
disconnected inside a larger discussion

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260

about the proper place of sexuality and
human behavior and to me that's the

human behavior and to me that's the
 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.259
human behavior and to me that's the
level at which the problem needs to be

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269
level at which the problem needs to be
 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.770

get married that was a good answer and
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.130
get married that was a good answer and
it's an answer that people should still

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140
it's an answer that people should still
 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.979
it's an answer that people should still
listen to but we'll put that aside

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989
listen to but we'll put that aside
 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.150
