00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.700
Much like bathroom-humor at the dinner table,
hemorrhoids can be a taboo subject.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.090
However, the truth is that everyone has them.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.430
Their job is to protect your anal sphincter
muscles (the ones that open and close your

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.250
anus) and to help keep your anus closed when
you have moments of increased abdominal pressure,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.550
like when you’re coughing.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.860
They become a problem when they become inflamed.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.190
Once this happens, they’re known as piles.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.790
Of course, popular culture has led to “hemorrhoids”
and “piles” being interchangeable in common

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.790
vernacular.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.730
In any event, by the age of 50, about half
of the population will have dealt with these

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.260
inflamed itchy protrusions at one point or
another.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.070
Because most people with piles get curious
about why their backside is itching, let’s

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.370
take a closer look at what they are, what
causes them to become inflamed, and how you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.230
can prevent that from happening.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.440
Your anus is controlled by one of the many
sphincter muscles within the body.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.500
Sphincters are muscles that form like a doughnut
around the many openings within the body,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.180
like the entrance and exit of your stomach.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.120
Those would be the lower esophageal sphincter
and pylori sphincter respectively.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.560
When sphincters relax, they allow the entrance
or release of liquids and solids.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.870
Normally sphincters are constricted which
keeps those liquids and solids from leaving

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.620
their respective positions within the body.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.690
No one likes the acid from your stomach coming
back up and making your chest feel like it’s

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.790
on fire!

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.929
As mentioned before, your anal sphincter is
cushioned by hemorrhoids.

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.470
Hemorrhoids themselves are made up of what
are known as modified squamous epithelium.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.509
These highly vascular cushions reside along
the anal canal in three main areas- the left,

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.510
right and back of the canal.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.259
They are made up of elastic connective tissue
and smooth muscles.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.440
Many of them do not contain muscular walls
like arteries and veins do.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.590
Because of this, they are technically known
as sinusoids (a small blood vessel like a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.090
capillary) and can swell up due to blood not
being able to leave.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.950
When you’re relaxed, they provide about
15-20% of the pressure keeping your anal canal

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.950
closed.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
When you have an increase in abdominal pressure,
like when sneezing, the blood going back to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.410
your heart through your inferior vena cava
is reduced.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.960
This causes these vascular cushions to swell
up with blood pushing on your sphincter, and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.010
thus, help prevent the infamous anal-leakage.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.860
It’s also thought that hemorrhoids are responsible
for helping us determine the exact content

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.840
of what’s coming out, like gas versus a
solid bowel movement.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.790
When your hemorrhoids begin to swell up chronically,
they begin to cause problems.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.180
This is when they become known as piles.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.549
Once they are piles, they can cause symptoms
like hard lumps that can be painful and itchy,

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.120
the feeling like you still have to go to the
bathroom after you’ve already gone, and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.859
mucous discharge or bright red blood while
defecating.

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.730
Anything that causes an increase in your abdominal
pressure can cause your hemorrhoids to become

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.040
chronically inflamed.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.879
Thus, there are risk factors for piles- things
like being pregnant, chronic constipation,

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.879
lifting heavy weights, straining when passing
stool, being obese, and increasing age.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.510
Some studies have even suggested the tendency
to develop piles is inherited.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.350
You have two types of piles, internal and
external.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.079
A line known as the dentate line is what differentiates
them.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.340
Located below the dentate line is external
piles.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.790
These are covered by a type of skin called
Anoderm that contain nerve fibers, specifically

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.020
fibers connected to the pudendal nerve.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.540
The cause of the itchy pain is revealed!

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.420
Internal hemorrhoids are broken down in to
4 classifications.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.120
1st degree protrude only into the anal canal.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.290
2nd degree protrude outside the canal but
go back in spontaneously.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.079
3rd degree require you to push them back in
manually, and 4th degree don’t go back in

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.349
to your canal no matter what you do.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.930
The treatment for your piles depends on severity.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.299
If only minor, your doctor may choose to simply
treat the symptoms, administering things like

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.819
corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, laxatives
if constipated, pain medication and anti-itch

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.079
creams, as well as advising you to attempt
not to strain while on the toilet, and to

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.719
use simple pads to help with irritation.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:13.299
If your pile is more cumbersome, your doctor
can choose to remove or reduce the pile.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.939
They can do this in a variety of ways.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:21.130
Banding involves placing an elastic band around
the base, cutting off blood-flow to the pile.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.090
After a few days, it will die and simply fall
off.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.530
They can inject medications into the pile
causing it to shrink, known as sclerotherapy.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.390
Surgery is also an option.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.300
They can remove the pile (hemorrhoidectomy),
or staple shut the blood-flow to the pile

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.310
itself.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.110
In the end (pun intended), contrary to popular
belief, everyone has hemorrhoids.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.900
Scratch your bums with pride knowing that
about 50% of you will have yours inflame by

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.949
the time you’re 50.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.560
Let’s just hope it’s only a minor inflammation,
because no one wants a Doctor cutting anything

00:04:49.560 --> 00:05:03.400
off down there!
