00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.140
WHILE RESEARCHING CORAL
IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.080
THIS MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH TEAM 
MADE AN ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY...

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.880
IN THE FORM OF AN UNUSUAL PHOTO-BOMBER.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.380
We had this idea to film, like, 
a large piece of a coral reef

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.980
and just take photograph, and photograph, 
and then stitch them together

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.920
to give an idea of what
a nighttime fluorescent reef looks like.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.240
We get back to the lab at night, 
and we're looking at the photos,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.440
and  there's this little eel, like, sitting in the photo.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.360
And it was bright green.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.700
We thought there was something
wrong with the camera,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.560
there was some problem with our gear.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.360
Little did we know that the eel was real.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.420
IT WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT THIS EEL 
WOULD EXHIBIT BIOFLUORESCENCE

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.700
THAT THIS SINGLE PHOTOGRAPH LED 
DR. DAVID GRUBER TO ESTABLISH

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.220
A WHOLE NEW REALM
OF RESEARCH ON LIFE UNDERWATER.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.800
Luckily I was working with an ichthyologist, John Sparks
at the American Museum of Natural History

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.420
and we set out on these voyages,
this expedition around the world,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.540
looking for different fluorescent fish.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.540
AS OPPOSED TO BIOLUMINESCENCE, WHERE ORGANISMS PRODUCE THEIR OWN LIGHT

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.840
WITH CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.520
FLUORESCENCE IS THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING
LIGHT TO OTHER WAVELENGTHS.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.180
IT’S NORMALLY INVISIBLE, AND HAD MOSTLY
BEEN OBSERVED IN CORAL,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.800
AND SCIENTISTS WEREN’T COMPLETELY SURE WHY.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.480
97% of hard corals have this ability 
to absorb the blue ocean light

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.360
and turn it into greens,
turn it into oranges, turn it into reds.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.290
Why is a coral doing this?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.280
Is it acting as a sunscreen?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.820
Is it a way for the corals to call in the
symbiotic organisms to inhabit their microbiome?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.260
COMMUNICATION IN AN UNDERWATER ENVIRONMENT IS COMPLEX,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.820
WHERE LIGHT FOLLOWS A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.250
My blood wouldn't look red underwater.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.640
It's because there's no red photons making it there.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.040
Just imagine that scene: 
it's like being in a nightclub

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.460
where there's just blue lights on.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.720
What would it mean for animal to just have
one color light in its environment?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.280
TO FIND OUT, DAVID AND HIS TEAM VENTURED INTO
THE DEPTHS.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.790
Our team goes down about 150 meters, using
technical advanced mixed gases.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.069
We then go out and scan the reef at night,

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.299
shining blue light on them, and we're looking
to see who has the ability to absorb blue light

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.040
and send that back out 
as a different color.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.500
What we came back with was just, like...

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.599
a bouquet of fluorescent fish.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.519
We found it in blennies, we found it in eels.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.380
We found it in stingrays...

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.060
and then we found it in sharks.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.240
TO DATE, DAVID HAS DOCUMENTED OVER 180 SPECIES
THAT EMIT THIS SECRET GLOW.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.740
BUT THESE DISCOVERIES ONLY 
LED TO MORE QUESTIONS

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.100
ABOUT HOW THESE ANIMALS
 ARE USING THEIR SUPERPOWER.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.480
In the eyes of these seahorse are these 
specific biofluorescent patterns.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.189
Perhaps they're using this fluorescence as
a way of marking and seeing each other.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.999
They are the masters of camouflage.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:19.999
It would make sense for them to blend in perfectly
into the red fluorescence of the sea grass.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.340
With Olindias, which is the flower hat jelly,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.420
at the very tips are these green fluorescent pieces

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.940
that act as a lure, helping them feed.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.969
One of the most interesting ones was 
the fluorescent swell shark.

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:38.340
The females have almost what looks like a
mask, and these are really social animals

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.270
that hang out in small groups.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.740
So, potentially this is a way for them to
have secret little differences on sharks

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.640
that only the sharks can see.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.880
This made me think, like, “How do I test
this?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.360
What are these sharks seeing?”

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.500
THE ANSWER WAS TO ASSEMBLE A TEAM OF NEUROSCIENTISTS, ICHTHYOLOGISTS,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.780
EYE DOCTORS, AND ROBOTICISTS
TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.640
INTO THE SHARKS’ VISUAL SYSTEM,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.580
WHICH IS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC AND SENSITIVE THAN OUR OWN.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.040
We designed a shark-eye camera.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.900
When we looked at this shark, it has one visual
pigment in its eye,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
a rod that sees right at the blue-green interface.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.220
But an incredibly sensitive rod,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.200
meaning that it can likely see better in the dark,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.180
about a hundred times better than a human.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.160
According to our models, this is creating
much more contrast for the sharks

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.900
than a non-fluorescent animal, 
or a non-fluorescent object.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.360
Like seeing a Las Vegas nightlife scene from
an airplane from far away, where patterns

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.060
on each shark say, "hey, this is who I am."

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.520
BUT BESIDES THE FUN OF EAVESDROPPING 
ON A SHARK’S NIGHTLIFE SCENE,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.020
FLUORESCENCE RESEARCH HAS PROVEN SURPRISINGLY APPLICABLE

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.580
TO LIFE ABOVE THE SURFACE.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.700
IN THE 1960s, A MOLECULE CALLED GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN, OR GFP,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.080
WAS ISOLATED FROM JELLYFISH.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.060
IN THE DECADES SINCE, GFP HAS SINGLE-HANDEDLY
TRANSFORMED BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.500
GFP was actually discovered by accident,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.810
by a group of scientists that were interested

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.620
in the question of, 
"Why is this jellyfish glowing?"

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.140
They noticed that the pure bioluminescent
machinery was blue.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.380
But the animal in nature was giving off green light.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.620
So, there was some protein in there

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.270
that was absorbing the blue light
 and turning it into green light,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.900
and that was Green Fluorescent Protein.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.280
THE CODE FOR GFP CAN SAFELY BE INSERTED 
INTO THE GENOME

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.540
OF ANY ORGANISM, CREATING A SIMPLE
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK TAG,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.240
AN UNPRECEDENTED TOOL TO TRACK EVERYTHING

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.200
FROM HOW CANCER CELLS AND INFECTIONS SPREAD

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.680
TO HOW DEVELOPING ORGANISMS MATURE.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.240
We're such visual learners, and when we see
something it causes a cascade of ideas.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.540
The publications are just in the tens of thousands

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.720
of people that have made discoveries,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.000
who have better understood life,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.460
because this simple little molecule 
from a marine creature.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.940
DAVID KNOWS THAT LEARNING FROM OUR UNDERWATER COUNTERPARTS

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.280
WILL HELP US SHED SOME LIGHT
ON THE BIGGER PICTURE.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.900
AND EXACTLY WHAT HE HOPES  HIS DATA AND IMAGES WILL INSPIRE US TO DO.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.720
Something like jellyfish have been around
for 500 million years.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.380
They are just these ancient, simple,
 yet sophisticated, yet beautiful animals,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.260
and they can just jump through extinction events

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.920
like nobody's business.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.760
But humans, we are incredibly sensitive,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.880
and if we were to turn off the sun for 10, 20 years,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.960
we don't have the capacity to survive that.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.580
But other animals do.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.680
It's almost like these ancient elders that are down there.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.020
So, I think it's about learning from these
other creatures, just about success.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.710
About simplicity.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.180
We emerged from the ocean, we have salty blood
that runs through our veins,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.360
and we are part fish.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.720
So, really, my interest in the ocean is about
better understanding us.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.740
Better understanding where we fit in,
where we fit among all the other species,

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.000
and where are we going?
