00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.370
So for the last step in implementing our hash table. Your

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.800
goal is to define a procedure, we'll call it hashtable_update. It takes

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.400
three inputs the hash table, the key, and the value. And

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.440
what it should do is update the value associated with that key.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.980
So if the key is already in the table, then instead

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.130
of creating a new entry like were doing before with add. What

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.080
we want to do is change the value associated with that key,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.380
to be the new value that's passed in. If it's not already

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.820
in the table, then what we want to do is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.540
add a new entry, that has that key associated

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.510
with this value. This is going to be a pretty

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.930
complicated procedure. I think it's the most complex procedure you've

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.820
been asked to define so far. But if you

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.790
think about it carefully and put together all the things

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.780
we've seen so far, and understand how the hash-table

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.090
works, I think you'll be able to define it yourself.
