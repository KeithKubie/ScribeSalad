(Mark)
He's disgusting.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.742
Bernard?
He's disgusting.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.143
He's not even like her.

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.545
He's an airplane technician.
I mean, come on.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:14.515
And he talks too much.
That's why I like you.

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:15.782
You don't talk.
You just listen.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.851
- It's good.
[bell dings]

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:21.255
Okay.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.957
And the captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.592
Got a little turbulence
coming up.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:26.960
Should be no problem.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.996
Just remain in your seat
until the sign is turned off.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.964
Thank you
for your cooperation.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.267
Okay.

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:39.039
Excuse me.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.308
Hi, excuse me.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.709
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:44.344
I'm gonna need you
to take your seat.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.679
The "fasten seat belt"
sign is on.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.480
Yeah, I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom for a second.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.482
I'll be
right back, okay?

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.750
I understand
what you want to do.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.084
Unfortunately,
I'm gonna need you

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:52.486
to observe
the "fasten seat belt" sign.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.022
That'd be
much appreciated.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.557
Right, it's just
I read on the Internet

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.192
that it's not
against the law

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.326
for me to go
to the bathroom

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.662
while the "fasten seat belt"
sign is on, so...

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:02.963
"Seat belt" sign
is on.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.566
But is it
against the law, though?

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.600
The light is on.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:07.801
[inhales sharply]

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:09.503
Is it against the law?

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.871
You see
that there's a picture

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.039
of a seat belt
on that sign.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.675
I know, but is it
against the law, though?

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:15.609
The "fasten seat belt" sign
is on.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.811

the law, though?

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.379

- Lawful.

- You're being very difficult.
- Law, law, law.

- Not illegal, not illegal.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.827
- Okay.
- Legal.

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:34.995
- Fasten--
- Legal.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:37.531
- Fasten your seat--
- Legal.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.899
- Sir.
- I have to piss.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.034
And I have to shit
in the toilet.

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:42.269
Can you lower
your voice?

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.371
[whispering]
I have to piss,
and I have to shit.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.305
Okay, lower
your intensity.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:46.340
You're louder
than me.

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.075
You're yelling
in my face.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.244
Sir, you're the one who I think
needs to tone it down right now.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.311
You are
screaming at me.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:55.349

You're hurting my eardrums.

That wasn't
a word.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:06.793
You're not saying
a word there.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.595
This is a word.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.930
- That's not--
- That's a word.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:13.333
That's not a word.
That's a tongue trick.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.269
Okay, sir.
Sir, sir.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:15.936
If you would like--

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.405
I would not like to.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.706
I would not like
to sit down.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.678
What I'd like to do is go
take a shit in the bathroom...

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.314
because it's not

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:31.285
against the law.

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:35.255
So I'm gonna go
to the bathroom, okay?
