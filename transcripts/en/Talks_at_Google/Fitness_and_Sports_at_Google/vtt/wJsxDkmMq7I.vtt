[GOOGLE JINGLE PLAYING]

00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:08.010
JASON KLEIN: So we're just
going to jump right in.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.600
I'm Jason.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.230
CASEY WHITE: I'm Casey.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.140
JASON KLEIN: And we
have been best friends

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.950
since kindergarten.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.033
CASEY WHITE: That's right.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:18.630
We've been at this business
now for 18 years, best friends

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.860
since kindergarten.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.050
We started out making movies
and mascot costumes and--

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.797
JASON KLEIN: T-shirts out
of our parents' garages.

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.130
CASEY WHITE: We were also the
Swinging Friar, the Padres

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160
mascot for a couple years.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.500
JASON KLEIN: This is the
elementary school playground

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.750
that Casey and I
met at in La Mesa.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.814
CASEY WHITE: Ms.
Laramie's class.

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:43.480
JASON KLEIN: And as
Casey had mentioned,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.520
we started the business sort of
out of our college dorm rooms,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.830
and in the summers
out of my bedroom.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.350
And we took my bed and we
shoved it in my closet.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.730
So I slept in this,
like, crypt, basically.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.360
And we started to reach out
to minor league baseball teams

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.170
across the country.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.780
We spent-- gosh, write
letters for 150 clubs.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.840
And one team got back to
us and said, we like it.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.950
We'll buy it.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.270
And that was the West
Tennessee Diamond Jaxx.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.210
And growing up here in
Southern California,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.280
we were really influenced
by going to Disneyland,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.155
and this idea that
story telling could

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:25.330
be used to create experience.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.180
And so during this first
product, we had this idea.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.100
What if there was
this diamond miner,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.400
and he was in the hills of
Tennessee, mining for diamonds?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.050
And there could
be foam pickaxes.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.370
And kids could wear
handlebar mustaches.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.890
And so we really loved this
idea about telling stories

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.512
and immersing fans in this
creative world of the hometown

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:48.160
team.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.660
CASEY WHITE: Yeah,
since then, we've

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.430
rebranded about 60 professional
sports franchises--

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.770
major league, minor league, NBA.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.680
We've been really lucky
to work on some really

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.435
amazing projects.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.430
We also get to work
for Nike sometimes.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.639
We've done a bunch
of stuff for a bunch

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.930
of different
departments at Nike--

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.320
LeBron James, KD,
streetwear stuff,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.390
Just Do It, championship rings.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.610
And yeah, they're a really
fun client to work for.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.360
Yeah, World Record Breaker.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.060
JASON KLEIN: So "Welcome
to the Circus Business"

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.560
is the title of our talk.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.240
And the world that we operate
in is very non-traditional.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.220
It's not your traditional
sports business.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.210
It's the minor league
baseball business.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.290
And the thing about
minor league baseball

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.450
is that the minor league teams
don't control the product

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.020
on the field.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.280
So all of the talent is paid
for by a major league team.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.960
They play and control players.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.430
So a game goes on whether
the fans show up or not.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.820
That part of the business
is completely separate.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.410
So the minor league
baseball owner--

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.865
you're in charge
of merchandising,

00:03:06.865 --> 00:03:08.750
you're in charge of
concessions, you're

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.272
in charge of sponsorship.

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:15.840
And in the early days of
minor league baseball,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.082
it was just baseball fans.

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:19.290
And then someone said, if
we give away a rally towel,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.165
maybe someone will come
out just because they

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:22.050
want a rally towel.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.980
And then they started giving
away other stuff, like,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.030
giving away cars so
people would come out.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.870
And they'd have these dizzy bat
races, and all this goofy stuff

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.520
that happened on the field.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.120
And that was really
a paradigm shift,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.840
because now, 80% of minor
league fans come out to a game,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.350
have no idea who's playing.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.350
They have no idea
who the score is--

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.610
or what the score is.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.290
They have no idea who won.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.460
And so we're really in
charge of creating experience

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.840
for everything off the field.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.350
CASEY WHITE: And we like to say
it's a party when a baseball

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.750
game broke out.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.770
JASON KLEIN: So it is a very
different mindset of thinking

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.150
in the business model.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.470
So this is Reading,
Pennsylvania.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.567
They had a mascot band.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:07.900
They don't just have one mascot.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.420
They have five mascots.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.436
They play at every game.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:13.065
CASEY WHITE: It's
an amazing band.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:13.815
JASON KLEIN: Yeah.

00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:14.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.250
CASEY WHITE: It really is.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.589
JASON KLEIN: And this is one of
their mascots, the crazy hotdog

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:21.410
vendor.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.030
And it's a guy that
rides an ostrich.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.790
And in the fourth
inning, he throws hotdogs

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.890
and hurls them into the crowd.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.730
And the crazy hotdog
vendor is more

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.470
famous than any player that has
ever come through that team.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.120
And to give you an
idea, kids at Halloween

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.360
don't want to dress up like
SpongeBob or like Batman.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.900
They want to be
crazy hotdog vendor.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.120
And so they are fans.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.860
There are more fans of
the mascot at the ballpark

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.970
than they are of the team.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.740
And this is a bunch
of crazy hotdog vendor

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.950
costumes, homemade.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.630
There's an inflatable costume.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.850
There's the real
crazy hotdog vendor.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.059
Even the adults get in on it.

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.725
CASEY WHITE: I love
these homemade ones.

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:05.620
They're amazing.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.820
JASON KLEIN: This kid
is just totally out.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.070
CASEY WHITE: Living the dream.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.010
JASON KLEIN: Yeah.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.920
And to go a step further,
the players actually

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.680
wear the costume of the mascot.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.250
So it just goes to show the
power of the entertainment

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.760
part of this business and how
it influences the game so much,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.950
as opposed to the game
influencing the entertainment

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.790
business.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.040
And so when we were developing
some new logos for this team,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.130
we were thinking, how do we
take this idea of this ostrich?

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.505
And their team name's
called the Fightins.

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:39.630
And so we're, like, yeah,
the Fightin's an ostrich.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.120
And we came up with
this cap design,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.290
which is a fighting ostrich.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.180
And that's what the
team wears on the field.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.304
CASEY WHITE: And then they
have live ostriches that

00:05:47.304 --> 00:05:48.955
run around the outfield berm.

00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:51.630
Before the game, they put
them in these horse carriages.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.250
And so sometimes you're, like,
an ostrich go lay an egg.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.489
It thuds into this metal crates.

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:58.155
It's incredible.

00:05:58.155 --> 00:05:58.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.128
JASON KLEIN: Yes.

00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:01.130
It is a circus business.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.840
So we have this philosophy
that great brands

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.120
are built on great stories.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.340
And our whole process is
about storytelling and telling

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.250
stories.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.640
So the first step
is we pack our bags

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.180
and head from here in San
Diego on research visits.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.240
So we've been mile deep in
a West Virginia coal mine.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.310
And we want to be
honorary citizens.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.430
We want to eat the local foods,
talk to the locals, take tours.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.730
We just want to immerse
ourselves in our visit.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.030
And of course, we
meet with staff.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.890
So this is a staff
conference table

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.055
in Eugene, Oregon, where we
were working on a project.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.466
CASEY WHITE: Yes, again,
it's about immersion.

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:46.090
It's about finding
something authentic.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.710
So we were tasked
with having to name

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.990
the triple A for the
Padres, the El Paso team.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.680
Which we'll call blank for now.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.080
And so we started out
heading out to El Paso.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.830
JASON KLEIN: Yeah.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.990
And we did a focus group.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.445
And fans said, oh, we don't get
respect from the rest of Texas.

00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:06.870
We're, like, underdog.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.460
We're feisty.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.555
We're fiercely loyal.

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:10.770
We like to party.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.640
We're kind of party animals.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.650
So we packed our bags and
did our research visit

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.130
and spent time there.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:27.300
And when we come up with
names for brands, new brands,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.750
there's a couple criteria.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.802
And I'll let Casey jump in.

00:07:30.802 --> 00:07:31.510
CASEY WHITE: Yes.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.900
So we don't like formulas.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.729
We don't like
formulas, but we found

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:41.770
that these four things
are really good for naming

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.936
minor league baseball teams.

00:07:42.936 --> 00:07:44.415
So something about our--

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.590
our research visit
is really important

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.560
because we find things
that are deep cuts

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.430
and authentic to the region.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.590
It's all about kids.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.520
It's all about family.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.060
That's really, really important.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.040
Can't be ignored-- these
minor league teams,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.331
they're not major league teams.

00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:03.270
They don't have
major league budgets.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.290
They don't a big TV deal.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.233
And so we use naming, as
we'll get into-- and we should

00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:11.680
probably hurry up, too--

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.250
so we use the naming process
and everything to really get

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.070
a lot of attention.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.111
And then we wanted to
inspire the fan experience.

00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:18.840
So when you go to
the ballpark, and you

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.390
enter into El Paso's ballpark,
it should speak to El Paso.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.640
It should speak to the
brand we're creating.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.290
JASON KLEIN: So we
were in a parking lot.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.120
And Casey asked me, he's,
like, what desert are we in?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.789
I think we're in the
Chihuahuan Desert.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:38.530
And we're, like, OK, feisty,
fiercely loyal, underdog.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.150
So we had this idea
of one of the names.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.596
And the brand eventually
became the El Paso Chihuahuas.

00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:51.300
And so when you go into a
Chihuahuas game, you walk in,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.009
it is Chihuahuas everywhere.

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:55.550
The whole experience-- it's kind
of like going to Disneyland.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.152
The whole experience is
centered around the Chihuahuas.

00:09:00.152 --> 00:09:05.010
They have a Wooftop Deck, which
is at the top of the ballpark

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.610
and it overlooks the
entire experience.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.280
It's awesome.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.240
And you can party with
your friends up there.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.130
They have incredible food.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.340
So they're right on the border
of Mexico, the ballpark.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.050
And so the great--

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:25.440
the frutas and all the
pepper and the chili.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.410
I ate one of these whole
pineapples when I was there,

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.170
and it was amazing.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.880
CASEY WHITE: A few minutes
later, Jason was like,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.550
I don't feel good.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.674
And I was, like, because
you ate a whole pineapple.

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:37.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.360
JASON KLEIN: More snacks--
they got rebranded.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.970
This is their
signature food item.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.990
It's dog bowl nachos.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.025
And they serve it in a dog bowl.

00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:50.530
And they get steak nachos.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.720
And kids take this home,
and they tell their parents.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.527
And they demand that they want
to eat their breakfast out

00:09:56.527 --> 00:09:59.253
of the dog bowl they
got the night before.

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:00.800
So that's cool.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.879
We tried this
dogbone yard of beer,

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:06.920
but it had some visual
issues all over the place.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.050
And we decided to
scratch that idea.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.650
Also, we developed
Chihuahua's emoji.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.280
So in El Paso, there's
a way of communicating.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.640
Everybody sends emoji to each
other in their own unique way.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.370
And so there's very
specific cultural emoji,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.745
including their mascot, Chico.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.140
This is the airport team store.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.710
So the team is so
popular, they've

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.620
taken over an entire
airport team store.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.650
And it's just-- it's an
incredible experience.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.817
And we did that same
process of storytelling

00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:45.150
and we bring it to other cities.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:52.180
So in Richmond, they're known
as the Flying Squirrels.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.070
Lehigh Valley created most of
the steel that built America.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.020
And so pigiron is the raw
material to create steel.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.120
And we flipped it and
it became the Iron Pigs.

00:11:06.138 --> 00:11:10.550
Jumbo Shrimp in Jacksonville.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.170
Akron is known as the
rubber capital of the world.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.640
So this is the
Akron Rubber Ducks.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.830
And Binghamton is the
carousel capital of the world.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.870
So we were trying
to figure out how

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.220
to make a carousel kind of
cool and modern and edgy.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:32.710
And we had this idea of this
crazy horse coming off--

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.300
breaking itself
off the carousel.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.240
And then in New Orleans,
there's a tradition

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.900
during Mardi Gras of a cake.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.660
And inside the cake,
there's a little baby.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.490
It's hidden inside the cake.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.390
And then whoever gets the
slice that has the cake in it,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.600
that person has to
throw a party next year.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.986
So in New Orleans, they're
called the New Orleans Baby

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:53.485
Cakes.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.320
And right now we're
actually naming a team,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.360
or helping to name the
team in Amarillo, Texas.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.300
And these are the options--

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.900
the Boot Scooters, the Bronc
Busters, the Jerky, the Long

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.530
Haulers, and the
Sod Poodles, which

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.790
is a name for a prairie dog.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.060
So you guys can participate,
too, if you want to jump in.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.510
You can go to
AmarilloProBaseball.com

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.420
and cast your vote.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.320
So making teams famous.

00:12:31.994 --> 00:12:33.410
CASEY WHITE: So
we have a few ways

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.460
that we've found that
worked really well

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.180
to bring a lot of national
and international attention

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.720
to our clubs.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.120
So one way is to innovate.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.880
So we love doing firsts.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.740
So this is the best
picture you could ever

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:52.410
find of Al, the Rally Tuna
in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.090
So he comes out of
his little hidey hole

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.930
there when they have a player
on third base, I think.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.900
And when the Altoona Curve--
is the name of the club.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:07.120
And so he's this mythical,
Sasquatchesque creature.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.010
And so we came up
with this idea.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.275
So the Altoona-- this
is their normal home hat

00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:15.450
for the Altoona Curve.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.670
But just like when
you're in Little League,

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.635
we have it to where you
can turn it inside out

00:13:19.635 --> 00:13:20.850
and become Al the Tuna.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.490
So this is the first
official rally cap,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.550
official on-field rally cap.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.170
And of course, yeah,
bring the Altoona out.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.440
Making a splash--
so this is a project

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.490
that we did for the LA Clippers.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.230
They taked us with creating
a new mascot for them.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.120
And so we came up with Chuck the
Condor, the California condor.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.214
And we want to tie it,
again, with our research,

00:13:47.214 --> 00:13:48.630
we want to tie it
to the location.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:54.120
So he's a stuntman,
a Hollywood stuntman

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.380
come to be the mascot
for the LA Clippers.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.800
And we found it really
difficult to introduce

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.530
professional or-- sorry, big
league mascots, especially.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.340
There's just a lot of animosity
at the big league level,

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.290
for some reason, for mascots.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.140
So we were like, well,
let's instantly ingratiate

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.330
Chuck with the fans.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.520
So we made a deal
with Converse there.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.110
And then everyone that
was at that night's game

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.185
got Chuck shoes.

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:29.880
And Chuck has been a big hit.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.920
And we do everything.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.370
We create a whole back story for
them to help them introduce it.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.480
Everything to sort of get
the city excited for Chuck.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.430
We've got these little
California references.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.040
Yeah, we do things like
tell his story, his origin,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.146
and comic books, all that.

00:14:49.146 --> 00:14:53.050
And then celebrating
hometown culture--

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.970
so we have become pretty well
known for these food identities

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:57.470
now.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.866
So this is in Lehigh,
Pennsylvania, which

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:00.990
is right outside of Philly.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.187
It's also the Philadelphia
Phillies affiliate.

00:15:03.187 --> 00:15:05.520
So you can get the-- they
were the steaks for one night.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.666
And of course, you can get it
with onions or without onions.

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:11.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.350
And this is the cannolis
in Staten Island,

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.830
doing the Babe Ruth pointing
for the fences pose.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.030
This is the Rochester
Garbage Plates.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.845
So there's this
dish in Rochester

00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:27.510
called garbage plates.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:33.390
And it is macaroni salad, hash
browns, hamburgers, chili,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.890
onions--

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.100
JASON KLEIN: Mustard.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.400
CASEY WHITE: You know.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.125
JASON KLEIN: You
only eat it at 2 AM.

00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:40.300
CASEY WHITE: Yeah,
affectionately called garbage.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.889
Anyway, so the Garbage Plates.

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:44.014
This one was just unveiled.

00:15:44.014 --> 00:15:46.129
This was the Wisconsin Brats.

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.920
JASON KLEIN: Brats.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.003
CASEY WHITE: Brats, sorry.

00:15:48.003 --> 00:15:49.030
JASON KLEIN: That's OK.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.390
CASEY WHITE: And then
this one was just unveiled

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.190
yesterday, right, Monday.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.464
So this is the Staten
Island pizza wraps.

00:15:55.464 --> 00:15:57.380
I don't know if you guys
saw that, pizza wrap.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.080
I was pretty excited.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.120
And you get the hat
delivered in a pizza box.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.340
JASON KLEIN: OK, so
another one is making sure

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.720
that you're authentic.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.645
This is one of our
favorite stories.

00:16:11.645 --> 00:16:13.470
There's the Spokane Indians.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.440
And they're up in
Spokane, Washington.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.520
They're named after the
Spokane tribe of Indians,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.870
well before any sports
team affiliation.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.970
And up to that point,
there were a couple

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.940
of ways to treat the whole
Native American issue.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.020
One is, don't change the name.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.440
So like, hey,
we're the Redskins.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.250
We don't care what people think.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.166
And we're the Indians.

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:34.680
We don't care what people think.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.790
Or the other option was to
change to something benign.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.010
We're the Red Hawks now.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:45.055
Or we're going to completely
change the name to the Black

00:16:45.055 --> 00:16:46.300
Bears, whatever.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.150
And so we were there working
with the Spokane Indians,

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.540
the baseball club.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.900
And they said, hey,
whatever you do,

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.650
we can't touch the
Native American issues.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.730
OK, that's great.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.450
And we said, cool.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.480
Tell us the back story.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.925
And they said, oh, we're named
after the tribe of Indians.

00:17:02.925 --> 00:17:05.174
We're like, do you guys have
a relationship with them?

00:17:05.174 --> 00:17:07.450
Like, oh, yeah, they're
great friends of ours.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.240
And so we're like,
well, could we

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.360
collaborate with
the actual tribe

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.589
on creating a brand centered
around their heritage?

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.175
And so we went up
to the reservation.

00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:19.290
We met with the tribal elders.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:24.720
And they sat-- and it was a
collaboration with them and us.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.270
And they gifted us
the eagle feather

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.020
to be able to use
part of their brand.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.820
And they also created
this lettering

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.840
in Salish, which is the
tribal language, that says

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.820
Spokane Indians Baseball Club.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.360
And what's incredible is there's
only about five individuals

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.420
in the world that speak Salish.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.510
And the amount, the percentage
of actual tribal members

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.840
in Spokane is
really, really tiny.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.250
It's probably less than 5%.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.370
But they've completely embraced
the ballpark experience.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.440
So here in San Diego,
we have restrooms

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.930
in English and Spanish.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.130
In Spokane at the ballpark,
they have English and Salish

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.224
for all the restrooms
and all the signage.

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:12.640
And if you think
about the-- like,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.410
five people can speak that.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.960
But it's a great
outreach program.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.050
It's a great way--
third option, if you

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.670
will-- of the whole concept.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.542
And so this is--

00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:27.125
all the jerseys are
written in Salish.

00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:31.980
It's the only non-English or
-Spanish team on a baseball

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.200
jersey in America.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.906
They have great
celebration nights

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.530
where they celebrate
the whole culture.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.414
And it's been a
great experience.

00:18:41.414 --> 00:18:43.330
And the jersey is in the
Baseball Hall of Fame

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.300
as a result.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.006
And yeah, so we'll
jump to the Q&amp;A.

00:18:48.006 --> 00:18:50.346
CASEY WHITE: OK.

00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:51.970
SPEAKER 1: So before
I start, are there

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.260
any questions from anybody in
the room for Jason or Casey?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.198
JASON KLEIN: Yes?

00:18:57.198 --> 00:19:00.190
AUDIENCE: Could you
pronounce that name?

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.470
JASON KLEIN: It's the Salish?

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.490
AUDIENCE: That says Spokane.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.700
JASON KLEIN: It
says Spokane on it.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.491
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.540
JASON KLEIN: Yeah.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.620
AUDIENCE: When you guys ask a
question, can you repeat it--

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.620
JASON KLEIN: Absolutely.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.290
Yeah, so the question--

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.050
AUDIENCE: --so that we can
hear you on television?

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.260
JASON KLEIN: Yeah,
the question was what

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.840
was the word across the jersey?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.075
And it's the word Spokane
in the Salish language.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.934
Great.

00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:28.600
SPEAKER 1: Well, while we're out
in San Francisco, any questions

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.120
from the room in San Francisco?

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.992
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
having dealt with

00:19:35.992 --> 00:19:38.230
or having been on the
customer's side of going

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.540
through some
redesigns in the past,

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.040
I know how difficult and
painful that process can be,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.340
and how many times it
takes to get it right.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.200
How did you guys succeed?

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.127
Or how do you guys--

00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:53.210
because, obviously, you
have a great body of work,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.567
but how do you guys manage
those tricky engagements where

00:19:57.567 --> 00:19:59.400
people are like, yeah,
this is not quite it.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.483
Yeah, that's not quite it.

00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:01.890
Yeah, that's not quite it.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.460
Those types of scenarios--

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.960
CASEY WHITE: That's
a good question.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.949
So again, we've been
at it for 18 years.

00:20:08.949 --> 00:20:10.365
And we're really
proud of the fact

00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:13.780
that we've never
issued a change order.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.775
We try to price--

00:20:14.775 --> 00:20:16.150
we're a little
bit more expensive

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.150
than all of our clients.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.115
So we try to price our
services at a level

00:20:20.115 --> 00:20:23.374
in which the client
can basically put us

00:20:23.374 --> 00:20:25.430
through the ringer and it's OK.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.490
That's really the short answer.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.070
And we sort of look at it as,
like, it all averages out.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.795
So sometimes projects
gel really quickly

00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:39.820
and come together
really fast and then

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.550
some drag on for years.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.190
But we think it all
kind of averages out.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:50.800
I would also say that
one trick that we use

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.300
is just to trust our process.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.960
Our process is really strong.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.230
And we're really
proud of our process.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:01.420
And it being proven
over the years

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.420
has been beneficial to helping
to guide projects to closure.

00:21:09.542 --> 00:21:12.000
SPEAKER 1: I really enjoyed
the walk through of the El Paso

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.880
Chihuahuas.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.750
And I definitely understand
why those yard beer

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.460
things didn't make it.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.585
Good idea.

00:21:18.585 --> 00:21:20.710
So I'm sure you guys have
done a lot of other stuff

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.820
that was really clever, but just
didn't see the light of day.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.360
What were some of your favorite
things that just never saw

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.445
the light of day?

00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:29.944
JASON KLEIN: So we thought we
might get asked this question.

00:21:29.944 --> 00:21:30.760
CASEY WHITE: We came prepared.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.630
JASON KLEIN: We came prepared.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.766
CASEY WHITE: Ideas that
never saw the light of day.

00:21:33.766 --> 00:21:34.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:36.700
AUDIENCE: What a coincidence.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.790
JASON KLEIN: So this is
the Blind Cave Shrimp,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.770
which is-- so to
give you an idea,

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.710
in Bowling Green,
Kentucky, there's

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.540
the largest underground cave
system in North America.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.707
And there's one spot where you
could fit a whole NFL stadium

00:21:51.707 --> 00:21:53.040
and it wouldn't touch the walls.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.900
It's ginormous.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.790
So they have this blind
translucent shrimp

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.630
that lives in the caves.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.700
And in the name the team
contest, one of the contenders

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.420
was the Blind Cave Shrimp.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.920
Ultimately, the fans
voted for the Hot Rods,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.165
which is the team they became.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.890
But in the back of
everybody's mind,

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.540
it was like, man, what if
we were the Cave Shrimp?

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.873
What if we were the Cave Shrimp?

00:22:17.873 --> 00:22:20.370
And so together
with the team, we

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.100
invented the first
what could have

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.290
been night, which is a game in
which you play in the runner

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.810
up identity of a name
the team contest.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.960
So this was the
Blind Cave Shrimp.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.440
And it became so popular,
they stock it on shelves.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.791
Still to this day, they sell a
ton of Blind Cave Shrimp logo

00:22:41.791 --> 00:22:42.290
merchandise.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:47.925
So this is one of those times.

00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:50.580
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
the merchandise sells,

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.050
but the shrimp didn't?

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.050
SPEAKER 1: The question
is the merchandise sold,

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.670
but the shrimp didn't?

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.120
Don't even dignify that one.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.780
Moving along.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.200
So I follow you guys
on social media.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.890
I highly recommend
you guys do, as well.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.870
It's very entertaining
and you see these things

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.330
before they are
released, many times.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.350
And one of the things
that I saw was that you're

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.005
shooting a TV pilot?

00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:16.450
Anything you can
share about that?

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.080
CASEY WHITE: Yeah.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.140
So don't you want to ask us
about our process, first?

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.248
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.170
Yes.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.630
So we were approached
by a company

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.090
that produces the
show, "The Voice" to do

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.950
a pilot for a TV show.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.635
And yes, so they made this--
what did they call it?

00:23:39.635 --> 00:23:41.730
A pilot presentation
or something like that.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:41.980
JASON KLEIN: Yeah.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.063
CASEY WHITE: I don't know.

00:23:43.063 --> 00:23:44.870
So they made this cool
pilot presentation.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.790
This is one of
our favorite parts

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.020
of the process, which is--

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.930
we spent two full
days with the club,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.680
researching, becoming
honorary citizens, as we say.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.530
And then we get to sit in
the stands during a game

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.860
and drink a few beers and
brainstorm team name ideas.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.880
So this is a shot from
one of those moments.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.880
So that was last year, right?

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.330
And then this year, "E:60"
is doing a piece on us.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.420
And it is unclear when that
will come out, but soon.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.790
They have been very up in our
business for about a year now.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.080
So we're pretty
excited to see it.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.430
They spent a lot of time on it.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.000
Yeah.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.970
It's such a well-produced show.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.428
I don't know if you've seen
that show, but it's phenomenal.

00:24:28.428 --> 00:24:29.175
Yeah.

00:24:29.175 --> 00:24:30.050
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.730
So you probably get to see
a lot of interesting places

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.840
in your travels, a lot
of cool small towns,

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.000
a lot of interesting ballparks.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Which one was a
pleasant surprise

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.082
to you or one that's a
must-see minor league park?

00:24:46.082 --> 00:24:48.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.899
CASEY WHITE: Funny
you should ask that.

00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:53.274
SPEAKER 1: It's almost as if
we had known in advance what

00:24:53.274 --> 00:24:54.800
the questions were going to be.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.600
JASON KLEIN: Shh.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.700
We're very fast at
putting up slides.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.440
So there's a couple we
thought came straight to mind.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.890
One is El Paso.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.370
It's a brand new--
it's a modern park.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.380
It's an hour flight
from here in San Diego.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.630
It's incredible.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.370
It's over the top.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.810
They spent a ton of time,
energy, money, love, care

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.050
into that park.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:22.830
And they just live, eat, breathe
Chihuahuas baseball there.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.020
And then the other one, as
we've mentioned, is Reading.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.020
Reading is your kind
of Fenway, Wrigley.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.720
It's a classic
minor league park.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.040
It's over 50 years old.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.280
And so it's folksy.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:42.355
It just feels like you're at a
local fair or everything's done

00:25:42.355 --> 00:25:43.660
with so much heart there, too.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.520
And it's just--
those are the two

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.932
experiences that I think of.

00:25:47.932 --> 00:25:48.640
CASEY WHITE: Yes.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.400
So Reading has become
our favorite place

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.145
to visit, which, you
know, says nobody but us.

00:25:54.145 --> 00:25:55.371
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.800
They have-- did you just say
all their signs are handpainted?

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.540
There's portraits of everyone.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.449
It feels like a time machine,
and it's still small.

00:26:07.449 --> 00:26:08.740
They don't have a new ballpark.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.130
They just kept adding on to it.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.360
One of my favorite things about
it is under the bleachers--

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.320
these aluminum bleachers,
noisy, creaky, aluminum,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.660
high school-style bleachers
they still have that run along

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.340
the first base line--

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.330
they've added all these
little carnival activities,

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.910
putt putt golf kinds of things.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.180
So they just have
cram-packed it.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.780
And they've built it out
of stuff from Home Depot.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.570
Nothing is done
with any sort of--

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.310
JASON KLEIN: Architecture.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.935
CASEY WHITE: --yeah,
it's just amazing.

00:26:40.935 --> 00:26:44.093
And it sort of becomes this
cacophony of nostalgia.

00:26:44.093 --> 00:26:46.160
And it's pretty fantastic.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.880
I can't say enough
about Reading.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.125
SPEAKER 1: So you guys, I
know from reading your bio,

00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:52.984
you've been friends
since kindergarten.

00:26:52.984 --> 00:26:53.650
Is that correct?

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.580
And you went to Helix
High School together.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.150
And I think that was actually
one of your first design

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.990
successes that was accepted.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.010
They did the logo for
Helix High School.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.470
So having been married
for a long time myself,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.470
I know sometimes you need
a little bit of space.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.600
Being lifelong
friends, how is it

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.420
that you guys keep it light when
you're in business together?

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.070
JASON KLEIN: I think a lot of
it is running a fun business.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.700
It really is.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.240
You come to work every
day, and it is fun.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.910
Early on, we were kind of
doing the exact same things.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.360
We were doing, like, I'll
sketch and you sketch.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.280
And at some point, I
remember Casey said, oh, man.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.000
I don't want to make
any sales calls.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.775
And I was like, oh, these
sketches, man, too much.

00:27:35.775 --> 00:27:37.060
It was like, I'll trade you.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.360
And so I think part of it
is knowing your strengths,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.980
knowing what you're good at.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.010
And you know, I try to stay
as much out of the sketching

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.621
process and let Casey let
his imagination run wild.

00:27:47.621 --> 00:27:48.120
Yeah.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.570
CASEY WHITE: Yeah.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.620
I think a couple things.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.466
One is that we've found our
own niches in the business.

00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:02.090
I would say we
reconvene-- we both have

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.370
a hand in the direction
of the company.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.892
But we only to have to meet
about that once a month

00:28:06.892 --> 00:28:07.850
or something like that.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.080
We both really share in
the same vision, I think,

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.330
of where we're headed.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.230
And another one is,
I think, we just--

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.010
we do spend a lot
of time together.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.707
I mean, if we both
reach our hands out,

00:28:17.707 --> 00:28:19.040
we can touch each other's hands.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.870
So we value our own lives, I
think, is a big part of it,

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:24.665
just to be honest.

00:28:24.665 --> 00:28:26.915
But I would say the biggest
thing is that I just still

00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:30.230
am entertained by my
relationship with Jason.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.560
I think we still
have fun whenever

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.510
I get a chance to
brainstorm with him.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.520
I just enjoy it.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.350
And yeah, there is
a lot of "meshment."

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.720
We probably have more bank
accounts between the two of us

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.220
than we have with our
significant others.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.820
So yeah, you do have to have
some boundaries, I think.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.380
But ultimately,
as long as you're

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.375
enjoying each other
and the work, it works.

00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:56.000
SPEAKER 1: I have a
few more questions.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.716
But let me take a break to see
if there's one from the room?

00:28:59.716 --> 00:29:04.750
AUDIENCE: I've got a two-part
question, out of San Francisco.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.840
First part would be, I'm super
interested in New Orleans,

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.570
always have been.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.290
Would love to hear the story
behind rebranding Baby Cakes.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.280
And then the second
part would be,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.408
are there any discounts on
beer that you can offer?

00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:21.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:21.315 --> 00:29:22.940
CASEY WHITE: Second
question first, no.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.127
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:25.127 --> 00:29:26.710
Well, the first one,
yeah, New Orleans

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.130
was a fascinating project.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.340
Mostly because New Orleans
is a fascinating place.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:36.320
I think it's the most
interesting city in America.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.120
I mean, what other
city in America

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.540
can boast that it
speaks a second language

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.410
other than Spanish, right?

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.955
But yeah, it's
just very unusual.

00:29:45.955 --> 00:29:47.080
The architecture's unusual.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.195
The make up's unusual.

00:29:48.195 --> 00:29:51.650
So we wanted something
that was really unusual.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.630
It's also a major league town.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.285
So they have the
Pelicans and the Saints.

00:29:56.285 --> 00:29:58.285
They can support, probably,
a major league club.

00:29:58.285 --> 00:30:01.790
But they have a
minor league club.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.670
Well, you have to
get their attention.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.510
In a big market like that, like
San Diego or LA or whatever,

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.010
you have to make a lot of noise.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.110
And so we wanted something
that couldn't be ignored,

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:16.120
that was a stark contrast to
the Saints and the Pelicans,

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.860
these more sort of
down the middle names.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.980
Now this is really
behind the curtain stuff.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.091
So we wanted a different name.

00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:30.090
Baby Cakes was one of the
names we came up with,

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.830
but we thought
that is terrifying.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.460
We can't call them that.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.270
But we pitched them a bunch of
names, and ultimately, the GM--

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.970
the guy that runs
the club there--

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.340
just got on his soapbox
and had one of those

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.720
Robin Williams jumping on
the desktop moments, where

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.260
he was like, I'm sick
of being ignored.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:49.760
Cookie.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.709
Cookie is amazing.

00:30:50.709 --> 00:30:51.750
He's down in New Orleans.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.890
I'm sick of being ignored.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.790
And we won't take it anymore.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.520
And we've got to go all the way.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.620
And we've got to be Baby Cakes.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:03.290
And everyone was taken aback,
and that's what we did.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.550
So it was pretty awesome.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.280
We're grateful that we have a
lot of really brave clients.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.064
Because we do-- we
actually measure

00:31:09.064 --> 00:31:11.480
the success of a project, like
a Baby Cakes or Chihuahuas,

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.895
by how much hate email we get.

00:31:13.895 --> 00:31:15.812
If we get a lot of hate
mail, we're like, wow.

00:31:15.812 --> 00:31:17.603
They're going to sell
a lot of merchandise.

00:31:17.603 --> 00:31:19.000
That's really good.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.874
But yeah, they have to put up
with a lot more than we do.

00:31:24.874 --> 00:31:26.290
JASON KLEIN: People
always ask us,

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.710
isn't it the worst when
people hate what you guys do?

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.168
We say, no, the
worst thing is when

00:31:30.168 --> 00:31:31.910
they're apathetic about it.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:33.740
These teams like
Casey alluded to,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.450
they don't have millions
of dollars in ad revenue.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.710
So we have to find ways
to make the headlines

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.350
without a lot of ad spend.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.560
And we always want to make
sure that it's authentic.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.580
Is it authentic?

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.035
Can it be tied back?

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.010
The team cake that the
baby's coming out of,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.750
is it authentic
in all its glory?

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.250
Is the lettering
authentic to New Orleans?

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.099
So we're always
thinking about that.

00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:06.890
AUDIENCE: What were
some of the other names

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.350
that you were going between
for that particular city?

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.689
JASON KLEIN: There was the
Red Eyes, the Tailgators.

00:32:13.689 --> 00:32:14.980
CASEY WHITE: Give some context.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.354
We should give
them some context.

00:32:16.354 --> 00:32:19.400
JASON KLEIN: Yeah, Red
Eyes was the late nights

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.238
in New Orleans combined with--

00:32:23.238 --> 00:32:24.669
what was it-- crawfish.

00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:25.460
CASEY WHITE: Right.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.820
JASON KLEIN: Crawfish.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.669
We had cool ideas.

00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:29.210
We thought, what if
the uniforms were

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:34.049
made of newspaper, like
print, so the crawfish

00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:35.090
are wrapped in newspaper.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.820
It would be cool to have a logo.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.778
CASEY WHITE: Because
people dump the crawfish--

00:32:38.778 --> 00:32:40.970
JASON KLEIN: Yeah, they
dump the crawfish boil.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.880
We had the Tailgators,
alligator tailgating.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.462
We had the Night Owls--
was another favorite.

00:32:47.462 --> 00:32:49.600
The Po' Boys, the
Po' Boys sandwich

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.920
was another name that
was in that contest.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.466
And the Baby Cakes--

00:32:55.466 --> 00:32:56.466
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:32:56.466 --> 00:32:57.890
Thanks, guys.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.380
AUDIENCE: You're going to
talk a lot about your process.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.510
But do you guys do any
testing about-- once you've

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.885
got the brand name or the
logo, kind of concept theme,

00:33:05.885 --> 00:33:10.546
do you guys go outside of you
two and the individual team

00:33:10.546 --> 00:33:14.590
management to see what
consumers' reaction is?

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.852
SPEAKER 1: So the question
was, after you come up

00:33:16.852 --> 00:33:18.470
with a concept,
how do you vet it

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:22.420
with the customer or the team?

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:27.230
CASEY WHITE: So we are
really against focus groups.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.190
Yeah.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.980
It's not just our decision.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.480
I think that we
have this reputation

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.710
of being these crazy guys that
name these teams crazy names.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.290
And we are that and we do that.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:44.430
But we don't saddle anybody with
a name that they don't want.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.800
It's not our decision.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.520
It's their decision.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.910
We have a bunch of private
schools, and at least 25%

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.470
of them are going with the
very straight down the middle,

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.715
more big league-esque name.

00:33:55.715 --> 00:33:56.865
And we're totally
fine with that.

00:33:56.865 --> 00:33:58.805
If that's the style of
product that they want

00:33:58.805 --> 00:34:00.860
to put out there, we get it.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.250
We're naming teams for
most operators, guys

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.955
that run the clubs that are
giving away free vasectomies

00:34:06.955 --> 00:34:11.191
and doing on-the-field
colonoscopies for colon cancer

00:34:11.191 --> 00:34:11.690
night.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.402
And it's a pretty
crazy business.

00:34:13.402 --> 00:34:14.360
It's a circus business.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.370
So the name should
reflect that, right?

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:21.520
You shouldn't be the
Brown Bears if you're

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.775
doing craziness like that.

00:34:24.775 --> 00:34:26.150
SPEAKER 1: Speaking
of craziness,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.529
you guys have come up with some
pretty incredible concepts.

00:34:29.529 --> 00:34:31.320
Has there ever been
one that's been brought

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.540
to you, a suggested
project that you just

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.489
said, we can't do that?

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.909
CASEY WHITE: Not where
we couldn't do that.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:45.000
I mean, I'm regularly scared
of a project-- regularly.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.409
In fact, there's a
right amount of scared.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:51.150
And I'm even questioning
if there's, like,

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.770
even an any amount of
scared for a project.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:57.710
Like, we don't know where
the ceiling is for craziness,

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.530
to be honest.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.090
And the league and
all the operators

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:04.840
seem to be really
willing to go with us.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.485
And so we're excited and
really scared about how nuts

00:35:09.485 --> 00:35:10.610
we can get.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.680
This year there's
some really crazy ones

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.270
that we're excited about.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.370
But as far as, like,
we've never turned down

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.700
a project because of political
reasons or anything like that.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.050
Again, it's a fun business.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.704
Everyone is out to have fun.

00:35:23.704 --> 00:35:25.370
If there's a project
that we don't want,

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.786
I would say the
only thing I would

00:35:26.786 --> 00:35:29.870
say about that is we maybe bid
it way too high so that if we

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.870
do get it, it's not as painful.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:33.671
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:35.945
That's rare, though.

00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:38.320
SPEAKER 1: So you've alluded
to your process a few times.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.212
And I have a feeling there
may be a slide in there that

00:35:41.212 --> 00:35:42.170
describes your process.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.570
If not--

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.278
CASEY WHITE: Yes.

00:35:43.278 --> 00:35:43.940
SPEAKER 1: Yes?

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.690
So yeah, if you don't mind--

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:49.351
you talked a little bit
about becoming local citizens

00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:51.100
for a couple of days,
really understanding

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.760
the local history.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.700
I've seen some of sketches on
your behind-the-scenes process

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.560
on your website.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.110
But if one of you
could take us through.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.050
JASON KLEIN: Yeah.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:03.680
Yeah, so this project was
just unveiled on Monday.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:09.240
And it is for the Staten
Island Pizza Rats, which is--

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.320
so there was a name the team
contest a couple of years ago

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.000
for the team in Staten Island.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.030
And they had fans vote.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.860
And they remained the
Staten Island Yankees,

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.310
the major league
namesake, the past year.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.430
But they thought, you know what?

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.980
Pizza Rats got the most votes.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.470
At least for five games this
year, let's take the field

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.890
and we'll go as the Pizza Rats.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.320
Once we do we do our
visit, we come back

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.775
and we hit the drawing board.

00:36:37.775 --> 00:36:41.420
And so Casey gets sort of
in it and just sketches,

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.120
and just comes up
with different ways

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:50.180
that we could represent pizza
and rats and New York City.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.035
And there's some
subway token stuff.

00:36:52.035 --> 00:36:56.620
And there are some early ideas
that combined the Yankees

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.020
NY with a pizza slice.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.240
And at this point, it's really
important for us, I think--

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.850
and somebody asked how
we get client buy in--

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.892
is we just all agree on
the criteria, the mindset.

00:37:10.892 --> 00:37:12.850
We don't have an agenda
about how we get there.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.760
We just say, like, oh,
we can't be ignored.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.910
We need to be authentic.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.290
We need to tell a story.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.700
And let's figure out how we're
going to go about doing that.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.720
And as long as everybody
at the top level

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.764
has bought into the
process, we don't even

00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:25.930
know where it's going to go.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.200
Or it's, like, let's throw the
ideas at the wall, and just

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.040
sort of shepherd this thing
along and see where it ends.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.285
So after we do sketches
and we have direction,

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:36.670
then we get into digital.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.320
Sometimes there's
some happy accidents.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.736
Like, the club said, you know,
that slice looks, actually,

00:37:40.736 --> 00:37:42.980
like the shape of Staten Island.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.530
And so, well,
that's a great idea.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.815
So we sort of
massaged that into--

00:37:47.815 --> 00:37:50.540
the pizza slice into the
shape of Staten Island-- which

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.920
is an Easter egg that nobody's
picked up on yet this week.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.190
CASEY WHITE: So just talking
about authenticity again--

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.010
so, again, the shape of Staten
Island for the Staten Island

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.510
mark.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:05.590
This is a reference to an old
New York City subway token,

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.690
the NYC with the Y in there.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.215
And then, of course, like
any respectable New Yorker,

00:38:11.215 --> 00:38:13.480
you fold your slice to eat it.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.370
So our rat chef there
is folding the slice.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.460
Yeah, so then, after digital--

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.310
JASON KLEIN: After digital,
we go into swatches.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.536
So we put together
the spec sheets

00:38:26.536 --> 00:38:28.660
for New Era, who's the
official cap of minor league

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.150
and major league baseball.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.150
And there's certain limitations
to the type of colors you have,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.594
what you can do with embroidery.

00:38:37.594 --> 00:38:39.010
One thing that we
really pioneered

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.230
was treating embroidery
like sculpture.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.110
So instead of just
embroidering something,

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.040
we'll break out-- this
is a great example,

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.450
you can see-- we'll break out
the sections of how we want

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.470
to lay down a single color.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.947
So in this sort of gray
color here, we'll say,

00:38:53.947 --> 00:38:55.280
we're going to center this here.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.520
We want this laid down this way.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.510
And when you have 3D logos,
where basically they put foam

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.140
underneath, and they can raise
up logos like you've seen,

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.025
it is interesting.

00:39:06.025 --> 00:39:07.960
Because you have
different levels of foam,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.800
so there's different
levels of how high it is.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.485
And then how you lay down the
thread, the type of thread

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.550
that you lay down, the colors.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.030
So we treat it like sculpture.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:23.740
And then once we approve the
swatches, we get into uniforms.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.520
And uniforms has its own
particularities about them.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.490
And we try to push the
envelope a little bit there.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.800
But yeah.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.850
SPEAKER 1: That's pretty cool.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:38.300
Looking at your
sketches, Casey, too, it

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.470
seems like a lot of
what you do is almost

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:44.730
all worldly-- letterpress
day sort of stuff.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.250
How does technology
factor into what you do,

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:52.250
and has it changed your approach
to creating or promoting

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.770
your work?

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.250
CASEY WHITE: So
technology is really big.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.340
We're quick to adopt
new technologies.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.400
We're still a really
small firm, so we

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.850
try to use all the project
management stuff that we can.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.560
We have a group of
people that work for us,

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.230
but they're all over the world.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.630
Because what we
do is so specific.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.040
It's hard to find people that--

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.150
even talented graphic designers
can't emulate our exact thing

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.130
that we're going for.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.387
But yeah, so I
mean, social media--

00:40:22.387 --> 00:40:23.470
we're kind of new to this.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.400
I would say Jason doubled
down on social media

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.490
maybe a year ago,
something like that.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.980
But he's having fun with it.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.370
And it's been really cool
to be able to control

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.950
a bit of our message about us.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.990
So that's been really fun.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.530
And then we actually have
a technology company.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:44.240
So a few years ago, some clubs
got together and asked us

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.445
if they were to build an app
for minor league baseball-- you

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:48.290
know our business.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.050
And so we formed this
company called Grandiose Ops,

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.390
and we built an app for
minor league baseball.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.180
We have the contract with BAM.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.090
So Baseball Advanced Media
is the technology arm

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.930
of Major League Baseball.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.780
They're really
great to work with.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.909
But yeah, so we built an app
for them three years ago.

00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:08.450
Now we're building
some new software,

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:12.410
actually, we're really,
really excited about.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.210
And I can't get into
what it's going to do,

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.679
but it's going to help the
clubs run their show, basically.

00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:18.720
And we have this thing
called the idea bar, which

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.410
is a place for people
to come and share

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.580
ideas about the industry.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.750
That's really cool.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.020
And so this is actually funny.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.200
So we tried to take that same
philosophy of naming something

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.387
crazy to technology.

00:41:32.387 --> 00:41:34.595
So this is a new product
called the Fairy Fan Father.

00:41:34.595 --> 00:41:37.250
And basically,
it's a delivery app

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.070
for delivering candy and
beer to the ballpark.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.114
But we're like, we should name
it Delivery Boy or something

00:41:44.114 --> 00:41:45.280
you'd think out of the gate.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.863
Let's name it something
crazy, like we

00:41:46.863 --> 00:41:48.080
do for our baseball teams.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.410
And so we had this idea
of this Fairy Fan Father,

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.420
that he grants your wishes.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.070
He runs around the ballpark
making all your cotton candy

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:00.990
and beer dreams come true,
raining beer and cotton

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.880
candy on you.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:06.830
So yes, so that was how
we took it to the market.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.260
So it's just an app.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.770
But we're seeing how
that naming process,

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.850
creative process
works in technology.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.899
We'll keep you posted.

00:42:16.899 --> 00:42:17.690
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:20.065
Actually, I've had it recently,
and cotton candy and beer

00:42:20.065 --> 00:42:21.350
is a great flavor combination.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:21.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.170
I think we have time
for one more question.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.080
AUDIENCE: Is there a story
behind the name Grandiose?

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.580
SPEAKER 1: The question is, is
there a story behind the name

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.029
Grandiose?

00:42:31.029 --> 00:42:33.570
JASON KLEIN: So when we first
started off in our college dorm

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.200
rooms, we had this
idea that people

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.997
who came to us, to work
with us, that they didn't

00:42:38.997 --> 00:42:40.080
like what they were doing.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.240
And that they wanted to
a sort of second option.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.020
So we started off
as Plan B Branding.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.685
A lot of other
Plan Bs came along.

00:42:47.685 --> 00:42:48.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.630
And when you call
somebody saying,

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:53.170
hey, it's Jason from Plan B,
people get a little nervous.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.160
So at some point, we
decided maybe it's time

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.560
to switch it up, evolve.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.110
And we sort of outgrew this
idea of being a second option

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.950
creative group.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:07.200
And we wanted something that
represented us being larger

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.170
than life, with some whimsy
and some magic to it,

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:17.150
and going back to our
roots of storytelling

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.840
and being kind of over the top.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.357
So we made up a word.

00:43:25.357 --> 00:43:25.940
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.815
Well, I think we're
running out of time.

00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:29.940
I'd like to thank everybody
here and everybody here

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.780
who dialed in from various
cities around the country.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.010
Thanks very much for
your questions, as well.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.370
I would encourage everybody to
follow Grandiose on Twitter.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.060
They do some stuff
on LinkedIn, as well.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.200
And just to check
out their work.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.540
So thanks again.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.090
I really appreciate you, Casey
and Jason, stopping by today,

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.270
and hope you enjoyed this talk.

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:52.320
