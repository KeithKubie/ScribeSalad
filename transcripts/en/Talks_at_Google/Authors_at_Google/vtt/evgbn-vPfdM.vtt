&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Alright everyone, thanks
for coming to another @Google event. It is

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.880
my pleasure to introduce to you today P.J.
Simmons, he’s a good friend of mine. He

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.299
has worked for over fifteen years to connect
sustainability issues to public foreign policy

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.359
and business affairs. Ah, I’ve got a brief
edited list of things he's done, bear with

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.300
me. He is the founder and co-founder and chairman
of the Corporate Eco Forum. The members of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.050
this forum are basically the "who’s who"
of the global economy. Google is a member

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.470
of the forum. He served as a research assistant
on International Environmental affairs at

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.110
the National Security Council. He founded
the Woodrow Wilson Center's Environmental

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.070
Change and Security Program. He founded and
edited Washington DC's first Consumer Guide

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.810
to Environmentally Friendly Businesses. He
served twice as the Clinton Global Initiative

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.670
Deputy Chair for Energy and Climate Change.
He directed the first Clinton Global Initiative

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.610
University Climate Program. P.J. also, he
received his BA in Political Science from

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.860
Tufts and his MA from Johns Hopkins. He was
a Fulbright scholar to the former Yugoslavia

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.759
and he holds of Certificate in Conservation
Biology from Columbia University. Outside

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.780
of that and the things I left off here, P.J.
has done nothing else. [laughs]. He is also

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.700
the co-author of the book Green to Gold Business
Playbook and that is what he is here to talk

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.200
to us about today. So, take it away P.J.
&gt;&gt; P.J. Simmons: Thanks so much, Jason. Good

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.939
afternoon everybody. When Google first invited
me to come here, and I am so grateful to be

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.229
here, I instantly said “yes”. Of course
as Jason mentioned Google is a member of the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.750
Corporate Eco Forum. I know the company well
and the company is actually been a real leader

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.590
in the space of sustainability innovation.
Um, but you know I actually subscribe to the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.434
email that says when there is new Google talks
and one of the first things that I wanted

00:01:54.434 --> 00:02:02.430
to do was check out who had done recent Google
talks and so of course I saw Tina Fey and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.119
Mario Batali and the two winners of the American
Idol [chuckles] and then some guy that was

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.590
talking about men’s sexual health and I
thought “Well, my work is cut out for me”.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.640
Tough acts to follow but I am going to try
to do my best to impart some knowledge on

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.010
you and I really appreciate you coming out
today.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.210
Let me just start by giving an introduction
to this book and where it came about. Back

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.390
in 2006, a book called Green to Gold that
my co-author Dan Esty wrote with Andrew Winston

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.140
and at the time it really made a big impact
because it really made a compelling case for

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.440
why companies ought to view environmental
issues and sustainability issues beyond the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.020
realm of corporate social responsibility and
as philanthropic issues and really see them

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.490
as core strategic issues for the future of
their businesses. And it was the book of the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.180
meeting at Davos, the World Economic Summit
in 2006. It really changed a lot of minds

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.120
and it really was this sort of "why" . And
Dan Esty called me a couple of years ago and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.190
knowing that I had been working with a lot
of Fortune 500 companies and large global

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.720
companies in the Corporate Eco Forum to ask
if I would be interested in working on the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.320
companion book the how to Green to Gold. And
that is the origin of the play book. We wanted

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.270
to create something that was really practical
that really helped people across a range of

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.510
different business functions so not just the
people with sustainability in their titles

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.020
and the environmental green team folks, but
people who do information technology for companies,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.460
people that do buildings and facilities, supply
chain executives and so forth. A quick word

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.360
about the organization that Jason mentioned
that Google is part of, and I should say by

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.930
the way that Jason mentioned I was deputy
chair of the Clinton Global Initiative for

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.491
a couple of years on Energy and Climate change.
My co-deputy Michael Terrell is actually a

00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:52.830
Googler based in California and was one of
my favorite colleagues to work with. The basic

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.050
idea of the Corporate Eco Forum, which we
set up in 2008, is to create a safe space

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.280
for their Senior Executives, again not just
the folks with the Environmental title but

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.620
people that are doing all sorts of different
things to drive successful business within

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.830
companies to kind of shut the door and sort
of create a safe space for them to exchange

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.510
their war stories and their success stories
in trying to make Green work for their companies

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:24.060
in a way that is profitable and lead to hard
business results. The [pause] and it has been

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.030
a really fabulous learning experience for
me and was a big part of the inputs that went

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.160
into this book. But I want to sort of flash
back for a few years. Many of you may have

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.560
seen this ad on TV, this 30 second ad spot
by IBM where there was this skeptical CFO

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.380
type, Chief Financial Officer, sitting behind
a desk and this woman comes in, the commercial

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.840
was shot in black and white in the first part.
She is saying that this is a case for why

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.020
the company ought to invest in some energy
efficiency measures. And the guy is really

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.680
skeptical and basically says this is going
to be great for the tree huggers, I get it,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.639
it is really a nice thing that we want to
do this but really from a business perspective

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.760
why should I sign this. And she then goes
through all of the costs savings and the millions

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.520
of dollars that the company is going to save
if they do it and all of a sudden it shifts

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.070
into color sort of like Dorothy landing in
Oz and the birds start signing and the music

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.930
starts playing [chuckles lightly] and he says
“where do I sign”. The remarkable thing

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.090
is since the book came out and since that
commercial came out there are so many examples

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.700
of companies that have actually had that experience
where somebody has gone into a skeptical CEO

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.389
or CFO office and made a case for investing
in something that might be a higher upfront

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.510
cost but would generate some really serious
payback in lots of different ways and because

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.620
of all that anecdotal evidence and because
so many people are seeing that from their

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.650
peers it has lead to a lot of people jumping
on the band wagon. And that really, again,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.820
is what the book is all about is to showcase
a lot of those case stories and really go

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.240
through the benefits of how Green creates
business value. The Green to Gold framework

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.410
which, back in the first book, outlined four
key benefits that we build on in this book.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.590
The first of the four benefits is Cutting
Costs and this is where most companies start

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.980
on their Green Journey. This is the most well
understood, it’s the most easiest to justify

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.470
to financial types and get budget for. The
idea is that Green in the new lean, if you

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.699
use a Green lens and Green principles you
are going to find new forms of waste , hidden

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.080
forms of waste that are costing precious time
and resources that are taking money away from

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.850
their profits. And you know one of the biggest
areas here focuses energy waste but we are

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.530
also talking about other operational costs
and inefficiencies. The result of water waste,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.630
scrap waste, chemical waste and all sorts
of other things that lead to regulatory burdens

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.110
and all sorts of other expenses. The second
big area is Reducing Risk and here we are

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.400
not just talking about sort of the mega risks
that we are all familiar with and we see on

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:01.250
the news, the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico
or catastrophic chemical accidents. But we

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.990
are also talking about the kind of environmentally
related risks that creep up on companies and

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:11.530
that may not be on a lot of strategic planners’
minds but ought to be given the way that trends

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.800
are shaping up around the world. One of those
examples, if you are a company that is a beverage

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.000
company for example like Coco Cola that relies
heavily on water, it’s a key input for you.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The fact that world water resource, fresh
water resources, are becoming more scarce

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.390
is a big concern to you. Not only because
it’s a key input to your product but also

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.880
because you might get blamed and might get
a lot of the exposure for being part of perpetuating

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.790
the problem if you don’t fix it. And that
is one of the reasons why Coca Cola is one

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.650
of those companies that is actually investing
in Water Shed Restoration and Protection around

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.220
the world to create the system so that water
actually keeps getting generated. And there

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:52.182
are lots of other examples of that in the
IT realm. For example there is a lot of other

00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:57.680
companies like Google that are using huge
amounts of energy because their information-intensive

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.900
and have a lot of data centers and a lot of
servers and so companies are thinking “what

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.360
about the price of energy? What happens when
carbon-based energy becomes more expensive?”

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.150
So what does it look like to invest in other
forms of energy that might not expose us to

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.400
so much of those changes? The third big area
is Growing Revenues and this is where is starts

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.070
getting really interesting and where we have
seen a sea of change in the last couple of

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.090
years in the way that big global companies
start thinking about their environment from

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:28.000
just this compliance thing to a cost reduction
thing to a risk reduction thing to actually

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.490
something that might really help drive innovation,
drive growth of their business, be a source

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.740
of future revenues and competitiveness. Dupont,
the chemical company, is an example of one

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.800
that actually set a 6 billion dollar revenue
goal by 2015 for products that are built around

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.450
sustainability. A lot of you are probably
familiar with the ads for Ecomagination by

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:54.650
GE. They have been so successful, that originally
started as a marketing initiative where the

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.680
company was already doing a lot of products
that were really good delivered a lot of environmental

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.240
reductions and benefits and the CEO, Jeff
Immelt sort of pulled people together and

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.850
said “How can we better communicate this
stuff? How do we package this in a way that

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.290
gets the message out there?” So they came
up with Ecomagination but that ended up being

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.029
so successful that it launched a whole new
wave of thinking within the company and a

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:22.029
new wave of innovation. The revenue goals
for 2012 for that company, for the Ecomagination

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:28.300
line are 25 billion dollars. Huge growth area
from where it was just a few years ago. And

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.480
Proctor and Gamble, a big consumer goods company
that you are all familiar with, makes detergents

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.420
and all sorts of household products, they
are now looking at a revenue goal by next

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:41.850
year of 50 billion dollars in sustainable
product innovations. That has to do with anything

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.850
from low compact laundry detergent that uses
less energy and less product, costs less to

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.040
ship to all sorts of different innovations
there.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.460
And then the final area which is harder to
describe for a lot of people, harder for people

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.920
to buy into but it’s probably one of the
biggest when it goes to Environmental Sustainability

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.890
and it has to do with brand and intangibles.
And here we are talking about the benefits

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.660
that aren’t easily captured on traditional
financial statements and accounting statements

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.540
but they are the kinds of things that are
really important drivers of future earnings

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.610
and of share holder value and of stock price.
We are talking about brand equity, customer

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:20.220
satisfaction, customer loyalty, are people
going to stay with you are shift over to the

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:26.600
next big thing when someone else invents it.
License to operate around the world, reduced

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.209
operational burden and interference from regulators,
from NGOs; less Green Peace sort of demonstration

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:37.770
of what you are doing, less regulators breathing
down your back, stronger ability to attract

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.870
top talent and retain top talent and for a
company like Google that is absolutely enormous

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:47.010
and priceless. Stronger R and D and innovation
capacity within the company, how nimble, how

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.220
adaptive and how creative is the culture and
capable of actually responding and looking

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.460
at trends in the world, looking at customer’s
needs, looking at how things are changing

00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:02.320
and adapting to that and innovating. It is,
a brief word about stock value, going back

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.730
to Coca Cola for a second. Twenty percent
of its market capitalization can be attributed

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:13.300
to its book value and it’s hard assets.
But eighty percent of the value is attributed

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.959
to intangibles, like how investors view the
strength of its brand; it’s exposure to

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:21.760
risks, its R and D capacity and so forth.
And there are companies that are smaller like

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.620
New Belgium Brewing Company which makes some
of my favorite beers, based in Colorado, that

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.930
have really experienced the people-related
benefits of going green. Their CEO is really

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:37.279
charged up about sustainability and you see
a bike in their actual logo. Their, they have

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:42.640
an employee retention rate of 95 percent and
their motivated workforce has really propelled

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.790
them to exceed the growth rate of a lot of
their competitors. The industry average is

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:52.779
about 80 percent; their growth rate has been
13½ percent. Another example of a much bigger

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:58.040
scale of total brand turnaround is WalMart.
This is a picture of Mike Duke addressing

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.110
earlier this year sustainability gather of
his company. That company if you flash back

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:10.279
to before Katrina, Hurricane Katrina, and
the tragedy there. It was getting hammered

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:14.600
by NGO and the public left and right for being
bad on social issues, being bad on environment

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.589
and so forth. And there was a kind of an “Ah-Ha”
moment when the company decided from a values

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:24.029
perspective to do the right thing with Katrina
and think about how it could actually help

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:31.600
make a big difference in alleviating suffering
and helping people. At that time the CEO Lee

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.800
Scott walked away and thought to himself and
with some urging from other colleagues thought

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.520
“What would it be like if WalMart was always
at it’s best like this?” And that plus

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.830
a lot of other personal transformations and
conversations with experts that WalMart had

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:53.790
lead to an imaging of a future where WalMart
actually would be loved by people and would

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.350
attract people that actually care about sustainability.
But it also started looking at it from a hard

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:03.290
business perspective of resources running
out, prices changing, of all these factors

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.820
and its license to operate all around the
world. And it started thinking how could it

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.330
change the way it does business and it’s
been a profound transformation. And if anybody

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.640
is actually interesting in learning more about
that there is great book called Force of Nature,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.360
which I just read a few weeks ago. It really
is kind of a great behind the scenes story

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:25.950
about that transformation. Going back to this
IBM commercial, even though there is so much

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.970
exciting stuff that we talk about in the Playbook
that I’m part of with the Corporate Eco

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.800
Forum review that I learned about, the reality
is that the vast majority of people in business

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.050
still think like the CFO behind the desk.
They think of environment and sustainability

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:43.750
as a cost center. Something that is going
to be a pain in the neck, an add-on to everything

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:50.510
that they are already doing. And one of the
interesting indications of this, there was

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:57.310
a survey that a big company called Forrester
Research did at the end of last year, 2010

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:05.440
fourth quarter. And it asks something like
2600 company executives that had budget authority

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:11.290
“What are your top business priorities for
2011?” So you can see the top is growth,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.860
company revenue is really important. Attracting
and retaining customers is one of those intangibles

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.910
but a really important priority. Efficiency,
lowering operating costs, improving quality

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:26.170
of products and processes. Innovation, again
intangible stuff but how do you improve your

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.720
ability to innovate as a company, how do you
drive new market offering and business practices.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.459
Talent, how do you acquire and retain talent,
again an intangible, it is something not easily

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:40.820
measured and quantified but really important
to improve productivity. If you are wondering

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.940
where environment is, it is at the bottom
of the list and it falls under, it’s number

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:51.029
ten, and it is called Improved Corporate Environmental
Sustainability and Social Responsibility.

00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:55.190
I think the way that that question is framed
and the fact that it’s a separate add on,

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.290
it’s thought of in terms of responsibility
and not in terms of something that actually

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.521
advances every single one of those things.
In the growth, efficiency, innovation and

00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:07.290
talent department. It’s a measure, a sort
of indication, of where we are and it’s

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:11.680
where things are changing. The CEOs and the
companies that are visionary are seeing the

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:20.529
connection and the through line through all
those categories and not seeing it as a stand-alone.

00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:25.120
Really, this is what the book is meant to
sort of help people with. It is designed not

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.959
for, as I say, just the Chief Sustainability
Officer or the CEO, and it is not meant to

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:33.580
be read from cover to cover. But it is meant
to be a really practical guide that a CEO

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.120
could hand to somebody that is the Chief Information
Officer, the Chief Technology Officer, the

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.260
head of R and D or the supply chain and say
“Hey, check out this. Have we tried these

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.300
different things? Have we looked at these
different plays, they seem to be paying off

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.070
for other people. Would this work?” And
to be very clear, Dan and I, in this book,

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.301
are very adamant. If this is going to work
for you you need to apply the same sort of

00:15:55.301 --> 00:16:00.139
business tough approach that you would for
any other business decision making issue and

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:06.360
not every play that we talk about in the book
is going to pay off for every company. But

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.980
for the companies that do, apply the lens
and the kind of principles we sort of guarantee

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:17.300
that you will find ways that it pays off for
your business. And you will see that these

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.600
are Chapters 8-17. I pulled them out because
it sort of gives you a sense of the fact that

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.990
we wrote for these different audiences and
tried to use, tried to start from the prospective

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.420
of what is it that somebody in logistics is
really going to be caring about and how could

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.610
green actually help with what they are doing.
As an extension, just one last word about

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.100
sort of where we both think this is going
and why Dan and I wanted to get this book

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.720
out there. To sort of accelerate the trends
that we think are under way, where Green is

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.130
no longer seen as separate thing. Where it
is pivotal to long term business success and

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.839
it’s integrated with business activities
across value chains, it’s a top innovation

00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:58.839
driver, and you see there are lots and lots
of surveys that supports this is the megatrend.

00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:05.669
We want to just move it a little faster given
what’s actually happening with global environmental

00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:09.600
trends. One final word before I talk about
some of the examples from the book, one of

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.089
the things that I have been thinking about
a lot recently is vocabulary and how we talk

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:18.340
about these issues. The word "environment"
I think has a connotation, built-in connotation,

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.079
that make people think of polar bears and
spotted owls and all sorts of mega-charismatic

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:27.870
species and not about something that we actually
connect to. And the business context , again

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:32.870
it's seen as, often times, it activates a
way of thinking about corporate responsibility,

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.650
stewardship, values and so forth. You see
these kinds of statements in annual reports

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.580
and in our websites. We care about the environment
so it is something separate from us. We have

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.320
a responsibility to the environment, to the
planet, this is our environmental strategy,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.929
as apart from our business strategy. We want
to generate win/win outcomes for the business

00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:54.610
and the planet so they are two different things.
It struck me a couple of weeks ago that maybe

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.290
we ought to just replace the word environment
in a lot of those conversations with the word

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.620
"long-term". And if you do that, it actually
ends up really getting to the basic logic

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:10.390
of what this is all about. It’s about businesses
caring about their long-term success and competitiveness.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.221
The responsibility to their long-term, and
to the share holders in the long-term. It's

00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:18.631
their long-term strategy and they want to
generate win/wins not just for, when they

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:22.380
say the business, but what they often times
means quarterly profits. They also want to

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:29.830
generate win/wins for the short term profits
and for the long term. So let me just focus

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:35.740
on the rest of the time, give you some examples
from the book of some of the plays that are

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.840
paying off for companies and where we talk
about a lot more in the Playbook. And on the

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.121
first and closest to home is the office environment
and how is affects virtually every company.

00:18:44.121 --> 00:18:50.390
And a great place to start is paper and printing.
We have all probably been to the printer,

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:55.551
shared printers and seen a ton of paper that
has just been left there by other people and

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:58.260
not been picked up or we have forgotten to
pick something up ourselves at the printer.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:04.480
There is Xerox research that says that 40
percent of printouts are discarded within

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.780
24 hours. We don’t need, most every single
company whether its small or large can actually

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.640
get rid of a lot of paper and save a lot of
money in the process. Some of the research

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:20.419
we uncovered pointed to savings of about $1250
per employee per year with a return on investment

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:26.110
of 300% through just really simple measures,
like making double sided printings standard

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.200
and with helping users with software that
actually makes it easier for them to make

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:36.080
better choices. Lockheed-Martin , a big defense
contractor, saves ¼ million dollars every

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.850
year by shifting a manual they used to hand
out to all employees that seems kind of mindless

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.049
by saying “Here read this.” Which would
just sit on a lot of desks, they put it online

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:49.380
and that is saving them ¼ of a million dollars
a year. Barclays Capital in the UK actually

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.809
requires the use of a swipe card to go pick
up your print jobs and that is saving about

00:19:53.809 --> 00:20:00.100
½ a million dollars a years. And GE estimates
that it is saving, has saved about 1.6 billion

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.020
over the last decade by shifting a lot of
things to digital. I am proud to say that

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.700
in writing the Green to Gold Playbook I didn’t
print, well, I didn’t actually have a printer

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:12.780
that was working, I did everything online.
We used Wikis , we used Google docs, we used

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:19.299
all sorts of collaborative techniques and
.pdf viewers and the only paper was actually

00:20:19.299 --> 00:20:24.360
when the publisher sent me single-sided versions
of the manuscript, which ended up, this was

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.850
the last day before we sent it off to the
publisher. There is a ton of things that can

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.490
be done in the office environment. We go through
a whole handful from electricity use, paper,

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:40.289
trash, water, e-waste, travel, food and these
are things that Google is operating on all

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:44.390
cylinders in this regard too. A big theme
that we talk about, not just in the context

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:50.020
of office environments, but also in virtually
every part of the book is engaging the talent

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.150
and the ideas of people like you that are
just on the frontlines and know what the problems

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.330
are and can figure out creatively what the
solutions are. For instance, one great example

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:02.950
of this that I love from Yale University they've
got thirteen dormitories. They created a competition

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:09.140
and the reward was $300 of pizza. That was
the investment. And that generated tons of

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.960
ideas which ultimately lead to a million dollars
in energy savings for Yale just out of the

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.429
$300 investment. Similarly at WalMart they
went through, several years ago, they started

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:24.679
involving people in what they called a Personal
Sustainability Pledge or Project, now they

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:30.289
call it My Sustainability Pledge. And they
put a lot of employees through a training

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:33.220
where they got to think about “What does
sustainability mean to me? How can I make

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.860
a difference in my personal life and my job
that is going to benefit me and benefit the

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.430
business?” And one guy was sitting in a
break room and he realized the lights in the

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:46.680
vending machine were on in a very well lit
room, this is not the actual room, but he

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.680
basically got this idea that this was serious
waste and it bubbled up to Corporate. WalMart

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.130
is saving a million dollars a year just by
turning off the light bulbs in its vending

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:59.270
machines. It’s just one of those simple
ideas that when you start giving people and

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.700
empowering people with the concepts and give
them some examples, the creativity they come

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:13.480
up with is just amazing. Closer to home for
all of you in the area of information technology,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.340
one of the things that is making a big difference
and really paying off for a lot of companies

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:22.370
is using video conferencing and remote collaboration
and telecommuting to really drive a lot of

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:29.001
cost savings and actually make employees a
lot happier. How many of you either telecommute

00:22:29.001 --> 00:22:34.680
at any point like one day a week now or how
many of you currently do? And how many of

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:42.039
you would like to that don't already? So for
those of you that do, you probably have, you

00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:45.620
can probably speak of some of the benefits
that are there. But the research really bears

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:53.450
out that what it does is help companies really
cut real estate costs in a huge way, about

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:57.539
twenty five percent of IBM staff telecommute
regularly and that program saved the company

00:22:57.539 --> 00:23:01.690
fifty million dollars. And there are a lot
of studies that show that there is a boost

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.240
in productivity and that people actually work.
I can attest to this, too, because I telecommute.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.600
You actually work more hours in part because
you are not stuck in traffic and you are not

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.671
dealing with the hassles and vagaries of weather
and everything else. This can really help

00:23:16.671 --> 00:23:21.309
with retention because there are a lot of
studies that this makes people happier. In

00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:25.740
the McKessen Corporation which is in the Health
Care Sector, reports that the group that it

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.910
has the highest job satisfaction in it’s
whole company are the thousand nurses that

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:36.980
they have working from home. On a related
note, video conferencing is huge and collaboration

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:42.280
tools and I can just point out how much I
love Google+ and I am one of early early adopters

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:49.550
and one of the evangelists of the technology.
But here you have Google+ hangouts which allows

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:56.870
up to ten people to communicate really quickly
at a time. And this kind of innovation is

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.830
really brining down the cost and making it
affordable for virtually anybody to take advantage

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:05.200
of these kinds of technologies and reduce
a lot of travel as well which is really costly

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.080
for companies. And a huge source of carbon
emissions as well which when companies start

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.580
counting up their carbon emissions, travel
for a lot of companies is big. So this helps

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:20.030
on multiple fronts. And then you have solutions
like Cisco Telepresence which are also really

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:29.940
coming down considerably in cost and so the
payback is fast. Not just because of the prices

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.460
are coming down but because of the massive
amount of savings for travel reduction are

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.340
often times paying for the equipment and the
investment in like fifteen months or less.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:43.630
Moving into the area of buildings which is
an area we spend a whole chapter on, have

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:49.990
a lot of checklists. It used to be that a
lot of great opportunities in Greening buildings

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:54.250
and in saving money were untapped because
people just have the perception that it costs

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.710
a lot more, lack of awareness about the best
practice and opportunities. That is really

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.530
changing as companies exchange their success
stories the costs are dramatically coming

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:10.010
down. The upfront cost premium for a commercial
Green building today is only about two percent

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.789
compared to a traditional building. And the
time to recoup the initial investment has

00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:18.822
dropped down to an average of three to four
years. The return on investment over a twenty

00:25:18.822 --> 00:25:24.630
year period on a Green building now stands
at four to six times the upfront costs. And

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.300
Green building are not only sort of paying
back for themselves and generating a lot of

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.510
operational saving and reduced energy bills
and retirement and everything else. But they

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:39.039
are also commanding rent premiums of about
$11.33 more per square foot for LEED certified,

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:43.789
which is one of the highest environmental
rating system that people have over traditional

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:50.130
buildings. They also have higher resale rates,
they are selling for $171 more per square

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:58.549
foot over, LEED building are, over the traditional
counterparts. One of my favorite examples

00:25:58.549 --> 00:26:02.640
of not a Green building, it didn’t start
that way, but has been retrofit to become

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.270
one is the Empire State Building. I actually
took this from my apartment so it is not the

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.540
clearest picture but one of the things I love
about the building is that they have transformed

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.159
the idea of what lights at night look like
and just by lighting up with LED lights at

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:20.600
the very top of the building they have created
this iconic thing that everybody loves in

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.080
New York City. Of course it changes and people
go on the website and look at what the different

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:29.840
colors mean, but what they did recently is
invest twenty million dollars in retrofits

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.870
to try to make the whole building much more
energy efficient. They are getting a payback

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.820
in three years for that and they are expecting
4.4 million dollars for annual savings by

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:45.500
cutting energy like thirty eight percent just
by that initial investment. You know there

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:52.250
are so many areas again that we cover in the
Playbook, from plugging holes literally in

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:57.500
doors and windows, better insulation, setting
water temperature lower, putting air conditioning

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:02.830
and heating at rational levels. I just went
to a luxury hotel recently and got put up

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.400
there and it was another one of those experiences
where you turn on the tap of hot water and

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.780
you almost burn yourself because it is so
hot. And then you walk into the hallways and

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.920
it is like fifty degrees [chuckles] like the
Arctic. That’s not luxury to me and it is

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.720
just a huge amount of waste for the company
that they are doing stuff like that. So we

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.890
have a lot of examples and checklists in the
book for things like that. Lighting is one

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:30.800
of the big areas where, one of the first areas
that we encourage people to focus on. It consumes

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.039
about thirty five percent of electricity in
US commercial buildings. And the EPA says

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:39.480
that we are wasting about fifty percent of
the energy associated with lighting because

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:47.190
of inefficient design and poor maintenance
and inappropriate use. Huge payback in this

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:52.330
area and one of the, I pulled this up too
since I was thinking about the incandescent

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.710
light bulbs which are often joked by engineers
as being little heat engines that emit a little

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:02.400
bit of light. Because they emit so much heat
that someone invented a product around them

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.720
[chuckles] back in the seventies, an Easy
Bake Oven. But the sort of newer forms of

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.800
lighting drive down a lot of bills and they
also boost productivity. And one of the things

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.510
that was staggering that I learned in the
context of this book that a lot of folks are

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:21.130
saying that better lighting boost productivity
and makes people happier at work. So the numbers

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:26.080
again are controversial because how do you
measure that, how much to put a price on that.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.929
But one of the things that one of the researchers
did was they calculated at even a one percent

00:28:30.929 --> 00:28:34.720
productivity bump from lighting . You think
about how much companies spend on employees

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:40.340
and salaries, if you boost productivity by
just one percentage, sort of an estimate that

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.480
can actually offset in many cases companies
lighting bill for the entire, energy bill

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:51.809
for the entire year. That can make a big difference.
Another area we focus on is roofs, painting

00:28:51.809 --> 00:28:58.370
a roof white is a really simple measure; it
deflects a lot of heat. Green buildings are

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:03.130
becoming a more popular for similar reasons.
All of this changes the ambient temperature;

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:09.591
it reduces the load on the AC and the heating
within actual companies, or building. Con

00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:13.940
Edison here in New York actually installed
both of these forms in its corporate head

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.890
quarters recently reducing the summer heat
gains by sixty seven percent, the white roof

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:24.169
is. And the Green roof is cutting summer heat
by eighty four percent, and winter heating

00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:30.810
losses by thirty seven percent. So huge gains
in the building area.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:36.321
Going back to your realm of information technology,
this is an area where the role of IT professionals,

00:29:36.321 --> 00:29:41.989
the Chief Information Officers, is becoming
big and I think it’s going to become absolutely

00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:46.120
huge and indispensable for companies that
really want to seize Eco Advantage . And it

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.740
is obviously big for just about every company
because every company uses IT in one way or

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.121
another. But for companies that actually are
built around IT like Google, this is a huge

00:29:54.121 --> 00:30:00.830
area of both impact and opportunity. First
of all most companies spent a lot of money

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:06.710
on energy because of IT and when you get more
efficient about it you can save a huge amount

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:11.610
of money as a result. IBM says that its clients
as it helps get more efficient in this area,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:18.049
get fifteen to seventy percent reduction in
operating costs through IT efficiency initiatives

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:22.419
and full payback in most cases in one to two
years. And these again are fairly simple measures

00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:27.650
and IBM itself actually saved forty nine million,
or avoided forty nine million dollars in costs

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:31.580
in building a whole new data center because
it did some efficiency measures to make one

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.900
of its data centers hugely more efficient
and upped the capacity of that data center

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.670
by eight times. So it avoided having to build
a whole new building, forty nine million dollars

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:45.370
saved from a one million dollar investment
in a Green overhaul of that data center. Second

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.909
of all the reason why IT is such a big area
is because companies are going to face increasing

00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:54.360
pressure in this area to address the rising
impacts associated with IT. Especially in

00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:00.570
the area of Greenhouse Gas Emissions associated
with energy use at their data centers but

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:05.210
all sorts of the devices that we carry around
and plug in and of toxics associated with

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:10.990
electronic waves. In fact McKinsey , the consulting
firm, predicts that by 2020 the biggest source

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:17.429
of Greenhouse Gas Emissions worldwide could
come from information and communications technologies

00:31:17.429 --> 00:31:22.750
and products. And of course we have all heard
about E-waste and toxic issues being a really

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:28.020
big problem. And then finally and I think
most interestingly there is potential for

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:35.840
the IT industry and IT professionals to really
transform a lot of processes and be net solutions

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.899
drivers. So yes, you have all those impacts
but there is potential to actually move the

00:31:39.899 --> 00:31:46.720
industry in a way that solves some many sustainability
problems that its own impacts are offset by

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:52.300
all those contributions. And you see a lot
of companies getting into the consulting space

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:58.550
and sustainability software space, huge explosions
of offerings that try to help companies deal

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.490
with the huge amount of analytics that people
are now trying to grapple with all the sustainability

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:06.190
metrics to try to make their company more
efficient, make their supply chains more efficient,

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.460
track what’s happening in Indonesia and
China with one of their suppliers. Lots of

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:21.730
complexity in terms of information that IT
professionals are seizing or jumping on the

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.039
band wagon to just try to solve [pause].
We talk about a lot of different areas in

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:29.919
the book in IT that people can make a difference
on a lot of the end user environment efficiency

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:34.010
and so forth. But one of the biggest areas
is data centers obviously and I think most

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.279
of you are probably very familiar with this
issue and you know that Google is one of the

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:41.890
world leaders in this area so I am not going
to spend too much time on this but just a

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:46.442
couple of issues to mention when it comes
to data centers cause it is so important.

00:32:46.442 --> 00:32:49.549
You know there is two key issues when it comes
to data centers from an environmental and

00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:53.780
energy standpoint. First off the energy and
the impacts form the equipment itself and

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.179
second of all the energy and impacts from
the building and the structures that actually

00:32:57.179 --> 00:33:02.320
house them. All the cooling and heating and
lighting associated with that. Right now according

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.340
to the EPA and Department of Energy of the
United Stated, data centers represent about

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:11.140
1.5 percent of all the energy that is consumed
in the United States. And that figure is likely

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:18.870
to double in the next five years. Cooling
is a big area where it adds up for companies,

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:25.270
where it costs a lot of money. About ten years
ago about seventeen cents per dollar spent

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.169
on a new server went towards power and cooling
and today it’s up to forty eight cents.

00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:33.610
If that number doesn’t change, according
to one estimate, it could go up to seventy

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:37.130
eight cents. So companies are doing a lot
to change this and Google is one of the pioneers

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.929
here as I mentioned and really helping to
accelerate the spread of those best practices

00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:47.169
and what we call "next" practices, emerging
practices in this area. One of the companies

00:33:47.169 --> 00:33:52.090
that is doing some really interesting things
in this space is Yahoo. The reason I bring

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:58.260
them up is they built this data center in
New York that actually draws a lot of free,

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.140
literally free cooling that it doesn’t have
to pay for it from the outside air and they

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:11.259
were inspired to invent this from looking
at how chicken coops actually cool naturally.

00:34:11.259 --> 00:34:16.149
But again really some of the most exciting
stuff in this area has to do with the potential

00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:21.739
for IT to drive sustainability problem solving
at the company level, at the regional level,

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:26.970
the country level and really at the global
level. And I think Google Earth Engine, which

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:31.809
was just announced recently in Cancun at the
Climate Negotiations last December is really

00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:35.309
one of the most stunning examples of this.
I love this picture, it is of the Chief of

00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:43.049
an Amazonian tribe called the Surui and they
are using Earth Engine to help measure forest

00:34:43.049 --> 00:34:51.200
carbon in their area. But this is an incredibly
powerful and important monitoring platform

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.909
that is going to be an invaluable tool in
curbing deforestation around the world. And

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:58.760
it was launched by .org so a lot of you may
be wondering why I am mentioning this in sort

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.089
of a business focused presentation, but again
going back to the brand impacts. First of

00:35:03.089 --> 00:35:08.381
all, I think this actually is one of the products
that Google comes out with that is associated

00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:13.180
with this brand that really does drive a lot
of people to feel great about the brand of

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.660
Google and it’s really invaluable in that
sense. But it’s also, as they say, sort

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:24.200
of indicative of a solution to many sort of
emerging needs and problems out there where

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.190
IT can be a solution.
Very quickly in the manufacturing space the

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:35.039
idea of Green being sort of taking lean manufacturing
to new heights, putting lean on steroids.

00:35:35.039 --> 00:35:38.959
It’s about sort of routing out waste in
all forms and sort of identifying waste that

00:35:38.959 --> 00:35:43.990
you might not otherwise see and one of the
secret weapons for anybody in Green manufacturing,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:48.160
sort of like the pizza party at Yale, is to
tap into the talent and the expertise of line

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.369
employees. One of the things that General
Electric does is they have these treasure

00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:56.680
hunts that have been replicated and shared
with a lot of other companies that are doing

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:02.289
similar things now. And these are pictures
from a three day treasure hunt in Wisconsin

00:36:02.289 --> 00:36:07.019
where they set a goal and they call it the
Hunt for Carbon or something. The idea is

00:36:07.019 --> 00:36:11.819
that carbon is a symptom of waste and so they
are going to go hunt for carbon to try to

00:36:11.819 --> 00:36:17.920
find at least seven hundred thousand dollars
in energy savings. What then team did is they

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.420
went on a weekend when normally things are
shut down and they tried to look at all the

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.049
things that were sort of spinning around,
the lights that were on in the bathrooms or

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:29.960
wherever, ventilation issues and tried to
get a sense of where there is waste. They

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:36.059
came up with three million dollars in savings
just in a three day treasure hunt. Miller

00:36:36.059 --> 00:36:40.759
Coors is an example of a company that has
actually gone and taken some of its plants,

00:36:40.759 --> 00:36:46.910
as GM has and a lot of other companies have,
to zero waste. They were generating 1.6 million

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:52.229
in pounds of trash in 2007. Some of their
folks got together and said we want to create

00:36:52.229 --> 00:36:57.880
a goal of within five years getting to zero
waste, they did it in two. Another company

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.579
that makes vacuum cleaners, that you may own,
Bissell, uses a lot of the input to its products

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:06.510
to make new products and just keeps recycling
stuff and recycling and they call it, it’s

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:10.099
closed loop manufacturing. It’s an idea
inspired by nature, where nature doesn’t

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:15.450
waste anything it just keeps recycling stuff
over and over again and using those inputs.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:21.630
In the area of logistics and transportations;
planes, trains, automobiles and trucks, you

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:27.249
have a lot of folks who have been slow adopters
to this because they have to worry about getting

00:37:27.249 --> 00:37:31.880
things precisely where they ought to be, exactly
when they ought to be in the right shape.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.880
So many thing and variables that could go
wrong, so for a lot of logistics professional

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.280
supply chain leaders the idea of adding Green
has been “I can’t deal with this, we have

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.499
so many things on our plates already.” The
companies that have including FedEx and Staples

00:37:45.499 --> 00:37:52.599
and UPS and WalMart and so many other companies
that have accomplished logistics operations

00:37:52.599 --> 00:37:57.349
have found enormous savings here. And one
of the simple measures that a lot of companies

00:37:57.349 --> 00:38:01.229
that take are with their trucks they take
and put these auxiliary power units on so

00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:04.410
that the trucks don’t have to idle. Because
truckers driving around twenty four hours

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.269
they have got to actually sleep, so usually
what they would happen is they keep the engine

00:38:09.269 --> 00:38:12.249
running to keep the air conditioning on and
keep the heating on in the summer and winter

00:38:12.249 --> 00:38:17.760
time. These auxiliary power units can save
up to twenty gallons a day for a truck which

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.930
really you can imagine adds up to huge savings
over time. A lot of companies are now getting

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:30.819
into hybrid trucks, big upfront investment
but a huge payoff in the form of savings.

00:38:30.819 --> 00:38:35.700
Fuel, forty percent better mileage, and also
maintenance costs tend to be less for all

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:41.109
the companies that investing in this stuff.
One of the examples that I love from logistics

00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:47.990
is from Boeing. They actually were inspired
by the sort of biomechanics of dragonflies

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:53.509
and bats. They ended up putting these winglets
on a lot of the planes that have cut fuel

00:38:53.509 --> 00:38:57.390
use in the planes that use them by three percent,
which may not sound like a lot and that’s

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.670
the whole idea with sustainability. These
little things that when you start adding them

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.680
up it’s like compound interest, the numbers
can be astounding when you start creating

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.509
these little innovations that can lead to
big changes.

00:39:08.509 --> 00:39:12.140
Another big area is packaging. It took this
picture; it is probably one of the most egregious

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:17.140
examples. But there have been so many where
I get this box where something could have

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:23.430
just mailed the box, but a sticker on the
box. What that leads to is a lot of trucks

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:31.630
that are could be filled much more efficiently,
a lot of wasted gas, a lot of wasted fuel

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:36.059
in airplanes and so forth. And a lot of wasted
packaging that the consumer, the customers,

00:39:36.059 --> 00:39:43.440
end up having to deal with which is a drag.
Let me move now and sort of wrap up in talking

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.920
about product innovations in some of the areas
where companies are actually boosting revenues

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.309
because they are innovating a lot of products.
Start with a couple of examples of pioneers

00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:54.569
in this area that are pretty well known. One
is ZipCar, a lot of you may not think of ZipCar

00:39:54.569 --> 00:40:00.229
as a Green player or Green company. I don’t
think they sort of started that way either.

00:40:00.229 --> 00:40:03.470
But the idea was that they basically have
done is taken a product and turned it into

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.769
a service. And in the process of doing that
they have taken for every car that they have

00:40:06.769 --> 00:40:11.380
they have taken fifteen and twenty cars off
the road and they are now boasting about that

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:16.440
in terms of their Green credentials, rightly
so. But this concept of actually going from

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.029
product to service is a really important one,
driving a lot of innovation. Similarly Interface

00:40:21.029 --> 00:40:24.569
Carpet Company, many of you may have heard
of it, if you haven’t there is a remarkable

00:40:24.569 --> 00:40:29.769
man Ray Anderson who is CEO and founder of
Interface Carpet Company. He kind of got religion

00:40:29.769 --> 00:40:33.810
many years ago when he read Paul Hawkins book
the Ecology of Commerce. He was running this

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:38.279
industrial carpet company that was generating
enormous amounts toxic waste and so forth.

00:40:38.279 --> 00:40:42.430
And he was so inspired by the concepts there
that he decided to really undertake a radical

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:47.150
vision for his company and try to be a net
zero, have net zero impact by the year 2020.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:52.829
That galvanized the company much like the
brewing company that I mentioned earlier.

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:56.980
That people are really excited about that
vision, the retention has been great, the

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.609
branding has been fantastic and they came
up with this innovation that many of you may

00:41:00.609 --> 00:41:05.180
have seen. Flor Carpets where you can actually
buy carpet tiles and that way you can, first

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.930
of all, design a carpet to look exactly the
way you want it, which is pretty cool and

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:14.329
is a new benefit for companies. But is also
allows you to actually reduce the costs of

00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:18.640
maintenance because you can recarpet very
heavily trafficked areas and not have to buy

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.240
a whole other carpet and of course reduce
a huge amount of waste too. There is a company

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.359
called, in the newer entrepreneurial space,
Active Ion, that just last year developed

00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:36.999
something called the Ionator EXP. That Fortune
said was one of the top ten destructive technologies

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:42.299
in the world, and it actually turns tap water
into a chemical free cleaning agent that kills

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:46.849
almost 100 percent of germs. And there is
a lot of demand for hospitals and businesses

00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:51.170
for these kinds of cleaning solutions. Even
Valvoline is getting into the act with recycled

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:58.450
motor oil. This is a really interesting example
from a company called StoCoat in Vermont that

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:03.719
was inspired by the lotus flower which in
Asian culture symbolizes purity because of

00:42:03.719 --> 00:42:08.339
its ability to remain clean while growing
in a dirty environment. And what they managed

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:14.269
to do was replicate the surface microstructure
of the lotus plant [clears throat] leaf in

00:42:14.269 --> 00:42:20.880
paint so that you never have to wash your
buildings, the dirt just sort of washes off.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:28.279
A company named AkzoNobel , you may know that
does paints and performance coatings and specialized

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:34.069
chemicals in Europe now is focused on EcoPremium
solutions sort of like GE’s EcoMagination

00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:39.569
solutions. And that’s generating a huge
amount of profit for the company higher margins

00:42:39.569 --> 00:42:43.119
for these products. They were inspired by
the way that a lot of marine mammals move

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:47.309
through water in a very sleek way and they
came up with this coating that allows ships

00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:52.059
to actually move through the water a lot faster,
more efficiently, safe the customer money

00:42:52.059 --> 00:42:55.969
and they are getting a huge boost in profits
from that. Another really interesting example

00:42:55.969 --> 00:42:59.329
in Calera, they have actually flipped the
idea of cement on its head. They actually

00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:04.309
were inspired by coral reefs and the way the
marine organisms actually develop their own

00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:09.799
shells and grown within a marine environment.
So they developed a process where they take

00:43:09.799 --> 00:43:14.099
carbon dioxide out of industrial processes
and use that waste to actually make cement.

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:16.449
And what is most interesting I think about
the businesses model is that it doesn’t

00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:21.400
go out selling cement; it relies on charging
the polluters to actually have the service

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:27.259
of taking carbon dioxide and sequestering
the carbon dioxide. So free cement but carbon

00:43:27.259 --> 00:43:32.839
negative cement which in an industry like
cement is huge because it is such a big contributor

00:43:32.839 --> 00:43:39.999
to carbon emissions.
I just want to end with the statement that

00:43:39.999 --> 00:43:44.410
a lot of people ask me “Is the Green stuff
a fad?” and I have felt after working on

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:49.069
this stuff for seventeen years now, I have
felt for seventeen years that it is not only

00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:52.420
not a fad it is something that is going to
be something so powerfully part of everything

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:58.319
that we think about and do. Maybe not in our
lifetimes but fairly soon and one of the reasons

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:02.269
for that is that the fundamental drivers that
are driving all this pressure from activists,

00:44:02.269 --> 00:44:09.329
from investors, from share holders, from customers,
from NGOs, all this pressure is routed in

00:44:09.329 --> 00:44:12.890
some realities about what’s going on with
our natural world and with our natural ecosystems.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:19.799
And I took this picture recently in Bahia,
a few weeks ago in Brazil. This tree is kind

00:44:19.799 --> 00:44:23.989
of overtaking this natural structure that
we had built and I was thinking how, in fact,

00:44:23.989 --> 00:44:28.140
you know we tend to think about ecosystems
again as this other thing, but in fact these

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.140
are these remarkable natural biological infrastructures
that have been built through R and D for four

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.049
and one half billion years on this planet
that do pretty amazing things. Certainly when

00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:42.940
you stop and think about it, rain falls on
a virgin forest; it’s healthy and out comes

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:48.779
water that we can all drink, that purifies
our water. The Amazon is known as the lungs

00:44:48.779 --> 00:44:52.709
of the planet cause it breathes twenty percent
of the oxygen that we breathe on this planet.

00:44:52.709 --> 00:44:58.369
You have mangroves off the coast on Indonesia
that not only are protecting when they are

00:44:58.369 --> 00:45:04.440
healthy, protecting people against Katrina-like
events or tsunamis but there are also nursing

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.599
ninety percent of the fish. So they are serving
as the nurseries for that and they are a huge

00:45:08.599 --> 00:45:14.720
amount of the solution for sequestering carbon
in our atmosphere. We have all this systems

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.059
that sort of work behind our backs and we
all take for granted and the reality though

00:45:18.059 --> 00:45:24.009
is that a lot of this has been free for us
until recently and what I think companies

00:45:24.009 --> 00:45:27.940
are just beginning to understand is that nature
in a sense is going to start charging for

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:33.190
all that stuff. And back in 1997 when a bunch
of economists did an estimate of if we had

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:38.690
to pay for all of this stuff, what is it that
nature is giving us for free? And then came

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:43.469
up with the figure of thirty three trillion
dollars annually of free goods and services

00:45:43.469 --> 00:45:48.289
that we get. That’s double, at the time,
double the output of all the world’s economies

00:45:48.289 --> 00:45:53.539
combined. And that number has been recently
updated and is being updated and could be

00:45:53.539 --> 00:45:57.249
double at this point. When you think about
what it would cost us to build that infrastructure

00:45:57.249 --> 00:46:01.319
that nature has already got around, the answer
is usually it would cost us a lot more. We

00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:06.369
saw this in New York City, here in the New
York City Watershed for years, for decades

00:46:06.369 --> 00:46:11.219
we have always talked about New York having
the finest water in the world. You go to a

00:46:11.219 --> 00:46:14.849
restaurant and say “I’ll take New Yorks’
finest!” Well several years ago, about fifteen

00:46:14.849 --> 00:46:18.859
years ago, the water started degrading in
quality and the EPA basically came and said

00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:22.949
New York City you are going to have to build
an eight billion dollar water treatment plant

00:46:22.949 --> 00:46:28.450
to safeguard people from this water that is
unhealthy to drink. And some genius had the

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:33.019
idea that in fact nature was doing this for
a long time by itself and maybe we ought to

00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:37.969
restore and fix the natural infrastructure
that was already there rather than build this

00:46:37.969 --> 00:46:43.660
eight billion dollar plant. So for a fraction
of the cost, New York City issued a bond issue,

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:50.299
they changed land rights, they paid farmers,
educated farmers to do different practices.

00:46:50.299 --> 00:46:53.030
And instead of having to build a plant that
would actually have millions of dollars of

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:57.582
annual upkeep cost and have the upfront investment,
for a small fraction of that we ended up restoring

00:46:57.582 --> 00:47:02.249
the natural info structure and now we still
have clean water. This kind of story is being

00:47:02.249 --> 00:47:09.479
repeated around the world. But you know recently
what I am excited about is that there are

00:47:09.479 --> 00:47:16.130
big companies and institutions, Price Waterhouse,
teamed up with Georges Bach and the UN and

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:20.709
several other actors to create something called
the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity

00:47:20.709 --> 00:47:25.880
Assessment recently. And one of the things
that they concluded is the ecosystem threats

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.920
are going to eclipse climate change in economic
impacts but there are still off the CEO and

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:38.400
valuations radar screen. They estimated that
the current costs that we are doing, in terms

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.559
of global environmental damage, is about six
and one half trillion dollars in 2008, eleven

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:48.239
percent of GDP. It’s estimated to be twenty
eight trillion on 2050 and at three thousand

00:47:48.239 --> 00:47:53.599
public companies cause one third of the damage.
And if those big companies don’t think that

00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:58.459
folks are going to actually put pressure on
them to start accounting for that damage that

00:47:58.459 --> 00:48:03.690
so far has been external, as we call these
externalities in economics. It’s an easy

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:07.699
way of saying it sort of doesn’t matter
at the moment but in fact people are paying

00:48:07.699 --> 00:48:11.549
the cost indirectly. We are all paying the
costs and companies are eventually going to

00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:16.119
start paying the costs much more directly.
What this all means is that there is going

00:48:16.119 --> 00:48:21.430
to be more demands for transparency, more
ratings systems like we see, we see countless

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.390
explosion of surveys like Corporate Responsibility
Magazine. We are going to see them rating

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:29.400
companies based on all sorts of different
criteria. We see more demands for radical

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.989
transparencies, Patagonia has been a pioneer
doing it’s Footprint Chronicles and sort

00:48:33.989 --> 00:48:40.770
of allowing consumers to sort of look at where
a particular object that they bought was manufactured

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:44.489
and follow the train all across the supply
chain. WalMart is actually starting to do

00:48:44.489 --> 00:48:50.719
this with barcodes on fish and other products.
You see companies like WalMart that are demanding

00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:56.229
for all of their suppliers, their billions
of dollars worth of suppliers, for answers

00:48:56.229 --> 00:49:00.359
about how they are doing, what their sustainability
performance is because they realize that it

00:49:00.359 --> 00:49:05.699
is all connected. More effort to try to make
it easier for the consumer. This is not necessarily

00:49:05.699 --> 00:49:11.170
the answer but the Carbon Trust has a label
that it has worked on in the UK to sort of

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:15.299
work with Tesco to actually put a carbon footprint
label on every product so that companies,

00:49:15.299 --> 00:49:19.219
so that consumers can differentiate . And
it also means that there is going to be more

00:49:19.219 --> 00:49:23.749
regulation and hopefully it’s smart regulation
that actually creates incentives and frameworks

00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:27.900
and gives private sector the flexibility to
innovate and come up with the right answers

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:31.730
at the right costs and doesn’t just sort
of command and control like we have seen in

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:36.359
the past. But companies need to prepare for
more regulations. And there is going to be

00:49:36.359 --> 00:49:40.949
more global competition in this area. We have
seen in the areas of wind and solar and a

00:49:40.949 --> 00:49:44.920
lot of other high tech, clean tech areas where
the US was the catalyst and was the original

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:52.020
innovator. A lot of those industries are becoming
the global sort of leaders are in other countries.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:58.880
That is just going to keep being an issue
as we move forward. Why am I optimistic at

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.479
the end of the day, people ask me if I am
optimistic or pessimistic about this sort

00:50:01.479 --> 00:50:05.670
of state of affairs here and are companies
doing enough? First of all, I am incredibly

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:10.249
optimistic because I have seen countless examples
including Google of companies that have really

00:50:10.249 --> 00:50:14.670
been visionary in creating things that nobody
could have even imagined in terms of solutions

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:19.670
several years ago. But when you compare it
to the scale of the issues that are causing

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:26.029
are these fundamental drivers, it’s nowhere
near. The gap is just unfathomable. And so

00:50:26.029 --> 00:50:29.920
what we need and what the companies are sort
of "next practice" in this area, are thinking

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.529
like Albert Einstein. We can’t solve problems
using the same kind of thinking we have when

00:50:34.529 --> 00:50:42.400
we created them. We need totally new frameworks
and fresh thinking. And so what I answer,

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.260
I am optimistic when I meet people like you
and companies like Google and I am sort of

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:51.279
reminded in a situation like this of the scene
in 'Airplane' where Leslie Nielsen keeps coming

00:50:51.279 --> 00:50:54.670
into cockpit as the plane is coming down and
he says “I just want to let you all know

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:58.460
we are all counting on you!” That’s sort
of the way I feel about all of you and I thank

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.189
you for your time today and I thank you in
advance for all the great stuff you are going

00:51:01.189 --> 00:51:04.680
to do for the future! Thanks. [clears throat]
[ applause ]

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:10.499
Let me add just one other quick word if I
could, for those of you that are interested

00:51:10.499 --> 00:51:13.759
in keeping up with what properties are doing
and the sort of latest trends in Corporate

00:51:13.759 --> 00:51:18.809
sustainability, we published a free briefing
every Monday morning. This is a no nonsense,

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:23.329
no advertising briefing that highlights a
lot of the most notable plays that companies

00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:28.920
are doing and government regulation and market
technology trends and everything else. You

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.630
can sign up for it on our website ecoforum.com.
