00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.180
There are two broad categories
of approaches to use for

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.650
choosing stocks to buy or sell.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.790
They're based on Fundamental
analysis and Technical analysis.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.380
Fundamental analysis involves looking at

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.000
aspects of a company in
order to estimate its value.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.750
Fundamental investors typically look for

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.260
situations where the price of
a company is below its value.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.950
Another camp is based
on Technical analysis.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.060
Technicians don't care about
the value of a company.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.120
Instead, they look for patterns or
trends in a stock's price.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.650
This lesson will focus
on technical analysis.
