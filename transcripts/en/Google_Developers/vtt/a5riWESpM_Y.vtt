00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:09.590
TODD KERPELMAN: Hello, I/O Live.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.710
Todd Kerpelman here,
and I am joined

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.770
by Leor Stern, who is product
operations lead for Wear OS

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.280
by Google.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.781
Hi, Leor.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.613
LEOR STERN: Hi, Tom.

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:17.150
Hi, I/O.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.130
TODD KERPELMAN:
So I couldn't help

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.297
but notice there's quite a
number of watches around.

00:00:20.297 --> 00:00:20.963
What's going on?

00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:22.720
LEOR STERN: Yeah,
there are quite a few.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.580
In fact, there are
29 watches here,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.970
which represent a broad
spectrum of the watches

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.540
available today running Wear OS.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.440
You can see some of the kind
of high-end, luxury-oriented

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.350
watches that we have here,
like the Hublot, which

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.510
is a limited edition watch.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.530
You can see a good
sampling of fashion watches

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.790
from brands like
Michael Kors and Fossil.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.870
And on your right
we have a bunch

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.090
of more fitness-oriented
watches, which

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.820
have features like GPS
and a heart rate monitor,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.667
and are great to use when you
go out for a run or a workout.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:58.750
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.535
Very cool.

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:02.020
And so, what is new
with Wear OS this year?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.390
LEOR STERN: So what
we're looking at here,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.860
behind us, are
these four displays,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.460
which represent the four
product pillars of Wear OS, one

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.970
of which is the Assistant.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.820
And we launched a new
UI for the Assistant.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.720
It's actually rolling out
to watches now as we speak.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.500
And then next to that is
the productivity pillar,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.960
which is focused on
things like being

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.670
able to see when your
next appointment is

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.240
at a glance or a bunch of
new features for Google

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.310
Keep on Wear.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.690
Next to that, we have the
connectivity and communication

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.190
pillar.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.246
We're doing a lot of
work on notifications,

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:43.870
on making the watch
a great way for you

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.470
to be in touch with the people
and things that matter to you.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.290
And then lastly,
the fitness pillar,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.410
where we're also doing a
lot of work on Google Fit

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.140
and also focusing
on third party apps,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.200
like Strava, like
Lifesum, that bring

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.457
a set of powerful
features to Wear OS users.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:04.540
TODD KERPELMAN: Excellent.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.310
Getting fit is always good.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.009
So I know you had
mentioned that we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.550
have some neat new
features that take

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.674
advantage of the Assistant.

00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:11.770
Can we see a demo of that?

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.978
LEOR STERN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:12.978 --> 00:02:15.430
So we've got a couple of
things at I/O this year

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.160
that are in developer preview.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.910
We're previewing a new power
saver mode for the watch

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.550
where, once you dip below a
certain battery threshold,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.810
will actually disable
a bunch of the radios

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.970
and different features to extend
the battery life of the watch

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.320
and make it easy for users to
get back to turning everything

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.450
on with a long press.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.220
The other preview that we have
is Kotlin support for Wear OS.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.130
And the big feature that we're
demoing here in the booth

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.590
is the new Assistant
UI for Wear,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.067
for which we can segue to my
colleague Kangwon for a demo.

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:52.150
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.760
Let's go take a look right now.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.520
Hey, Kangwon.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.452
I hear there is a new
Assistant on Wear OS.

00:02:57.452 --> 00:02:58.660
Can you show me what it does?

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.770
KANGWON LEE: Of course.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.770
Now it has all the actions
available on the watch.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.400
So let's see.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.700
Do I need an umbrella tonight?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.670
So it gives me the
weather information.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.640
What's added is I can continue
this conversation using

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.210
suggestion tips or I ask
more questions, such as,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.820
what about tomorrow?

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.150
These are called
suggestion tips that

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.580
are relevant to the context
and gives me more information.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.780
These are first-party actions,
and I'm going to show you other

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.350
third-party actions because
Google knows about the weather

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.770
but not everything--

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.020
Google cannot turn on
the light on this one,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.000
because this is
not Google product.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.780
Would you tell it to
let there be light?

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.530
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, I'll do that.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.530
Let there be light.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:50.988
KANGWON LEE: There you go.

00:03:50.988 --> 00:03:52.470
TODD KERPELMAN: Whoa.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.140
That's amazing.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.910
KANGWON LEE: Yeah.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.586
Pretty cool.

00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:55.460
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.334
Any other third-party
devices it can talk to?

00:03:57.334 --> 00:04:00.300
KANGWON LEE: We actually have
a robot vacuum right behind me,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.690
so let me try to start
cleaning this floor.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.556
Start cleaning.

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:07.430
TODD KERPELMAN: Whoa.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.050
Look at it go.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.466
Go little robot vacuum, go.

00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:13.695
KANGWON LEE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:15.350
TODD KERPELMAN: Get those chips.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.880
Get them, get them, get them.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.600
That is awesome.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.300
And is there an action
that will make my kids put

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.030
their dishes away after dinner?

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.840
KANGWON LEE: You
can build your own.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.010
That's the whole point.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.340
You can have your own actions.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.630
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.005
That will be
available next year.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.600
Wow.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.270
That was fun.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.770
All right.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.990
So I have one last
question for you.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.410
What time is it?

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.690
I'm just kidding.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.490
My last question is,
if I'm a developer

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.380
and I want to find out more
about building something cool

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.930
on Wear OS, where would I go?

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.540
LEOR STERN: So now,
developers can build actions

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.229
on Google for the Assistant
and just keep the watch in mind

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.770
and make sure you
test it on watches.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.050
And, of course, everyone
should come check us out

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.260
at wearos.google.com to
learn about the platform

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.625
and everything it has to offer.

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:57.270
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.936
So there you go.

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.810
Actions on Google and
wearos.google.com.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.190
And hey, did you
like this video?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.050
Want to see something just like
it, or kind of close to it?

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.810
Head on over to g.co/io/guide
for more videos like this.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.560
Thanks, everybody.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.351
We'll see you soon.

00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:15.809
