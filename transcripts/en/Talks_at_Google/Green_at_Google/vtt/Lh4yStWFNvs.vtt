SPEAKER: Please join me in
a massive round of applause,

00:00:02.381 --> 00:00:03.576
welcoming Will Butler-Adams.

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:06.366
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:11.030
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: Thank
you very much, everybody.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.685
You don't need to cheer
me unless you want to.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.534
So I'm going to tell you a
little bit about our business.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.890
Thank you very much for turning
up and sort of turning down

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.600
our very short-lived summer.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.700
So that's the bike
that I've taken out

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.990
of our reception, which has
got a dodgy light on it,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.870
which doesn't seem
to want to turn off.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.870
This is one that we've
made which we are-- we just

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.574
need to get some of you guys
away from your computers

00:00:42.574 --> 00:00:44.115
and obsessed with
your little tablets

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:45.850
and on a fucking bicycle.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.020
So in the interests of the
importance of branding,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.940
we made one to show you.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.470
But basically we make a bike
that makes life in cities

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.710
a little bit more enjoyable.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.020
It doesn't mean that your
children are well behaved.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.980
It doesn't mean that your
boyfriend or girlfriend is fit.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.570
It doesn't mean that you
look like you're worth it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390
on an advertising campaign.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.700
None of that.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.340
It just makes life
a little bit better.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.740
We've been making them
in London since 1980,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.440
and I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the journey

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.870
that the company's been on
from when Andrew, the inventor,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.190
started through to where we
are today and some of the plans

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.215
we have to try and grow
our little business.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.270
So it started because
of Andrew, who's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.600
looking pretty knackered
in that photograph.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.460
And that was in about
1982, I suspect.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.080
He started-- he
went to Cambridge,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.180
studied engineering, and was
far too intelligent to work

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.300
for anybody else.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.060
If you've met
hyperintelligent people,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.537
they find it extremely difficult
to work for anyone else,

00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:03.120
because they know
they're just so much

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.971
cleverer than the person they're
supposed to be working for.

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:07.970
So he was never going to
work for somebody else.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.330
He was always going
to work for himself.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.720
That started off with an
entrepreneurial cutting-edge

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.710
flower business, which he
got his friends to invest on

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.100
in early sort of
crowd-source funding.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.630
They shoved their money
in, he got a little van,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.550
and he did these sort
of hanging baskets

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.640
in Burlington Arcade and
other places around London.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.170
And he had winch mechanisms
and gear mechanisms

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.190
and automated watering systems.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.232
And within two years,
the business went bust.

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:40.440
So his first adventure into
the entrepreneurial world

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.400
of "I'm going to make it"
went a bit pear shaped.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.050
Things carried on, and he
did a bit of contract work

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.382
but didn't really find his feet.

00:02:48.382 --> 00:02:50.340
And his dad at this stage
is starting to worry,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.923
because his friends
are off on their--

00:02:51.923 --> 00:02:54.190
this is in the '70s-- off
on their graduate trainee

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.604
programs, and they've all
become captains of industry.

00:02:57.604 --> 00:02:59.270
And he's still fiddling
around wondering

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.580
what he's going to do.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.490
And his dad had been in
touch with a business

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.790
called Bickerton.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.490
Ever heard of Bickerton?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.040
Very, very cool bike.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.810
And the strap line
was Bag a Bickerton.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.340
It was a folding bike.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.430
The son I know quite well today.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.940
Really cool design but rode
like of blancmange, made out

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.500
of aluminum with
wiggly handlebars

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.550
and rode a bit weird.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.430
Anyway, Andrew's dad,
who was an accountant,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.710
knew that they were
looking for some support so

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.767
got-- well, shoved-- encouraged
Andrew to go along and meet

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:29.350
them, because he
thought he might have

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.250
a role with them, which he did.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.469
He went there, and
then he came back,

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.010
and his dad's like,
so how did it go?

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.200
Maybe a job?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.510
Maybe a 9 to 5 normal job.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.520
Was it exciting?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.540
And Andrew's like, yes.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.380
This was awesome.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.380
It was so interesting, but
they've got it all wrong.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.290
And I've got a much better idea.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.770
And his dad's like, oh, my god.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.700
Here we go again.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.460
Another bloody disaster.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.090
So Andrew set off, coming up
with his design for a better

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.560
folding bike.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.920
And he at the time rented a flat
on the Cromwell Road, which he

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.470
rented when he left Cambridge.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.260
He still rents at 67 the same
flat just on the Cromwell Road,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.130
and he designed
his bike, and he's

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.834
pretty modest,
hyperintelligent, and decided

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.500
to call it the Brompton, because
his flat overlooks the Brompton

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.950
Oratory, which is a Catholic
church just damp from the V&amp;A.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.350
And he had a brilliant idea,
and the idea was principally

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.009
that the bike folded
around the rear wheel,

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.300
and you encapsulated all the
grubby bits in the middle.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.080
That was the basic idea.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.572
And he never wanted to make it.

00:04:35.572 --> 00:04:37.030
He wanted somebody
else to make it.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.340
He just came up with
a brilliant idea.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.300
He knew he was brilliant.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.341
He knew it was brilliant.

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.309
It was all brilliant,
except that nobody else

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:43.350
thought it was brilliant.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.630
So when he wrote
letters to Raleigh,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.400
who were making a million
bikes a year at the time,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.610
they turned him down.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.050
Everyone else he went
to, they turned him down.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.309
And after five years of
turn-downs for someone else

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:54.350
to make it, he thought he
better make it himself,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.420
which is what he's doing
here with a guy called Paddy.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.737
And in two years, they made 400
bikes, and they sold them all.

00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:04.320
And after two years,
Andrew got around

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.780
to worrying about the
actual P&amp;L and discovered

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.610
he made no money, because
his tooling was-- well,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.520
it didn't exist.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.520
He was fiddling around,
filing bits of plastic,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.410
but the bikes worked, the
customers liked the bikes,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.860
and he knew if he could
just get a bit of money

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.045
to pay for tooling so he could
buy an injection mold tool

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:23.636
rather than having to file
and mill plastic, then he

00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:25.760
could sell it for the same
price and make a profit.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.860
He needed 40 grand in
1982, which isn't actually

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.330
a huge amount of money.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.640
So he went to Barclays Bank.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.750
He went to NatWest Bank.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.040
He went to all the VCs.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.530
He went to the government help
you get your business going.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.760
All of them turned him down.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.290
And finally, six years after
he'd stopped production in '82,

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.310
it was one of his customers that
was so frustrated they couldn't

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.400
buy more of these bikes that
he stepped in-- a chap called

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.410
Julian Vereker-- and if
you're into your music,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.090
there's a fantastic British
maker of audio called Naim

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.190
Audio, and Julian founded Naim.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.350
And he put the money in
and got Andrew going.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.470
So it took Andrew 13
years to get this business

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.160
off the ground.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.950
And to be perfectly
honest, you have

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.340
to be slightly barking to
be so obsessed by a product

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.480
that for 13 years, when
everybody else tells you

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.120
it's not going to work,
you still go at it.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.270
And that's not 13
years, to the point

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.090
where he's now a great success.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.512
That's 13 years just to get
the flipping thing started.

00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:34.220
And there were plenty
of years after that

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.960
where it was nip and tuck.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.930
We make the bike in London,
and make means make.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.060
Often people think make
means remove from box

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.360
with made in China, take out
of box, turn little screw,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.400
stick on Union Jack, made in UK.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.850
So we take metal,
we bend it, form it,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.600
crop it, braze it,
make the frame parts,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.170
and make it in London.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.060
Andrew is extraordinarily
determined,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.530
and the whole business is
based upon the product.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.780
In the early days,
he found customers

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.630
a complete pain in the ass.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.001
He was obsessed with the bike.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.750
There were things that
were wrong with it,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.050
and he had all these
annoying customers trying

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.899
to get more of his bikes.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.690
And he hadn't finished
perfecting the bike.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.814
So they were just distracting
him and annoying him,

00:07:24.814 --> 00:07:25.684
and they bugged him.

00:07:25.684 --> 00:07:27.100
And then he had
annoying customers

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.250
from Holland wanting to
fiddle around with his bike

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.170
and he was going to have to
spend more time translating

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.590
a brochure.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.870
But that was a waste of time,
because he was getting trouble

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.130
with his indicator chain.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.660
He was perfecting
his chain tensioner.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.490
And the business only
got off the ground,

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.290
because it was one
of his customers

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.610
who was so frustrated that they
sorted him out with the dosh.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.470
So not listening
to what people say

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.230
is one thing we
believe strongly in.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.970
Two, all you need to really
care about is your customer,

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:05.860
and that is so overused
and so rarely implemented.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.640
I started by saying
this will not

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.290
mean you have a fit boyfriend
or girlfriend nor will

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.990
it mean you look
like some poster that

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.690
isn't even real, because most
of what we see is bullshit.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.200
It's over-rated, over-told,
over-promised untruths.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.320
And yet we all march around
buying into this stuff

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.720
and then discover that half the
stuff we bought is total trash.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.370
We wonder why we even bought it.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.539
If we do buy it, we
wonder was it worth it?

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.620
Did it deliver what it said
it was going to deliver?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.799
So it's simple.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.429
We just deliver a
bike that makes life

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.932
just a little bit better.

00:08:42.932 --> 00:08:44.640
And if we can deliver
that and deliver it

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.980
not for the first
six months when

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.438
you've just had the elixir of
spending a grand on a bicycle

00:08:48.438 --> 00:08:51.120
and you flipping love
it, if after six years

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.320
you genuinely think
it's added some value,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.340
then we've achieved something,
because few products do that.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.520
Again, the bike
hasn't really changed.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.970
The design hasn't
really changed,

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.490
but the bike is
changing all the time.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.700
The bike industry is funny.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.490
If you take-- in fact, we'll
come on to that in a bit,

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.720
but I'll save that for later.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.514
But the design hasn't
changed, but the bike's

00:09:20.514 --> 00:09:21.430
changing all the time.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.260
So I reckon I've
been there 14 years,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.552
with the exception of one
part, which has dogged us,

00:09:27.552 --> 00:09:28.510
and no one's wanted it.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.000
It's been like a hot potato,
which is finally being fixed.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.333
Pretty much every part has
probably changed two or three

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:35.010
times over that period.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.190
You can't see it,
but they've changed.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.640
And also our jigs
and fixtures have

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.330
changed, because
in the early days,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.680
we were using feeler
gauges, verniers, now we're

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.030
using CMM machines.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.550
So our glasses have got
rather more binocular,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.310
and we can see more.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.440
We couldn't see before.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.805
And also FEA didn't exist.

00:09:53.805 --> 00:09:55.180
We couldn't afford
the computers.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.000
Now we can see it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.150
So all the bicycle
is doing is trying

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.762
to get as close to nature.

00:10:00.762 --> 00:10:01.720
That's what physics is.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.220
Physics is just mother nature.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.109
And you try and get
as close as you can

00:10:05.109 --> 00:10:07.400
and make it as light as
possible, as stiff as possible,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.250
as compact as possible,
and occasionally it

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.690
tells you zzzt--
it can't do that.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.110
But the more you understand
about nature and FEA,

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.454
finite element analysis,
and some of the tools

00:10:17.454 --> 00:10:19.370
that we have today that
we didn't have before,

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.619
have allowed us to get closer.

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.500
Now it has allowed
us, funnily enough,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.600
to make the bike
stronger, more efficient.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.105
We haven't made it that
much lighter in the last two

00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:28.730
or three years.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.688
In the last 10 years, we
made it a lot lighter,

00:10:30.688 --> 00:10:33.210
but more recently we're
finding our customers are

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.970
more like you guys and
actually you're a real pain.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.100
We like customers who are--
we don't mind customers

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.250
who are quite heavy but
don't do many miles,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.860
because you can get
that in America.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.580
You get someone who's quite
large and they look at you

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.820
and go, you know, is it
going to be all right?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.680
I'm like, it's fine.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.430
No trouble at all.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.450
As you get thinner,
you will do more.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.230
It's a sort of
self-regulating prophecy.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.280
But the problem is
when you find a sort

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.140
of 28-year-old
rugger-bugger who rocks up,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.370
and he weighs 17 stone
and does 10 miles each way

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.120
and bounces off every
curb, and those guys

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.910
are an absolute nightmare,
because they try and break

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.570
our bike.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.199
And we've become more
trendy, and so suddenly we've

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:12.240
had to make the whole
thing quite a lot stronger.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.270
But you don't know that, but
we've been worrying about that

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:14.770
quite a bit.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.870
So I'm slightly
obsessed with this thing

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.570
about how you communicate
who you are, what you are.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.390
And my perception
is, I mean, you

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.610
can tell I don't care
too much about fashion.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.370
That's not where I'm
spending my time.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:43.260
But Andrew doesn't realize the
extent to which he is embedded

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.580
in our business, but he is.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.510
And he thinks we're all useless
and everything we're doing

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.094
is crap, because
he's a perfectionist,

00:11:48.094 --> 00:11:49.718
and he knows better
than everyone else,

00:11:49.718 --> 00:11:50.940
and we're all pretty useless.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.250
But he was obsessed
by the product

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.350
and allowed the product
to do the talking.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.220
And the product, a
brand, is not a logo.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.950
It's not something you
pay an agency for that

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.201
spend millions of pounds
fiddling around and coming up

00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:08.700
with.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.310
A brand isn't even
what you sell.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.360
A brand is an experience that
you have over a period of time.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.460
It is something that
is built up over trust

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.700
and over genuine
value that you add.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.900
So we have been lucky.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.650
That's all we've cared about.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.639
We don't spend our
money on marketing.

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:31.930
I don't think we're one of
the biggest Google customers

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.400
for AdWords or other words or
other bits or other things,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.320
and I'm lost already, because
if I spent-- like a Gillette

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.560
razor, you're not buying
a flipping Gillette razor.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.380
The razor cost is this much.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.950
Most of it's going
on crap-- some tennis

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.309
player or some other thing.

00:12:50.309 --> 00:12:51.850
You're not getting
what you paid for.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.620
You're being ripped off.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.544
I don't mind spending
some of my profit

00:12:55.544 --> 00:12:57.960
on R&amp;D, because I feel that
my customers will think, well,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.060
you're making it better
for the next generation.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.750
But to spend it
on naff billboards

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.630
and sort of overrated
stuff is a bit not my bag.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.030
But we have been
lucky, and you are

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.830
in some respects part of that.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.040
Andrew's philosophy was
always word of mouth.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.430
And the thing that's luck is
that we've hit word of mouth

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.930
at a time where word
of mouth has changed,

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:28.120
has moved from word of
mouth to being global blogs.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.180
The word of mouth has been
augmented by the internet.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.767
And honesty and integrity
is what people look for,

00:13:35.767 --> 00:13:37.100
and the internet has given that.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.700
And your reach, through
that word of mouth,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.590
has become global.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.710
And so we're very
lucky at a time when

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.180
we were relying on
physical word of mouth

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.480
that at the same time--
and to be fair, it was just

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.800
when I happened to
arrive, so it looks

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.799
like I've done an amazing
job, but actually I've

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:53.520
just turned up at
the right time--

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.850
and that has allowed
that word of mouth

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.960
to become more widespread.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.200
And as a result, we've
become quite international.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.770
We now export 80% of our bikes.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.400
We're making about between
45,000 and 50,000 bikes a year.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.680
We've made about half a
million bikes to date.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.402
We're exporting about 80% to
44 countries around the world.

00:14:16.402 --> 00:14:18.110
But we haven't gone
out there and started

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:19.524
wandering around
waving our flag,

00:14:19.524 --> 00:14:20.940
saying who wants
to sell our bike?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.490
People have come to us and said
I've got a friend in London,

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.040
was in London for two years,
bought one of these cool bikes.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.807
He's taking it back
to wherever he's gone,

00:14:27.807 --> 00:14:28.890
showing it to his friends.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.660
They got a few more.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.620
Can I become the distributor?

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.750
And that's how we've started
to sell and increasingly

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.840
sell abroad.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.270
And in the early
days, I remember

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.675
I went to Taiwan,
which is ironic really,

00:14:42.675 --> 00:14:44.800
because most of the bikes
that people buy in the UK

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.591
are made in Taiwan.

00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:47.780
It's quite nice to sell
them the other way.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.470
But I was in Taiwan,
and I was with a guy,

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.570
sadly, Sturmey
Archer, who make hubs.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.050
They got screwed over
in the UK, and then they

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.840
were basically bought
out of receivership

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.830
and went to Taiwan.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.630
And we helped that business
come back to life in Taiwan.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.710
So our hubs come from Taiwan.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.310
So I was with one of
our suppliers in Taiwan

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.190
and looking for a distributor.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.340
There's this one guy.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.120
He was an architecture student,
obsessed with bikes, never done

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.720
selling, never done
distribution, had a cool shop.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.340
He was a one-man band.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.570
So I met him.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.397
He loved the Brompton, wanted
to become a distributor,

00:15:23.397 --> 00:15:24.230
thought it was cool.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.021
Then we went to dinner
with this other guy,

00:15:26.021 --> 00:15:28.035
who was some massive
great distributor,

00:15:28.035 --> 00:15:28.910
whole load of people.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.110
We all got absolutely lashed
on whisky, which would

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.390
seem to be par for the course.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.170
He showed us around
his massive warehouse.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.970
We were all going
to be millionaires.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.540
And we finished, and I was
sitting down with Pearce,

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.180
and I said now,
Pearce, which one

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.040
do you think we're going to
go with as a distributor?

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.900
He said, well, it's obvious.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.400
You've got this big
massive company.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.099
Yeah, but they
don't give a shit.

00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:48.140
They don't care about us.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.950
They just see us
as the latest fad.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.129
So instead we went
with Thomas, who

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:53.920
didn't know the first
thing about anything,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.610
to do a distribution but cared
deeply about our product.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.850
Thomas has grown our
distribution in Taiwan.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.950
We've now set up a
partnership with him in China.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:01.980
He's a complete legend.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.350
He's now had three children.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.510
He's a bit of a panicker, but
he cares about our business.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.850
And in the long run, that
is what your brand is about.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.880
It's not just about--
it's everything.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.870
It's just honesty.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.600
So anyway, so the
business has got bigger.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.760
And we're making a bit
more money-- I mean,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.770
compared to you
guys, really tiddly.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:28.550
But we have a simple
aim, which is just

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.517
to make living in cities
a little bit better.

00:16:31.517 --> 00:16:32.600
That's what we want to do.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.020
There are about 90,000
Bromptons in London.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.400
And we have had an
effect on London.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.480
We have changed London,
only a little bit,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.280
but it has had a real
effect on the city.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.704
And that's something
to be very proud of.

00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:46.370
If we're going to do
what we need to do,

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.200
and we've got all
these ideas, and we

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.658
don't want to go to a bank,
and we don't want to go to VCs.

00:16:50.658 --> 00:16:53.009
We want to self-fund it, then
we need to make a profit.

00:16:53.009 --> 00:16:54.800
And that's nothing to
be embarrassed about.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.840
We need to make a profit
to invest in new ideas

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.840
and enable to
business to be better.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.150
And so it's growing,
getting there,

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.717
and I'll talk a little
bit later about where

00:17:06.717 --> 00:17:09.050
we are at the moment, because
we were doing brilliantly,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.180
and we were sitting
back and making money,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.409
and then we just kicked all
that into the long grass.

00:17:13.409 --> 00:17:14.450
But we'll come onto that.

00:17:16.867 --> 00:17:18.450
I was going to say
our prime minister,

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.369
but I haven't got to
raise him there yet,

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:23.290
so we'll have to
just do this bloke.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.540
It's really weird.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.030
People get quite
uppity about politics.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.530
But I'm quite into
politics, because I've

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.880
met quite a few politicians.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880
Don't care who they are.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.380
Just care who's in
power, who makes

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.190
change, who affects the
lives that we live in.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.880
And the problem
with politicians is,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.490
I knew who they were
when I was at university.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.710
And basically they
were pretty boring.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.040
They were the debating society.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.460
I was getting lashed or
doing some engineering.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.550
There they were.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.360
They had it written all over
them when I was at university.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.330
They've not done work.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.090
They've been
perfecting their sort

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.170
of not answering the
question and doing

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.550
other funny political stuff.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.740
They're all professional
politicians.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.970
The intent is solid.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.240
I haven't met a politician
who doesn't care,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.680
but their knowledge, their
experience, their understanding

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.138
of the real world
that we are in is

00:18:10.138 --> 00:18:12.110
pretty much piddly and small.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.920
So therefore we have
to engage with them,

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.541
because they don't have a clue.

00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:19.040
We have to tell them what's
what in our own little industry,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.260
because if we don't tell
them, they won't know.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:28.170
And really, in my industry,
the problem is infrastructure.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.430
The thing works.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.800
We only have to look in
Copenhagen or Amsterdam

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.907
and those things
haven't happened.

00:18:34.907 --> 00:18:35.990
People talk about culture.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.700
Gosh, Amsterdam was no
different to London in 1972.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.020
It's been a political
change that has enabled

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.070
it to become a cycling city.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.750
So I always think you
shouldn't be afraid.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.270
You should get stuck in and
accept that they don't know.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.020
And as long as you
know they don't know,

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.603
and they know they don't know,
then you can make a difference.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.710
The other thing.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.685
I'm going to be slightly
contentious here.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.830
So at the moment
in the business,

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.560
things are tough
in our business.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.280
We just moved factory.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.880
Now, what happened was the
factory was this amazing thing.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.720
We just moved
factories, all amazing.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.940
We worked our socks off.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.799
We ran out of money
in moving factory

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:17.340
so we haven't got
anything left so we

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.030
can't make it funky and
nice, and it's pretty tough.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.480
And actually people
are pretty down,

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.030
but that's the reality
of where we are.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.360
People go up and get down.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.360
You can't make people
happy by telling them

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.285
they must be happy.

00:19:29.285 --> 00:19:31.160
You make people happy
because they are happy.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.940
They are interested,
engaged, and so you

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.280
have good times and bad times.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.571
And if there are bad times,
don't pretend it's not bad.

00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:39.620
It is bad, and you work
together and get it better.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.200
But actually things
are exciting,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.640
but it's tough at the moment.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.680
But that's of our own making.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.000
But, again, it's
quit the bullshit.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.251
There's so much fun to be had.

00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:52.125
This is an example of
us having a bit of fun,

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:53.470
and I'll touch on it afterwards.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:58.810
So can I ask in this room how
many of you are world athletes?

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.810
Have any of you competed in the
Brompton World Championships?

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:03.840
Yes.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.740
I knew you looked
like an athlete.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.177
That is a world athlete in
your presence, everybody.

00:20:08.177 --> 00:20:10.426
We'll just have to give him
a round of applause, yeah.

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:11.240
Well done.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.980
I am actually one too.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.770
So that is a laugh.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.680
It was started in 2004 with
our Spanish distributor,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.116
because he got hacked off with
our potential customers going,

00:20:24.116 --> 00:20:26.740
yeah but, I mean, it's
got funny little wheels.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.220
It's not going to go very fast.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.640
He's like, oh, god, here we go.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.780
So maybe I'll race it.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.140
So he started racing, had 60
people racing, then 140 people

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.790
racing.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.800
Then it got too big for
him, so we took it over.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.070
Now we have 16 heats
around the world.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.440
The male and female winners from
those heats around the world

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.800
are flown to London to race
in the World Championships.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.580
It is on the mall.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.900
There are 750 elite athletes.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.230
It is a Le Mans start.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.620
You're not allowed
to wear Lycra,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.150
and you have to wear
a jacket and tie.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.480
And it's a bloody good laugh.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.340
And you know what?

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:09.170
That entire global event
pretty much costs us nothing.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.295
No cost.

00:21:10.295 --> 00:21:11.470
It's just having fun.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.987
Our customers pay.

00:21:12.987 --> 00:21:14.070
No, we don't rip them off.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.850
We don't want to make any money.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.766
In fact, we make a small
loss, but very small.

00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:18.660
And we have a bloody good laugh.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.050
Our staff have a good laugh.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.000
Our customers have a good laugh.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.770
They nearly clog up
your flipping system,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:28.800
there's so much tweeting and
recording and thingamajigging,

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.800
and it's all going vvvvv.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.572
And that's fine
for me, because I

00:21:32.572 --> 00:21:35.030
don't spend too much money on
it, and it's bloody good fun.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.830
It's good fun for our
customers, it raises awareness,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.000
it makes you just laugh.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.670
And there's not
enough time for that.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.170
And you can pretend
you're laughing,

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.390
but you're not laughing,
and so it's got to be real.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.890
And I think if it just feels
not real, I mean it's so corny

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.120
but it isn't, and I
think that's the question

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.500
you need to ask yourself
when you're doing stuff.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.420
Is it corny?

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.690
Is it a little bit pretendy?

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.560
Is it made up, then it
probably is, in which case

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.680
I'd give it a wide berth.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.570
So what are we looking at in
this little world of ours?

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.380
And I know this is what
people in California in Google

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.230
are spending millions and
millions of pounds on,

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.790
we're spending thousands
and thousands of pounds on.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.630
But basically it's interesting.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.205
We're becoming urbanites.

00:22:22.205 --> 00:22:23.080
We're becoming urban.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.460
There's net migration to
cities all over the world,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.293
and it's happening in
the East, in the West,

00:22:27.293 --> 00:22:28.980
and wherever you
like to look at it.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.060
Then you think, OK, so
we're moving into cities.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.850
So what's happening in cities?

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.290
We're all basically
not that happy.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.860
So in cities, we
stuff in these things

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.060
called buses and these things
called taxis, so we belch out

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.290
the worst air pollution.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.180
So we stuff everybody
in the place

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.060
where the air is the crappiest.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.410
So we're all sucking
that up for starters.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.130
So that makes us
not that healthy.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.740
Then what we do is, if you're
not wandering along Oxford

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.826
Street, munching your way
through the exhaust fumes,

00:22:57.826 --> 00:23:00.200
you're normally getting out
of bed half asleep and slight

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.859
[MUMBLE], you pot along,
and you get your coffee.

00:23:03.859 --> 00:23:06.150
You're still half asleep,
then you potter out the door,

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.460
and then you poot along.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.920
And then you go to a
thing called a Tube.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.640
This is something you
actually pay for, amazingly.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.662
Then you cram into this thing,
you bounce across other people.

00:23:15.662 --> 00:23:17.370
You don't actually do
it, but sort of say

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.000
fuck off because they're
half asleep as well,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.499
and they're bouncing along, and
they're feeling a bit ropey.

00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:23.500
Then you go down this
hole in the ground,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.110
and you're bouncing along,
and all these other people

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.420
are all looking pretty grumpy.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.400
And then you sort of stand
in a queue all half asleep

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.760
and things whoosh past you, and
you shuffle along a bit closer.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.010
Another one whooshes past,
and then eventually someone

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:33.620
pushes you in.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.140
And if you're not six
foot four like me,

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.223
you're probably up somebody's
armpit or somebody's

00:23:37.223 --> 00:23:38.210
splattering on you.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.912
They're all looking
grumpy and no one's

00:23:39.912 --> 00:23:40.870
speaking to each other.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.640
Then you jingle along
down this funny tube

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.650
thing under the ground, then
you do the same thing up,

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.780
and then you sit in front
of a computer all day.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.250
And then you do that every day.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.500
Just that's what they do,
thousands and thousands

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.960
and thousands of them.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.470
There they are, in
and out every day.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.571
And they go mad.

00:23:57.571 --> 00:24:00.070
We have mental health problems
that are going stratospheric,

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.945
and it's not just
the UK, it's global.

00:24:01.945 --> 00:24:02.570
And guess what?

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.560
We have obesity problems.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.920
Obesity is up 60%.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.750
So diabetes is up 60%
in the last 10 years.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.030
It's cost the UK
economy about 9 billion.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:17.480
But then the average distance
in cities to work is four miles.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.170
So it's like, hold on.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.480
What are we missing here?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.300
We have a city with
cool architecture,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.014
with parks, with
canals, with a river,

00:24:25.014 --> 00:24:27.180
and we're all going down a
little hole in the ground

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.390
to squish through a tube.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.625
And most people are doing
about four to five Tube stops.

00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:35.000
In many cases,
you could walk it.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.940
Forget cycling.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.760
So something has to change.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.080
And it's not driven by some
toe-sandaled, you know,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.100
hardcore-- it's
just urban living

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.130
and what can society afford?

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.450
And we need to change
how we live in cities.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:56.170
And I'm not pretending a
bicycle is the solver of all

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.750
of our problems.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.250
But it is definitely part of it.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.780
And we know it's part of it,
because we look in cities where

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.170
cycling isn't at 4%,
which is where London is

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:10.290
as a city-- it's at 25%, 35%.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.200
All the measures
demonstrate the value.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.170
So the next 25 years are
going to be interesting.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:28.570
So we're trying to innovate
and, interestingly, innovation

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.210
is getting cheaper.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:35.440
When I was at uni,
Ford had a tier system.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.409
Unless you were some
massive conglomerate,

00:25:37.409 --> 00:25:38.700
you couldn't afford a computer.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.450
Took up the most of this room.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.150
The idea that anyone
had a 3D printer

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.730
when I started only 14 years
ago, which we had bits of ply,

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.930
and we filed them all down,
and then when we made tools.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.800
We had to basically make
it up, all done on 2D.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.946
Now we can design something
in 3D, print it out,

00:25:54.946 --> 00:25:56.820
and we can make it 2.5%
bigger because that's

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.050
the shrinkage of the metal, 2.5%
for the tool, which is made out

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.354
of aluminum, and 3.5% for
the white-hot malleable iron.

00:26:03.354 --> 00:26:04.770
So we do 2 and 1/2
times 3 and 1/2

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.750
and it's perfect
when it comes out.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.330
Just everything
is getting easier.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.140
Then you do FEA, so you don't
have to do so many prototypes.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.570
What that means is innovation
is being disrupted.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.200
If you weren't massive,
you couldn't compete,

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.250
and that's changing.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.270
Whether we're big
enough, I don't know,

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.170
but we're going to give it a go.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.990
We spent 10 years
on this project.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.170
It's a flipping joke.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:33.860
Trying to make an electric bike,
and we spent two years just

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.641
farting around and
just trying to learn.

00:26:36.641 --> 00:26:38.890
Then we decided we thought
we knew what we were doing,

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.640
and we went to a
company in Taiwan

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.665
who were a motor company.

00:26:42.665 --> 00:26:44.290
We tried to go with
some guys in Wales,

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:48.010
and they were just too greedy.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.870
Anyway, we went with
the guys in Taiwan,

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.265
and we spent nearly
four years there.

00:26:52.265 --> 00:26:54.390
We spent three years and
doing quite a lot of work,

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.431
and we made some progress,
but we hit a dead end.

00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:58.660
We had a technical problem
we just could not solve,

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.140
and it was to do with
the epicyclic gear train.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.250
And we just couldn't solve
it, and it was beyond them,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.320
and it was beyond us.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.900
And it was like bugger,
because with an electric bike,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.000
there are lots of
them as it happens.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.370
The market in 10 years has
gone from pretty much nothing

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.430
to 1.2 billion in Germany.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.140
So that's quite a big market.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.280
The market is expected
to be 24 billion globally

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.060
by 2025, E-bikes.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.930
So you can kiss goodbye
to a normal bicycle.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.366
So basically this is old tack
what I'm showing you here.

00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:28.270
But that's fine.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.590
I'll still sell it to you.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.790
But we ended up
hitting a brick wall.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.369
So then I thought, oh, crumbs.

00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:34.910
We've got it.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.618
We need somebody who's
a bit more techie,

00:27:36.618 --> 00:27:38.350
and we need somebody
who's closer.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.240
So I ran out one
of our customers,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.765
because that's what we
always rely on when we're

00:27:41.765 --> 00:27:42.931
in trouble is our customers.

00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:44.160
A chap called Patrick Head.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.910
He ran Williams for 25 years,
the F1 fast car people,

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.240
and I asked him for
advice to who to go to.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.780
And then he said,
well, we have been

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.500
putting these electric motors
in our cars for about six years.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.000
It's called a KERS system, a
kinetic energy recovery system.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.780
It's got a light efficient
dynamo that turns into a motor,

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.339
and all has a battery pack.

00:28:03.339 --> 00:28:05.630
And we've also developed
Williams Advanced Engineering,

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.290
which is like a
spin off vehicle.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.630
Maybe we could help you.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.910
I was thinking, you're
far too expensive.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.200
Anyway, it was jolly expensive.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.241
We got a bit of help from
the Technology Strategy

00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:15.250
Board, which is now
Innovate UK, and we

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.120
spent the last three years
developing an electric drive.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.240
And we're quite close to
having something pretty cool.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.110
And we cracked the
problem with the hub gear,

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.560
and it's a
combination of design.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.660
So we've got very clever
injection-molded design,

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.695
which enables us to get
four-tooth engagement rather

00:28:31.695 --> 00:28:32.210
than three.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.190
So we're putting the
load over a larger area.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.930
And we're using a material which
is a pretty weird material.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.390
The design of the gears comes
from one company in America,

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.050
for which we have an
exclusivity agreement,

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.520
and the material is
only made in the UK.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.811
We put the two together, and
we've solved that problem,

00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:47.854
and it came out of
the UAV industry,

00:28:47.854 --> 00:28:49.520
because that's where
they were using it.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.310
It's not being used in our
electric drive industry.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.940
So we're hoping
to have something.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.627
And, again, you start thinking
about materials science

00:28:57.627 --> 00:28:59.460
and what's happening
with materials science,

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.250
and it's going to interesting.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.710
And actually, I'm
rushing along and jumping

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:10.800
about, but if you think an
airplane, 1916 airplane.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.690
Got it?

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.820
It's made out of
cotton and wood.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:19.390
2016 airplane, just
unbelievable killing machine.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.900
Mach 2.5 and all
sorts of whiz gizmos.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.220
Massive change.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.530
So then you go 1916 bicycle,
two wheels, double A-frame.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.120
2016 bicycle, plenty of
bullshit, lots of marketing,

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.052
two wheels, double A-frame.

00:29:36.052 --> 00:29:38.060
Hard tail, soft tail,
fat tire, thin tire,

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.600
but basically it hasn't changed.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.619
I mean, it's gone nowhere.

00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:43.660
But that is about to
change, because now suddenly

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.670
we're putting technology
into a bicycle.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.910
That means the average
sale price in Germany

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.630
is 2,500 euros.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.190
That delivers more
revenue for the industry,

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.190
more opportunity to
develop material science.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.160
I think bikes are going
to change, particularly

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.118
if you think of them from
an urban perspective.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.530
Do you rent this building?

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.200
You do.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.720
You rent it.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.234
How many staff in the building?

00:30:10.234 --> 00:30:10.900
AUDIENCE: 1,000.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.535
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: 1,000.

00:30:11.535 --> 00:30:12.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.230
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS:
How many cycle?

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.215
200 with bike passes.

00:30:15.215 --> 00:30:15.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah, probably.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.290
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS:
That's better.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.120
That's better.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.800
You're back pedaling now.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.090
OK, good.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:27.390
So the problem is,
cyclists cycling in cities

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.490
is selling to cyclists.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.400
So they're selling
to people who cycle.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.280
And in the male brigade, that
involves wearing funny clothes

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.030
and shaving your legs
and, in some cases,

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.990
forgetting to get the
six-pack before you

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.740
put the funny clothes on, which
makes the whole thing less

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.258
delightful on the eye.

00:30:45.258 --> 00:30:49.430
But then if you look at
countries where people cycle,

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.950
they're not cyclists.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.640
They're just normal people.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.380
They just get on
a bike and pedal.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.780
They don't have
to do weird stuff.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:02.520
So we are trying to
make cycling normal.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.030
And lots of people,
nearly everybody,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.900
learned to ride a bike.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.900
And that sense of
freedom and simplicity

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.350
you get with riding a
bike is so delightful.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.320
It never leaves you.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.285
So we created basically
a bike dispenser.

00:31:15.285 --> 00:31:17.360
That's our Brompton Dock.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.870
We have 50 of those in
24 cities across the UK.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.997
Use a smartphone, you walk
up, you type in a code,

00:31:23.997 --> 00:31:25.830
the door pips open out,
out comes a Brompton

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.920
and off you go.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.127
Average hire is 4 and 1/2 days.

00:31:30.127 --> 00:31:31.210
So you don't take it back.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:31.790
You can take it anywhere.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.748
You can take it to France,
you can take it over

00:31:33.748 --> 00:31:34.620
to US for a week.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.620
It's 2 pounds 50 a day.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.800
And you can drop it
back whenever you like.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.600
That should be
outside your building,

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.634
and it should have
these inside it

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:44.300
so your staff can go
wherever they like.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.930
It's a no-flipping-brainer.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.384
And it means that somebody who
is a cyclist has a bicycle,

00:31:50.384 --> 00:31:51.550
and they're going somewhere.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.900
They'll just say, we'll
go take one of the bikes.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.930
Let's go.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:55.540
Hop on a bike.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.331
Whiz off, fold it up,
no trouble at all.

00:31:57.331 --> 00:31:58.956
Someone's at the
weekend again, they're

00:31:58.956 --> 00:32:00.660
going with their children
or they're going on holiday.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.090
Take two bikes, go with
your children and have fun.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.580
No-brainer.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.570
Cycling needs a catalyst
to get more people cycling.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.842
You can't just rely on people.

00:32:08.842 --> 00:32:11.175
You've got to give them a
really little barrier to entry

00:32:11.175 --> 00:32:12.231
and let them try it.

00:32:12.231 --> 00:32:14.480
Once you try it, you love
it, but you haven't tried it

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.195
for so long because it
suddenly became uncool,

00:32:16.195 --> 00:32:17.940
and you've got to drive
a car because then you've

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.481
got loads of money and you're
going to get the chicks and all

00:32:20.481 --> 00:32:21.140
that stuff.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.070
But actually, that's just nuts,
and the bike is super cool,

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.970
but you've just
forgotten about it.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:27.920
It's quite innovative.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.680
In businesses, so you've
got 1,000 people here.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.710
You've got other
people in other office.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.750
People talk about businesses
as being hundreds of thousands

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.260
of people.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.440
Businesses aren't hundreds
of thousands of people,

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.150
they're just groups of
maybe 80 to 100 people.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.885
They're like lots of
little businesses.

00:32:47.885 --> 00:32:49.510
You have a culture
within a department.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.884
You have a culture within
different part of the business.

00:32:51.884 --> 00:32:54.680
It's not a complete business.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.080
And at Brompton,
we've had-- well, I

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.970
used to work for ICI and
DuPont and these big companies,

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.470
and I was involved in
project management.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.850
So we did project
management, and we used

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.000
to sort of do these projects.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.770
And we had to have a
three-year payback.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.560
So guess what?

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.730
We wrote this great
business plan.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.289
We had to have a three-year
payback, a three-year payback,

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:20.330
two and 1/2 year payback.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.920
Then we had a little piece of
paper that had to go around,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.400
and everyone had to sign it.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.737
And that's basically ass
covering, that piece of paper.

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:27.570
And as long as enough
people have signed it,

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.010
everyone saw that somebody
else has signed it,

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.020
and then it's all fine, because
no one's taking responsibility,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.730
because they've all signed it.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.290
So it's fine.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.630
And it says less than
three-year payback.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:34.480
So that's all fine.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.250
It's all going to be great.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.610
But the problem is, if
you have enough experience

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.444
of these types of projects,
they never add up,

00:33:42.444 --> 00:33:43.860
because they're
based on something

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.390
called an assumption that's
deep in the guts of a project.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:52.530
And the assumption is basically
just a sort of educated guess,

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.850
and it spins out
certain effects.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.800
And, of course, I
loved my projects,

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.560
and I wasn't going to have
somebody else get the money

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.490
that I wanted for my project so
of course my assumptions were

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.240
maybe a little bit on
the optimistic side.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.620
That's the nature of the beast.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.980
So we have a part of
our business, which

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.739
is where we do far less
research and development,

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:16.230
far less endless
justification for investment,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:19.670
and we look at the downside.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:24.920
So in your business, rather
than always assuming the upside,

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.322
give yourself more
flexibility, less bureaucracy,

00:34:28.322 --> 00:34:30.530
and say to yourself at the
beginning of the year-- so

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.364
in our case, we don't
have it at the moment,

00:34:32.364 --> 00:34:34.654
because we're so full of
projects we've got to deliver,

00:34:34.654 --> 00:34:35.710
there is no fuck-it fund.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.580
But for a long time,
we did have it.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.620
And basically, we had a fund
that's basically fuck it.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.690
It's the fuck-it fund.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:49.719
Started at 5 grand, and
we had a 5-grand pot,

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:53.179
and we decided to just give
it a go, try something.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:55.590
And that justification
was not the upside.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.630
That justification
is the downside.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.530
So in a project, if
everything goes wrong,

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.630
what are you in for?

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:06.770
That is a much more exact
amount in terms of reputation,

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:07.950
in terms of cost.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.160
You can measure that.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.800
And if you can measure that and
you know you can afford that,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.230
then just do it.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.420
Don't go through endless
analysis and tons

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.380
of market research.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.800
It costs you a fortune.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.070
Give it a try and find out.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.120
Now, if you try it, and
it's a complete disaster,

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.480
you stick a sign up and say
do not go down this alley,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.604
because it does not work.

00:35:25.604 --> 00:35:27.020
So you've got
something out of it.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.360
If you try it, and you think,
hey, that was pretty cool.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.610
Maybe there's more to do here.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:35.090
Then you do more research,
and you justify your research,

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.660
and you understand and you
go after that business.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.160
The business, the
electric bike, the E-bike.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.290
Our first store.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.840
We're all sodded,
bugger it, you know.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.560
Who cares?

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.130
Just do it.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.680
But do it with a
controlled downside.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.542
And I think if you take
a certain amount of funds

00:35:56.542 --> 00:35:58.000
and write them off
at the beginning

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.660
of the year-- write
them off-- there is

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.040
no return on
investment required.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.269
They're written off, but
you can play with them,

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:05.060
and you give them to
different departments,

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.280
it will allow more innovation.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.040
Retail.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.430
Like I said earlier,
we've gone into retail,

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.180
not because we're
interested in retailers,

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.740
because our retailers don't
speak to our customers.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.170
They speak to blokey techie
weird people with shops

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.600
full of people with their
jeans halfway around their bum

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.970
and talking about the
2-speed-- 16-speed Shimano

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.590
dung-dung-dung.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:30.430
We don't want that.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.940
We just want a nice
color, get on it, works.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.190
Like it.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.850
And so we've created stores.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.010
We've now got 11 stores.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:40.190
We started with one store in
Kobe in the South of Japan.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:46.300
We've now got them in Amsterdam,
Shanghai, Beijing, Milan,

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.460
all over the shop, and growing.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.980
And it started by just doing it.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.630
We started with three
stores, just give it a go.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.930
Now we've got brand guidelines
and all the other stuff.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:57.762
That came later.

00:36:57.762 --> 00:36:58.470
I'm wittering on.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.969
I've been told I've
got two minutes.

00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:03.030
I've now got about 45 seconds.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:10.269
In summary, businesses,
we are growing.

00:37:10.269 --> 00:37:11.060
We're still little.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.150
We're 32 million.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.640
We've grown while
I've been there

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.920
from 24 staff to 240 staff.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.360
We've gone through various
transitions over that time.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.590
We've had to introduce
processes and procedures

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.780
because you can't rely
on speaking to people.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.010
But my job is to disrupt.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:34.560
My job is to agitate and
to not be too serious

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:41.950
and to not start worrying too
much about what might or might

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.270
not happen and to
continue to be different.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.020
And I've been there 14 years.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.260
In theory, I should be stale.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.750
I'm frustrated we
haven't even got

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.830
started with the
amount of stuff we

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:57.480
should be doing
with this business.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:02.700
And I think that-- and remain--
my ambition for the business,

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.760
and I hope similarly
for our staff is not

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.150
how much dosh I can have.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.900
When you meet an
80-year-old, they

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.980
don't give a stuff how
much dosh they've got,

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.390
and all that crap
they've accumulated

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.051
over their life,
most of it's rubbish.

00:38:14.051 --> 00:38:15.550
What they care about
is what they've

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.970
delivered to society, what their
legacy is, what effect they've

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.150
had on this little
planet of ours.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.290
And in this business,
in every business,

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.040
that is the opportunity.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.480
And if you can deliver
on that, then you've

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.250
delivered something worthwhile.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.250
Thank you.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:38.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:38.424 --> 00:38:39.090
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.900
First of all, I've bought
one of these about year ago

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.990
and I absolutely adore it.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.940
So thank you very much.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.490
Second thing is, you I believe
let your patents lapse.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.710
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: Yes.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:51.140
Well, we didn't let it
lapse, because a patent only

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:51.999
lasts 21 years.

00:38:51.999 --> 00:38:52.540
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.110
But you didn't renew the--
could you talk a little bit more

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.003
about that and the kind
of rationale behind it.

00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:56.919
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: IP.

00:38:56.919 --> 00:39:01.110
So in our world-- bike
world-- most people

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.252
just assemble bikes.

00:39:02.252 --> 00:39:04.210
Actually, most people
don't even assemble them,

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.480
but those that do make
them assemble them.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.460
Assembling is easy.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.160
The value in a bike-- anyway,
in my opinion-- is the frame.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.200
That's the clever bit.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.020
And the way we make
our frame is weird.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.450
It's anal.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.780
It has a tolerance of about
plus or minus 0.2 of a mil

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.740
versus a normal bike
plus or minus 2 mil.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.190
We use CMM machines.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.080
We braze it.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.970
We do weird stuff,
because it demands it,

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:27.136
because it's already a
compromise, because it folds.

00:39:27.136 --> 00:39:29.650
So everything else must
not be a compromise.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:33.300
There is far more IP in
the manufacturing process

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.710
than there is in the product.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.579
So we have a 200-grand
auto-braze machine.

00:39:36.579 --> 00:39:37.870
It's got thermographic cameras.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:38.960
It's PRC controlled.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.280
Its hydraulic system is
designed and made in house.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.410
We've got oodles of weird stuff.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.812
So if we got someone
else to make it,

00:39:46.812 --> 00:39:48.270
we'd have to teach
them how to make

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.050
the machines to make the bike.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.633
And we have to teach them how
to maintain the machines and all

00:39:52.633 --> 00:39:53.590
the proactive stuff.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.142
And therefore, that's fine.

00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:55.850
They could do it.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:56.850
Anyone can do it.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.891
It's not that difficult.
We'd have to teach them.

00:39:58.891 --> 00:40:00.320
It would take three
or four years.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.778
So if that happened and we went
to the most sensible place,

00:40:02.778 --> 00:40:05.012
which would be
Taichung in Taiwan,

00:40:05.012 --> 00:40:07.470
where most of the good-quality
bikes in the world are made,

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.450
someone could work
for us for five years,

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.085
understand our
process, then they

00:40:11.085 --> 00:40:13.210
could work for a competitor
and not even move house

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.751
or take their children
out of school.

00:40:14.751 --> 00:40:16.700
That just means that
your knowledge just

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.410
seeps out of the business
to the competition.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.900
We are the only bonkers
people making bikes in London.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.030
So therefore our
knowledge is quite safe

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.580
unless our staff decide they
want to emigrate to Asia.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.110
So actually being
manufactured in London

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.730
wasn't a conscious
decision, but it

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.610
has been an important
part in protecting

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:35.970
our intellectual property.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.230
People think bikes are simple.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:41.800
They are to a point because,
remember, someone rides this.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.390
You will ride your bike
for the next 15 years

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.600
every day, potentially.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.935
What happens if it breaks?

00:40:47.935 --> 00:40:49.390
You're next to a bus.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.200
That is not a funny outcome.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.510
So the implications of
getting the quality right

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:59.040
and having a product that's
robust is really important.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.780
And so you can make
something look like this but,

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.390
personally, I would be
wary about jumping on it.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.390
It might be fine for
the first six months,

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.556
but you're whizzing down a
hill and the thing snaps,

00:41:08.556 --> 00:41:10.672
it's an unfunny outcome.

00:41:10.672 --> 00:41:12.490
SPEAKER: Nick.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:15.420
I had my first Brompton
for about 10 years

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.610
and I've had my second
one for about another two.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.470
When I was replacing
it, I seriously

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.230
considered-- I
looked at the cost,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.910
and it was about 1,000 pounds.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.490
It lasted me about 10 years.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.840
You can get a cheap bike
for about 100 pounds.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.710
So I was looking at,
hmm, I could get myself

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.580
a new cheap bike every year.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.180
Does that sort of
economics worry you,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.760
and how can you deal with that?

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.880
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: So just
to put it into context,

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:45.830
the material cost, which is
a commodity, of this bike

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:50.048
is about three times the
cost of your 100-pound bike.

00:41:50.048 --> 00:41:51.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.270
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS:
Yeah, if you bought one.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.880
It is so shit, you
shouldn't get on it.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.390
If you were saying a
400 or 500-pound bike,

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.600
that's fair enough.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.520
But if it's a
100-pound bike, it's

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.900
a flipping death trap,
because the stuff that they've

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.810
made it with is rubbish.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:11.070
But there is absolutely
an argument to say,

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.640
and if we could make
something-- we're not greedy.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.490
We make about 40% gross margin.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.980
We make about 10% net profit.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.771
As it happens, our net
profit at the moment

00:42:19.771 --> 00:42:22.290
has gone south, because we're
investing in the future.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.470
But we're not all wandering
around in Ferraris.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.730
We're riding little bicycles.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:34.260
But I think it's-- the labor
cost in our bike is currently

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.070
about 25% is the labor cost, out
of the total cost of the bike--

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.060
direct cost.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.235
People would think it's
much more because you're

00:42:40.235 --> 00:42:41.190
in London, labor cost.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.490
We reckon we can get
that down to about 15%.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.420
Now, you may be able to get
that down from 15% to 4%

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.650
if you went to Taiwan or China.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.570
But then what's the value
proposition between it being

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.857
15 down to 4 and the
value of protecting it

00:42:55.857 --> 00:42:58.190
and the value of having our
profits to be able to invest

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.569
in more innovation?

00:42:59.569 --> 00:43:00.360
And there is value.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.401
We've got somebody from
the Royal College of Art,

00:43:02.401 --> 00:43:03.620
a student in for six months.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.370
He did mechanical
engineering at Imperial.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:06.744
Now he's at Royal
College of Art.

00:43:06.744 --> 00:43:07.570
Awesome.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:08.500
Coming up with ideas.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.291
See, there's real value
in being in London.

00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:16.510
So it is a risk but, ultimately,
if we are giving good value,

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:20.380
if we are obsessed with
giving good value, then that's

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:24.045
the proposition-- value--
not absolute cost on the day

00:43:24.045 --> 00:43:24.545
you buy it.

00:43:24.545 --> 00:43:25.045
It's value.

00:43:25.045 --> 00:43:27.530
And brand is a reflection,
in my opinion, of value,

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.820
but that takes time.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.200
And then maybe products will
come along and look great,

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.640
and they might
have their moment,

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.129
but the real test is
whether they're still there

00:43:37.129 --> 00:43:38.920
after five years and
whether they've really

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.282
delivered that value.

00:43:41.282 --> 00:43:43.240
AUDIENCE: Do you feel
you'll get enough support

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.067
from the government to
continue production in the UK?

00:43:46.067 --> 00:43:47.900
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: I
think any business that

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.280
replies on any government
for their well-being

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.280
needs to have their heads
inspected, because you

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.840
can't rely on the
government for anything.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.060
The fact is governments
come and go.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.360
Like we were saying earlier,
they mean their best.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.760
If there are little bits
that help us along our way,

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.404
I'll scoop them up,
and they've been great.

00:44:06.404 --> 00:44:08.320
What we got from the
Technology Strategy Board

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.790
was awesome, because
it-- my board were always

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.964
a bit worried.

00:44:13.964 --> 00:44:15.880
And the fact that somebody
from the government

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.921
had said it's a good idea
and given us 200 grand,

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:21.720
they're like, oh well, we can't
say no to that then, can we?

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.520
And R&amp;D tax credits, thank you
very much, we'll have those.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.900
They genuinely
make a difference.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.910
Patent box, that genuinely
makes a difference.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:31.120
But if you took everything
away, if the business can't

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.560
stand on its own two
feet in its own world,

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.497
then you are in trouble.

00:44:37.497 --> 00:44:39.580
Personally, I'd feel very
uncomfortable with that.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.620
So there's far more the
government could do.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.750
The most important thing
the government could do

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.090
is stop spending
tens of billions

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.400
of pounds on
digging more tunnels

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.920
and putting in infrastructure
before they spent

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.670
2 billion pounds making
cycle lanes across cities,

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.850
because that is so
much better value.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.240
And it would make our
cities a better place.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.610
But that's coming.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.440
It's just taking
rather a long time.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.085
AUDIENCE: So I've not
heard of the rental boxes.

00:45:04.085 --> 00:45:05.085
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: Yeah.

00:45:05.085 --> 00:45:06.960
AUDIENCE: I'm totally
going to try that now.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.490
But what is preventing
the larger rollout?

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.870
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: Cash.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.400
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.300
It costs you.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.520
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: Well,
it costs somebody else.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.224
So we sell the dock
and we sell the bikes.

00:45:23.224 --> 00:45:24.640
So we have to sell
it to somebody.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.790
We are not funding it, but
we sell it to somebody,

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.910
they put it in place, and
then they get bike hire,

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.230
and it costs them nothing.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.240
At the moment, the
Boris scheme is about 25

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.440
grand a bike to put on
the streets of London.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.670
And then it's costing
GLA 12 million a year.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.480
And the outer boroughs
that are funding it

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.870
are not getting any bike hire.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.620
And you couldn't put
that bike hire scheme

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.050
into greater London, because it
would make even bigger losses,

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:48.258
and it would cost more money.

00:45:48.258 --> 00:45:49.140
So it's not viable.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.140
It's fine for capital
wealthy cities,

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.790
but it's not viable for
Leeds, for Sheffield,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.100
for other cities.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.360
So we've created something
and also if you go back,

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.550
start to get quite
cool, but this scheme

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.850
has retrofitability
of electric bikes,

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:07.700
because everybody else is trying
to charge the electric bike

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.980
in the docking station.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.322
And all urban cycling
is going to go electric,

00:46:11.322 --> 00:46:13.030
but that's a big
mistake, because then it

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.634
makes the docking station--
you have to put more power in.

00:46:16.634 --> 00:46:17.550
This is solar powered.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:20.120
You just drop it on the street,
half an hour, it's live.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.536
Theirs, you have to dig up the
street, planning commission

00:46:22.536 --> 00:46:26.440
lawyers, ripoff, and with
electric bike it's even worse.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.725
But in ours, the electric
drive, the power pack

00:46:30.725 --> 00:46:31.870
is in your luggage.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.805
So if you're an electric user,
you would get sent luggage.

00:46:34.805 --> 00:46:36.180
And then all that
would happen is

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.250
a door would open
with the solar power,

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.320
and then you just
click your power on,

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.778
and you'd be in
control your power.

00:46:39.778 --> 00:46:41.510
So there's all
sorts of cool stuff.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:43.942
But I suppose we're
not VC backed,

00:46:43.942 --> 00:46:45.900
we're a privately owned
company, and we've only

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.650
got so much money.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.960
And probably we're
taking on too much.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.310
At the moment, it's costing
us about 30 grand a month,

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:53.870
that project.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:56.440
We've invested probably
[INAUDIBLE] about a million

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.920
quid in that project
so far funding it.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.480
And it's so awesome,
but it's flipping hard,

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.700
and also sticking out across
the country is quite difficult.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.280
Anyone else?

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.155
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:08.155 --> 00:47:09.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:12.040
I wonder what you think
of other companies that

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.390
are sort of disrupting
travel a little bit,

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.092
in particular Tesla--

00:47:16.092 --> 00:47:17.050
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: Yes.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.549
AUDIENCE: --the
electric car people.

00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:20.852
They seem similar, albeit
much newer than you.

00:47:20.852 --> 00:47:22.810
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: He's
getting a bit more help

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.330
from the government than I am.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:31.492
I just think it's
interesting times.

00:47:31.492 --> 00:47:33.450
The average age of the
people getting a driving

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:36.810
license in the US has
moved from 17.4 to 19.2

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:37.840
in the last 10 years.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.500
So people are not needing to
have that driving license.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.950
So things are shifting.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:49.740
The question is, can we remain
private and have enough revenue

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.290
to innovate at the speed
that we need to to retain

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.480
a viable competitive product?

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.889
And that's debatable.

00:47:56.889 --> 00:47:58.930
The next three or four
years will be interesting.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.100
The interesting thing
about the car industry

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:05.604
is they keep just trying
to make more cars.

00:48:05.604 --> 00:48:07.020
They don't sort
of realize they're

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.360
in the transport industry,
and they pretend they are.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.210
They talk about mobility.

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:12.060
They keep making cars,
and they're big boxes,

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.393
and they're quite heavy, and
they're not that efficient.

00:48:14.393 --> 00:48:17.360
This thing, our electric
bike weighs 11, 12 kilos,

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.710
and it carries me.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:22.010
A car that's electric
weighs 1,000 kilos.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.000
It's flipping nuts.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.750
It's inefficient.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.083
You're carrying all that weight.

00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:27.522
So it's going to be interesting.

00:48:27.522 --> 00:48:28.730
And I don't know the outcome.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:29.890
AUDIENCE: But I guess they're
interesting because they're

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.730
cars but not so much
like other ones.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:32.230
And your--

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.710
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS: The
interesting thing--

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:33.850
AUDIENCE: And yours are
bikes but they're not

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:34.870
so much like other one.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.536
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS:
The thing about Tesla

00:48:36.536 --> 00:48:40.490
is, the barrier to entry for
developing an electric engine

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.710
is far less than an
internal combustion engine.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:45.020
So, again, the point is,
the internal combustion

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.040
engine required
massive industry,

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.870
massive collaboration.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.000
Electric engines are
pretty easy to make.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.690
So that is going to open up
that industry quite a bit.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:57.670
But if you look at his accounts,
there's been-- basically,

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.500
the US government
has given up on GM

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.067
and just shifted their enormous
great subsidies into Tesla,

00:49:03.067 --> 00:49:03.650
but it's good.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.760
At least he's doing
some innovative stuff.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.551
I think it's great.

00:49:05.551 --> 00:49:10.560
And the one I really like
is his vacuum rail thing,

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.930
because that's flipping cool.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:15.317
If you can stick a train down a
vacuum, that would be awesome.

00:49:15.317 --> 00:49:17.650
AUDIENCE: And you could
probably carry a Brompton on it.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.540
WILL BUTLER-ADAMS:
Yeah, of course.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.248
And that's there.

00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:20.215
End-to-end end journey.

00:49:20.215 --> 00:49:21.705
SPEAKER: With that,
we'll leave it there.

00:49:21.705 --> 00:49:22.250
Please join me in a
massive round of applause

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.550
for Will Butler-Adams.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:25.100
[APPLAUSE]
