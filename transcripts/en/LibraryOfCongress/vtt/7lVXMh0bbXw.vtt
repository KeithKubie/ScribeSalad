00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.110
&gt;&gt; I'm Stacie Moats, I'm
the Education Specialist

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.170 position:73%
for the Library's Interpretive Programs Office,
which is the office that handles all aspects

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.290 position:58%
of exhibitions, and related programs.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.120 position:69%
So, the first thing when people come to the
library they almost always are first of all,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.740
astounded and their breath is taken
away by the Jefferson building,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.510 position:64%
which is an incredible historic building.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.130 position:67%
If you've never been here, you can actually
experience it virtually online as well,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.350 position:72%
but I strongly urge you to come and do the
real thing, because there's just nothing quite

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.550 position:63%
like being here onsite in D.C. When
you're in the Jefferson building though,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.200
after you've had a second
to hopefully take it all in,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.630 position:73%
and perhaps either do a self-guided tour, or
to, you know, go on one of our Docent-led tours

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.640
through the Visitors Service
Office, that's when we hope

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.710
that you also go through
some of the exhibitions.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.640 position:75%
And again, depending on your interest, depending
on your time, you can explore the galleries.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.910 position:59%
Museum Education, a lot of people
don't realize is a whole entire field,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.220 position:69%
so I actually first became interested as a
kid, and a lot of the research will show you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.560 position:73%
that you know, if you are in a family that ends
up going to museums, there's a strong change

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410
that you know, you're going
to go to museums as an adult.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.690 position:73%
And for me that kind of was the extreme in that
my family was extremely committed to going to,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.390 position:61%
it seemed at the time, every historical
site and museum on the East Coast.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.540
Which I had to admit I did not
always appreciate as a kid,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.870 position:61%
but certainly led to this lifelong love
of learning, and for informal learning.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.080 position:73%
I think probably what really drove me to
become a museum educator, and particularly here

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.500
at the library was because I just
love all different kinds of object.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.530 position:59%
And the library as you hopefully know,
has everything in its collections,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.690
it's not only books, but you
know, photographs, films, audio.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.300 position:72%
I mean, just everything you could possibly
imagine, and it's wonderful to be able to draw

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.590 position:66%
from these world-class collections, and
to help people to understand this history,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.620
not only the United States,
but really of the world.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.060 position:75%
And so, you really can't ask for a better place
to work, and to have that opportunity to people,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.830 position:56%
you know, help people connect to the
stories of real people of the past,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.280 position:70%
and then connect it to things going on today.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.070 position:66%
For me, it's probably most gratifying when
I am working with teachers or students,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.700
and you see that light bulb go off.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.200 position:73%
And you see them kind of get this understanding
of wow, like I am looking at the real thing,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.580 position:69%
this is not, you know, this not just a copy.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.780 position:75%
This is not -- you know in our world today where
everything seems to be, you know, born digital,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.140 position:73%
or something that's not authentic in many ways.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.490 position:58%
They are getting a chance to actually
see something that is one of a kind

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.810 position:64%
that witnessed history, and that's just
for a lot of students something that kind

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.560 position:58%
of blows them away, because they just
haven't really thought about that,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.590
that something has survived,
you know, from that past.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.780 position:63%
I am truly one of the luckiest people
on the planet, I just think that working

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.100 position:58%
in this institution, working with
the exhibitions, being able to engage

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.820 position:67%
with visitors of all ages, all backgrounds.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.200 position:69%
You know, people come from all over the
world to experience The Library of Congress,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.180 position:72%
people are so appreciative, and so interested,
and really amazed to see what we have here.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.240 position:66%
And then to go online, and to see the
online exhibitions, I'm also the, I guess,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.220
technically the Ask a Librarian
for our online exhibitions,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.870 position:61%
and that the inquiries come through me.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.580 position:63%
And so, again, it's great to see how
people use the online resources as well,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.250
but for me being in the gallery
is just -- I could spend all day.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.570 position:58%
And it's hard sometimes actually to
come back to my desk and do some more

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.270 position:56%
of the administrative end of things,
because I love just interacting

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.460 position:64%
with people of all ages in the galleries.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.970 position:64%
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation of The
Library of Congress, visit us at loc.gov.
