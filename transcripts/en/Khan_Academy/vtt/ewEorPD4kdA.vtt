00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.820
Let's do some problems with
the distributive property.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.750
And the distributive property
just essentially reminds us

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.620
that if we have, let's say, a
times b plus c, and then we

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.570
need to multiply a times this,
we have to multiply a times

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.870
both of these numbers.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.300
So this is going to be equal to
a times b plus a times c.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.500
It will not be just a
times b then plus c.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.690
And that makes complete sense.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.490
Let me give you an example.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.450
If I had said 5 times 3 plus
7, now, if you were to work

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.380
this out using order of
operations, you'd say, this is

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.252
5 times 10.

00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:42.840
So you'd say, this is 5 times
10, which is equal to 50.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.470
And we know that that's
the right answer.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.870
Now, use the distributive
property, that tells us that

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.590
this is going to be equal to 5
times 3, which is 15, plus 5

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
times 7, which is 35.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.370
And 15 plus 35 is
definitely 50.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.950
If you only multiplied the 5
times the 3, you'd have 15,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.370
and then plus the seven, you'd
get the wrong answer.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.320
You're multiplying 5 times
these things, you have to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.410
multiply 5 times both
of these things.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.610
Because you're multiplying
the sum of these guys.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.370
Anyway.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.260
Let's just apply that to a
sampling of these problems.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.040
Let's do A.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.050
So we have 1/2 times
x minus y minus 4.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.270
Well, we multiply 1/2
times both of these.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.480
So it's going to be 1/2
x minus 1/2 y minus

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.240
4, and we're done.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.540
Let's do C.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.330
We have 6 plus x
minus 5 plus 7.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.850
Well, here there's actually
no distributive

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.940
property to even do.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.800
We can actually just remove
the parentheses.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.010
6 plus this thing, that's the
same thing as 6 plus x plus

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.610
negative 5 plus 7.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.610
Or you could view this
as 6 plus-- So this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.360
right here is 2, right?

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.190
Negative 5 plus 7 is 2,
2 plus 6 is 8, so it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.730
becomes 8 plus x.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.450
All right.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.010
Not too bad.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.760
That was C.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.970
Let's do E.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:21.140
We have 4 times m plus 7 minus
6 times 4 minus m.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.360
Let's do the distributive
property.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.200
4 times m is 4m plus
4 times 7 is 28.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.330
And then we could
do it two ways.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.850
Let's do it this way first.
So we could have minus

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.580
6 times 4 is 24.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.030
6 times negative
m is minus 6m.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.930
And notice, I could have just
said, times negative 6, and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.550
have a plus here, but I'm
doing it in two steps.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.350
I'm doing the 6 first, and then
I'll do the negative 1.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.520
And so this is going to be
4m plus 28, and then you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.760
distribute the negative sign.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.600
You can view this as a negative
1 times all of this.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.630
So negative 1 times
24 is minus 24.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.620
Negative 1 times minus
6m is plus 6m.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.920
Now you add the m terms.
4m plus 6m is 10m.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.200
And then add the constant terms.
28 minus 24, that is

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.580
equal to plus 4.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.200
Let's go down here.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.610
Use the distributive property
to simplify

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.730
the following fractions.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.400
So I'll do every other
one again.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.520
So the first one is, a
is 8x plus 12 over 4.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.870
So the reason why they're
saying the distributive

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.150
property, you're essentially
saying, let's divide this

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.980
whole thing by 4.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.590
And to divide the whole thing by
4, you have to divide each

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.440
of the things by 4.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.790
You could even view this as,
this is the same thing as

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.440
multiplying 1/4 times
8x plus 12.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.620
These two things
are equivalent.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.680
Here you're dividing each
by 4, here you're

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.340
multiplying each by 4.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.060
If you did it this way, this is
the same thing as 8x over 4

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.810
plus 12 over 4.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.130
You're kind of doing a adding
fractions problem in reverse.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.680
And then this 8 divided
by 4 is going to be,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.360
this'll be 2x plus 3.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.600
That's one way to do it.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.580
Or you could do it this way.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.810
1/4 times 8x is 2x, plus
1/4 times 12 is 3.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.960
Either way, we got
the same answer.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.050
C.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.300
We have 11x plus 12 over 2.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.050
Just like here.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.895
We could say, this is the same
thing as 11-- We could write

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:40.480
it as 11 over 2x, if we like.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.950
Or 11x over 2, either way.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.620
Plus 12 over 2 plus 6.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.360
And let's just do one more.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.140
E.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.810
This looks interesting.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.570
We have a negative out in front,
and then we have a 6z

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.650
minus 2 over 3.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.140
So one way we can view this,
this is the same thing, this

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.190
is equal to, negative 1/3
times 6z minus 2.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.070
These two things
are equivalent.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.340
Right?

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.550
This is a negative 1/3.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.650
You could imagine a
1 right out here.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.830
Right?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.610
Negative 1/3 times 6z minus 2.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.210
And then you just do the
distributive property.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.280
Negative 1/3 times 6z is
going to be minus 2z.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.090
And then negative 1/3 times
negative 2, negatives cancel

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.530
out, you get plus 2/3.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.180
And you are done.
