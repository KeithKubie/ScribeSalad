00:00:07.456 --> 00:00:11.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: On March 24th you're going
to stand in front of your peers.

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:13.106
You're going to stand in
front of your parents.

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:15.366
You're going to stand in
front of a panel of engineers.

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:16.626
You will have data.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:17.936
You will have graphs.

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:20.066
And you're going to knock
the socks off people.

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:23.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Seattle teacher, Scott
McComb is outlining a project

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:27.616
to his ninth grade physics class that
will have them creating, building,

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:32.936
and testing various wing structures
that they will design in teams.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.566
McComb is part of a
growing group of educators

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.926
who believe project learning is
the most effective way to teach.

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:39.796
&gt;&gt;Man: Try right now.

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:40.996
So you know how to do it?

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:43.006
&gt;&gt;Linda: When you think
about project-based learning,

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:47.236
learning that results in
demonstrations of performance,

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:52.336
real tasks that have brought
challenges to students to solve,

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:56.996
you can see that it's in context
with the ways in which kids have

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.336
to be able to be functioning adults.

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:00.496
&gt;&gt;It's quite an improvement.

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:02.966
&gt;&gt;Remember our first wing
didn't even hold water?

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:07.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Project learning is a
hands-on student directed activity

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.876
in which students create something

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:13.766
that demonstrates what they have
learned whether it's a website,

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:14.776
a play.

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:16.266
&gt;&gt;Can you believe this arrogance?

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:18.166
They think they can stop us.

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.906
Nothing can stop us.

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:22.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or a wing
design portfolio.

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:25.046
&gt;&gt;Seymour: First thing you have to do
is to give up the idea of curriculum,

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:29.326
curriculum meaning you have
to learn this on a given day.

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:35.216
Replace it by a system where you
learn this where you need it.

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:38.616
&gt;&gt;So that means you're going
to put kids in a position

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:40.806
where they're going to use
the knowledge that they get.

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:44.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Projects involve in-depth
investigations of subject matter

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:48.266
which are often guided by
professional experts who enrich

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.156
and supplement the
teacher's knowledge.

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:53.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We do this in the real
world too and it's very cool.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:56.606
And that's- I'm hoping to
show you how cool it is.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.496
&gt;&gt;Hayley: I like doing
hands-on projects more just

00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:03.526
because I feel I learn better by
learning from my own experiences.

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:06.246
When we were doing the
wing project I learned

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:07.596
like our first wing was really bad

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.036
and then our third wing,
we did really well.

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:11.836
&gt;&gt;Oh I'm so proud of us!

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:13.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Current research shows

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:15.856
that project learning
can be more effective

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:19.616
than traditional instruction in
increasing academic achievement.

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:23.076
It is also effective in
helping students understand,

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:25.926
apply, and retain information.

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:30.146
Other benefits include building
skills like critical thinking,

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.616
communication, and collaboration.

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:36.856
Students who work on projects
show increased motivation

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.716
and engagement in their studies.

00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:42.926
&gt;&gt;Our task was to create a
high-efficiency, low-weight wing

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.846
that when tested it would, you know,

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:48.646
it would show the values
you'd want for a real wing.

00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:51.806
&gt;&gt;Mike: These kids the way
they present themselves,

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:53.976
they're articulate, they
know what they're about,

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.136
they know what they've learned.

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:59.036
They've obviously been able to work
together and in a situation like this

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.486
for ninth graders to
pull off something

00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:01.786
like that is absolutely remarkable.

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:04.006
&gt;&gt;Student: And here's
our data for our wings.

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.626
This would be the first round
would be one, two and three,

00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:09.176
then four and five and six.

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:12.096
