00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.590
I've got three rectangles
here, and I also

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.640
have their dimensions.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.915
I have their height
and their width.

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:10.540
And in fact, this one right here
has the same height and width,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.432
so this is actually a square.

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:14.640
So let's think about how
much space they each take up

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.294
on my screen.

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:17.460
And since we're doing
everything in terms of meters,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.330
since all of the
dimensions are in meters,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.892
I'm going to measure the area
in terms of square meters.

00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:24.350
So let's see how
many square meters

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.930
I can fit onto this
yellow rectangle

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.760
without going outside
of its boundary

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.680
and without overlapping.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.360
So I can fit 1 square meter.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.840
Remember, a square
meter is just a square

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.510
where its length is 1 meter
and its width is 1 meter.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:53.980
So that's 1 square meter, 2, 3,
4, or 5, and 6 square meters.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.210
So we see here that the
area is 6 square meters.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.820
Area is equal to
6 square meters.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.800
But something might
be jumping out at you.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.040
Did I really have to sit
and count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.450
You might have recognized
that I could view this

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.995
as really 2 groups of 3.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.380
And let me make that very clear.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.700
So, for example, I could
view this as one group of 3

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.480
and then another group of 3.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.140
Now, how did I get groups of 3?

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.680
Well, that's because
width here is 3 meters.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.630
So I could put 3 square
meters side by side.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.510
And how did I get the 2 groups?

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.227
Well, this has a
length of 2 meters.

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:48.060
So another way that I
could have essentially

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.380
counted these six things
is I could have said,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.470
look, I have a
length of 2 meters.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.755
So I'm going to
have 2 groups of 3.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.990
So I could multiply 2 times
3, 2 of my groups of 3,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.255
and I would have gotten 6.

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:11.090
And you might say, hey, wait.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.880
Is this just a coincidence
that if I took the length

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.700
and I multiplied
it by the width,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.130
that I get the same
thing as its area?

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.430
And no, it's not, because
when you took the length,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.220
you essentially said, well,
how many rows do I have?

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.710
And then you say when you
multiply it by the width,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.850
you're saying, well,
how many of these square

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.740
meters can I fit into a row?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.510
So this is really a
quick way of counting

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.550
how many of these
square meters you have.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.430
So you could say that 2
meters multiplied by 3 meters

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.310
is equal to 6 square meters.

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.600
Now, you might say, hey, I'm
not sure if that always applies.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.340
Let's see if it applies
to these other rectangles

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.910
right over here.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.020
So based on what
we just saw, let's

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.710
take the length, 4 meters,
and multiply by the width,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.440
and multiply by 2 meters.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.670
Now, 4 times 2 is 8.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.550
So this should give
us 8 square meters.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.600
Let's see if this is
actually the case.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:36.440
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--
and you see it's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.540
going in the right
direction-- 6, 7, and 8.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.520
So the area of this rectangle
is, indeed, 8 square meters.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.100
And you could view
this as 4 groups of 2.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.010
So you could literally
view this as 4 groups of 2.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.610
That's where the 4
times 2 comes from.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.640
So you could view it as
4 groups of 2 like this.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.240
Or you could view
it as 2 groups of 4,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.130
So 1 group of 4 right over here.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.100
So you could view this is 2
times 4, and then 2 groups 4.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.100
I want to draw it a
little bit cleaner.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.900
Now, you could
probably figure out

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.674
what the area of
this rectangle is.

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:17.090
It's actually a
square, because it

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.480
has the same length
and the same width.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.550
We multiply the length, 3
meters, times the width,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:36.330
so times 3 meters, to get 3
times 3 is 9-- 9 square meters.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.500
And let's verify it again just
to feel really good about this

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.010
multiplying the dimensions
of these rectangles.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:05:02.850
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.890
So it matches up.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.370
We figure out how many
square meters can we

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.694
cover this thing with,
without overlapping,

00:05:08.694 --> 00:05:10.110
without going over
the boundaries.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.250
We get the exact same thing
as if we multiplied 3 times

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.145
3, if we multiplied the length
times the width in meters.
