00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.670
In this video, we're going to
learn to divide polynomials,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.230
and sometimes this is called
algebraic long division.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.550
But you'll see what
I'm talking about

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.330
when we do a few examples.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.720
Let's say I just want to
divide 2x plus 4 and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.230
divide it by 2.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.680
We're not really changing
the value.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.790
We're just changing how we're
going to express the value.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.600
So we already know how
to simplify this.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.810
We've done this in the past. We
could divide the numerator

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.490
and the denominator by
2, and then this

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.100
would be equal to what?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.250
This would be equal to x plus
2-- let me write it this way--

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.490
it would be equal to, if
you divide this by 2,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.340
it becomes an x.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.650
You divide the 4 by
2, it becomes a 2.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.880
If you divide the 2
by 2, you get a 1.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.380
So this is equal to x plus
2, which is pretty

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.910
straightforward, I think.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.500
The other way is you could have
factored a 2 out of here,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.175
and then those would
have canceled out.

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:56.830
But I'll also show you how to
do it using algebraic long

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.100
division, which is a bit of
overkill for this problem.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130
But I just want to show you that
it's not fundamentally

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.640
anything new.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.300
It's just a different way of
doing things, but it's useful

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.180
for more complicated problems.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.610
So you could have also written
this as 2 goes into 2x plus 4

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070
how many times?

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.300
And you would perform this
the same way you would do

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.020
traditional long division.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.780
You'd say 2-- you always start
with the highest degree term.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840
2 goes into the highest
degree term.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.350
You would ignore the 4.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.050
2 goes into 2x how many times?

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.770
Well, it goes into 2x
x times and you put

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.962
the x in the x place.

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:34.070
x times 2 is 2x.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.673
And just like traditional long
division, you now subtract.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.490
So 2x plus 4 minus 2x is what?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.550
It's 4, right?

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.740
And then 2 goes into
4 how many times?

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.810
It goes into it two times,
a positive two times.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050
Put that in the constants
place.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.240
2 times 2 is 4.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.280
You subtract, remainder 0.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.530
So this might seem overkill
for what was probably a

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.140
problem that you already
knew how to do and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.410
do it in a few steps.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.240
We're now going to see
that this is a very

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.970
generalizable process.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.140
You can do this really for any
degree polynomial dividing

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.070
into any other degree
polynomial.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.850
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:29.980
So let's say we wanted to divide
x plus 1 into x squared

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.260
plus 3x plus 6.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.780
So what do we do here?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.050
So you look at the highest
degree term here, which is an

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.030
x, and you look at the highest
degree term here,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.550
which is an x squared.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.140
So you can ignore
everything else.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.530
And that really simplifies
the process.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.280
You say x goes into x squared
how many times?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.040
Well, x squared divided by x is
just x, right? x goes into

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.900
x squared x times.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.730
You put it in the x place.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270
This is the x place right
here or the x to

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.000
the first power place.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.350
So x times x plus 1 is what?

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.722
x times x is x squared.

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:15.810
x times 1 is x, so it's
x squared plus x.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.080
And just like we did over
here, we now subtract.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.220
And what do we get?

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.350
x squared plus 3x plus 6 minus
x squared-- let me be very

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.630
careful-- this is minus
x squared plus x.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.030
I want to make sure that
negative sign only-- it

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.030
applies to this whole thing.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.810
So x squared minus x squared,
those cancel out.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.020
3x, this is going
to be a minus x.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.020
Let me put that sign there.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.410
So this is minus x squared minus
x, just to be clear.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.250
We're subtracting
the whole thing.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.720
3x minus x is 2x.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.880
And then you bring down the 6,
or 6 minus 0 is nothing.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.030
So 2x plus 6.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.220
Now, you look at the highest
degree term, an x and a 2x.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.530
How many times does
x go into 2x?

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.290
It goes into it two times.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.660
2 times x is 2x.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.673
2 times 1 is 2.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.790
So we get 2 times x plus
1 is 2x plus 2.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.120
But we're going to want to
subtract this from this up

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.900
here, so we're going
to subtract it.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.240
Instead of writing 2x plus 2,
we could just write negative

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.330
2x minus 2 and then add them.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.850
These guys cancel out.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.780
6 minus 2 is 4.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.620
And how many times
does x go into 4?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.320
We could just say that's zero
times, or we could say that 4

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.570
is the remainder.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:55.680
So if we wanted to rewrite x
squared plus 3x plus 6 over x

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.160
plus 1-- notice, this is the
same thing as x squared plus

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.980
3x plus 6 divided by x plus 1,
this thing divided by this, we

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.640
can now say that this is
equal to x plus 2.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.130
it is equal to x plus 2 plus
the remainder divided by x

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.820
plus 1 plus 4 over x plus 1.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.530
This right here and this right
here are equivalent.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.690
And if you wanted to check that,
if you wanted to go from

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.130
this back to that, what you
could do is multiply this by x

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.120
plus 1 over x plus 1
and it add the two.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.780
So this is the same
thing as x plus 2.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.240
And I'm just going to multiply
that times x plus

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.770
1 over x plus 1.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.500
That's just multiplying
it by 1.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.440
And then to that, add
4 over x plus 1.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.870
I did that so I have the same
common denominator.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.820
And when you perform this
addition right here, when you

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.050
multiply these two binomials
and then add the 4 up here,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.690
you should you get x squared
plus 3x plus 6.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.540
Let's do another one of these.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.070
They're kind of fun.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:18.020
So let's say that we have-- we
want to simplify x squared

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:26.310
plus 5x plus 4 over x plus 4.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.930
So once again, we can do our
algebraic long division.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:43.410
We can divide x plus 4 into
x squared plus 5x plus 4.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.610
And once again, same
exact process.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.690
Look at the highest degree terms
in both of them. x goes

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.120
into x squared how many times?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.390
It goes into it x times.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.790
Put it in the x place.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.230
This is our x place
right here.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.820
X times x is x squared.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.440
x times 4 is 4x.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.060
And then, of course, we're
going to want to subtract

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.990
these from there.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.750
So let me just put a negative
sign there.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.240
And then these cancel out.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.540
5x minus 4x is x.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.800
4 minus 0 is plus 4.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.940
x plus 4, and then you could
even see this coming.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.190
You could say x plus 4 goes into
x plus 4 obviously one

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.770
time, or if you were not looking
at the constant terms,

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.770
you would completely just
say, well, x goes

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.300
into x how many times?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.770
Well, one time.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.580
Plus 1.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.140
1 times x is x.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.260
1 times 4 is 4.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.430
We're going to subtract them
from up here, so it cancels

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.540
out, so we have no remainder.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.410
So this right here simplifies
to-- this is

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.000
equal to x plus 1.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.600
And there's other ways you
could have done this.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.980
We could have tried to factor
this numerator.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.200
x squared plus 5x plus
4 over x plus 4.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.270
This is the same
thing as what?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.190
We could have factored this
numerator as x plus 4

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.910
times x plus 1.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.380
4 times 1 is 4.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.980
4 plus 1 is 5, all of
that over x plus 4.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.700
That cancels out and you're
left just with x plus 1.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.400
Either way would have worked,
but the algebraic long

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.630
division will always work, even
if you can't cancel out

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.920
factors like that, even if
you did have a remainder.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.870
In this situation, you didn't.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.830
So this was equal to x plus 1.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:37.159
Let's do another one of these
just to make sure that you

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.690
really-- because this is
actually a very, very useful

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.650
skill to have in your toolkit.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:49.030
So let's say we have
x squared-- let me

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.730
just change it up.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.850
Let's say we had 2x squared--
I could really make these

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.950
numbers up on the fly.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:01.280
2x squared minus 20x plus 12
divided by-- actually, let's

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.800
make it really interesting, just
to show you that it'll

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.510
always work.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.830
I want to go above quadratic.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:15.860
So let's say we have 3x to the
third minus 2x squared plus 7x

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:24.590
minus 4, and we want to divide
that by x squared plus 1.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.880
I just made this up.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.980
But we can just do the algebraic
long division to

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.470
figure out what this is going
to be or what this

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.280
simplified will be.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.250
x squared plus 1 divided into
this thing up here, 3x to the

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:46.140
third minus 2x squared
plus 7x minus 4.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.790
Once again, look at the
highest degree term.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.010
x squared goes into 3x to the
third how many times?

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.930
Well, it's going to go
into it 3x times.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.830
You multiply 3x times this,
you get 3x to the third.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.930
So it's going to go
into it 3x times.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.885
So you have to write the 3x over
here in the x terms. So

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:09.000
it's going to go into it 3x
times, just like that.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.380
Now let's multiply.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:17.130
3x times x squared is 3x
to the third, right?

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.820
3x times squared plus
3x times 1.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.350
So we have a 3x over here.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.380
I'm making sure to put
it in the x place.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.440
And we're going to want
to subtract them.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.090
And what do we have?

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.000
What do we have when
we do that?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.060
These cancel out.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.090
We have a minus 2x squared.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.890
And then 7x minus-- because I
just subtracted 0 from there--

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:45.830
7x minus 3x is plus 4x,
and we have a minus 4.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.140
Once again, look at the
highest degree term.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.450
x squared and a negative
2x squared.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.210
So x squared goes
into negative 2x

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.960
squared negative 2 times.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.450
Negative 2, put it in
the constants place.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.430
Negative 2 times x squared
is negative 2x squared.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.370
Negative 2 times 1
is negative 2.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.820
Now, we're going to want to
subtract these from there, so

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.100
let's multiply them
by negative 1, or

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.460
those become a positive.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.800
These two guys cancel out.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:24.520
4x minus 0 is-- let me switch
colors-- 4x minus 0 is 4x.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.470
Negative 4 minus negative 2 or
negative 4 plus 2 is equal to

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.340
negative 2.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.385
And then x squared, now it has
a higher degree than 4x, and

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:39.463
the highest degree here, so we
view this as the remainder.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.430
So this expression we could
rewrite it as being equal to

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:57.490
3x minus 2-- that's the 3x minus
2-- plus our remainder

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:03.425
4x minus 2, all of that
over x squared plus 1.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.150
Hopefully, you found that
as fun as I did.
