00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.680
(intro music)

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.020
Hello I'm The Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
There has been a war going on for years

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.160
It caused bloodshit anarchy chaos it's torn this world apart

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.100
When you meet someone for the first time

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.000
An immediate screaming is needed that can only be summed up in one question

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.640
And one question only

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.560
"Tangled (2010) or Frozen (2013)?"

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.960
Strange to think but there's a kind of rivalry

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.480
among movie fans about which one is better

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.200
Disney's version of Rapunzel or Disney's version of the snowqueen?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.040
It's similar to the rivalry you will see among Geeks,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.860
sports fans

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.400
and girl's doomed to disappointment

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.280
but I was kinda shock to discover the more

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.560
and more I talk to people

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.480
the more they seemed to really want to pick a side

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.520
If you say you like Frozen, there's always someone that says

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Oh! But Tangled is so much better

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040
If you say you like Tangled,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.380
there's always someone that say Oh! What's the point when you have Frozen?!

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.320
So why on earth is there such a debate?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.580
I mean nobody is comparing Lion King to Aladdin?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.580
or The Little Mermaid against Beauty and the Beast?

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.600
Well, maybe one of the reason is there does seemed to be a lot of similarities.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.620
Both films does seemed to be focus on CGI princesses

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.020
Who all ready look pretty similar.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.060
Whom optimisticall perky, having issues with the magical problem

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.580
, come across a chiseled man whom teaches them the ways of the outside world.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.220
stumbled across a comedy sidekick,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560
and goes back and forth on saving each other

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.180
while trying to resolve their problem

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.860
Why would there be an issue with these differences when they seemed so much alike?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.600
Well, like anything there's gonna be some elements that

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.060
that are done better than others

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.620
one that most peole can agree with is the story(Tangled)

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.680
Even people who loved Frozen acknowledge

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.640
the story is not the strongest part

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
ESPECIALLY the backstory.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.860
There's curses and trolls and wiping out memories,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.700
and parents making downright psychotic decisions.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.680
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.360
Tangled, like most people can agree has a very flowing narrative.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.640
It's a good update to the classic fairy tales that's easy to follow and easy to relate to.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.760
I would make the argument that the comic relief is a little better too.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.060
Not that either film rely on just one element for their comedy THANK GOD!

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.420
But there certainly are chracters created mostly to get a laugh.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.320
Where the one in Frozen is fine but kinda typical.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.020
The one in Tangled stands out much much more!!!(Maximus)

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.440
How many times have you seen a horse act like Tom Lee Jones from The Fugitive?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.320
It's such a bizzare idea

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.480
but their conviction to it completely sells us on it

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.160
resulting in a ton of laughs.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.500
But, Tangled has some weaknesses too,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.040
the villain for example seems to go back and forth between trying to be menancing

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.640
and trying to be a silly obstacle.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.860
While other Disney villains balance comical and threatening very well,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.520
this one seems to be half the energy at both,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.040
which makes a little harder to get invested in her.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.440
Not to say the villain in Frozen was perfect,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560
but it was meant to be a surprise

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.420
which help further the message of the film.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.220
And when the reveal is shown, he was surprisingly kind of intimidating.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.780
Also, the music while good,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.240
is still not as hummable as Frozen's.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.420
Even with a similar sound, the music to Frozen is a monster!

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.300
Taking basic establishing songs we've heard variations of for years

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.420
and using it to once again tell the story and explain how a person feels.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.800
But on top of that, they're just more memorable.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.360
Hell, even TOO memorable!

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.440
There's sing-along that are still all over the place!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.160
And there's still kids everywhere that will not stop humming these songs.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.500
So yeah! Both seemed to have strengths, both seemed to have weaknesses.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.100
But why do so many people demand that they choose which one they like better?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.500
Perhaps a big part of it is

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.520
that they do such a good job at the parts that people like to compare.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.060
I mean okay, there's details we can contrast

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.680
like environment, timing, style and so forth.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.080
But the parts people usually like most in a movie are the characters and the ideas.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.880
As mentioned before, these characters and ideas are so similar,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.340
it's almost impossible not to naturally 
 want to compare them

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.240
Anna has been sheltered most of her life just like Rapunzel,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.480
resulting in a naive but giddily cheerful protaganist.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.080
Flynn and Christoff had spent most of their lives in the wild,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.420
growing cynical but still a charmingly upbeat personality.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.360
And both of them make fun of the popular  Disney tropes that have been popular for years

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.780
while also continuing others to still make it profitable.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.380
For example, Flynn asks why the heck everybody suddenly burst into song.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.320
I don't know if a Disney character has ever done that before.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.940
Rapunzel is also physically more active than most disney princesses.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.940
And I know a lot of you may think of Mulan

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.940
seeing how she was not a princess, Oh Yeah!

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.980
Don't believe your lies! k

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.300
Next issue, Frozen is  even more obvious with their dig at the  Disney tropes.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.380
Hammering in that you can't just marry a guy you just met.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.280
Now, I think most people grow up figuring this out for their own

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.080
but Disney still gets a lot of blame for instilling this mindset.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.440
Even though, I have to meet a person who actually has this mindset.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.340
I said person, that's a nuisance(Hyper Fan Girl).

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.200
But it's still a Disney product and they obviously are not going to abandon all their cash cows.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.640
So the people are still gorgeous with the traditional big eyed look.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.460
There's still elegant outfits and hairstyles we can parade into toys to sell.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.000
And there's still the message of following your dreams and things will turn out how you want.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.360
We can mock these all we want but there's no debating that this is what most kids like to see and thus,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.140
most adults and their child want to see.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.500
So it has the adult interest for something new, and the childhood with something familiar and nostalgic.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.400
However, poularity wise, there's no contest,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.460
Frozen is still everywhere!

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.600
Tangled, while a hit at the box office, is now where near the numbers that Frozen pulled in.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.060
Which leads to the last and more likely reason why there's a rivalry,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.260
when one gets more attention than the other.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.400
Everyone seems to be praising Frozen as a masterpiece.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.920
But when a film which looks and acts very similar comes out first,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.620
It doesn't seem very fair.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.920
If one film did these elements first and in some people's eyes, better,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.680
Why isn't this everywhere as much as the other one?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.640
Again, Tangled is definitely know, but no where near as big as Frozen.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.220
There's even been a backlash that's been forming around it

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.080
of people saying it's a downright terrible movie!

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.040
I've done that tutorial about this before about whether or not hype can kill a film

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.080
and in some ways, the popularity of Frozen has drawn many people away from it.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.520
calling it a bad movie.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.280
We've seen this happened with lots of films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.020
The Dark Knight,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.020
and most recently, Star Wars.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.920
These are all movies that peole would like fine if they saw them on their own

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.720
But when combined with everyone saying It's amazing! It's one of the greatest things ever,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.100
can easily arouse someone the wrong way.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.500
It's hard to say Frozen is a terrible movie with so many actual terrible movies out there

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.080
But it's not hard to see someone not liking  it.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.080
People like and dislike things for various reasons,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.080
but in situations like this, it's much more appealing to root for the underdog.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.800
The hipster argument, I like the original blank(___) before the new blank(___).

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.500
I saw what was perfect before society went and screwed it all up.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.020
Not that this argument can't be true sometimes, heck a lot of the times.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.140
But it seems to be one we like to fall back on a little too easily.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.080
there are lots of times where a predecessor is better,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.140
but people's acceptance or non-acceptance of it shouldn't make a difference,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.400
whether you like a newer film or an older film doesn't automatically place you in a certain category.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.020
The reason someone likes Tangled over Frozen could be entirely different from why you like Tangled over Frozen.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.620
It's fun to share likes and what you have in common, but

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.800
acting like that suddenly makes you one of them or one of us

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.220
is just plain silly.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.640
it's not what you like or what you don't like that makes you interesting,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.120
it's why you like or don't like those things

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.980
and there's no right or wrong answer.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.620
Comparing thoughs and opinions isn't done to judge or separate

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.140
at least, it shouldn't be.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.140
It's done to understand and connect.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.400
Both Frozen and Tangled can be good films.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.900
And if you like one better the other, AWESOME!

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.880
Sure why?!

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.480
Maybe we will find out something about you we never knew before.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.520
There will be similar arguments with similar franchises and there'll no doubt be a lot of fun to talk about.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.460
But just remember, it is for fun.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.320
We can learn a lot from it but don't ever take it too seriously.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.520
Because whether it will be comparing ourselves,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.980
or CGI princesses,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.920
chances are, there's a lot more in common than you would think.(peaceful music~)

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.440
And besides, Frozen is better.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:06.940
BOO!

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.300
I'm the Nostalgia Critic guy(aka that guy with the glasses)I'll remember it so you don't have to!

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.940
*double middle fingers*

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.940
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:24.660
(outro song)

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.460
Hey everybody, Doug Walker here!

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:29.960
(is that Nostalgia Critic?)

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.200
Doing the charity shoutout and this week, we are doing the Children's Miracle Network.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.700
This charity raises funds and awareness

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:45.100
for 170 hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the United States and Canada.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.880
Now the donations stay local the fund critical treatments and health care services as well as

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.420
pediatric medical equipment and charitable care since 1983 this organization has raised

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:01.740
4.7 Billion dollars. Most of it just coming from one dollar donations

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.520
It's various fundraising partners and program support the nonprofit's mission

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.440
to save and improve the lives of as many children as possible.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.380
One of those partners you might have heard of before Extra Life(extra-life.org)

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:19.260
uniting thousands of players around the world in a 24 hour gaming marathon to support this wonderful charity

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:25.660
since 2008 extra.org has raised over 14 million dollars for these hospitals.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.900
You can see they do a lot of work and if you go to their Youtube channel you can also see

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.880
all the wonderful stories that they share, they have good people, good partnerships,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.040
so definitely go check them out and make a huge difference in a child's life.
