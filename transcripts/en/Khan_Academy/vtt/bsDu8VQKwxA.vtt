00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.768
- So we're told Circle P is below,

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:04.834
this is Circle P right over here.

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:09.714
What is the arc measure
of arc BC in degrees?

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.527
So this is point B, this is point C,

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:16.290
let me pick a different
color so you can see the arc.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.915
And since they only gave us two letters,

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:19.889
we really wanna find the minor arc,

00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:22.490
so we want to find the
shorter arc between B and C.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.765
So the major arc would
be the long way around,

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:26.530
and if they wanted to
specify the major arc

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.201
they would've had to give us three letters

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.989
to force us to go the long way around,

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.286
so if they said arc BAC or BDC,

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:34.610
that would go the long way around,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.839
but since they just gave us just B and C

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.486
we assume it's going to be the minor arc,

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:42.713
so we wanna find that arc
measure right over there.

00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:44.409
Now, the arc measure is going to be

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.405
the exact same measure in degrees

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:49.865
as the measure of the
angle, the central angle,

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:51.768
that intercepts that
arc, so it's going to be

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:54.793
the same thing as the measure
of this central angle,

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:58.752
which is 4k + 159 degrees.

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:00.706
So if we can figure out what
K is, we're gonna know what

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:03.168
this central angle measure
is, and then that's going

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:05.744
to be the same thing as this arc measure.

00:01:05.744 --> 00:01:07.718
So how do we figure that out?

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:10.729
Well, what might jump out
at you is that this angle,

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.822
angle BPC that we care about,

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.792
is vertical to angle APD.

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:20.418
These are vertical angles,
and vertical angles

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:23.274
are going to have the same measure,

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:27.314
they are, they're going to be congruent.

00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:31.617
So let's set these two
measures equal to each other.

00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:36.399
So we know that 4k + 159

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:41.996
is going to be equal to 2k + 153,

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:45.137
so let's get all of our K
terms on the left-hand side,

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:48.504
and all of the non-K terms
on the right-hand side.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:51.314
So let's subtract 2k from both sides,

00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:54.053
so we can subtract 2k from both sides.

00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:56.143
And let's subtract, well
let me just do that first,

00:01:56.143 --> 00:01:57.825
I don't want to skip steps.

00:01:58.487 --> 00:02:01.174
And so I got rid of the
K's on the right-hand side

00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:03.832
so it's just gonna be left with the 153.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:07.269
And on the left-hand side, 4k - 2k is 2k,

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.427
and I still have + 159.

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:13.050
Now let's get rid of this
159 on the left-hand side

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.513
so let's subtract it.

00:02:14.513 --> 00:02:15.720
But if I do it on the left-hand side

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.764
I need to do it on the
right-hand side as well,

00:02:17.764 --> 00:02:20.527
so subtract 159 from both sides.

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:24.339
And I'm left with 2k

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:28.594
is equal to 153 - 159 is negative 6,

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:32.379
so K is equal to, just
divide both sides by 2,

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.688
K is going to be equal to negative 3.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.224
Now you might be tempted
to say oh, negative 3,

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.639
but we're not just trying to solve for K,

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.193
we're trying to figure
out this angle measure

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:44.074
which is going to be the
same as the arc measure

00:02:44.074 --> 00:02:45.133
that we care about.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:47.112
And that's just expressed in terms of K,

00:02:47.112 --> 00:02:51.972
so it's 4 times K + 159, so
that's going to be 4 times

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:55.987
- 3 + 159

00:02:55.987 --> 00:03:00.462
well what's that going
to be? 4 times -3 is -12.

00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:04.970
Plus 159 is going to be 147.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.097
So this angle right over here
has a measure of 147 degrees

00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:11.860
and you can calculate, that's
the same thing as over here.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.503
2 times -3 is -6, plus 153 is 147 degrees,

00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:21.503
these two are the same,
and so 147 degrees.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.290
This angle measures the same
as the measure of arc BC.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.096
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.208
Circle P is below.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:34.355
What is the arc measure of BC in degrees?

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:37.050
Now since once again they
only gave us two letters,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.465
we can assume it is the minor arc.

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:44.046
So we care about BC,

00:03:44.693 --> 00:03:47.731
we care about this right over here.

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:50.030
And so what is the measure of this arc

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.003
is going to be the same
thing as the measure

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:55.045
of the central angle
that intercepts that arc,

00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:58.249
and that measure is going to
be the sum of these two angles

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.941
so it's going to be 4y + 6

00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:07.984
+ 7y - 7.

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:13.816
4y + 7y, we can combine the
y terms, is going to be 11y.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.465
And then 6 - 7 is going to be negative 1.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:22.176
So it's going to be 11y - 1,
and how do we figure that out?

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:23.920
Or how do we figure out what Y is?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.918
We need to figure out what Y is

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:27.751
in order to figure out what 11y - 1 is.

00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:29.632
Well, we know, let me write this down.

00:04:29.632 --> 00:04:32.801
So the angle that we care about is

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:36.847
11y - 1, 11y - 1.

00:04:36.847 --> 00:04:40.444
We know that that angle,
plus this big angle

00:04:40.444 --> 00:04:44.719
that I'm going to show in blue,
that if we add them together

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.597
that it's going to be 360 degrees,

00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:49.221
'cause we would've gone all
the way around the circle.

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:54.123
So we know that 11y - 1 + 20y

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:58.836
- 11 is going to be equal to 360 degrees.

00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:02.246
And so now we can just solve for Y.

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:06.351
What is, let me get some
new colors involved,

00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:09.607
what is 11y + 20y?

00:05:09.607 --> 00:05:14.607
Well that's going to be
31y, and then if I have

00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:19.465
- 1 and -11

00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:21.674
that's going to be negative,

00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:25.528
let me do this in a different
color, so that's going to be,

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:31.134
- 1 and -11, that's -12,

00:05:31.134 --> 00:05:35.426
and that's going to be
equal to 360 degrees, 360.

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:39.457
So let's see, we can add 12 to
both sides to get rid of that

00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:44.034
- 12 right over there, and
that's going to leave us with 31y

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:49.034
31y is equal to 372

00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:54.098
and so if we divide both sides by 31,

00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:57.441
it looks like 12, yep,
it'll go exactly 12 times

00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.760
so Y is equal to 12, which is equal to 12.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.105
And remember, we weren't
trying to solve for Y,

00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:08.145
we were trying to solve for 11y - 1,

00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:12.806
so what is 11 times 12?
We know that Y is 12.

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:16.207
11 times 12 - 1, let's see.

00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:21.125
11 times 12 is 121.

00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:27.008
And then 121 - 1

00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:30.897
is going to be, oh sorry no,

00:06:30.897 --> 00:06:33.970
my multiplication tables are off,

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.906
it's been a long day.

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:40.906
11 times 12 is going to be 132,

00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:46.022
132 - 1 is going to be 131,

00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:48.364
and it's going to be in degrees.

00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:52.242
So 131 degrees, that's
the measure of this angle

00:06:52.242 --> 00:06:56.354
which is going to be the
measure of minor arc BC.
