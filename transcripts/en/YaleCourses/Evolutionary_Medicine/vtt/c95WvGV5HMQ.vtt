1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.140
When we compare humans to the other great apes,

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.660
we see that they have a rather unusual life history.

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.830
These unusual features include large fat,

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.050
relatively undeveloped infants,

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.320
early weaning and short inter birth intervals,
slow development,

6
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.880
and extended childhood,

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.390
usually one offspring occasionally too.
And menopause.

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.580
We also have a life which is considerably longer than those of chimpanzees or

9
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:38.090
Bonobos
to see this concretely.

10
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:40.700
Let's take a look at two mothers.
One of them is named Emma,

11
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.350
the other is named Fifi.

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.280
Emma had 10 children in 17 years.

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.530
Seven of them survived and her inter birth interval was 1.8 years.

14
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.930
Her Age at first birth was 31 years,
pretty advanced.

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.610
Her agent last birth was 48 years,
unusually late.

16
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.240
Her Age at death was 88 years.

17
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.790
Fifi had nine children in 31 years,

18
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.860
almost the same number,
but it took her much longer.
Seven of them survived,

19
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.760
as did Emma's.

20
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.080
Her Inter birth interval was 3.9 years,

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.480
more than twice that of Emma's.

22
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.070
Her Age at first birth was 13 years much earlier.

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.790
Her agent last birth was 44 years,

24
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.600
not that much different from Emma's actually and her age of death was 46 years,

25
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.220
considerably younger than Emma's.

26
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.070
Emma is Emma Darwin,

27
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.640
Charles Darwin's wife and Fifi is one of Jane Goodall's.

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.420
Chimpanzees had gone bay.

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.380
<v 0>If we expand that to look at the human life history in comparison with Bonobos,</v>

31
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.000
chimpanzees and gorillas,

32
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.600
the things that really stand out are highlighted here in a heavier type.

33
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.580
Humans are heavier when they are born by almost twice the amount of the nobos

34
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.020
and chimpanzees.
They are weaned earlier.

35
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.080
The female age at first breeding is considerably later.

36
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.520
The average maximum lifespan is two decades or more longer and the Inter birth

37
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:35.080
interval is relatively short,
not that much shorter than Bonobos,

38
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:37.960
but considerably shorter than chimpanzees or gorillas.

39
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.520
The fact that humans are giving birth to offspring that need more care,

40
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.130
nevertheless are being weened earlier implies that in humans,

41
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.580
childcare is a social endeavor.
One person alone,

42
00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:58.450
a mother alone could not rear this many children this fast.

43
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.500
Now let's start with the human life history,
uh,
at the beginning,

44
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.480
which is the egg.

45
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.270
This is an image of an egg in a follicle in the ovary.

46
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600
The first point to make is that at three months of development of the fetus,

47
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.920
her ovaries are developed with about 7 million oh sites.

48
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.180
These old sites are progressively eliminated and by birth she has about a

49
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.781
million of them left.

50
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:36.781
Having discarded about 6 million and by men are a few thousand are left evidence

51
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.530
suggests that the defective ost sites are being preferentially discarded.

52
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.370
We also know that about 60 to 70% of concepted I or a boarded in the first

53
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.010
following Menzies,
many of these are not even noticed.

54
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.680
It takes a fairly careful study to get that kind of figure

55
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.350
evidence from Hutterite.

56
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.850
Women who have recurrent spontaneous abortions should suggest that the human

57
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.851
female reproductive tract is discarding concept die that are immunologically

58
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:11.251
deficient either because the paternal MHC illegals are too similar to the

59
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:16.270
maternal ones for the immune response to function or to avoid inbreeding

60
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:17.104
depression.

61
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.700
So the appear to be discarding lower quality offspring.

62
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.470
About 70% of conceptions that started as twins and is singleton births.

63
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.770
This is something we've discovered since ultrasound became standard practice.

64
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.620
All of these lines of evidence suggest that the human female reproductive tract

65
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.540
has been designed by evolution to function as a quality control device,

66
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.710
a selection arena,

67
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.430
<v 1>the</v>

68
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.430
<v 0>as I go survives this implants and grows and is then born size at birth sets off</v>

69
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:02.090
a whole series of trade offs.

70
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.540
Human birth weights range from one to four and a half kilos in length.

71
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.060
Human infants are 40 to 57 centimeters at birth.

72
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.450
Human babies have larger brains and they are fatter than babies that are born to

73
00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:22.451
a similar size that chimpanzee or Bonobo relative to adult brain size.

74
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.320
Human babies should have even larger brains at birth,

75
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.370
but their growth is constrained by the diameter of the birth canal.

76
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.501
Therefore,

77
00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:38.480
human babies continue brain growth and differentiation for a relatively long

78
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:41.510
time after birth up until about seven years of age.

79
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.150
This is related to the evolution of childhood and is a stage in our life history

80
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.030
that is lacking in chimpanzees and Bonobos.

81
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.210
The average birth weight of humans is actually about half a kilogram less than

82
00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:58.310
the optimal weight infant survival.

83
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.260
This is either the result of current offspring conflict or have the constraints

84
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.330
of a narrow human birth canal.

85
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.550
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

86
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.430
<v 0>low and high birth weight adversely affects survival,</v>

87
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:12.770
health growth and mental development

88
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.960
and among other interesting natural history observations,

89
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.961
long thin baby girls reach men arc about six months earlier than normal short

90
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:27.530
chubby ones because they more than compensate with leader growth.

91
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.543
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.240
<v 0>human growth patterns are very interesting primarily because they differ between</v>

93
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:39.500
the sexes.
Human growth is target seeking and self stabilizing.

94
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.640
It is divided into five periods.
Infancy,

95
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.540
which is from birth up until about two years.
Childhood,

96
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.960
which is from two to about seven years.
When the brain finishes growing,

97
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.150
the juvenile period is from the beginning of puberty at about 10 years in girls

98
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.910
and 12 years in boys up until adolescence,

99
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.270
which continues through to full sexual maturity,

100
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:07.271
which is about 14 and girls and about 16 and boys and then adulthood and

101
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:09.320
adulthood.
Catch up.

102
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:14.000
Growth can continue in males up until more than 25 years of age.

103
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.360
Although most males stop growing as teenagers.

104
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.980
<v 0>The growth patterns are different in the two sexes.</v>

106
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.100
Childhood may be a feeding adaptation that allows shorter inter birth intervals

107
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:31.150
with family support.

108
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.800
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.190
<v 0>The human adolescent growth spurt is uniquely large.</v>

110
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.540
Chimpanzees and Bonobos do not have that kind of growth spurt.

111
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.120
Girls Look at adult and have men sees before they are fertile and they can in

112
00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:51.121
day engage in adult roles without becoming pregnant for a year or two after they

113
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:52.150
appear to be adult.

114
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:57.151
Women voice produce functional sperm before they complete growth and develop

115
00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:01.240
adult appearance,
so that is reversed between the two sexes.

116
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.070
Men are slightly larger than women,
possibly because of sexual selection

117
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.500
and women's store,
more of their fat in thighs,
buttocks and breasts.

118
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:16.120
Men are more muscular,
so there is sexual dimorphism in humans.

119
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:20.640
That's pretty standard
to emphasize.

120
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.110
The differences between the sexes.
Here are the growth velocity,

121
00:08:25.111 --> 00:08:30.111
so the rate of growth with age for girls in red and boys in blue,

122
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.010
you can see that girls hit their peak growth velocity at about 12 and boys,

123
00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:36.000
it's about 15

124
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.210
so they are differing considerably in the ages at which they achieve biological

125
00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:46.644
maturity.

126
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

127
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.790
<v 0>Human patterns of reproductive investment are interesting.</v>

128
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.690
The proximate factors that affect fee.

129
00:08:54.691 --> 00:08:58.560
Kennedy Inter birth interval include nutrition,
stress,

130
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.360
marriage patterns,
breastfeeding,
contraception,
venereal disease,

131
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.900
conscious decisions in the presence or absence of the father.

132
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.790
All of those will affect inter birth interval and Fico Foundation.

133
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.960
Ultimate factors affecting fecundity and inter birth interval does it.

134
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.690
The evolutionary selective forces include offspring,

135
00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:22.650
survival rates mediated by disease and nutrition,

136
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.670
the presence and absence of relatives and mates who help with child caring.

137
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.090
So this presence or absence of relatives and mates is something that developed

138
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.150
evolutionarily as part of human social life and it is probably on the order of

139
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.780
six or 7 million years old
mothers.

140
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:47.190
Fertility rates are trading off with intimate survival and that is shaping inter

141
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:50.370
birth interval,
short birth intervals,

142
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:53.880
endangered children who are at both ends because then there's going to be an

143
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:56.280
overlap of parental care between the infants.

144
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:02.030
Large families impose costs on two to four year old children and lactational.

145
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:05.460
Amen.
Maria regulates birth spacing to a certain degree.

146
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.360
As long as the woman keeps nursing,
she is less likely to ovulate.

147
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.420
One of the interesting patterns of reproductive investment in humans is
twinning.

148
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.830
Here are some identical girl twins and some identical boy twins.

149
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.970
4% of births are twins.

150
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.740
Twinning does pay in some environments but not in others.

151
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.390
It is more likely to increase fitness of both twins are girls

152
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.750
in food stress populations.

153
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.020
Twinning is maladaptive and it can be associated with infanticide,

154
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.160
which has been observed in hunter gatherer populations in both South America and

155
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:44.994
in Africa.

156
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.200
Ultrasound shows that about 70% of conceptions that start his twins and is

157
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:54.660
singleton births,
and that's another indication that twins are expensive.

158
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.570
It's almost as though up we made a mistake,

159
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.990
we need to get back to one rather than two and one of them is resort.

160
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.320
One Study of 20 done by your Luma and her colleagues showed that the Finnish

161
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:14.940
archipelago had a richer and more stable food supply than the finish mainland in

162
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:16.560
the 18th and 19th centuries.

163
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.320
They found that twins in the archipelago produced more than one adult,

164
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.860
but twins on the mainland only produced oh 0.7 adults.

165
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.730
Twinning was more common in the archipelago,

166
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.090
so the patterns seem to fit the survival probabilities.

167
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.550
Twin sisters were most successful.
Twin brothers were least successful.

168
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.780
Mothers of twins had higher mortality after age 65 because they were more

169
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:47.010
susceptible to tuberculosis.

170
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.830
So a study like this shows that there are trade offs between offspring number

171
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.990
and the sex of the offspring and the adaptiveness of having twins and also

172
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.090
between offspring number,
offspring survival and parental survival.

173
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.580
Now what about sex allocation,

174
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.870
which means the ratio of female to male offspring.

175
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.960
In terms of cultural effects,

176
00:12:17.961 --> 00:12:22.961
we know that bride price societies limit the number of sons because sons become

177
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:28.030
expensive when they marry Dalry society's limit the number of daughters because

178
00:12:28.131 --> 00:12:33.131
daughters become expensive when they marry where sons inherit the wealthy favor

179
00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:36.050
sons and the poor favor daughters.

180
00:12:36.051 --> 00:12:38.180
And that seems to be true in the United States,

181
00:12:38.181 --> 00:12:42.830
Hungary and in Germany that would conform to the triggers.

182
00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:44.150
Willard hypothesis,

183
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.170
which basically states that women could good condition,

184
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.830
should have more sons and women in poor conditions should have more daughters,

185
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.220
especially in any meeting system in which the sons need to be in good condition

186
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.240
in order to marry and have offspring.
But overall,

187
00:13:02.241 --> 00:13:04.550
if we look across all of the studies that have been done,

188
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.810
the support for the triggers,

189
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:08.540
Willard hypothesis in humans is really rather mixed.

190
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.010
It's about 50% of the cases supported and about 50% do not.

191
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:14.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.830
<v 0>Now,
what about lifespan in aging in humans</v>

193
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.830
that we live longer than chimpanzees and bonobos might be the result of lower

194
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:27.910
extrinsic mortality rates that are caused by our social organization in our

195
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:31.990
group defense against predators.
You can think of that as self domestication.

196
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.380
<v 0>That effect,
however,
is not large enough to explain our observed lifespan.</v>

198
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.700
In addition,
we may have to invoke intergenerational transfers.

199
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.030
That is parental care and cooperative childcare,

200
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.170
mother and father effects and grandmother and grandfather effects,

201
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.370
all of which increased fitness contributions of older individuals.

202
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.260
So selection will act to extend lifespan if older individuals are having a

203
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:04.000
greater beneficial impact on overall fitness.
Now,

204
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:08.200
men can reproduce later in life than women if they have several marriages and

205
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:11.170
sequence.
Women will stop with menopause,

206
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.290
but men can keep going if they can then marry a younger woman.

207
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.420
So selection to prolong male life may then indirectly prolonged female life

208
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:23.350
because many of the same genes and regulatory networks are involved in

209
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:24.610
maintaining both sexes.

210
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.340
That would not explain why women stop reproducing at menopause.

211
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.310
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

212
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.930
<v 0>so menopause is a bit of a puzzle.
After all in evolution,</v>

213
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.660
fitness is determined by reproductive success and here women are stopping to

214
00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:44.430
reproduce.
Why does that happen?

215
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.090
We know that chimpanzees do not have menopause.

216
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.130
Healthy females continue to have offspring right up until they die,

217
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.500
whereas in humans,
menopause is normal.

218
00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.970
There are at least five nonexclusive hypotheses for the evolution of menopause.

219
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.811
As you'll see,

220
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:07.250
we don't actually know which or what mixture is correct.

221
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.700
The first idea is that it's about mothers.

222
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.990
Mothers stopped reproducing because the risk of dying in childbirth rises with

223
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.140
age and the mother must survive long enough to rear a child.

224
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.490
There's no point in trying to reproduce if the risk is so high that you'll die

225
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:23.870
and then the child will also die.

226
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.240
The second idea is that it's about grandmother's grandmother's can better help

227
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:32.570
daughters.
We are grandchildren if they do not have children themselves.

228
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.710
Intergenerational transfers can increase fitness contributions of older

229
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:37.544
individuals.

230
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.410
So the grandmother hypothesis really takes us an assumption.

231
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.410
Something like the mother hypothesis is a starting point.

232
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.700
Third it's about reproductive conflict.

233
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.840
Mothers in law or more related to their own offspring.

234
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.250
All o 0.5 then to those of their daughters in law,

235
00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.240
they are related,

236
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.690
they're open to five whereas daughters in law are unrelated to the mother in

237
00:16:03.691 --> 00:16:08.691
Law's offspring 0.0 and they are more related to their own oh 0.5 that means

238
00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:14.960
daughters in law are under greater selection to quote when conflicts over

239
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:18.440
resources used for reproduction and that could select against continued

240
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:23.441
reproduction in older women in a fairly tightly knit society living in small

241
00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:24.614
groups.

242
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:31.700
The fourth idea is that it's about offspring quality.
Essentially menopause is,

243
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:36.590
they're seen as a byproduct of selection for an efficient filter to eliminate

244
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:37.850
defective oh sites.

245
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.480
It occurs when the supply of ost sites is exhausted by a treasure.

246
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.580
This works if enough improvement in offspring quality early in life more than

247
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:51.440
compensates for reproduction,
which is lost late in life.

248
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.580
That fits fairly well with the evolutionary theory of aging.

249
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.230
But we have no direct evidence on it.

250
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.060
And then finally menopause is thought to be about self domestication.

251
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:08.960
So the idea here is that our social behavior,
our agriculture,

252
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.060
our culture improved survival,

253
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:16.061
extended lifespan and extended post reproductive life but did so without

254
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:20.600
increasing the supply of o sites selection.

255
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:24.830
Then modified the behavior of post reproductive individuals to enhance their

256
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:27.230
fitness by having them help to raise grandchildren.

257
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:33.220
So this actually combines the Austrian quality hypothesis with the grandmother

258
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:37.910
hypothesis.
The evidence is mixed.

259
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.500
The mother hypothesis,

260
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:44.150
the idea that mortality in childbirth increases with age only works as a

261
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:48.890
standalone explanation if the increase in mortality is implausibly large.

262
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.420
There is some evidence for and some against the grandmother hypothesis is a

263
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:55.920
standalone explanation,

264
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:59.100
but it does seem to work in combination with some of these others.

265
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:00.760
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

266
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.480
<v 0>reproductive conflicts between mothers and law and daughters in law appear to be</v>

267
00:18:04.481 --> 00:18:07.180
real and they could contribute to the explanation,

268
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.690
but we have no quantitative measure of their effect.

269
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:12.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

270
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.620
<v 0>There is as yet no convincing evidence on the offspring quality hypothesis.</v>

271
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.460
It's logically plausible but empirically unconfirmed.

272
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.340
The self domestication hypothesis also plausible and it rests on evidence for

273
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:30.390
both the offspring quality and the grandmother hypotheses,
which it combines.

274
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:32.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

275
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.700
<v 0>These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and some studies find combinations</v>

276
00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:38.950
of effects that will explain menopause.

277
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.660
It's hard to measure the relevant effects in the cultural and physical

278
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:49.661
environments in which the trade evolved that happened in the past and all modern

279
00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:54.890
hunter gatherer societies that we can study are disturbed to a certain extent.

280
00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.080
They're not necessarily representative of the hunter gatherer societies that we

281
00:19:00.081 --> 00:19:04.430
ourselves came from in Africa,
Europe,
the Middle East and Asia.

282
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:06.280
<v 1>Okay,</v>

283
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.120
<v 0>so to summarize,</v>

284
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.460
the human life history has evolved to solve ecological problems are short,

285
00:19:12.461 --> 00:19:15.640
inter birth interval is made possible by social help.

286
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:17.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.170
<v 0>We are large and fat at birth with brains that will grow for seven more years.</v>

288
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.380
That brain growth requires a lot of fat.

289
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:27.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

290
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.730
<v 0>There are trade offs between the mother's Inter birth interval and offspring,</v>

291
00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:33.700
survival rates,
physical vigor and disease resistance

292
00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.120
in males and reproduction and survival for females that are in poor condition.

293
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

294
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.670
<v 0>Menopause probably evolved for a combination of reasons.</v>

295
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:51.680
We listed five that include at least mother,
grandmother,

296
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.180
reproductive conflict,
offspring quality and self domestication hypotheses.
