00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:21.480
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.040
MALE SPEAKER: Great design
happens within constraints.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.430
And those constraints
are good because it

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.410
helps narrow your focus.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.520
There's something about the
pressure and, in many cases,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.820
conflict that
creates good things.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.700
So in our context, the sprint
is a very focused intense period

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.990
where we have a team of
people coming together

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.620
from different
disciplines and focusing

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.560
on solving a specific
design problem.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.530
In this case, we're
doing a sprint

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.820
at a pretty massive size.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.420
MALE SPEAKER: Too often, there's
a process where one group works

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.970
on something and then they
hand it to the next group.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.870
And then that group
hands to the next group,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.640
and it gets-- something
gets lost in translation.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.440
So this is a mechanism where
we can all get together

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.840
on the same page, because
we're all in the same room,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.000
and you get much more tangible
results much more quickly.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Product
managers, engineering,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.460
designers-- it's really
a chance for us all

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.750
to work very closely
together, and to really

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.720
see product development
through the eyes of others

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.740
that are on the team.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: The
ability to kind of leapfrog

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.380
the traditional design
process is incredible.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.520
Here is a chunk of time.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.419
Here's a bunch of
experts, and we're

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:40.210
going to make sure that
you have everything

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.330
you need to just focus
and come together and be

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.094
super successful.

00:01:45.094 --> 00:01:47.510
MALE SPEAKER: I think a lot
of people's idea of creativity

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.580
is you have this
freedom, you know,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.280
leaning back in their chair
just imagining things,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.590
and it's not like that at all.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.920
MALE SPEAKER: Watching what
was going on yesterday--

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.130
was a lot of arguing.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.000
There was a lot of
dissatisfaction.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.250
And they had to figure
their way through that.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.520
And so today, they're actually
testing their prototypes

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.872
and getting validated or
changing tack a little bit.

00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:12.330
And that's kind of
the magic of it,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.117
when you see these transitions
that these teams go through.

00:02:16.117 --> 00:02:18.075
FEMALE SPEAKER: I like
it because then that way

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:21.200
you have kind of a go-to
person in that new store.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: A lot of
what comes out of Sprint Week

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.220
is this intangible
camaraderie that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.330
helps us work better together.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.950
But the second part
is the projects.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.790
A significant number of
projects come to life

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.279
as is or very close to what
comes out of Sprint Week.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.820
MALE SPEAKER: What
we're trying to do

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.530
here is create very high
quality deliverables

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.430
that turn into real products.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.393
MALE SPEAKER: An actual
artifact at the end

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:48.320
that you can then take
to engineering to build

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.797
or you can take to customers
to get more feedback on.

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.380
MALE SPEAKER: We hope that there
will be a lot of the projects

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.840
that people are working
on that will get picked up

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.000
in some form or another, but
there's really no losers.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.980
When you participate
in a Sprint,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.625
you either win or you learn.

00:03:08.782 --> 00:03:09.726
[CHEERING]

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:13.380
MALE SPEAKER: On your
marks, get set, go!

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.500
MALE SPEAKER: There's ideas
that get cross-pollinated.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.340
People are making connections.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.554
People are having the
chance to work with others

00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:24.304
that they don't normally
get to work with.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.900
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe they only
knew each other via email,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.900
but now they actually
really know one another.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.060
And they have insight
into the things

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.050
that they each
respectively work on.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: Every
piece together here

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.940
is bigger than the
actual sum of the parts.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.253
There's something bigger and
more special happening here.
