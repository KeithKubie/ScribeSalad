you get a new one I could make a
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890
you get a new one I could make a
prediction right here and now using my

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900

ends on the 30th of December and predict
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.090
ends on the 30th of December and predict
from that that because the calendar ends

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
from that that because the calendar ends
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.310
from that that because the calendar ends
there that is also where the world must
