Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. And I mean like I like Tyron was man, there's a, there's this thing too where you, you get to a point where you have to, you're the guy who has to provide, you're the guy who has to hold up and it's not, not necessarily people saying you have to do it or you, you feel that sense of responsibility, you know? And, and in, in my family I, I felt that I feel that sense of responsibility. Like there's one that your family when you were growing up. Yeah. And you know, like I like when I say I come from humble beginnings, your like being raised in Nigeria like, and it wasn't like the village village where we lived in huts. We had a house but it wasn't really, we didn't have plumbing, you know, we had to go to the well or get water. We electricity was rare.

Speaker 1:          00:45          That's a scarce thing, you know? And it's where we, even when we came here, when we immigrated here yet life got a lot better. How old were you when you came here? About eight years old and it was hard to adjust to the school system, you know, because kids were kids. Kids are mean. I haven't talked with the funny accent and kids would tell you, hey, why don't you say this to the teachers? Hey, hey bitch, call her. And I was always in the principal's office because I had no idea what that means and things like that. So the kids are cruel. I had dealt with all that. You know in English when you came here. Yeah, we spoke English but it pigeon English. So we knew that in all were colonized by the European. So the English is the word root of the words.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Root words aren't from the European. So we knew English, but it's just our take on it. Uh, and so how much different is pretty different? It's very different. Like if I was talking with another Nigerian, I was speaking patient English, you would pick out words, but it's a little different. But can you say something in pigeon English? Yeah. And like I said, nothing. I right now we just sit down here just talking to you. You're not, so she's down just to talk just a [inaudible] not be any tea. That's how I was. Cool. Yeah, it does. It if like me and Israel out of Tonya was talking like it, it'll be mad cool. Oh, right, right, right. Like we speak it to each other. So going from that to, you know, be in essentially raised and, and, and going through school. And, and one thing that, um, man, I haven't, I really haven't ever shared with anybody, you know, very, very few people know, is that my father has been incarcerated since 2009 and this is the first time really out, um, you know, ever talked about it like my dad was, um, it goes through a test to just adjust the system here, man.

Speaker 1:          02:35          It's so, so, so crooked and it's so backwards. Yes, of course. We're fortunate. Like, ah, there's so many things that we're thankful for living here in this country that, you know, you can sleep at night in your house and not worry about somebody breaking in, robbing and killing you, you know, for the most part. And to where and we're thankful for that. We're thankful for the opportunities. But my dad was a businessman and my dad built one of that, uh, uh, a very, very big business in Dallas. The owned like an ambulance company and you know, it comes to a certain point where people just don't want you to be your, you're an immigrant and you're succeeding in a certain business there where it's kind of like people don't care about it. People don't want you to be there. And you know, I was one of those situations who, where my dad hired the people that he thought were the right people to do what he didn't know the job to run his company.

Speaker 1:          03:32          While he can tend to a certain things like us, like his family day to day, different things I cared about to where they run the company into the ground and not because my dad was the owner of the company, they put it all on him even though the people that were doing, you know, the things that were really wrong and the company admitted to doing the wrong things. But what the court is saying is that, oh, because you own the company. So ignorance is, it's not an excuse. So because of that we're going to sentence you to 15 years. So he got sentenced when he didn't know crime. It see the thing is the business again, it, my dad owned the ambulance company. An ambulance company. Yes. So it was a transportation for emergency and non emergency. You know, and one thing that he hired, these are like the paramedics, the EMS to run the company because these people that, that know the business.

Speaker 1:          04:29          So he had people that he hired from that acquired, he acquired from a different company. But you know, one thing that I will say is my dad's ignorance is, is he didn't really do as research well enough on the guys that he hired. So you hire certain guys and now these guys are running the business and these guys are like, yeah, we're gonna make it. We're going to help you grow this business. Like any business, man, fuck yeah, I hired the right people. Yeah. Help me grow the business. So now they're helping. He's there doing that. If he thinks, okay, I trust these guys. They're taking care of the business and the the most disappointing heartbreak and thinking about the businesses. My Dad, they're not, they're not the one who does the billing, the billing for the business. They contract a difference as an outside company to do the billing.

Speaker 1:          05:13          So it's not them doing it. So they're doing the runs, they're sending the notes to them. This is the runs we did to you guys build the government or whoever else to pay us. My Dad's the owner. He has people that are doing all this. He's not, they're running the day to day. So eventually they go under investigation on, we're investigating like I think maybe like 15 patients or something like that. I don't know the exact number. I have 15 patients we're investigating for these runs or whatever that would build this building on them. And so they put it all in your investigation and they're like, okay. After a while they come back and they said, all right, we'll give you your stuff back. Like, we didn't really see anything, but we'll give you your stuff back after they shut it down for a little while.

Speaker 1:          06:00          So damn, now I gotta go back. So my dad's like, ah, fuck it. I'm getting out of the business. They already killed my business for me. So now I became one of the biggest company. But you shut down for so long, you've lost in what you've worked for. So now he's getting rid of and getting out of it. Then they come back later, few years later for the same thing that you've already said. You're good here to have your stuff back. They come back and said, no, we're, we're going to prosecute you for this. So now those guys, I, and I've, I've seen it. This is obviously how the feds work now, those guys that you caught, the EMS and these guys that were clearly did rose was wrong. You gave them a deal and say, hey, we caught you guys because those guys started their own company doing the same shit.

Speaker 1:          06:41          So they get caught. Now they're like, okay, we want that guy. So you guys basically gave him a deal to say, okay, that guy was in on it and my dad's life, and I guess they offered my dad a deal, a plea deal, which his lawyer didn't really tell him about because he had a court appointed, a lawyer, a lawyer. So he said, no, I didn't do shit wrong. Why would I take that deal? Which would have been, I think maybe like five years was the deal or something like that. What does I know? I didn't do shit wrong. Why would I take five years? So he goes to trial and broke. We've seen murderers, we've seen all these people that are defraud the government and like start more hedge fund guys. Billions of dollars get bill. They said no, they wouldn't even grant him bail. My Dad's a citizen, like turn over his passport and everything.

Speaker 1:          07:32          They said, Nope, I'm not going to give you a bail. We're going to hold. You want to freeze all your accounts. You can't really fight the case. So you're stuck there and now your family's left with nothing, with nothing, no money in the account, nothing. And so my dad is deal with that and they just threw the book at him and I'm like, you know, we'll give you 15 years. And this was 2009 and he's already been in for 10. He hasn't been in for 10. And one thing that really killed me was um, one thing, uh, it was a part, a part in a trial where, um, the lawyer would basically telling the judge like, this guy's an upstanding guy. No correct curd. You know, he has kids look at his kids and how well they're doing. His older son is in college. The second one is in college.

Speaker 1:          08:22          The youngest is about to being in college. These kids are all scholarships, student athletes, great student athletes. And the one thing that killed me was the prosecution was like, the reason that is is because he was defrauding the government from this money. That's why they're in college. And I was like, wait, my dad is not paying for us to be in college. We're all student athletes. We earned these, we worked hard earned scholarships as far as to being college. The defense didn't say that. They even fucking say like, you have a court appointed attorney. I think he did. Yeah, Bro. My Dad just got railroaded, man. And it was like, and it was so heartbreaking to where you're telling them, man that has raised his family, raised his kids to, to work hard, get to a place in life and you're telling him that the only reason it's there is because he cheated and it was just one of those things that added a chip on my shoulder at all, man.

Speaker 1:          09:24          It, there've been so many moments, that attitude put chips on my shoulder with everything that I like. I've been through so much that I just internalize and I compete with all this energy and so two for that. You, you telling my dad that? Yeah. Like you're going to sit down and I just, and, and obviously of course I researched more and more into that because I was so heartbroken after that. Like money, like you just going for what? For how much you're saying not even up to almost a million. They would, they, they just piled a lot of money on. They're like, oh, this, this and that for a little over other sane little over a million total, which is nowhere near that. You gave him 15 years when these guys had fun guys that, that you found guilty for manipulating these markets for billions.

Speaker 1:          10:12          You give him six months house arrest if that and you're saying you're going to give him 15 years. And I started researching, I'm like, a lot of these judges have stakes in these prisons and to what they do is they give a lot of time because they get paid per prisoner. That's, and we know that story about that guy and um, Pennsylvania who was, uh, who was a judge and he was doing that. He was sending kids to generally he was extending their sentences and giving them sentences for nothing. And it turned out he had been getting paid by the person to seek a lot of them down the river. Yeah, I heard a lot of them get kickbacks and different things from that. And so to put people there, as you become more and more famous, you can shed more and more light on this.

Speaker 1:          10:52          Yeah, man, it's your dad do for parole, man. I don't, I don't even know. I think soon listen to this podcast alone. You talking about this could very well bring someone forward that wants to help you with the appeal. Yup, man. And my mom, my dad actually wrote, cause when, don't know Obama administration, there was that whole clemency deal when they were doing. And my dad actually wrote a letter, actually have that later. I don't know where I put it, but he wrote a letter to him and it was when I read the letter, man, I, uh, I can help a cry about it because my, my dad, um, it's my dad cares about his family so much and when I go see my dad because my dad is so proud of me and I'm, and I'm so proud of him. I mean, he raised us so well and um, to go see him in there.

Speaker 1:          11:42          And I mean, it's not like he's sitting in the maximum security, but for someone to tell you that you can't go home to your family at night for [inaudible], you've got an ear, you've got to sleep. When we told you to sleep, we got it. You got to eat when we you to eat for 10 years. And when you know I didn't do anything wrong because I chose to say no, I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not going to take this sentence you give me. They say okay fine, you're going to sit in there for 15 years and there's nothing you can do about it. As a man. It broke my heart man. And then when I think about it some I just hold the name cause I, you know, I try not to cry about it, which I'm just like screw it. I've have different situations that happen in life.

Speaker 1:          12:19          I'm like, you know, but I, I ate that one up on the shoulder. I put that chip on his eye. You know what they're going to say that the reason I'm here that was scholarship is because my dad, they're saying my dad got money. A little bit of money. Are you serious? What about the freaking hard work that I did to get here? What about all the Times that I sat in a fricking hotbox my bathroom upstairs with a trash bag on because I knew that I needed to get a pound off the next day in order to be able to wrestle at this JV tournament. What about all that, you know, that didn't make any difference, you know, the reason, the only reason it was there is because of that. What about all the times my brother ran, worked hard to make national team when he was playing soccer or my little brother getting numerous scholarship for a division one football everywhere like that.

Speaker 1:          13:05          What? So all that put a chip on my shoulder, Joe, to where it was like, man, I got to succeed at all costs. I don't, I don't really care. And where, where did this happen? Where was this trial in Texas and Dallas, Texas. Not the best place to have the trial happen, but uh, uh, it happened in an Amana and put a sour taste in my mouth, but um, cause he file an appeal, um, and it follows them. Peel one time they didn't even look at it, man. It was like one of those things where it's like that judge, they put you there, you're there. That was his domain. They didn't even look at it like, hmm, who care? Cause I feel like you're using the system, you're UFC welterweight champion. But I think that they treated him like that because you're an immigrant in the system.

Speaker 1:          13:49          Get in there and that's, you know, and Joe led to wrap that, put that on. That's part of what this next fight symbolizes to me is the attitude that a lot of people have towards immigrants as people are forgetting that Americans or immigrants from that conversation, the last podcast. People are forgetting that. Yeah. And to where countries yet to where people have this attitude towards we're Americans. Go back to your country, you know, you know, go back. This is a free country. You are this and that. People like, I always heard that growing up, I always heard that and I always I, the more I research, I'm like, what? What are you talking about? First of all, this, this whole attitude when you walk into a nail shop, get your hand, feet, nails done. Who, the majority of the people that run those nail shops, Asians, I'm not saying all of them in the world, in the country, but the majority of them in Asians, but there's a lot of people that look down all of it.

Speaker 1:          14:45          Like, I'm not washing your feet. I'm not going to do your nails. Nolan's people, I take pride in that because that provides for them in, they do that, you know, but people, people condemn it. That's not a job people want to do. When you go to these hotels and certain things, who are the main people that are the maids that clean up the hotels? A lot of um, immigrants. We take pride in them because now we're in the country in a better place where we can provide for families. Those are jobs are a lot of people so called Americans, the whole Colby, Covington, whole persona art. Like I'm above that. I'm above that. That's the persona. But then at the same time, people now want to cry. All the here taking our jobs. Let's build a wall. Let's keep them out. They're taking our job.

Speaker 1:          15:30          No, they're providing, they're helping this country get to its height. The fact that you could come here and have someone do your nails, so will clean your house and wash your car. Someone do all this for you is part of what makes America so great. One of the greatest nations in the world and the fact that they, we want to build a wall. You want to keep these people out. You can't come here. You can't bring your culture, your stuff here. It just saddens me and it upsets me as part of what this fight, when it happens is fight represents for me because I feel like that's the attitude that this young man has. He's entitled to, I'm, I should be UFC champ. You're soy boy. You know you can't, you don't want dessert or you can't hang with me. Boy, that's his attitude. You can't do this boy, first of all, who's your boy?

Speaker 1:          16:11          I'm a grown ass man. Don't fucking talk to me like that. And that's the attitude that he has. I'm entitled to this. I mean, I should be the champion because I am this way. I'm American. I'm this. And Ah, Bro, we're all American here. And so this fight is greater than just, Oh, me beating up a guy that's talking a lot of shit. There's a, there's this fight means a lot to me. So when I get the chance to put my hands on that guy, let's just know this, the wrath of every immigrant that I've stepped foot in this country.
