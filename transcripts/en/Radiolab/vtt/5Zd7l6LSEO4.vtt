00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.480
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:06.890
S C e. Yup.

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.970
That lime doesn't cut it very much, I guess. Really powerful.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.360
It's basically straight rum. Yeah. This is a very,

5
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:23.361
a traditional Guadalupe Ian drink called that tea punch as in punch as in punch.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.950
Uh, ready. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

7
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:31.930
Today we're going to go off to an island. Yeah.

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.420
Small little corner of the globe,

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
which in its very surprising way is trying to figure out how to understand

10
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:43.260
itself. Buffet itself and protect itself against the winds of the wider world.

11
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.283
Yeah, exactly.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.620
Comes to us from our reporter Simon Adler. So, uh,

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.140
I went to Guadeloupe a couple, a couple of weeks back,

14
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.510
which is this French overseas department. Basically a territory from

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.630
Guadalupe. Guadalupe is a, this series of islands in the Caribbean,

16
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.070
bit east of Puerto Rico and 400 miles north of Venezuela. More or less.

17
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.230
Okay. So just landed the runway we landed on here was a,

18
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:18.231
it was just a bordered on both sides by these super lush green walls of,

19
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:20.520
of flora. I have no idea what they were.

20
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.690
And the story I want to tell actually starts on a watermelon farm.

21
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
It's okay if I park here, owned by this couple,

22
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.150
celly and Lois, thank you so much for being willing to do this.

23
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.670
They look to be in their late forties. Let's pull him.

24
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
How many celly had on a pair of glasses,

25
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.050
tee shirt and a cutoff blue jeans and just into the,

26
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.640
my wife and Lois. Nice to meet you. Very nice to me.

27
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.820
She was wearing one of those floppy hats and big rubber boots.

28
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.980
So you, you were born here in Guadalupe? Yeah.

29
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.870
It was only granted ops in what parts? It was born in print.

30
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.230
So after growing up in Guadalupe and graduating, Sally decided to, uh,

31
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.700
to get off the island for a bit. Went overseas for work and gay on eyes.

32
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:12.120
It was a executor's Ghana met Lois soul and fell in love.

33
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.020
It's true. Anyway, Zen, I came back to Guadalupe 20 years ago, uh,

34
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.070
to establish myself in the area. Did you buy this farm right here? I truly,

35
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:26.400
I didn't buy it. That I know was in the family for a long time. Okay.

36
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.670
So I decided just to give them a a hundred and then we ended up staying.

37
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:33.054
So, you know,

38
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.600
so it wasn't planned that you would be towed another time and eventually they

39
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.460
kinda fell in love with farming. We enjoyed. So it's a,

40
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.460
it's a new and different, a way of living. You know,

41
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.500
they've got like 60 acres of land.

42
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.530
These rolling hills bordered by the ocean filled with their crops.

43
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.380
Still mantles a sweet peppers. Bumpkins and watermelons,

44
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.620
watermelons. Our main [inaudible]. Yeah. So, uh,

45
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.900
Sally Louis took me out to their actual farm. So this is the, oops,

46
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.970
these are what we have to have it still in there. In this field.

47
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:11.110
I was surrounded by just hundreds and hundreds of these enormous watermelon or

48
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.340
these are huge, like, yes, they weigh about 20 to 25 pounds.

49
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.320
And this was actually why I was there because these watermelon in this field for

50
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.130
the past 15 years had been under attack. This one,

51
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.840
this one is another one that was punctured and this one is fresh.

52
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.920
Oh Man. Okay. This, they, they've been here recently? Yes. Likely last night.

53
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.540
Still red. It's still fresh.

54
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.270
And there's this golf ball sized hole board into the side of it.

55
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.840
It has a high amateur of maybe two inches,

56
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.960
and the watermelon itself had had just been emptied out.

57
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.630
It's incredible. It's like the deflated ball and you walk on it.

58
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:51.400
It's the same thing and the same thing and the same thing.

59
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.330
This field was just littered with hollow water. This,

60
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.410
this is the worst attack we've had in about three years because as I said,

61
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.150
they did it specially because you were coming.

62
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.700
I want you to ask this cause I think it's time. Who or what is doing all this?

63
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.430
Raccoons. Raccoons. Raccoon rack of course records.

64
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.640
Those masked bandits with the,

65
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:17.980
with those little tiny hands and the adorable.

66
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.020
Adorable at all. So not cute. No, no one. No.

67
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.560
But even if you think they're horrible, you have to give them that.

68
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.570
They are clever. Yeah, they were.

69
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.100
They were sneaking into Sali and Louis' field at night finding the biggest

70
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.360
rapist. Watermelon in the patch. Boring a tiny hole into it.

71
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:41.410
Scraping out the juicy innards. They just scoop it out and chowing down.

72
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.270
It's a fiesta. And for, and Lewis, this was a huge problem. UOP stuff. Anyway.

73
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.750
[inaudible] you're able to lose a a third of it.

74
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.870
A third of the watermelon crop would just be yes.

75
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.400
Meaning it could go up to a 20% of your venue. Yeah, sure.

76
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.380
Thousands of dollars. So we couldn't stand this loss is too much now.

77
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.120
We had to do something. We had to fight. So what do they do? What's that?

78
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:11.890
15 years ago, a sully and Lois declare war. Meaning what?

79
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.390
Well, to start with, we put any electric fence around our field, Zap them,

80
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.950
keep 'em away pretty quick in north to put the branch and walk on the branch and

81
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:24.010
get into your field anyway, they built a third of bridge.

82
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.300
You mean they would walk over the branches? Yeah.

83
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.400
So then they've got to try something new this time. They're like,

84
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.110
we have to be [inaudible] at night chasing them a blast music at them.

85
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:36.130
We'll run around.

86
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.390
We've lads who sad with Nordic with at one point [inaudible] even a stoop to

87
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:43.820
just throwing rocks at the raccoons. He picked up a rock and just,

88
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.850
I'm a good a belter, but you can stay in the field all night long.

89
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.490
So next thing they decided to try is, okay, let,

90
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.980
let's put some traps out in the field. Oh, we tried to trap some with Zillow,

91
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.030
smell these big metal third a trip wire cages.

92
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.860
But one day there was no trap.

93
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.400
We found a trapper in the woods and it was all bent up. They,

94
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.730
they run away with the truth. The trap. Yes.

95
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.680
The raccoons were actually destroying sometimes we just to TMC hoe shocks.

96
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.760
So for their final attempt, they decided, okay, you had to try the dogs,

97
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.380
guard dogs, put guard dogs in the field. But the next day when we came, it was,

98
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.860
it was, it was, it was a massacre.

99
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.280
The raccoons killed one of your dog. Exactly.

100
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.690
All of his intestines were outside. So it was a jewel to the debt. Oh,

101
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.410
well yeah. Really. So you know what kind of animal you're dealing with.

102
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.040
This confirms every feeling I have about racquets. They are not just clever.

103
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:47.420
They're fierce and inward. There's good and bad in every one of them.

104
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:50.070
These were obviously not very nice. Raccoons in the shower,

105
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.360
Lewis and Sally's position, I course I would shoot these records.

106
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.570
Is that what they did well or poison them something? Well,

107
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.750
yet I thought that if anybody would be on board with, uh,

108
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.780
with some sort of a eradication campaign,

109
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.970
it would be value in Lewis. Right? But when I floated this idea by them,

110
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.090
if I was you, I would want to kill those raccoons.

111
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.580
They just kind of looked at me funny

112
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.970
killing them. Uh, it's a little, uh, a little harsh,

113
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.110
but they're, they're attacking your livelihood. Yes. Yeah. They just,

114
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.630
it's hard to, I'm trying to understand how you,

115
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.920
I know it sounds strange because I myself putting myself in your position.

116
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:35.030
I would find it strange too. It's just maybe a sentimental,

117
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.220
a feeling, you know? Wait, W why, why mental feelings?

118
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:41.420
What does that mean? Well,

119
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.470
<v 1>here's the thing. The people of Guadalupe,</v>

120
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:48.370
they acknowledged that these raccoons are super destructive.

121
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.940
They know that they are attacking not only watermelon farms but but goat farms

122
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.210
and chicken farms that they're going and tipping over trash cans in downtown

123
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.940
[inaudible] but, but yet simultaneously the

124
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.980
<v 0>door them [inaudible] just very loved Salafi. Of course we love the raccoons.</v>

125
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.610
They put them on their postcard. We just think it's so cute.

126
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.220
It's driving down their main highways.

127
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:17.900
You see billboards where people's logos for their advertisement for their,

128
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:22.250
for their tire company is the raccoon. Like it's everywhere.

129
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.600
There is a statue of Iraq coat at the zoo with Ben Vinu zoo,

130
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.360
the grow newt. They're the number one exhibit here.

131
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:31.280
They are the first thing you see when you walk in,

132
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.380
we have menus in the trees there. Wow.

133
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.460
Couple up there like monkey and on the way out of the zoo,

134
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.450
all of you when you walk into the gift shop,

135
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:45.260
got a Coffee Cup with the raccoon on it. A snow globe with a record in it.

136
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.310
Key chains might have to get rid of those people love the record

137
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:56.180
people. People are raccoon crazy on this island. Why? Well it's,

138
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.180
<v 2>it's really complicated. It. It has to do with their history of the island.</v>

139
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:02.220
It has to do with who came to the island,

140
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:05.910
when and who gets to say what happens on the island. It has to do with with,

141
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.150
with power. Like who are you talking about? A raccoon here. That's still,

142
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.040
all of these problems and ideas are, are inside the raccoons tail. In fact,

143
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.210
in this, in his tail, the tail of the raccoon and the tail about the Raco. Yeah.

144
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.050
What [inaudible] as far as explain this a little better.

145
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.360
The trouble all started DVDs,

146
00:09:26.361 --> 00:09:30.000
any mean of song in 1911 with this guy, Garrett Miller,

147
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.310
he was a scientist working at the national museum in DC or museum Mu Muleeka

148
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.820
despite the way is blending chemo. She works for the wildlife.

149
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:45.170
Police spoke to my interpreter, Sally, Stan Yan, and she told us one day,

150
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:49.400
Miller was just hanging out in his office when a box showed up from quite a loop

151
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:54.320
and he opened it up and found how queen mill, very much dead raccoon. Yeah.

152
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.430
That's sort of misshapen, uh, skin and that can accompanying skull.

153
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.630
This is a Christopher Halligan curator of mammals at the National Museum of

154
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:03.530
natural history.

155
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.160
Part of the Smithsonian institution actually has the same job that Miller had

156
00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:08.680
back in 1911. Anyway, uh,

157
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.890
this raccoon that Miller had in front of him looked a lot like the North

158
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:13.723
American raccoon,

159
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.140
but it was small and different in quite subtle ways.

160
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:23.230
And so after some inspection, Miller baptized to go to the Pea,

161
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.860
raccoons at distinct species,

162
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.020
scientific name [inaudible] precise and minor [inaudible],

163
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.890
the Guadalupe and raccoon putting a name on it and recognizing it as a new

164
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:38.810
species implied a deep history of the presence of raccoons in Guadalupe,

165
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.710
hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years. And over these millennia,

166
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:45.890
these raccoons had evolved into their own distinct species,

167
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.640
found nowhere else on the planet. So is that when the Guadalupe,

168
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.270
Ian's began to love raccoons when they realized they had their own, you know,

169
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:58.010
one and only. Yeah, but, uh, well it took a while to catch on. I mean, um,

170
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.360
this discovery was,

171
00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:03.620
was initially only being talked about in these arcane academic scientific

172
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.710
journals. It's not like this discovery with on the,

173
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.160
with on the front page of the Guadalupe Aeon Times or anything. Uh, but then,

174
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.110
uh, in the 1980s, you know,

175
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.760
conservation really came into its own scientists started worrying about, uh,

176
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.380
about species disappearing from the planet and in particular they started

177
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:24.050
worrying about this raccoon, these raccoons, you know,

178
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.950
we're being recognized as potentially endangered thought being there only on

179
00:11:27.951 --> 00:11:31.070
these islands. There probably aren't that many of them. Like we've,

180
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.810
we've got to protect these things.

181
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.120
[inaudible] and so el that [inaudible] since Guadalupe is an overseas French

182
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:41.060
department, France decided to do just that.

183
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.640
February 17th, 1989 legislation, uh,

184
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.620
was created to protect the raccoon and shortly after the passage of this,

185
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.080
<v 3>do they do he look back no sooner do like with loop</v>

186
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.040
[inaudible] loop opened up its first

187
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 0>national park and uh, the raccoon became the mascot,</v>

188
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.580
the symbol of the national park.

189
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.970
<v 4>And then you met [inaudible] and as the mascot of this new national park</v>

190
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.020
[inaudible] it really became that symbol of protecting species [inaudible] loop.

191
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.000
It was celebrated apple predestined. People were like, okay, nice.

192
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.500
We love the raccoon in Morrison.

193
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.750
<v 0>Then just a symbol of the importance of protecting the natural environment of</v>

194
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.800
Guadalupe. Over time, the raccoon became in a way,

195
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.390
a symbol of Guadalupe itself. What was it? As you knew,

196
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.200
it's really that symbol for people that you can definitely see it as the old

197
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.490
evil in the u s

198
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.860
<v 2>aside from raccoons,</v>

199
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:44.090
you didn't really have hardly any other mammals that are native to these islands

200
00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:44.990
apart from bats.

201
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And so if the raccoon is the one furry critter running around that everyone can

202
00:12:50.301 --> 00:12:52.820
point to and say, this is something special. You know,

203
00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:56.030
this is not the same as a raccoon you'd find anywhere else. Um,

204
00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.560
that is an exciting thing is a powerful thing. And uh, a point of pride I think.

205
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.120
<v 4>Well, I mean we're not late in this time zone. Okay. Come in.</v>

206
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.580
Okay. Nah, Nah,

207
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.190
and very good to meet you. How are you,

208
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.080
who's happy lodge now launched valley shows. No age doesn't help things.

209
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.730
This is not Marie Joseph and you, you were born here in Guadalupe.

210
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.270
We, yes, yes indeed. She is an older woman.

211
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.690
Maybe in her seventies wearing this pink floral dress.

212
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.240
Her house was right on the highway with a field in the back and that she says is

213
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:37.510
a, is where the raccoons would hang up. Huh. Please. Young men,

214
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.920
there was a whole bunch of them just like chilling in the area because all this

215
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.450
behind the house was sugar cane.

216
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.950
They actually came and fed on the sugar cane. Did you say, oh please.

217
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.370
[inaudible] out there. I loved seeing them.

218
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.120
I mean there was always some time of pleasure and excitement like seeing those

219
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.170
raccoons out there.

220
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.550
So patella and at some point there was one that we really became acquainted with

221
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.600
at that point. She, uh,

222
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.560
scooched her chair over and picked up this black and white photo that was,

223
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.770
that was sitting on her dining room table and inspected it. When can,

224
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.530
can I see the photo that you have here is crushed, filled with water.

225
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:15.430
[inaudible]

226
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:20.430
basically what's on the picture is Sophie and I'm feeding her bread that I

227
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:21.970
didn't, two milk.

228
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:27.090
Sophie was a pet raccoon that na had back in the late eighties upper pluck home

229
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.400
saw. And she talked about Sofi as if she were her child. Maybe they'll make

230
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.920
[inaudible] you let the Nidos that you're making the gesture of like cradling a

231
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.800
baby. [inaudible] Sophie

232
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:45.520
[inaudible],

233
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.520
Sophie [inaudible] he would run around and like every time I called her name and

234
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:55.490
everything, like she would just like come running. Yeah. Of MTV one Sophie.

235
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.180
I was really close to him and like when other people came to visit,

236
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:02.840
they could see that had this rare wild animal with me.

237
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.430
<v 5>Uh,</v>

238
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.570
<v 0>and at one point she got,</v>

239
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.430
she got really quiet a to Sufi and grasped the photo very tightly.

240
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.940
<v 4>So you're holding it to your heart</v>

241
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:21.280
better football debut. When he died, I cried.

242
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:26.080
I cried. His name too is really, really painful time for me.

243
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.040
[inaudible] a lot. It's important sometimes to have something of your own.

244
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.483
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

245
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:42.210
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

246
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.210
<v 7>I almost got the sense that having this raccoon as its national animal was a way</v>

247
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.930
for Guadalupe to distinguish itself from France. What do you mean? Oh,

248
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:56.580
so Guadalupe has always been pushing against France,

249
00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.230
trying to declare some sort of a cultural or national independence.

250
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.280
In fact, just a couple of years before this, uh, this law was [inaudible]

251
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.330
<v 4>pass a group called the Guadalupe Liberation Army.</v>

252
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.170
<v 7>This group that was fighting for independence from France blew up a section of</v>

253
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.070
Guadalupe airport and the last studio in the government own TV station,

254
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.690
even a Chanel fashion perfume store in central Paris,

255
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.010
<v 4>[inaudible] tore out windows and doors and left him racks of high fashion</v>

256
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:26.150
clothing and shreds.

257
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.410
<v 7>And it felt to me like in some small way, uh,</v>

258
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.690
the raccoon had become a way for the Guadalupe eons

259
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.040
<v 0>to say to France, this is ours, not yours.</v>

260
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.580
And because of that,

261
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.200
it also became a point of tension between France and Guadalupe.

262
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.500
Yeah. What do you, what do you mean by that? Well, um,

263
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.090
the morning after I met up with na, I went to this police.

264
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.400
<v 8>Oh, good to see you to talk to these police officers.</v>

265
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.080
Do you mind saying your name for me? [inaudible] mono.

266
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.210
Antoni Antony [inaudible] is mixed

267
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.460
[inaudible] as well as a couple of others. All of them,

268
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:12.530
but one were white and French. Uh,

269
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.930
they were stationed here in Guadalupe and the,

270
00:17:14.931 --> 00:17:17.660
they took us up into this sort of war room, which was a,

271
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.370
the second story of this bungalow type building out in the middle of the jungle

272
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.330
oak hill. Uh, I'm looking a Subaru loop that has shown these things.

273
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.810
<v 0>Everybody was sitting around this makeshift board room table</v>

274
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.720
<v 8>and okay. Pretty quick.</v>

275
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.700
<v 7>Uh, after the meeting started, they, they booted up this power.</v>

276
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.100
<v 8>The point is they've got a PowerPoint up with a picture of a raccoon displayed</v>

277
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:42.700
up against the wall here. This image of a raccoon

278
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.880
<v 7>crouched down in this chicken wire cage. Wait, so what's going on?</v>

279
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.430
What is going on here? Well, their planning arrayed

280
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.060
<v 2>to liberate this raccoon. In fact,</v>

281
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:56.900
they had the location where it was being held, mapped out with,

282
00:17:56.901 --> 00:17:58.920
with entry points designated. Uh,

283
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.640
they even had the license plate number of the man believed to be holding the

284
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:04.980
raccoon. And why exactly are they doing this?

285
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.360
Well because as Anthony [inaudible], the,

286
00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:11.960
the leader of this whole operation explained to me in most of the space before

287
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:17.010
the law passed in France back in 1989 declaring the raccoon as a protected

288
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:20.700
species, it specifically outlawed killing raccoons,

289
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.320
transporting raccoons, and even [inaudible]

290
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.700
<v 9>having raccoons for pleasure. You can't raise a raccoon as your own pet.</v>

291
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.950
[inaudible] funny years, sometimes we're taking away a child of the family,

292
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:35.784
literally

293
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.170
[inaudible] but in France the law says they can't be held as pets [inaudible]

294
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.470
policy. And as a police officer in here, I'm speaking as a police officer,

295
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.330
I have to be here between 40 to law period. No questions asked.

296
00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.340
<v 8>And so once the briefing was over, they headed outside,</v>

297
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.990
strapped their pistols to their belts through the rest of the gear in the back

298
00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:06.010
of these SUVs and took off.

299
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.360
Everyone is rolling out. We're in three vehicles and 20 minutes later

300
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.920
we arrive at the top of this hill,

301
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.670
peering down into this lush dense jungle.

302
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.990
We're walking down this driveway into the forest.

303
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.160
We get halfway down the hill and, uh, w w w what are you?

304
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.650
Someone here? You did it up. Yeah. Apparently somebody who's in this clearing,

305
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.470
we spot this man. He doesn't see us.

306
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.620
There's a guy in a red shirt with a camouflage hat on.

307
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.190
He's got his hand behind his back. The cops tell us it's too dangerous.

308
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:51.200
You guys can't go any further. And so Sally and I ducked behind some trees

309
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.500
and then Simone and Anthony wearing a wireless microphone rushing to the

310
00:19:57.501 --> 00:20:01.620
clearing to confront him. [inaudible] set up [inaudible] okay.

311
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.280
Anthony's started grilling him a bit. I'm going to say

312
00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.410
[inaudible] me go ask him if he knew about the lot and they said he did.

313
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.710
[inaudible] call me and even though I was like 30 yards away,

314
00:20:15.711 --> 00:20:18.440
I could see that the guy just seemed confused.

315
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.840
[inaudible] pretty harmless. All good here.

316
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.650
He's cooperating right away. Closer please, please.

317
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.810
He told them where the raccoon was. Oh,

318
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.920
there he is in this chicken wire cage behind this giant tree. Cute little guy.

319
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.720
This rough looking raccoon. They pull out a toolbox, wire cutters.

320
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.750
Raccoon is grabbing the wire cutter like you thought it was playtime or

321
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.080
dinnertime. They cut open. The cage reached into it.

322
00:20:45.081 --> 00:20:50.081
These thick leather gloves that's on fire and then they granted by the neck and

323
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:56.120
threw it into this kind of dog carrier box thing and wait,

324
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.990
Mr to the mission is a success. [inaudible] create,

325
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.070
copy it with the 20th swimmingly as you know, you can get,

326
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.920
I gotta say this whole thing sounds a little, I don't know a little much for,

327
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.040
for this, for just releasing a pet. Yeah, no, agreed. But uh,

328
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.320
we're going to go put basically, okay.

329
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.190
Later that morning we went on this second rate. What are we expecting from,

330
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.670
from this scenario? And the seriousness clicked into place for me to,

331
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.140
I don't want to blame. I'll put this up here. It's really a different setting.

332
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.130
We walked into this courtyard surrounded by maybe 10 houses, uh,

333
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.810
many of them made of sheet metal.

334
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.980
And do we know where the raccoon is supposed to be? [inaudible]

335
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.630
it's right there under those trees.

336
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.890
He pointed at this pile of trash throwing this enormous white cage and their

337
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:44.290
inside was this golden looking raccoon. You had the

338
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.460
[inaudible] did. There's houses all around.

339
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:52.480
So we need to see who is really in charge of this raccoon.

340
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.410
But before the officers could do anything to free it room, I got the boys.

341
00:21:56.411 --> 00:22:00.560
You have a crowd start together [inaudible] no, no, no, no.

342
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:05.970
W o a woman has just arrived. [inaudible] and basically what's going on?

343
00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:09.480
Three or four people showed up, head started poking out of windows

344
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.510
[inaudible] and Sally overheard one of them saying that someone snitched and

345
00:22:15.511 --> 00:22:19.360
said that there was a raccoon in the area. He said someone snitched. Yes.

346
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.150
And I suddenly realized that be all of the officers were, were very on edge.

347
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.170
[inaudible] just going to leave. Why can't we just,

348
00:22:28.171 --> 00:22:30.450
just take the raccoon just for safety reasons.

349
00:22:30.451 --> 00:22:34.530
They don't want to stay here too long. And we got outta there.

350
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.210
<v 4>So d did t tell me what was going on in that second situation? Cause I,</v>

351
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.390
I have a lot of, it was over my head. I mean it's really understanding the,

352
00:22:43.391 --> 00:22:47.170
the context, the setting. I mean, this is not just a police,

353
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.230
I mean it's white police forces coming into an overwhelmingly black and poor

354
00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:57.700
neighborhood that has a lot of, you know, significance in this context.

355
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.430
A Millennium News. Yeah. Oh wait. In fact,

356
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.740
when I was talking to na about this the night before, no, no, no, no, no, no,

357
00:23:09.741 --> 00:23:14.510
no. She said that if police officers had ever come to try to take Sophie

358
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.430
[inaudible], I mean they would have had to take me in as well.

359
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.150
[inaudible] I would've taken my, my husband's gone and I would've, you know,

360
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.033
I would've shot

361
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.470
<v 8>when we come back from break, the tail thickens,</v>

362
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.483
we'll be right back.

363
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.520
This is Timothy calling from Stillwater,

364

369
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.250
This is radio lab and we're back with reporters. Simon Adler.

370
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.160
He's telling us the story of the Guadalupe Ian Raccoon,

371
00:24:17.161 --> 00:24:22.161
which as we just heard for the people of Guadalupe is both a point of pride and

372
00:24:22.501 --> 00:24:23.334
a point of tension.

373
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.860
<v 2>We are in the back rooms are beyond the public areas. Exactly.</v>

374
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.420
And to understand what happens next,

375
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.910
we're going up to the sixth floor of the museum.

376
00:24:32.911 --> 00:24:37.530
We have to go to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History here in the u s with

377
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.330
mammalogy [inaudible] Christopher Helga.

378
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.330
Where we are now is what's called the type collection,

379
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:47.370
the world's largest library essentially of dead mammals.

380
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.590
I have to say for such a grand place, it's,

381
00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:52.020
it's a little visually underwhelming.

382
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.560
Basically just a bunch of locked white cabinets. But that said, um,

383
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.400
the behind the scenes area where you know, the real treasures are stored.

384
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.540
Can we take a quick detour so I can explain what he means by that? [inaudible]

385
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.040
<v 8>sure. Okay.</v>

386
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.100
So scientists taxonomists their job is to name and differentiate species,

387
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:12.020
right? So how did they do that? Well, uh, let's,

388
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:15.070
let's talk about sharks because sharks are kind of cool animals, right?

389
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.660
Imagine there's the shark species, it's swimming around.

390
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.810
It's having a great time. And, uh, at some point,

391
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.950
half of the sharks in this shark population decide to leave to go somewhere

392
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:27.950
else. I don't know. They go to deeper waters or to a different ocean.

393
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.160
They get cut off from the, their previous shark family.

394
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.750
They don't see them for a long time and over thousands or maybe a million years,

395
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.540
they actually start evolving on their own as sort of a new, uh,

396
00:25:39.541 --> 00:25:43.490
a new type of shark has become different enough that they've become a new

397
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:46.280
species. That's what the scientists come in and try to figure out.

398
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.830
<v 2>Now, how do they make that termination? Well,</v>

399
00:25:49.831 --> 00:25:53.850
so basically it's a comparison game. They compare them to the old sharks.

400
00:25:53.851 --> 00:25:57.450
Do they look the same or their dorsal fins taller or shorter?

401
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.910
They'll look at how they, uh, how they behave in the water.

402
00:25:59.911 --> 00:26:02.880
How they move through the world is that different nowadays they'll even just do

403
00:26:02.881 --> 00:26:07.260
genetic work and if they decided it is in new species of shark

404
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.540
at that point, they do this sort of wacky thing that I had no idea about. Uh,

405
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.620
once they've decided that this, this shark is a new species,

406
00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.800
scientists will go and kill one of these sharks. They will stuff it,

407
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.300
put it in a box and then they will store it in a locked cabinet in a natural

408
00:26:25.301 --> 00:26:26.590
history museum somewhere.

409
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.090
Because ever after for hundreds of years,

410
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.780
that specimen becomes kind of a gold standard.

411
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.480
The definition of that species,

412
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.000
there's a different key for types than others. We just, uh,

413
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.360
every kind of moth or might or malice or mammal, you know,

414
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:51.510
every oak tree, every kind of zebra,

415
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:56.490
somewhere in the world there is a museum cabinet where locked down there is a

416
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.510
physical specimen of that organism. So it's like,

417
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.110
it literally is like the natural museum histories of the world or like the

418
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:09.000
library, the card catalog can't live life. Yeah. And the room that, uh,

419
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.720
that Helgen took me into in the sixth floor of the Smithsonian, I,

420
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.180
it was just cabinet after cabinet after cabinet after cabinet filled with these

421
00:27:18.181 --> 00:27:22.740
type specimens, including the Guadalupe Raccoon type specimen.

422
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.220
The very specimen Miller inspected back in 1911.

423
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.810
So here are where you go.

424
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.900
Halligan bent down and opened this one particular cabinet and pulling out a big

425
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.370
metal drawer. And inside here, this is it right here.

426
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.740
Here it is right in front of you.

427
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.030
This sort of ratty looking taxidermy drack whom is maybe not the most pretty

428
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.510
site. You know, the ears are a little bit broken and bitten off. Uh,

429
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.670
some of the stuffing was coming out of the belly,

430
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.160
but that's probably how it arrived. Nope. Helgen for saw this raccoon, uh,

431
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.930
back in 2001 of the first things he did was turned it over and looked at it and

432
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.020
it's small, maybe like an 18 inches long like that,

433
00:28:03.021 --> 00:28:04.800
that just like Miller had reported.

434
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:09.930
But then he popped open this little white box that had the skull in it and take

435
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:11.490
a look. What do you see here?

436
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.550
He pointed at these fine white lines crisscrossing the dome.

437
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.120
These are open sutures, which show that the skull is still growing.

438
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.790
In other words, it's not an adult,

439
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.520
which to Halligan was a big deal because ever since being a kid he was

440
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.090
suspicious of the Guadeloupe Ian Raccoon. It didn't, it didn't add up to me.

441
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.280
I just had a suspicion of, you know, these Caribbean raccoons didn't make sense.

442
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.600
He said, if you look at islands,

443
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.140
they usually don't have just one native mammal species walking around.

444
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.400
This made Guadeloupe an outlier. And so I'm going to put it on this tray.

445
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:49.110
The fact that this thing was a kid, it meant that there was nothing special,

446
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.290
at least about its size. And, um, you know, by the time I,

447
00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:56.380
I laid my hands on this one and looked at the skin and skull,

448
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.700
I'd seen so many raccoons in museum collections that, you know,

449
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:01.590
I knew their skulls and teeth really well.

450
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.340
And so when I saw this and one of the first things I noticed is there was just

451
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:09.180
nothing that looked any different to me from the common raccoon in the North

452
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.030
American raccoon. And so Halligan decided to do some genetic work.

453
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.840
He compared the DNA of these Guadalupe and raccoons against North American ones

454
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.400
did the math. We made the comparisons. And, uh, our clear answer came through,

455
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.220
not only are these, you know, not very different,

456
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:25.590
they are just simply North American raccoons.

457
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.910
<v 13>Looping records are the same ones that come in and torment my garbage cans.</v>

458
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.680
He exact same raccoon.

459
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.700
He y'all common literally garden variety rack here and that we have in our own

460
00:29:38.701 --> 00:29:42.370
backyard now for scientists and conservationists.

461
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:47.140
<v 7>It is a real turnabout, you know, it goes from being distinct,</v>

462
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:51.760
special, endemic, you know, found nowhere else to just the opposite

463
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.480
<v 2>invasive species.</v>

464
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.700
So when Halligan started publishing papers on the raccoon in 2002 a

465
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.600
conservationist, we're excited because raccoons, they can have real impacts.

466
00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:08.520
They will do things like eat sea turtles, birds, nests, bird eggs,

467
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.730
including of some that are um, potentially endangered. They'll eat that. Wait,

468
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.680
they were, they were hurting actual endangered species. Um, yeah.

469
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.230
And so now that, now that they have proof,

470
00:30:19.231 --> 00:30:22.560
now that they are certain that this raccoon doesn't belong here,

471
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:26.340
then they feel finally we're going to be able to go out and start doing

472
00:30:26.341 --> 00:30:30.360
something about this. Protect the actually special lens. Get rid of this one.

473
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.480
Uh, sort of faker. But, uh,

474
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.230
putting conservation aside, what you've got is,

475
00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:42.231
is this native to the island national icon animal that has suddenly become an

476
00:30:44.911 --> 00:30:48.350
interloper brought there within the last, you know,

477
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.760
200 years probably just on a boat. Huh. Well,

478
00:30:52.761 --> 00:30:55.050
we'll give it everything that you've told us about the colonial history.

479
00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:00.160
How did the Guadeloupe eons react to this? Well, well, we went down, uh,

480
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.170
in 2004, Helga and his mentor to Guadalupe,

481
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.030
and we talked to some people associated with the zoo and with the government

482
00:31:09.031 --> 00:31:12.900
management of the park. And it was just a very brief conversation.

483
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.350
He made sure that they had heard the news, you know, guys,

484
00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:19.830
this raccoon that's found only in your country.

485
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.750
It's not what you thought it was and it doesn't belong here. And,

486
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.090
um, I remember that the message that came back to us was essentially,

487
00:31:30.091 --> 00:31:33.900
thank you very much, but, uh, we're going to,

488
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.220
we're going to hold onto our record.

489
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.030
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

490
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.240
<v 7>Yep. Tolkien, Mondo communicates meaning according to Blondin Chemo,</v>

491
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.920
there was no major communication campaign held on to make sure that the

492
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:47.770
population knew that there was a change in status.

493
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.510
The government never really told anyone. Uh, and when someone did say something

494
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.380
[inaudible] like Gerard Barry here

495
00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.670
[inaudible] he's a native Guadalupe

496
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.353
Pian Longtime Conservation Amy [inaudible] music.

497
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.040
[inaudible] a few years back I was interviewed by a reporter and I told him what

498
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.580
I knew for a fact, uh,

499
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.020
when I read [inaudible] and everyone was just saying,

500
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.930
know off with his heads. Some of my friends were like,

501
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:22.870
why don't you put judicial [inaudible]? How could you possibly say this?

502
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:26.620
You know, you should not have said this. This is this bad.

503
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.040
<v 2>And so for over a decade now, nothing has changed. Um,</v>

504
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:38.000
the laws haven't been amended and because the governments kept this so hush hush

505
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.370
many people, these islands still

506
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.330
<v 4>don't know the truth.</v>

507
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.480
So my understanding of the story is for many, many years,

508
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.580
there was this thought that in fact,

509
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:54.610
I accidentally broke the news to not very recently.

510
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:57.950
It was discovered that no, in fact, it's a,

511
00:32:57.951 --> 00:33:01.340
it's the same species that lives in the United States. Does that,

512
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:05.320
does that change your feelings about Sophie or about, uh, the,

513
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.410
the Guadeloupe Ian Raccoon in general. Is Your [inaudible]

514
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.143
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

515
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:21.630
<v 4>uh, was it at uni? [inaudible] up.</v>

516
00:33:21.631 --> 00:33:24.900
I can find it in the United States, but we wait,

517
00:33:24.901 --> 00:33:29.130
so is it possible that maybe it was brought to the United States?

518
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:33.330
The scientists say that it was brought here from the United States? Your

519
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:36.540
[inaudible]? I mean,

520
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.660
I always thought that the raccoon was really endemic to Guadalupe in the

521
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:42.510
[inaudible].

522
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:47.070
It is kind of sad for me to know that it's not endemic to what loop. I mean,

523
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.720
no, I wish it would have been so to be honest.

524
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.010
<v 7>And then, um,</v>

525
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.210
I had the even less enviable task of informing,

526
00:34:00.211 --> 00:34:02.790
not that just this past July

527
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.890
[inaudible] the EU passed this regulation.

528
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.920
We recognize that we cannot act on basically a black list of invasive species

529
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:21.090
whose negative impacts concern the European Union.

530
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:27.000
The thing is, uh, particularly in Germany, the raccoon is terribly invasive.

531
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:27.660
Uh,

532
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.440
these raccoons have actually been called the Nazi raccoons is they spread from

533
00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:35.850
Germany throughout the continent. And so the raccoon made the list.

534
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.460
<v 4>And that means that that members states like France and us,</v>

535
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.520
very likely overseas agencies like Guadalupe will have to start managing or even

536
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.560
or advocating them from the folks I've spoken with.

537
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.780
There's a good possibility that in the next year the raccoon is going to change

538
00:34:56.781 --> 00:35:01.490
from being a protected species to being a species that can be hunted,

539
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.650
trapped and killed.

540
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.570
Just keep it jockey boy 20 [inaudible] chassis [inaudible] attack.

541
00:35:07.571 --> 00:35:09.910
Oh No, no, no.

542
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:17.500
[inaudible] [inaudible] there's some of him. [inaudible] it kills me.

543
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.640
Some of the, it kills me. The thought that, you know,

544
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.400
people could start hunting raccoons, like we have to protect them. Ah, no, no,

545
00:35:26.401 --> 00:35:29.320
no, no, no, no, no, no. Uh, no, no, no.

546
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:38.160
A just show fee. It's not a specific, yeah.

547
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.860
<v 14>Okay. Got It. I just don't care.</v>

548
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.850
<v 0>Angelic Charlotte, owner of the Guadalupe suit. You don't care? No,</v>

549
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:49.230
I don't care. It's just the raccoon of Guadalupe. But it's kind of an imposter,

550
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:51.210
isn't it? It kind of tricked everyone, didn't it?

551
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.060
Here's one that's responsible of the person. I'm saying it was another specie.

552
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.930
People make an error. He didn't do anything.

553
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.010
You must respect to the animal, you know, uh,

554
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.750
even celly and Lois,

555
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.600
the watermelon farmers from the beginning of this story said,

556
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.490
at the end of the day, if, uh, let's say they say, okay, as of this date,

557
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.860
the raccoons are no longer, uh, whatever.

558
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.130
I don't see myself taking a rifle run into the field and just laying in,

559
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:21.040
wait to shoot them. No. It shows that, uh, we have, uh,

560
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:25.970
a few type of a wildlife, you know, no snake, nothing.

561
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.640
So, you know, is, uh, the bigger ones, the biggest one.

562
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.890
So people adopted it as a national animal. That's it. It's one of those,

563
00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:38.290
if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with, type fit

564
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.250
could be a good one. So,

565
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.820
<v 14>as a pragmatic person, I know it's an invite this patient today. I know it,</v>

566
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.840
but I know also, I think he's cute and I think I like it.

567
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.700
So what is the best balance to find? You see,

568
00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.773
I don't know.

569
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.180
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

570
00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.620
<v 0>it's kind of interesting that, uh, we in America loved the Bald Eagle, uh,</v>

571
00:37:14.621 --> 00:37:18.970
kind of a wretched bird that steals other people's nests and is generally a

572
00:37:18.971 --> 00:37:20.710
vulgar animal actually,

573
00:37:20.711 --> 00:37:25.711
but we never think of it that way because we've given it majesty and we give it,

574
00:37:26.861 --> 00:37:30.250
you know, in its talons there you see both, you know, peace and war.

575
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.443
It has been,

576
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:36.630
we've dressed it in America and I think every time a nation chooses to identify

577
00:37:38.351 --> 00:37:39.640
with some wild thing.

578
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:43.810
It's mostly really about the people identifying not about the animal. Yeah,

579
00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.000
I totally agree. But I see, I see like this,

580
00:37:46.001 --> 00:37:48.990
like there's like you have this fact, right, there is a fact here that,

581
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:52.210
that the raccoons didn't show up a million years ago or whatever. Right?

582
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.650
It's probably, it was probably more like 200 years. That's most probably a fact.

583
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.480
Yeah. But then there's the stuff on top of that,

584
00:37:58.481 --> 00:38:02.620
which is like is are they natural? Are they invasive?

585
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.020
Do they belong here? Those don't feel like facts.

586
00:38:05.021 --> 00:38:07.990
Let's be like judgements and like who gets to make those judgements?

587
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.760
The scientist, I don't know.

588
00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.540
I certainly didn't realize the extent that this was a deep seated cultural

589
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:17.590
battle in which I was, you know, entering with inserted yourself. Yes. Strongly.

590
00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.610
Again, Christopher Helga is just a, the same information, you know,

591
00:38:21.611 --> 00:38:23.690
different responses. And, um,

592
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.340
and I think that one of the deep questions of that,

593
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.380
of this story lives in that which is like you,

594
00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.830
you came to a scientific truth and

595
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.990
<v 2>the question becomes, should that scientific truth win the day?</v>

596
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.960
I mean, uh, as a scientist, you know, I would say yes.

597
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.880
As a conservation biologist, I would say yes,

598
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.960
that's important to shows us that taxonomy really matters.

599
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:56.200
This animal didn't belong and, um, you know, really,

600
00:38:56.201 --> 00:39:00.520
perhaps it should be removed from the island, but at the same time,

601
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.260
it's really a question for Guadeloupe. No, this is their island.

602
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.370
These are their animals running around on it. And, uh, um,

603
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.960
it can be very challenging for scientists like myself to come to terms with,

604
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.520
but that's how the world works.

605
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:31.873
<v 15>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

606
00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:37.930
[inaudible] [inaudible]

607
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.130
<v 7>one more thought before we, uh, before we go. Is that all right? Um,</v>

608
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.770
before Helgen officially sank or dethroned, uh,

609
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.920
this Guadalupe Ian Raccoon, there's actually another guy with a similar hunch.

610
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:55.330
Uh, this Parisian mammalogy just named a j m pawns.

611
00:39:55.750 --> 00:40:00.750
And in one of his papers he wrote that even if it can be proven that the

612
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.500
Guadeloupe Ian Raccoon is no different from the North American raccoon.

613
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:09.400
That the best answer might not be it's reclassification or eradication,

614
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.030
but instead it's isolation.

615
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.190
He wrote that it's quote,

616
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.590
insular distribution prevents gene exchange with the mainland and is likely to

617
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:24.190
warrant different selective pressures that should favor short term genetic

618
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:28.900
differentiation that may lead to a longterm speciation process.

619
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.083
Wait, what does that mean?

620
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.240
Meaning if they were able to keep these North American raccoons on Guadalupe

621
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.180
isolated long enough, maybe some [inaudible]

622
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:43.470
<v 13>they could be reclassified yet again this time as real,</v>

623
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.000
quite a in [inaudible].

624
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.410
<v 10>Yeah. What's your response to that?</v>

625
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.730
<v 2>Ponds said that. Um, but uh, you know, I like it, but uh,</v>

626
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.430
uh, I have to say, you're going to be waiting a long time

627
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.030
that's going to take over.

628
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.513
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

629
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.360
<v 17>do you want to give super, super thanks to Sally,</v>

630
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:28.410
Stan [inaudible] who was our translator and got Simon everywhere he needed to go

631
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.670
and made sure that it all worked out and do Allie panell here in New York who

632
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.980
helped make sense of the whole

633
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.180
<v 12>thing before we left so, so we'll have a huge debt. Thanks also to Ebay manual.</v>

634
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.270
David Xavier Owl bear, Lawrence Baptist,

635
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:46.271
sell them all and Florian Kirschner and to Bernie bean meal and most especially

636
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.980
thanks to Simon Adler who reported and produced the whole story here.

637
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.400
I want to read you go to this one paragraph real quick.

638
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.470
Can we before we go sign off about what,

639
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.440
cause you know how we were arguing about whether the raccoon is a good creature

640
00:41:57.441 --> 00:41:58.490
or an immoral creature.

641
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.310
And I was looking for ammunition on the Internet to find,

642
00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.460
to read to you guys and I found this thing,

643
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:08.680
I found this thing is it's in a blog called the truth about raccoons. Oh boy.

644
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:13.730
And it contains this paragraph, which I'm pretty sure is not true.

645
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.920
It goes, and I quote,

646
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:20.180
raccoons are one of the only land mammals who can also walk on the bottom of

647
00:42:20.181 --> 00:42:25.010
river beds, holding their breath for up to an hour that they eat, both live,

648
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.760
pray and carry on. You consume up to 20 pounds of raw meat at a time,

649
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.620
then go without food for a week.

650
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.500
Their skeletal structure is found in no other animal,

651
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:38.000
and that combined with their ferocity and complete lack of moral fiber,

652
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.660
make them perhaps our most dangerous enemy.

653
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:46.810
I rest my case that was no juice,

654
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.940
just propagating hate speech.
