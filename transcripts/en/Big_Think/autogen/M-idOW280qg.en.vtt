the reason that they call it that
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590
the reason that they call it that
privation is because there is has been

an argument that if you are curious

an argument that if you are curious
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.150
an argument that if you are curious
there is a certain kind of negative

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
there is a certain kind of negative

this answer you feel a relief and a
positive feeling comes over you we argue

positive feeling comes over you we argue
that if you are interested and you are

an aversive feeling except you can have
negative feelings developed because you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
negative feelings developed because you
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770
negative feelings developed because you
have a problem in your search but that's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
have a problem in your search but that's
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.600
have a problem in your search but that's
different than trying to close a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
different than trying to close a
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.179
different than trying to close a
knowledge gap the way that I can best

demonstrate you how we consider

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180
demonstrate you how we consider
 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.969
demonstrate you how we consider
curiosity and interest to be different

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
curiosity and interest to be different
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190
curiosity and interest to be different
is by telling you to think about when

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
is by telling you to think about when
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950
is by telling you to think about when
you read a detective story when you read

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
you read a detective story when you read
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870
you read a detective story when you read
a detective story the minute you find

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
a detective story the minute you find
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.499
a detective story the minute you find
out that who actually is the murderer

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
out that who actually is the murderer
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.420
out that who actually is the murderer
you might not even want to finish your

you might not even want to finish your
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.410
you might not even want to finish your
book and compare that to reading like

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
book and compare that to reading like
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.090
book and compare that to reading like
say Harry Potter or some really

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
say Harry Potter or some really
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.370
say Harry Potter or some really
well-constructed book that you're not

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
well-constructed book that you're not
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.499
well-constructed book that you're not
simply trying to find out a knowledge

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
simply trying to find out a knowledge
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539
simply trying to find out a knowledge
gap you are interested in many of the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
gap you are interested in many of the
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.100
gap you are interested in many of the
characters you are interested in the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
characters you are interested in the
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.690
characters you are interested in the
ideas you are interested in the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
ideas you are interested in the
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910
ideas you are interested in the
relationships and you will keep on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
relationships and you will keep on
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889
relationships and you will keep on
reading that book not only is the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
reading that book not only is the
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.840
reading that book not only is the
lengths of time different and the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
lengths of time different and the
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.319
lengths of time different and the
aversion different but they're also the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
aversion different but they're also the
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.020
aversion different but they're also the
purpose is it's different like when you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
purpose is it's different like when you
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999
purpose is it's different like when you
are interested you are searching for a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
are interested you are searching for a
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.190
are interested you are searching for a
lot of information not just a specific

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
lot of information not just a specific
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.190
lot of information not just a specific
information to close the knowledge gap

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
information to close the knowledge gap
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.580
information to close the knowledge gap
now there are some

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
now there are some
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.240
now there are some
answered issues about this for example

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
answered issues about this for example
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.520
answered issues about this for example
what happens if you have interest in a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
what happens if you have interest in a
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.160
what happens if you have interest in a
content but there is a knowledge gap

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
content but there is a knowledge gap
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.350
content but there is a knowledge gap
that you're closing is that now

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
that you're closing is that now
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.020
that you're closing is that now
different from just being curious and we

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
different from just being curious and we
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.420
different from just being curious and we
argue that it is because for example

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
argue that it is because for example
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.339
argue that it is because for example
take a bridge expert who loves playing

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349
take a bridge expert who loves playing
 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.800
take a bridge expert who loves playing
bridge he is reading a book with many

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
bridge he is reading a book with many
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.640
bridge he is reading a book with many
many puzzles ok solving bridge hands he

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
many puzzles ok solving bridge hands he
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.110
many puzzles ok solving bridge hands he
goes and solves a knowledge gap and then

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
goes and solves a knowledge gap and then
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.940
goes and solves a knowledge gap and then
continues going on to other questions

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
continues going on to other questions
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.229
continues going on to other questions
other puzzles because he has that

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239
other puzzles because he has that
 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.210
other puzzles because he has that
individual interest in the content that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
individual interest in the content that
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.729
individual interest in the content that
propels him to go on for further

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739
propels him to go on for further
 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.459
propels him to go on for further
