00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.240
Helicopters are impressive machines, but is
there an upper limit to how big they can get?

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.380
We spoke to this engineer at Boeing and here’s
what we learned: One.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.860
Engineers are super into what they do, and
that is awesome.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.860
Two.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.679
The bigger and heavier a helicopter gets,
the more lift it needs.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.019
The rotor blades are like spinning wings so
they have to do the heavy lifting.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.699
Do we have an animation of that?

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:29.929
Yesssss.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.390
Helicopters can create more lift by adding
more wing area, so a large helicopter would

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.899
need as long a rotor blade as possible.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.240
But this creates all sorts of problems.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.240
Helicopters can create more lift by adding
more wing area, so a large helicopter would

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240
need as long a rotor as possible.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.240
But this creates all sorts of problems.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.780
For example, the tips of the rotor blades
can’t go faster than the speed of sound

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.550
or the turbulence will make the blades less
efficient.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.480
The longer the blades get, the faster the
tips travel.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.329
If the helicopter has an enormous and fast
spinning rotor, it won’t be able to fly

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.050
very fast because the blade that’s spinning
in the same direction the helicopter is moving

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.649
will be traveling through the air at its speed
plus the helicopter’s speed, bringing it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470
closer to that speed limit.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.470
So, long blades would have to spin slowly,
but that would require a lot of torque to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.470
move.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.540
That torque strains the transmission that
connects the engines to the rotor, so to handle

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.440
it the transmission would need to be big and
heavy, and that’s a no-no.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.380
Engineers could use shorter blades and add
more of them, but then the hub in the middle

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.570
of the rotor gets more complex.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.580
Truly designing a giant helicopter is an engineering
feat.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.930
Helicopters could get even bigger if they
used multiple rotors, and the V-12, did just that.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.640
At 67 meters wide from rotor tip to rotor
tip, the prototype was wider than a Boeing

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
747.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.160
It remains the largest helicopter ever built,
and proved that with imagination and engineering,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.040
the sky is the limit.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.850

Amy’s got the details on how helicopters
fly in the first place here, and thanks for

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840
watching Seeker.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.290
Hey can we see that wing animation one more
time?

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.720
Aw, yeah.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.160
Uh huh.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.790
That was expensive.
