00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.160
What we've written expresses a single constraint,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.370
that is a single property of the system which must always ho,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.360
hold. Okay? It happens to be an invariant as indicated by the INV, keyword.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.150
What, one thing that I've glossed over is, the fact that,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.550
we use the numbers 2 and 3, explicitly. Without any indication that they're,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.765
they're dates. Now that can be inferred from the type of checkout.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.380
But if we were to get this completely right,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.130
we have to make sure that all the types matched up.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.220
And in fact, we were talking about two weeks here or three weeks here. We do

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.750
have a date class but we have to make sure that we're using it appropriately.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.240
Each OCL constraint is interpreted in the context of a particular class.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.650
What that means is that any names that occur without qualification.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.040
That means without having only a single part without any period in there

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.540
are interpreted in the context of a particular class. And

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.710
what that means is that the name could be the name of the class,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.670
it could be the name of an attribute, or it could be the name of an operation.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.960
We're also allowed within the language to refer to elements of other classes.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.430
And in that case, we're going to have to explicitly name the class. And

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.600
then put a period separator. And then the name of the attribute or

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.530
the name of the operation in the other class. Those are qualified names. But

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.750
if we're doing it in, if we're referring to names that belong with the class

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.880
itself, we don't have to which is why we have the context keyword.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.320
This particular constraint is conditional and says that for each book object,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.420
if the bestseller attribute of that object is true, then the checkout period

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.560
attribute for that object must have the value of 2. Denoting two weeks,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.335
otherwise the checkout period attribute must have the value if 3
