00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.930
Time to check out what
we've got loaded up.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.390
Let's open up the project pane by
clicking the tab at the top left,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.010
or by hitting Cmd+1 if you're on a Mac.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.830
By default the project pane
only shows the source and

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.770
resources that are relevant
to an Android build.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.060
That can be nice sometimes, but
for now let's use the drop-down

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.580
at the top of this pane to
open up the project view.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.810
There we go.
Now we can see all the files and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.290
directories in our project directory.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.880
Let's open up the settings.gradle file.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.900
This shows us all the modules
that make up this project.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.980
Looks like this build has desktop,
Android, iOS, and HTML modules.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.080
So that's where the code for
each of those specific platforms lives.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.660
Then there's also the core module.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.380
That's where we'll write the code
that will run everywhere.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.160
Not all of these files and folders
will be super relevant to you, but

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.230
I want to go over what
all of them do just so

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.326
that there's nothing that
seems magical in here.

00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:56.540
First the .gradle folder.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.250
Gradle is a very smart build tool.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.420
And when you ask it
to compile something,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.890
it checks to see if it's
already compiled that file.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.953
And if so, it says that that compilation
task is up-to-date and skips it.

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:11.990
The .gradle folder is where gradle
caches that sort of information.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.610
The .idea folder is where Android Studio

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.020
holds its information about the project
and the state of the workspace.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.700
It's just a ton of complicated
XML you don't need to touch.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.480
We already talked about the android,
core, desktop, html and ios folders.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.210
Then there's the gradle folder.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.185
The gradle folder,
works together with the gradlew and

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:34.570
gradlew.bat files to form what's
called the gradle wrapper.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.110
Basically, the point is, that gradle
knows how to download itself, so

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.040
you can version control what
version of your build tools your

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.020
actually building the project with.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.589
It's something super fancy
you don't need to touch, but

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:49.170
it's also why you didn't have to install
gradle in order to build this project.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.053
Pretty, cool, right?

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:54.040
The .gitignore file tells git which of
these files shouldn't be checked into

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.575
version control.

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:58.540
These consists mostly of files
that are user specific settings,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.980
like everything in the .idea folder.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.120
And, of build outputs like everything
that's in each of the build folders

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.863
where gradle spits out its outputs.

00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:08.338
gradle.properties and

00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:12.210
local.properties store more
gradle specific configuration.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.590
Finally, there's a README file that
explains all this in much more detail.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.220
So, that's it.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.880
That's all of the files
on a libGDX project.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.780
Nothing really magical.
