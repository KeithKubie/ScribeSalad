00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.984
We've discussed everything you need to
know about creating notifications and

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:05.080
apps for Android Wear.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.240
But one thing we haven't
discussed until now,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.260
is how to show the time to the user.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.650
Well, watch faces are such
an important feature of Android Wear

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.175
that we have a whole
lesson dedicated to it.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.930
What's an Android Wear watch face?

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.890
A watch face is what's shown
when the screen is on, and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.180
no other apps are running.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.290
It's what you'll spend
the most time looking at.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.570
And the first thing that others will
see, when they glance at your watch.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.380
It's visible all the time, so you can
discreetly glance at the watch face,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.700
without touching or
activating the device.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
it goes without saying that
a watch face should show the time.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.860
Watch faces can also be a highly
functional way to share concise,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.180
timely information.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.000
For example, a watch face can show
your next upcoming calendar event, or

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.370
the weather, or
the current price of a stock.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.830
Watch faces are also
a personal statement of style.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.010
We like to say that Android Wear
let's you wear what you want, and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.970
no where is that more
true than a watch face.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.470
The design guidelines we discussed for

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.500
wear are a framework on which to build
your creations, giving you room and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.239
support for creative expression and
artistic freedom.
