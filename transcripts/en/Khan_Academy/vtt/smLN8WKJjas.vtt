00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:02.582
- [Voiceover] Let's talk about the idea

00:00:02.582 --> 00:00:05.171
of the impedance of some simple networks.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.926
Now, what I've shown here
is a very simple network.

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:11.571
It has two impedances
in it, Z one and Z two.

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.648
And inside these boxes

00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:16.735
are one of our favorite
passive components,

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.859
either an R, an L, or a C.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.587
That's what's in both of these things.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.420
We're gonna look at combinations of this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.543
and figure out what the impedance

00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:26.541
of simple combinations are.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.880
When we talk about impedance,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.456
what we mean is we take
sinusoidal signals.

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:31.894
We take a sinusoidal voltage,

00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:35.582
and divide it by a sinusoidal current.

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:39.104
And that is, that ratio is impedance.

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:40.655
And so the voltage is impressed

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:43.580
across the two terminals here,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.747
and then the current I flows this way.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.779
So this will be I, and this
will be plus or minus V

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:53.612
between here and here.

00:00:55.437 --> 00:00:57.142
And the relationship
between those two things

00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:58.809
is called impedance.

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:04.670
So now we have a circuit here

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.701
with two impedances in it in series.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.353
They're connected in series
because they're head to tail.

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:15.021
Now, if both of these
impedances were resistors,

00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.521
like this, if we just make them resistors,

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:23.771
when we write down the
impedance of a resistor,

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:27.673
we just write down R, the
impedance of a resistor is R.

00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:30.002
And the impedance of this one is R.

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.568
So we'll call that one R two, and R one.

00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:36.372
And the overall, the effect of
impedance of the whole thing

00:01:36.372 --> 00:01:40.539
is resistors in series, we
know this, is R one plus R two.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.052
So nothing new here yet.

00:01:44.052 --> 00:01:47.496
Now let's make a little
change, let's do this.

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:49.020
Let's make a network that looks

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.687
like a resistor and a capacitor.

00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.216
And I want to know the
voltage to current ratio,

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:00.707
or I want to know the impedance,

00:02:00.707 --> 00:02:02.915
the effective impedance of this.

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:04.653
So we transform the circuit,

00:02:04.653 --> 00:02:06.845
we write down, this value is R.

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:11.012
And the impedance of a
capacitor is one over J Omega C.

00:02:15.592 --> 00:02:18.581
And if I want to, I can write
it exactly the same way,

00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:22.748
I could say that is equal to
minus J times one over Omega C.

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:28.303
Remember, one over J
is the same as minus J.

00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:32.470
So, if I want to know the
impedance of this network here,

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.830
Z is, now, this is the great trick

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.771
of doing this transformation.

00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:42.873
We can use the same laws
that we know for resistors

00:02:42.873 --> 00:02:44.779
on this transformed circuit.

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.145
We transformed it into
the frequency domain.

00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:50.692
So this series combination
of two impedances

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:53.160
is the sum of the impedances.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.327
R plus one over J Omega C.

00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:03.824
This is the impedance
of this network here.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:09.712
Let's do another one, let's
do an inductor combination.

00:03:09.712 --> 00:03:13.045
So, we'll do a resistor and an inductor.

00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:21.721
Like that, so the impedance
of a resistor is R,

00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:25.221
the impedance of an inductor is J Omega L.

00:03:27.756 --> 00:03:29.687
And I can write the
combined impedance of this,

00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:32.310
the same thing, it's a series impedance.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.727
So I can do R plus J Omega L.

00:03:40.288 --> 00:03:43.675
Now what I want to do next is
introduce some new terminology

00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:46.144
that we talk about impedances with.

00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:48.094
So let's look at these
two examples down here,

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.103
for the capacitor and the inductor.

00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:53.270
R's a real number, one over J Omega C,

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.185
that's a imaginary number,

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:59.993
and together they make a complex number.

00:03:59.993 --> 00:04:02.157
And over here with the
inductor, we see the same thing,

00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:04.595
a real part and an imaginary part.

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:06.806
So the way we write an
impedance in general,

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:09.027
as a rectangular complex number,

00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:11.194
is we say Z equals R plus,

00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:18.361
and the letter we use is X.

00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:20.444
Now, R is the resistance,

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:28.836
and X, the name for X
in general is reactance.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.998
X is the imaginary part of an impedance,

00:04:36.998 --> 00:04:39.771
and that's referred to as the reactance.

00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:43.489
We also talked about the
inverse of a resistance.

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:46.989
One over resistance is called conductance.

00:04:53.163 --> 00:04:54.663
That's one over R.

00:04:58.788 --> 00:05:02.538
And one over X is referred
to as susceptance.

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:14.665
Now these are all just words that,

00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:16.980
they all sound like they
sort of mean the same thing,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.281
but engineers wanted to have,
sort of, different words

00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:21.767
for different parts of the impedance.

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:24.114
And these are the words that we use.

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:26.461
And finally, we have
another word for the inverse

00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:30.192
of impedance, the general
idea of one over Z,

00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:33.118
and that's referred to as admittance.

00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:34.785
Ad, mit, admittance.

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:41.285
This is our little vocabulary,

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:44.088
we have admittance is the
opposite of impedance,

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:46.008
or the inverse of impedance.

00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:49.984
Susceptance is the inverse of reactance.

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:53.384
And conductance is the
inverse of resistance.

00:05:53.384 --> 00:05:56.493
These are all just, sort of,
every word we can think of

00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:59.326
that meant resist and let through.

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:05.625
So now I'm gonna roll
up here a little bit,

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:07.027
and we'll do some plots.

00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:11.194
We'll look more carefully at
these impedance expressions.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.109
So if these are all complex numbers,

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.387
that means I can plot
them on a complex plane.

00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:22.356
So let's do that and see what it tells us,

00:06:22.356 --> 00:06:24.976
see if we can learn anything.

00:06:24.976 --> 00:06:29.059
Okay, this is the real
and this is the imaginary.

00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:32.338
Now, for resistance to resistors,

00:06:32.338 --> 00:06:33.801
we just have two real parts.

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.454
So there's some Z that's
the sum of two R's,

00:06:36.454 --> 00:06:38.008
and that's a real number.

00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:40.429
So I would just get a,

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:43.762
some sort of value like here, like that.

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.225
I'd add those two vectors together,

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:48.892
and that would be Z.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.356
So let's do that for
the other circuit now.

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:57.606
If I do it for capacitance, RC circuit,

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.879
the one resistor is out here like this,

00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:05.702
that's a value of R.

00:07:06.577 --> 00:07:08.484
And C, how do we plot C?

00:07:08.484 --> 00:07:11.776
Well, C, remember, is one over J Omega C

00:07:11.776 --> 00:07:15.859
is the same as negative
J times one over Omega C.

00:07:17.183 --> 00:07:20.796
So that's gonna give us a negative J.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:23.753
It's gonna give us a line
on the negative J axis.

00:07:23.753 --> 00:07:26.086
Here it is, real, imaginary.

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:32.164
And Z is gonna be, this
value here, right there,

00:07:32.164 --> 00:07:35.664
has a magnitude of one over J Omega, oops.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.941
This point right here has a magnitude.

00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:45.005
The length of that vector
is one over Omega C.

00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:48.817
And that point right there,
when we do the vector add,

00:07:48.817 --> 00:07:50.585
that'll be Z right there.

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:53.085
Dat, dat, dat, dah, like that.

00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:55.976
And let's do the L.

00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:01.048
Let's plot the circuit
that has an L in it.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.977
Okay, again we have an R,
so we go out some distance.

00:08:03.977 --> 00:08:05.144
R right there.

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:11.657
And now J Omega L, we
have a positive J here,

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.668
so it goes up by Omega L.

00:08:13.668 --> 00:08:16.093
So let's say L was kind of small.

00:08:16.093 --> 00:08:17.404
Let's say it goes right there.

00:08:17.404 --> 00:08:21.571
So that has a magnitude of
Omega L on the imaginary axis.

00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:29.310
And that'll give us a point,
that'll be Z for that network.

00:08:33.106 --> 00:08:36.310
Now you notice as, let's
say we change Omega.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.017
Let's say Omega is varying.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:41.478
Omega goes up, in this
case here, Omega goes up.

00:08:41.478 --> 00:08:43.703
This point will travel up.

00:08:43.703 --> 00:08:47.678
It'll move in the complex
plain if Omega changes.

00:08:47.678 --> 00:08:49.502
This one, if Omega changes,

00:08:49.502 --> 00:08:52.328
if Omega gets bigger for a capacitor,

00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:54.675
if Omega gets bigger for a capacitor,

00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:57.143
that means this number gets smaller,

00:08:57.143 --> 00:09:00.226
and this will move in this direction.

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:05.303
And on the resistor
side, if Omega changes,

00:09:05.303 --> 00:09:07.233
well, there's no Omega term here.

00:09:07.233 --> 00:09:09.857
So nothing changes when Omega changes

00:09:09.857 --> 00:09:11.989
in this resistor picture.

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:15.237
So, this shows us what
happens in a graphical way

00:09:15.237 --> 00:09:20.099
when we change the frequency
of a complex impedance.

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:22.266
Now I want to do one more.

00:09:23.194 --> 00:09:25.236
Let's do a circuit that looks like this,

00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:27.200
let's do three things.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.033
Let's do

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:35.176
an inductor, a resistor, and
a capacitor, all in series.

00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:39.752
And what is C?

00:09:42.468 --> 00:09:44.053
So, we label it as we did before,

00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:46.803
J Omega L, R, one over J Omega C.

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:52.707
So let's now work out
the impedance of this.

00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:55.299
It's a series circuit,
so the impedances add.

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:58.966
So we can say that Z
equals J Omega L plus R

00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:06.185
plus one over J Omega C.

00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:12.657
So we can try a plot of these things.

00:10:12.657 --> 00:10:15.824
Here's the real, here's the imaginary.

00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:19.074
Let's do R first.

00:10:19.074 --> 00:10:23.241
R is always on the real
axis, some value like that.

00:10:25.553 --> 00:10:28.220
J Omega L goes up by some value.

00:10:29.332 --> 00:10:32.999
Here's the inductor
represented as a vector.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.688
And here's one over J Omega C

00:10:36.688 --> 00:10:39.237
that goes down on the axis like that,

00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:42.132
so it's gonna come down
here somehow like this.

00:10:42.132 --> 00:10:44.460
Let's make the capacitor small,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.872
which makes it's impedance large.

00:10:47.872 --> 00:10:51.372
The magnitude of that is one over Omega C,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.610
and when we put all these together,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.267
we do, basically, we do a
vector add of these guys here.

00:10:58.267 --> 00:11:01.253
So I can, let's move
the L over here, let's,

00:11:01.253 --> 00:11:05.033
L goes up like that,
there's a vector add of L.

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:07.823
And then I have a vector
add of this vector here,

00:11:07.823 --> 00:11:10.823
adds onto that, back down like that,

00:11:11.724 --> 00:11:15.391
and the final answer
is this guy right here.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:23.031
And this is Z for this network right here,

00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:26.274
is that complex number right there.

00:11:26.274 --> 00:11:31.255
And you see, as we change
Omega, different things happen,

00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:34.242
and we can basically
move this point around.

00:11:34.242 --> 00:11:36.501
Moving this point around with frequency
