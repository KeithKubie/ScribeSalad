00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To answer this we'll apply these two formulas.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
First we'll compute x-bar and y-bar.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
X-bar is 2. Y-bar is 8.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now we'll compute our differences-- -1, 0, 1 for the x's, -4, -1, and 5 for the y's.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The numerator of each of these is 4 + 0 + 5 = 9.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The denominator of b is 2, so b is equal to 4.5.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, to sum up the square differences and the y's,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we have 16 + 1 + 25 = 42.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The product of these is 84, so we have 9 / âˆš84, which 0.982.
