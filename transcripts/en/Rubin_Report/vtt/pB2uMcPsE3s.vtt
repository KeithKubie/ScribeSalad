1
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.830
[inaudible].

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.020
<v 1>All right.
First off,
king,
we just did something that we've never done on this.</v>

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.880
We stopped for a moment so that Alexis could bring you a chocolate shake in the

4
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:21.510
middle of the show.
Normally,

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.320
normally someone with diabetes and heart should not have a chocolate milk.

6
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.223
However,

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.840
I've lost weight and I don't know why they say it comes with aging.
I have,

8
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:37.610
I try to have a daily milkshake to not lose anymore.
Yeah,
that's a,

9
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.490
that's a little call back to Brooklyn,
right?
Oh yeah.

10
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:45.100
We had malteds too where they put Maltin.
Yeah,
the candy store.

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.110
There's no candy stores anymore.
There's no case.
Well,
now they've got like,

12
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.030
you know Beverly Hills Super Deluxe Fan by a candy eye.
Candy.

13
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:56.500
I put a jukebox and you sit in.
I have agreements.
Yeah.

14
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.690
Well let's talk a little bit about age.

15
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.970
I guess it's a little weird to talk about.
At some level.

16
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:06.650
You are 84 85 in November.
Okay,
so you didn't believe it.

17
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.180
My father died at 46 I've had every known disease.

18
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.760
I can't believe it.
I can't believe I'm this age.
What does it,

19
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.240
what does it feel like?
I mean you've,
you've had a couple of heart attacks.

20
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:22.850
Are these your diabetes?
A couple of things and you're still here.

21
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:23.930
You're doing your thing,

22
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.520
you're out and about every morning I bump into you half the time I think that,

23
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.930
uh,
it's,
the reason I'm around is that I have a purpose.

24
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.610
I,

25
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.610
I'm amazed that people who retire as Milton Berle told me once when I asked him,

26
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:40.821
are you going to retire?

27
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.821
And he said to what would I do if I get up in the morning?

28
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.530
I had nothing to do.
That's terrible.

29
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.440
So I have a place to go to follow my profession.

30
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.610
That's wonderful.
If you can keep that going,

31
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.420
I'll probably die on the air or someone else.

32
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.100
What would you like?

33
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.270
You really want to increase my youtube views right now came from,
yeah.

34
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.030
What would you like your obituary to read?

35
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.430
And I said oldest man who ever lived passed away today

36
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.300
in his sleep with a smile on his face.

37
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.230
But you still get a kick out of everything.
I know it.
So wait,
just real quick,

38
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.970
tell,
tell everybody a little bit about,

39
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.200
you have these breakfasts with your old crew.
Well,
some of them have passed away.

40
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.670
The guys I grew up with in Brooklyn,
but we have a crew of about five or six.

41
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.710
We meet every day at different places and we attained to David.

42
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.160
We solve the problems in the world today and we solve the rack

43
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.330
audience.
No worries about Iraq.

44
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.270
The table solve the closely through jokes.

45
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.420
We do all the jokes and we talked about people getting in arguments.

46
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.360
We talk about Israel,
we talk hearings,

47
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.090
who's this,
what's this senator doing,
what she doing?

48
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:09.091
And then we also discuss Sinatra and old time musicians and who's doing what and

49
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.510
what Barbara Streisand make on her last tour.

50
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.690
And so we never know where the discussion is going and that's the wonderful,

51
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.190
and when you were going to have friends from childhood,

52
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.670
two of mine have passed away,
but I still have two others.

53
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.590
The best thing about it is I'm not Larry King.
I'm Larry to soccer.

54
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.910
That was my birth name and they're very happy for me.

55
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.980
But I'm still a
button,

56
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:47.080
the button on your shirt,
you know what I mean?
They,

57
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.050
they don't treat you like anything different.

58
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.170
What's it like as somebody of a certain age now where you know,

59
00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:56.910
you just mentioned you've lost some childhood friends.

60
00:03:56.911 --> 00:04:01.420
Your brother passed away just last year or so months ago.
Yeah.
Um,

61
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.370
just watching life turn in that way.
That's the sad Sinatra told me once.

62
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.850
The saddest thing about aging is your friends go before you.

63
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.430
I didn't want my brother to die before me.
He was your younger brother,

64
00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:21.080
right?
Yeah,
he was 80.
I'm,
yeah,
he was 80.
Yeah.
Is Hard.

65
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.480
It's um,
cause I don't believe in an afterlife.
I'm not religious.

66
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.800
You think this is it that baby.
That's it.
I've never,

67
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.420
I've interviewed thousands of people,

68
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.800
people who said they've seen death and all this,
I don't buy it.

69
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.410
I may be a little,
I don't buy it.
I just,

70
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.240
it just makes no sense to me that Lincoln is up there or that there's someone up

71
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:51.280
there looking down on me.
I am,
I went to my grandchildren's,

72
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.850
they're twins,
boy and a girl.
So they had a bot and a bar Mitzvah.

73
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.710
And for the first time in ages,
I read from the Old Testament

74
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.470
that God,
he's the work.
Huh?
Son of a bitch cheese.

75
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.310
Did he hate it?
Rocked my enemies.
Lou Out to show me one good pen.

76
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.960
My God,
believe in me.
Above me.
He was vain.

77
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.421
Incredible.

78
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.980
He was a Donald Trump before there was a Donald Trump believe in me above all

79
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:24.670
others.
I am the,
I can't believe it.
So when I read that

80
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.840
I couldn't believe it,
so I can't buy it.

81
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.720
I've interviewed all the great religious leaders except pope.
Yeah.

82
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.620
I've never been convinced.
So when you,
when you've sat down,

83
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.320
I mean you've sat down with everybody from the Dalai Lama across the board with

84
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.280
Billy Graham was a friend.
Yeah.
So when you sat down with them,

85
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:43.480
even if you don't believe it,

86
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.510
did you feel that some of them were able to get something out of belief?

87
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.510
I believe they believe,
unless there was some phone,
these,
you know,

88
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.640
sending $10 and I'll send you a little cross.
I don't buy any of that.

89
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.980
Sat Down with some of those guys do.
Oh yeah.

90
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.990
Jerry Falwell since as George Burns once said,
when he played God,

91
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.090
it's a great movie,
great movie.

92
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.720
And he gathers all the religious leaders and he calls in a Jerry Falwell type

93
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.800
and the fall type.
Go See,
call me in.
First goes up to his room,

94
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.770
sits down,
and God says to him,

95
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.140
why don't you sell shoes?
So I never,

96
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:30.570
I never bought that part,
but I,
I liked Billy Graham,
respected them.

97
00:06:30.571 --> 00:06:32.720
Billy Graham thought I was very spiritual.

98
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:37.660
And do I believe in Billy is with Jesus now?
No.
But bill,

99
00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:40.640
he believed that he believed he was going to Jesus.
He had not been,

100
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.690
have a fear of death.

101
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.160
He had a fear of being in a plane that's gone down to crash.

102
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.140
But he didn't fear death.
I fear I don't,
I don't.
I'm like Woody Allen.

103
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.430
I don't fear it.
I just don't want to be there.
Uh,
I can't go.

104
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.340
So my wife believes I respect believer's.
See,

105
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.310
when I approached an interview with Billy Graham,
I respect him.

106
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.190
I asked him the best questions I could ask,
like,

107
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.380
why do you need to stay at the Fontainebleau or as I've called her,

108
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:13.280
Lenny Bruce Timm,

109
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.490
any person who's got a calling from the Lord to lead the flock who has more than

110
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:25.220
one suit while someone has no clothes,
it's a copout.

111
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.770
And Billy Graham said,
in today's world,

112
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.940
you have to have more than one scene.
You have to travel.

113
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.260
I asked him if Christ Jesus probably had one pair of flip flop,

114
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.250
the crease would,
would Christ,
would he buy suits?
And he said yes,

115
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.740
and he would go on television.
That was the means of communication.

116
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.940
I mean,
that's their answer,
but he believed it.
I respected his belief,

117
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.620
but I'm not afraid to ask them any question if when you die,

118
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.390
if you believe in Jesus Christ,
you will live forever.
What happens is the Jews,

119
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.270
and he said,
well,
I,
I don't go into them,

120
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.270
but maybe at the moment of their death they accept Christ.

121
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.100
That's kind of a cop out.
There's always sort of another answer.
Right.

122
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.400
Did you ever talk to anybody,
either religious or otherwise,

123
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:22.880
that you felt had some sort of special insight into something?
Well,

124
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:26.090
I have this doctor on who was convinced that he had died,

125
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:29.690
visited what the world of afterlife was,
and then his life was saved.

126
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:33.440
He was a recognized doctor,
knew what disease he had.

127
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.810
I threw it up to a vivid imagination and he got a bestselling book out of it.

128
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.410
People want to believe,
you know,

129
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.030
I wished that I had faith that I could make.

130
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:49.820
It's called the leap of faith.
You can't prove it.

131
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.800
So it's a leap of faith.
Now we have faith in a lot of things.

132
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.490
You get on an airplane,

133
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.120
you have the faith that that airplane company hired a licensed pilot I punched.

134
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.940
You have some core of belief that you think that you,

135
00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:10.020
if you jump out of the 10th floor of a building,

136
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:13.230
you're not gonna make it so you don't Trump

137
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.960
the people who have that faith who go beyond.

138
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.340
I just think they've got a great crutch,

139
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.010
Greg Crutch to know you're going somewhere,
but at the end,

140
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:30.090
do you think it matters if they,

141
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.620
if they live a good life and you live a good life?
First of all,

142
00:09:32.621 --> 00:09:36.690
they never to know.
Yeah.
If they go somewhere they were right.
If they don't,

143
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:39.990
they don't know cause they did.
So they got a good deal going.

144
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.350
They really have a good deal.
I don't have an Amish.
If I've got an afterlife,

145
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.190
I'll be shocked.
Yeah,
but you'll be doing this.
Oh,
I will.

146
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.980
Absolutely.
Or maybe you'll be playing baseball up there.
I'm not that good.

147
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.870
That good.
Um,
let's talk a little bit about politics.

148
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.410
You mentioned Trump.
We did about 40 minutes.
His name didn't even come up once.

149
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:06.411
First Time in American conversation that any two people had a conversation for

150
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:09.690
40 minutes and the name Trump than not.
That's one thing he's done.

151
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.040
I'll bet you everyone in America at one time today said the name Trump.

152
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.080
Everybody.
Everybody.

153
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.350
Is there anyone else that in the years that you've been doing this,

154
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:24.570
that you saw just that effect?

155
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.540
He's the only president that I've known for 40 years.

156
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.020
I met the other presidents some before they became President Barack Obama,

157
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.010
George Bush,
Bill Clinton.
But they were in the political sphere.

158
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.160
But Trump is the only one that was my friend before Trump and I went to the

159
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:48.180
Superbowl together.
Can you talk about I fathers of the year together?

160
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.560
Is that right?
1995 he had his kids and my kids as a wall of his story.

161
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:54.910
We got trophies.
Um,

162
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.860
I went to see Marla maples and her Broadway show.

163
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:01.980
I went with Trump.

164
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.960
I stayed at hotels when I had some minor surgery in New York.

165
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:09.180
He took my wife out to dinner the night before.

166
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.890
He caught me at every hotel they own,

167
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.440
put me in a suite at the plaza when he owned the plaza.

168
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.990
But one thing we always knew about Trump,
he was a character and he lied.
Now he,

169
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.160
he almost lined by,
it's snowing out when it wasn't,
you know,

170
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:28.080
he'd be on my show and say highest rating it.
And it was all about him,

171
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.510
but he was a character and it was fun.

172
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.190
And he could be very nice and generous.
Okay.
I had all those qualities,

173
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.750
but he was a character.
I mean,

174
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:41.751
he would call up the New York Post with a different name and tell them stories

175
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:45.420
about Donald Trump's so we can get on page six.
That was his goal,

176
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.910
but precedent.
Precedent.
Are you kidding?

177
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.720
Anybody,
any of us who knew him ago?
First,
he was a moderate

178
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.450
to central Democrat,
supported Hillary Clinton.
Loved Hillary Clinton.

179
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.360
Thought she was a great senator.
He wanted single payer health care.

180
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.610
He didn't care about abortion.
Come on,
evangelicals.

181
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.710
I don't think Donald ever read a book,
but he's,

182
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.460
but he was a friendly character to be around a wonderful guest.

183
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.980
A lot of fun.
Fly off the top,
but precedent.
Precedent.

184
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.350
So what do you make about what happened here?

185
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.610
Like I have no idea where Hillary was a bad candidate.
A wonderful person.

186
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:37.390
I Know Hillary very well.
Great sense of humor.
Sad.
I don't know what her,

187
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.310
she didn't go to Wisconsin.

188
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.710
Did you get a different Hillary when you would into her interview her publicly?

189
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.850
This is what a lot of her is that she's very friendly and open.
The one on one.

190
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:53.390
She's good.
Yeah.
In front of an audience.
She's not,
she's not a good move.

191
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.490
She's running for something now wish I went to a young kippah service where she

192
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:01.390
was the speaker.
She was terrific.
She wasn't running from anything.

193
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.860
She was a senator from New York and damn good center.
Uh,

194
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.050
she ran a horrendous campaign and she was not a good campaign.

195
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:15.550
I thought she won the debates,
but it almost didn't matter.
Trump became,

196
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.620
went from,

197
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:21.520
got elected with that first question in the first republican debate when he was

198
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:26.521
asked about women and did he ever call women pigs and he said only Rosie

199
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.330
O'donnell and he sat in the middle of all the Republicans.

200
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.120
Why did they see them in the middle was just four on one side.

201
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.410
Fournier did you really think at the end from that moment that I thought he

202
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:39.400
would ignite something,

203
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:43.060
but I thought he was dead when he said that thing about McCain isn't a hero.

204
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.500
Certainly when he got off the bus with Billy Bush,

205
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.850
I thought that was over,

206
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.060
but his base doesn't care if evangelicals can put aside his personal life,

207
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.300
he'll never lose them.
He'll level.
It's,
it's,
it's,

208
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.160
I've never lived in weird at times.

209
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.750
I mean this is the weirdest time to every day.
Yeah.

210
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.030
There's a story.
Does this truly in all your years,

211
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:16.180
does this right now feel like a truly,
truly unique time?

212
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:18.340
Because people ask me that.
I'll have to come like events.

213
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:19.930
I do and I think the answer's yes.

214
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:23.450
Although you always think when you're living it,
but of course it's your neck.

215
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.600
Do you believe that somebody said one day to see what Lincoln Center to hear

216
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:33.700
what Roseville dig last night,

217
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.100
to see the speech that caught him mean to you?
When was that weird?

218
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.760
No,
they didn't do weird things.

219
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.150
They were president that I remember.

220
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:49.270
I was in the White House interviewing George Bush and Barbara Bush said to me,

221
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.930
Larry suspenders,
the White House,
you know,

222
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.170
she was in the White House's.
This place is now.

223
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.250
I wonder what it's like in their carrier.

224
00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:04.250
The guy writes the op Ed piece in the New York Times.
Mike God,

225
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.340
the Woodward Book,
Fascinating Book.

226
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.900
We living in those times would would've gone believe it,

227
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.320
<v 2>but I could see as you talk about it,
here's a glimmer in your eye,</v>

228
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.420
like there's something exciting about this.

229
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.870
Do you think that that's in a weird way,
the,
the good part of this,

230
00:15:19.871 --> 00:15:22.750
even if it's kind of helter skelter now and I'm glad I'm not alone,

231
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.560
<v 1>CNN,
no,
I wouldn't want to be doing panels every day and Trump all the time.</v>

232
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.910
I don't want to do that.
That's not the whole world.
Trump's not the whole world.

233
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.850
He thinks he's the whole.
How,
how important do you think

234
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.270
<v 2>politics actually is?</v>

235
00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:39.960
Because I think now there's maybe what I'm realizing now is that this is really

236
00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:42.360
about culture.
What we're fighting right now,
this,

237
00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:44.400
this battle that seems to be in points about culture.

238
00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.170
It's about what do we really care about?
What do we like,

239
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:49.500
not just about the ins and outs and machinations of

240
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.020
<v 1>too much of America is still prejudiced,
Latino's,</v>

241
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.340
blacks.
That still runs through a lot of us.

242
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.233
In my opinion,

243
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.210
people voting against their own self interest.
No,
let's,

244
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.730
I wanted to face it with something.

245
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.140
Obamacare is working for a lot of people.

246
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.450
You don't hear many complaints about people who are under it and getting good

247
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:24.650
medical care.
I'm not sure they'll ever do away with it.

248
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:27.860
Just those,

249
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.860
those kinds of facts are sort of bothers me when I see that.

250
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:37.550
Why we still have prejudice in America and appeal to it.
I mean,

251
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:42.110
Trump,
even his defendant would say he appeals to what?
What?

252
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.660
What did we need a,
we need a wall.

253
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.600
<v 2>Do you think,
do you think that's a play by him?
I mean,</v>

254
00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:49.540
for all the years that you knew him,
did you think he was racist or that this is,

255
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.020
<v 1>I never thought he was racist.
I think he was opportunity.
He was,</v>

256
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.920
he took advantage of a situation.

257
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.530
So we used to say he wasn't smart.
He wasn't book smart.

258
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.980
I bet at at school he got gentlemen see

259
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.560
the big influences in his life or Roy Cohn who I knew very well and his father

260
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.650
and they were bad influences.
I mean Rog Roy Cohn was,

261
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.170
I liked him because he was peculiar,

262
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.960
but he was waiting for the people that don't know who write on it.

263
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.730
He was a bad guy.
He was part of the McCarthy era and

264
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.990
angels in America had,
he played a part in that play.

265
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.020
Uh,
and he was affected by that.
And so I never,

266
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:43.580
I never thought he was a racist,

267
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.110
but his narcissism was beyond belief.

268
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.820
I in every other sentence,
I did this,
I did that.

269
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.670
I'm the greatest president we've ever had.

270
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.520
How often think you say that?
How could you say that?

271
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.260
<v 3>Okay,</v>

272
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.770
<v 1>so if you were sitting down with him,
I would say Donald,
why?</v>

273
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.860
I spoke to them everyday during the camp,
but not every day,

274
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.400
once a week during the campaign,
he knew I was voting for Hillary,

275
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.310
but we were friends and he would call me.
What do you think it is?

276
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:20.340
I'm the one that is,
what do you think of that?
I got this.

277
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:21.240
What do you think it is something.

278
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.060
I'm going to do an interview with the New York Times,
you know,
the guy,

279
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:29.100
should I do this?
And then when he was elected,

280
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:30.330
I never heard from him again.

281
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:34.640
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

282
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.640
<v 1>do you think we can get out of this polarization that we seem to be in?</v>

283
00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:41.340
So if we're in this unique time right now and crazy time,

284
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.480
how's it going to change?
You know,
we don't have,

285
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.050
uh,
forcefully to,
it might be Bloomberg

286
00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.420
to lead us.
We need someone
to leave this out.

287
00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:01.470
We need Gary Cooper,

288
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.060
maybe George Clooney in the modern society.
I'm a king.

289
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.540
George Clooney.
A Bright Jenny is bright.
Uh,

290
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:13.920
George Clooney wouldn't be very popular.
Women's vote

291
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.650
smart as a whip.

292
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:18.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

293
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.810
<v 1>What does that tell you though?
If we need to go to celebrities,</v>

294
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:23.680
do you think maybe we're just in there in this,
that's what it is,

295
00:19:23.681 --> 00:19:27.530
is that's the internet.
That's the world we live in.

296
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.930
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like Georgia.
I'd vote for him.

297
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.060
But do you think we can get out of this,

298
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.240
this thing where they say a medical always comes through everything?

299
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.830
George will,
who's will come very anti.

300
00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:46.930
Trump believes we can find the way.
Again,

301
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.590
America is a way of finding a way.
I hope so.

302
00:19:51.591 --> 00:19:53.780
I hope I'm around to see it.
Um,

303
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.180
but right now,
and you know when in my early,

304
00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:03.830
I could name every Senator [inaudible] 10,
20 years ago.
Every shot.

305
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.060
Yeah.
And got Ya.
Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy were great friends,

306
00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:11.000
sponsored bills together.
Hatch did his eulogy

307
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.900
that,
that wouldn't exist today.

308
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.633
<v 3>Okay.</v>

309
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.370
<v 1>That we have today.
The thing is so bad,</v>

310
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.500
when Obama nominated his guy for the Supreme Court,
I shouldn't forget his name.

311
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.520
Uh,
and they never brought it up.
Now of course it,
uh,
uh,

312
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.870
we'll get it.
We'll get it or not.
When,
when,
when,
when,

313
00:20:32.871 --> 00:20:37.550
when we nominate people like that who was pretty much middle of the road.

314
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.460
Oh,
garland.
Merrick.
Garland.
Garland.
Yeah.

315
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.110
If I were to Democrats now and they take the Senate,

316
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.620
I would hold up any appointment until they can have a president and first person

317
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:54.220
out of point would be married calling who deserve to be on that court.

318
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.380
<v 2>Yeah.
So this is just both of them playing politics to them.</v>

319
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.810
<v 1>But will we have a chance?
I,</v>

320
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:07.160
I don't see it coming.
You know when Merrick Garland was nominated,
for example,

321
00:21:07.161 --> 00:21:10.400
Orrin Hatch,
before he knew they would delay it,
said he's a great man

322
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.820
and then it becomes
party over country,

323
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.670
party over country.
Sad.
We'll let you think.
It's going to change.

324
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.310
<v 2>I think that the outrage machine that we're running on right now,</v>

325
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:29.470
I think it can only last for so long,

326
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:34.060
so I think it can either blow up into something much worse and I don't even know

327
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:34.871
what I mean by that,

328
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:38.440
but I think things would actually get much worse and some of this would actually

329
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:40.960
spill over into violence or what my hope is,

330
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.070
and I think this is the more a realistic option,

331
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.280
is that the outrage will start running out of steam,

332
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:52.250
like a car running out of gas and that from that somebody who,

333
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.850
whether it maybe if you're a Clooney or whoever else,

334
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:56.950
it is just such a decent human being,

335
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.060
a Bloomberg or something else will come back and decency will be appreciated

336
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.090
because I don't think this outrage thing can run forever.
It's too,

337
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:06.880
it's too mentally exhausting.
It's too,
it's physically,

338
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.990
<v 1>yeah.
Was a decent man.
I've known for years that Joe Biden,</v>

339
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.630
nobody dislikes him.
Wonderful father.
And a third is a great senator.
[inaudible]

340
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.780
great vice president.
If he were a little younger,

341
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.550
can you imagine he'd be,
what,
82 or something because she can't dislike them.

342
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.480
You want to be VP?
No,
I couldn't take the cut in pay.

343
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.250
<v 2>All right,
let's,
let's finish up with some big picture.
It's a big picture stuff.</v>

344
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.550
Looking back,
is there anything you would've done differently?

345
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:46.080
<v 1>The rear,
when I got married as much,
I would have gone national sooner.</v>

346
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:47.730
I had the talent,

347
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.600
but I was a big fish in a smaller pond in Miami and I liked that I'd radio

348
00:22:54.571 --> 00:22:57.750
television,
cop column in the Miami Herald.
You know,

349
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.100
everybody knew me and Miami.
I never sent a tape to New York.
Right.

350
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.800
I should have.

351
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.910
I would have liked to have gone national sooner just just to have more success.

352
00:23:08.911 --> 00:23:12.540
Earlier you had to appeal to more people because I had something,

353
00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:13.590
I knew I was good.

354
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.860
I knew I was good at what I did and I,

355
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.220
I didn't really get well known till my fifties and I think it could have

356
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:27.030
happened in the thirties I'm not any better than I was in the thirties I'm not

357
00:23:27.031 --> 00:23:31.170
better today than I was when I was in my late twenties I was all see,

358
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.460
I always was curious.

359
00:23:32.461 --> 00:23:35.790
I always let my ego at the door or was there short questions,

360
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.330
always got really interested in the guests.
That never changed.

361
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.400
Sometimes someone will play me a tape that they had for 30 years ago,

362
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.960
stole me.
Yeah,
I'm still,
they're still asking questions.

363
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.770
<v 2>I think the first time I interviewed you,</v>

364
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:54.920
I asked you something about the ego component relative to,

365
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.860
to interviewing and your answer.
I loved it and I,

366
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.830
I've really tried to incorporate it in what I do,
which is,

367
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:04.550
you said the show was called Larry King tonight.
My ego was already stroke.

368
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.730
<v 1>Yeah,
I'll be there tomorrow.
My motto,
it's a good model.
David could be,</v>

369
00:24:08.731 --> 00:24:13.290
your motto could be anybody's model.
If Donald Trump had this model,

370
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.260
we would be a better country.
This is my model.

371
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.470
I never learned anything when I was talking.
Think about it.

372
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.640
I never learned anything when I was talking.

373
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.930
Now I may impart things to people.
I may pick some knowledge,

374
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.980
but I am what I'm doing.
Anything

375
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.613
<v 3>when I'm talking,</v>

376
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.910
<v 2>it feels like a privilege in a way,
right?</v>

377
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:41.000
When you have somebody great across from you and you get the damn was this,

378
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:42.890
I'm telling you,
this hour of my life is a privilege.

379
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.580
<v 1>Oh,
to be on the Rubin report.
To be part of what?
By the way,</v>

380
00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:50.760
since is a report,
do I get a grade?

381
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.330
<v 2>You will be graded at the,
Oh,
trust me,</v>

382
00:24:52.331 --> 00:24:55.800
the youtube commentors they're going when we get youtube comments as they're

383
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.930
going to see.
I don't have the will with all the hottie Larry King.

384
00:24:58.931 --> 00:25:02.260
That is the last thing I wanted to impart on you.
All right,
final question.

385
00:25:02.261 --> 00:25:05.740
Here we go.
What's it all about?
I've asked you this.

386
00:25:05.741 --> 00:25:09.490
I've asked you some version of this many times every day,
my friend.

387
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.040
What's it all about and what does it all mean?

388
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:17.870
<v 1>What does it mean
a hundred years from today?
Who's going to care?</v>

389
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.153
Right?

390
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.700
John Lowenstein once hit a grand slam home run for the Orioles to beat the

391
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:30.440
Yankees,
and it was crowd went crazy.
Someone said,
John,

392
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:32.000
how does it feel?
And he said,

393
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.600
100 million Chinese don't give a damn.

394
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.050
What does it all mean?
The answer is I don't know.

395
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.360
<v 2>All right,
my friend.
Well,</v>

396
00:25:45.361 --> 00:25:48.210
despite the fact that you did not wear suspenders today,

397
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.480
<v 1>I did not.
I want it to be totally casual with you.</v>

398
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.620
<v 2>This true.
This is what it's about.
What I,
what we just did for the last hour.</v>

399
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.450
Thank you David.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
And thank you for the milkshake.
Alright,

400
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.520
you guys can check out Larry on Aura TV and follow him on Twitter acting things.
