00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.790
A wallet that looks like a matchbook and edible
spray paint.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.820
It's episode 21 of LÜT.
The mince that come in this spam tin actually

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.910
taste like cinnamon, but this lip balm tastes
like Lucky Charms.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.050
Question.
What's warmer than a sweater and a mug of

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.940
hot chocolate?
Answer: a mug wearing a sweater.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.109
Keep your hands equally warm with predator
and pray mittens.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.549
One hand's a cat, the other's a dog.
One's a frog, one's fly.

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:32.349
One's an owl and other is a mouse.
Or, use Tatchies.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.469
They let you get touchy with your touchscreen
without removing your gloves.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.160
Of course, all of these gloves will cover
up your awesome ring with the stone set upside

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.380
down, making it a "Killer Ring."
Or this ring with a hidden diamond.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.399
Generate also has synthetic leather bags that
look like envelopes, wing rings and shirts

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.919
with special stripes you can wipe your glasses
with.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.359
But let's talk about moulds that make your
cookies into moustaches.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.460
Or, these cupcake pillows.
A giant ice cream sandwich pillow is also

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.549
fun and barbed wire toilet paper is mainly
just scary.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.400
Kisses are better, but hey, this bath towel
makes it look like you're wearing a kilt.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.980
So let's talk high fashion and cover funny hats.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.460
Stupid.com also offers this tiny peace sign
hat for your little dog, and of course a hat

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
that looks like underwear.
Does this guy even know that his hat is funny?

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.270
I also like their hands waving USA flags hat.
Keep things patriotic with these flag pants.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.049
Betabrand also carries these dress pants that
are actually sweatpants.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.990
Now, if you've mainly made history wearing
shirts, use Urban Outfitters' t-shirt frames

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.090
to preserve those memories.
Or design your own on this t-shirt design

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.040
notepad.
Also a good option - this note-pad.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.809
Then toast your good taste with some bacon-flavored
soda, perfect for washing down a giant burrito.

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:57.349
Just kidding.
It's a protective wrap for valuable camera

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.700
lenses.
Improve your view with Generate's skyline

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.210
blinds and improve your bathroom with this
real aquarium sink - a perfect companion to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.250
the iPoop toilet.
Your iPhone will be fine if you drop it in,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.500
because you've waterproofed it with Liquipel.
Or, you're busy looking like an executive

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.830
with the iPhone handset converter.
Now these puzzles are shaped like donuts,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.710
pizza or coffee, but the world record holding
largest puzzle can be yours.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.000
It has more than 32,000 pieces and weighs
over 37 pounds.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.770
For a more dare devilish challenge, play Russian
Roulette with water balloons.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.610
You never when the gun will pierce the balloon.
But for a sweeter challenge, Bite The Bullet

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.200
gives you a dozen delicious chocolates shaped
like bullets, except one contains a hidden

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.260
dangerously hot pepper.
Good luck.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.760
If your sweet tooth also likes blink, pick
up some twinkles.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.520
Dental jewellery made with a special adhesive
that only lets go when you want to remove

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.220
it.
Clean the rest of your teeth with some floss

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.310
you pulled out of a dog's butt and clean your
body with tetromino shaped soap, behind your

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.200
Facebook-styled shower curtain.
Then, decorate your hair with these comic-inspired

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.920
headbands and show it all off in front of
the paparazzi that you hired.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.580
For an hour, at $100 a photographer, this
company will send paparazzi to harass you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.360
and make you look famous no matter who you are.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.400
If you get a boo-boo during the whole process,
be sure you're caught wearing a brandage.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.700
Question.
Can you identify which characters these eyes

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.440
belong to?
Well, they're sonic.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.340
You can play on the site or you can grab the
picture as an art print.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.760
Speaking of posters, here's a map of the world
made with what makes it go round.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.200
Moustaches.
And here's a fictional map made out of places

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.640
made famous in songs.
Just take the "Highway to Hell" after "Heartbreak

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.540
Hotel" and picnic in "Itchycoo Park."
This artist on Etsy will make an incredible

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.210
custom stamp that actually looks just like you.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.410
Now, separate salt and pepper shakers are
fine, but Fred makes this Switch - pick what

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.000
you want and shake.
Your earbuds can be superheroes and your ears

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.130
can also delight in wearing some handmade
Calvin and Hobbes earrings.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.400
If Hobbes means something more philosophical
to you, pick up a Hobbes mug.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.980
Now, how about a free thing?
Try Night Soil.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.640
This is the word for human poop that you steal
from outhouses and the trains and cesspools

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.950
at night in order to use us as free fertiliser
on your crops.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.910
It's a bad idea.
Don't do it.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.320
Compose that stuff first, come on.
But seriously, here are some great iPhone

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.030
backgrounds that you can get for free from
a great LÜT site.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.780
A Rhombicuboctahedron has 26 faces, which
is also the number of years old I'm turning

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.360
today.
That's right.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.740
It's my birthday and you're all invited to
the party.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.700
Consider the comment section the party...

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.780
And as always,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.820
thanks for watching.
