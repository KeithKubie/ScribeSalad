SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:10.770
CARRIE LAURENO: Again, my
name is Carrie Laureno.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm the founder of the
Google Veterans Network.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.020
I'm so happy to be here
tonight, with Sebastian Junger,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.590
with Guillermo Cervera,
and Brendan O'Byrne,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.940
who we just saw in
this incredible film,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.920
"The Last Patrol."

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.350
Again, wonderful to be
here with all of you

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.590
friends from Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.492
of America, Student Veterans
of America, Team Rubicon, Team

00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:34.200
Red, White, and Blue,
Veterans Advantage,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.360
and the US Military Academy
at West Point, as well as many

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.710
Googlers as well who
are in this audience.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.520
It was an incredible
film, Sebastian.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.290
I've seen all three
of your films.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.200
And when I watched "Restrepo"--
and we screened it on this very

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.680
stage-- for those of us who
haven't served in the military,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.540
we were able to experience
what it meant to go to war.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.850
"Korengal" gives
you a feeling of why

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.550
it's so hard to
leave that behind.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.331
And now, with "The
Last Patrol," you're

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.830
giving us an
opportunity to see what

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.090
it feels like to come home
and reconnect with America.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.460
And I want to thank
you for letting

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.620
us come on this journey with
you of your own transition.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.360
And it's very clear to
all of us in this room,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.520
and those watching, that
the transition process

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.070
for those leaving combat,
and combat reporting,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.992
or combat in general,
is a very difficult one.

00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:29.450
That people have
great expectations

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.790
when they come home.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.400
And sometimes those
expectations aren't met.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.240
I have to say my favorite
character was Daisy,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.220
far and away.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.710
No offense to you guys.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.090
At Google, you're
allowed to bring your dog

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.030
to work every day.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.320
And we thought last night
about inviting Daisy.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.290
And that would have been fun.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.790
Maybe we'll do
that another time.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.970
But she did a great job.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.212
Loved her camera work.

00:01:57.212 --> 00:01:57.920
What did you say?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.030
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: She was
our best camerawoman.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.640
CARRIE LAURENO: I was
just going to say,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.850
she was an excellent
camerawoman.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.370
She did a fantastic job.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.078
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
She's getting more work

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:05.670
than I am right now, actually.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.410
CARRIE LAURENO: So I took
away some really big themes

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.520
from all of this-- combat,
America, fathers, the influence

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.970
and the impact of
your relationships

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.042
with them, addiction of
different kinds, manhood.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.000
There's some really,
really big powerful themes

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.440
that stood out for me.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.940
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: You forgot
how to cook in your car engine.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.290
CARRIE LAURENO: That's right.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.860
I want that cookbooks.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.770
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: It's
called "Manifold Destiny."

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.707
No, it's not a joke.

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:37.040
It is called "Manifold Destiny."

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.030
I tracked it down.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.216
It was a classic from the '70s.

00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:42.340
CARRIE LAURENO: Oh my gosh.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.798
I feel like we
should get everybody

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:46.192
in this audience a copy of that.

00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:47.650
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
Imagine the sales.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.720
I mean, they just haven't
been sold for years.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.257
And then all of a sudden,
200 copies get sold off.

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.590
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: You can get
them on Amazon, seriously.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.870
CARRIE LAURENO: OK.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.420
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: For real.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.050
CARRIE LAURENO:
"Manifold Destiny."

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.591
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
"Manifold Destiny."

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:00.109
CARRIE LAURENO: OK.

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.650
So of all of those
themes-- and there

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.700
are many others that
I didn't mention--

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.790
I want to talk about
purpose, and what

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.450
your purpose was in doing this.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.020
Clearly, you had a goal
to reconnect with America,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.630
and to decompress after war.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.160
But why did you really do this?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.950
Such an interesting idea.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.360
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Originally,
when I first had the idea,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.080
was going to do it with Tim.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.440
And it was going to be a
way to show Tim America

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.950
and for me to understand
America in a new way.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.110
If you make yourself
vulnerable and marginal,

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.920
you have a very different
relationship with a place

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.930
than if you're just
driving through it.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.030
And you're very marginal
and vulnerable if you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.840
don't have a place
to sleep at night.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.760
I mean, really, if you want
to experience being marginal,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.730
just walk out your front door,
and don't come back at night.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.710
Spend one night out.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.710
Find a place to curl up.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.180
And come back in the morning.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.970
And you'll experience
what it is to be

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.190
a vulnerable person
in this society.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.235
And you'll feel
vulnerable no matter

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:06.860
how much you have in
your bank account.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.440
You just do that, you'll get it.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.530
And I wanted to experience
America little bit like that.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.580
And I thought the railroad
lines would provide us

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.360
this sort of view from
the inside out in America.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.970
Highways go around
towns or whatever.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.720
Railroad lines go straight
through the middle.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.170
So that was originally
what I wanted to do.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.270
And then Tim died.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.620
And so I had this whole
thing was struggling with.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.190
And I got to know Guillermo
because of Tim's death.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.860
And we're great friends.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.990
Really, really close.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.810
But I wouldn't have met him
otherwise, I don't think.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.510
And Brendan and Dave I knew, Tim
and I knew, from Afghanistan.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.530
I just said, OK.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.970
Here's four guys who've
been in a lot of combat.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.120
We're not going to
go back to war again.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.170
And maybe we could also
have this long conversation.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.030
It just seemed like a way
to-- I needed a change.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.980
I was 50 years old.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.730
A lot had happened in my life
in the previous few years.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.690
I really needed a change.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.150
And I just thought if I put
myself in an extreme place--

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.810
but with people that I really
trusted and was connected

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.520
to-- that's how you change.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.981
CARRIE LAURENO: And Guillermo,
why did you agree to go?

00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:19.480
GUILLERMO CERVERA:
At the beginning,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.100
when we were
walking, I would use

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.560
to say, Sebastian, I
don't see this story.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.190
I don't understand why
we have to do this.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.640
I was very tired every day.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.820
I didn't like to sleep outside.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.990
So I kept going.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.406
CARRIE LAURENO: We know what
you think of the Army poncho.

00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:39.382
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
Most Army products.

00:05:39.382 --> 00:05:40.720
CARRIE LAURENO: That's real?

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.601
GUILLERMO CERVERA:
They are very bad.

00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:46.070
They're supposed to be
impermeable, but they are not.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.830
Yeah.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.250
And when we kept
going and going,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.900
and I was just going because it
was a great opportunity for me

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.820
to photograph America
and be in the movie.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.120
So I kept on going.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.540
But I kept on saying, Sebastian,
I don't see the story.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.560
But after a while,
I start to see.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.950
And to see was something more
than being there photographing

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.770
in the project.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.130
Was more about my inside.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.540
What I was experiences.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.960
And dealing with three guys.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.820
I didn't know them.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.430
And they have kind of the
same problem that I have.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.770
That's what made me more
touched with the film.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.087
And after all, I learn a lot.

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:42.420
CARRIE LAURENO: And Brendan,
it sounds like you liked it

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.830
so much that it was
hard for you to leave.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.140
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.740
I was going through a really
rough time in my life, also.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.720
It was really me
breaking up all my wife,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.152
was the starts of that.

00:06:57.152 --> 00:07:00.100
I was in bad in drinking.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.000
I was drinking a lot.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.410
And all those things.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.270
It was really nice to
get away from all that.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.590
When staying at my house,
I couldn't stop myself

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.432
from drinking.

00:07:10.432 --> 00:07:12.890
But being in the middle of the
woods, I couldn't get booze.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.080
So that was like sure way
of not drinking for a week.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.850
And that's what I did.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.990
And also, my wife
wasn't there, so that's

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.789
why I really loved it.

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:26.580
CARRIE LAURENO: OK.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.392
It wasn't actually about combat.

00:07:29.392 --> 00:07:31.100
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: I
wasn't trying to heal.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.900
CARRIE LAURENO:
Different kind of combat.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.890
Got it.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.010
So on this journey,
it seemed like you all

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.680
met some really
interesting characters.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.710
And really, like a slice
of America that most of us

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.970
don't see all of the time.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.340
And I wonder what it felt
like to see that, especially

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.750
for Brendan, after being
in combat and coming home,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.450
and the people on whose
behalf you served.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.440
Seeing them, hearing what
they had to say about America.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.040
What was that experience like?

00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:07.130
Meeting people who
are so disconnected

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.730
from the experience that
you went through in the war.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.150
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.540
Meeting America
was great for me,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.970
because it really showed me
what I fought for, really.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.600
And it's really sad to see what
state our country's actually

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.450
in.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.460
There's a lot upset.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.560
A lot of poverty, a lot of drug
abuse, a lot of alcoholism.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.780
And it was sort
of sobering to see

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.179
that that's the place I was
fighting for is doing really

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.980
poorly in some places.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.760
So it was really good to
get to see that, and say,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.380
all right, well,
now there's a battle

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.130
here at home, also,
that I could fight.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.660
And the disconnect is going
to happen no matter what,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.540
because there's only 1%
of our country that's

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.330
fighting in the military.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.690
So I understood that
disconnect was going to happen.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.160
So that didn't bother
me as much as it really

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.970
bothered me to see how many
people are living in poverty--

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.100
and living, actually,
probably, worse off

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.800
than I was in
Afghanistan, in many ways.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.830
What really surprised
me was the fact

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.200
that when we were walking
through the bad parts,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.770
quote unquote, the
bad parts of towns,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.040
was where we actually
got the most help.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.000
Was where we got the
most support from people.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.880
It wasn't in richer,
upper-class areas.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.320
They didn't want to help us.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.850
But that the people that
were low on the totem

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.330
pole, the people that were
really just trying to survive,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.110
they wanted to help us.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.940
And that says a lot
to me about community.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.900
Community's still alive
in those small groups,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.910
in those places of poverty.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.710
And it's not alive in places
like upper-class, middle-class

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:55.210
areas.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.910
It's just not alive there.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.810
And that surprised
me, because I thought

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.984
it was going to be the opposite.

00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:03.400
CARRIE LAURENO:
And Guillermo, I'm

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.399
really curious to hear
your opinions about that.

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:06.771
You're originally from Spain.

00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:08.770
And you've lived here off
and on for many years.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.200
And you've been around
the globe a few times.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.050
From the perspective of
someone who isn't American,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.840
having the chance to walk
the railways with two

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.510
Americans or three Americans
and seeing what you saw,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.870
it seemed like there is
an equal amount of pride

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.190
that these folks felt, as well
as a great degree of sadness

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.460
that came through.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.040
And I'm curious, as
someone who isn't American,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.710
what your impression was about
the state of our country.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.800
GUILLERMO CERVERA: Well,
America is just fascinate me,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.260
because it has a
lot of weird things.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.120
And I like them to photograph.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.020
But also rejects me.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:55.360
I see a lot of the people
insane, and a lot of problems

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.950
that we don't see when we are
in Europe looking at the movies

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.380
from America.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.140
And I had that feeling
like the people

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.240
is really-- when you walk
around, you see a lot of pain,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.940
a lot of pain in faces.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.730
And that happens everywhere.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:20.050
Everywhere you see that problem,
because it's a human problem.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.450
I see it in
Afghanistan, everywhere.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.390
But the difference, I feel,
is like in other countries,

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.750
people help each other more.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.560
And here you see a
lot of individuality

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.570
and a lot of loneliness.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.400
That makes the problem bigger.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.462
And that's my feeling.

00:11:38.462 --> 00:11:40.795
CARRIE LAURENO: And that's
something you've seen before?

00:11:40.795 --> 00:11:43.070
Or this trip brought
that to life for you?

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.445
GUILLERMO CERVERA:
Well, I saw it

00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:46.820
before when I came here
when I was in college.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.820
I came two or three
years for study.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.640
And I live upstate
in New York, in Troy.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.492
And there's a lot of
people insane there.

00:11:56.492 --> 00:11:57.450
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.280
I'm writing an
article about PTSD

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.614
right now for "Vanity Fair."

00:12:03.614 --> 00:12:04.780
And I just heard about this.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.770
They had a really-- I
had this sort of idea

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:13.810
that one of the things
that's hard for combat vets

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:18.872
to come back to is the
alienation of society.

00:12:18.872 --> 00:12:20.580
I mean, if you're in
a platoon in combat,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.410
you're never further
way then a few feet

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.830
from another person for a year.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.546
In a very, very close,
intense, human experience.

00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:30.170
And then you come
back to this society,

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:35.760
and it's much more spread
out, and often alone, right?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.770
So that maybe the problem
with combat trauma

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.070
isn't the combat
trauma, it's that people

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.720
are trying to heal
by themselves.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.650
And individual
therapy, and whatever.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.480
The community experience
is lacking here.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.040
So I've been talking
to people about that.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.830
They did an experiment
with lab mice.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.320
And you can
traumatize a lab mouse

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.260
and give it traumatic
stress, right?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.240
You can give it PTSD,
just like humans.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:13.790
And those of trauma, you can
keep those going indefinitely

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.194
if you keep startling
the mouse, right?

00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:18.110
Loud noises, whatever.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.440
You can keep those symptoms
going after the trauma.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.530
But only if the
mouse is by itself.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.130
If you put that mouse back
in a community of my mice,

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.810
no matter what you do, you
cannot keep those trauma

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.770
symptoms at the same level.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.230
They decline.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.620
I think when you
talk about people

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.540
being in pain in this
country, and alone, I

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.380
think he's really right.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.720
I think there's a
lot of pain here.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.630
And it comes from a
sort of basic loneliness

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.820
that a lot of people
feel in suburban--

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.320
I grew up in the suburbs, the
loneliest place in the world,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.824
I think.

00:13:55.824 --> 00:13:57.490
CARRIE LAURENO: I
can't wait to read it.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.656
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:01.460
CARRIE LAURENO:
It's interesting.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.168
Some of the veteran
service organizations

00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:05.770
that we partner with here at
Google-- like a Team Rubicon

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.910
or a Team Red, White, and
Blue-- those organizations

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.574
get people out into the field.

00:14:10.574 --> 00:14:12.740
And I believe there's was
a article written recently

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.040
on task and purpose
about how being downrange

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.120
together, having
that camaraderie,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.240
is something that these
organizations are trying

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.570
to foster for veterans who
are coming back from these two

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.070
wars.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.700
And it seems very similar
to the environment

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.859
that you were replicating
on this patrol.

00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:32.650
That's interesting.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.500
What, specifically,
looking back on it now,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.772
was similar about
the patrol and war?

00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:43.730
There was a couple things
that stood out to me.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.801
And I remember at one
point in the film,

00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:48.800
you are looking out--
maybe through binoculars--

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.490
you were looking out for
cops who were far away.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.200
And it was almost like they
were the enemy in the situation.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.229
And you were trying to--

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:56.270
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Almost?

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.342
CARRIE LAURENO: Almost.

00:14:57.342 --> 00:14:59.050
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: They
weren't the enemy.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.620
But they were
definitely a challenge.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.940
CARRIE LAURENO: No, I
remember watching "Restrepo"

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.870
and thinking, oh, this is like.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.515
You're looking way
out for the Taliban.

00:15:05.515 --> 00:15:06.390
Where are these guys?

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.480
And you're doing the same thing.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.250
You're taking cover from
trains that are going by.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.624
You're taking
cover from bullets.

00:15:10.624 --> 00:15:15.280
And it felt similar without
the lens of combat there.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.260
What, for you guys, was most
similar about the experience?

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.269
GUILLERMO CERVERA: I
didn't find any similarity.

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:23.060
CARRIE LAURENO: No?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.940
GUILLERMO CERVERA: The only
thing I felt is, as I told you

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.230
before, after a few
trips in the patrol,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.810
I felt like coming back
to see these guys to spend

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.150
more time with them.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.070
Because I felt good.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.500
And that's kind of the feeling
when you go through a war,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.890
and you are with
friends-- journalists,

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.220
in my case-- you feel good,
because you help each other.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.580
And you are that
kind of situation.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.560
For me that was the similarity.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.840
Maybe for them was
something different.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.756
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:15:54.756 --> 00:16:00.570
For me, it's the
idea that in society,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.300
like Sebastian was saying,
it's a group of I's.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.460
Everyone is I, me.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:10.130
Inside combat, I only used I
and me was when I fucked up.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.880
When it was my fault.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.475
Hey, my bad.

00:16:13.475 --> 00:16:14.800
That was my fault.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.500
And the rest of the
time, we used we,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.410
because that was what we were.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:24.190
And inside of the patrol,
we had to do the same thing.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.880
We had to leave the I
at home, and use the we.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.040
And you could see it.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.300
One of the times Guillermo was
having a hard time walking,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.280
and it was really hot.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.390
And Sebastian took his pack.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.090
I mean, those are the things
without even-- actually,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.030
demanded, give me your pack.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.680
So those are the things that
you don't see in society.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.370
I think there was
a homeless person,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.550
or there was someone, I
think, dead in the street?

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.040
I can't remember the exact
story in New York City.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.089
And there was like a few hundred
people that passed by him

00:16:58.089 --> 00:16:59.130
and didn't even help him.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.080
And they didn't know
he was dead or dying.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.780
And that says a lot.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.200
That's lonely, When people
are walking past you

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.440
and you're dying, and
they don't help you.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.930
In combat, that doesn't happen.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.089
So the similarities were
that we were all there,

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.440
and we are all supporting
each other in every way.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.369
And we got shot at one time,
which was sort of similar.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:27.180
But it wasn't very accurate, so.

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:31.200
CARRIE LAURENO: I'm sure
there are a lot of people here

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.991
who have questions.

00:17:31.991 --> 00:17:34.310
We have some mics
out in the audience.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.550
It would be great if
anybody has a question,

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.060
if we could bring a
mic over to those folks

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.610
so that their
questions are audible.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.612
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:17:44.612 --> 00:17:47.169
Well, I have a question
about audience.

00:17:47.169 --> 00:17:48.210
And I've seen "Restrepo."

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.293
I haven't seen "Korengal."

00:17:49.293 --> 00:17:51.210
But "Restrepo"
seemed like a film

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.670
that was designed
to educate the 99%

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.210
to see what that's really like.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.120
Here, though, the
reason I ask this

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.407
is because one of
the significant

00:18:01.407 --> 00:18:03.490
challenges a veteran deals
with when he comes home

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.849
is that trust situation.

00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:07.390
The ability to trust someone
who hasn't been there with them.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.510
And I happen to work a lot with
veterans and experience that.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.230
And yet while this is still
educational for civilians,

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.250
there seems to be
another-- I'm wondering

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.130
how important the military,
the veteran audience is.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.320
Because on the one
hand, these may

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.820
be soldiers that
are like that, that

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.490
don't want to talk to anyone.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.960
But yet, although
you've been shot

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.270
at quite a bit and lost
one of your best friends,

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.520
you are a civilian.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.910
As are you as well, Guillermo.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.700
And there are many stories
filtering through the film that

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.260
are all about
childhood traumas--

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.790
the dog getting killed.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.000
Your example, the mice.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.880
Trauma, in many
cases, feels the same.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.580
And I wonder how intentional
and how important

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.360
the audience of a veteran is
for you, in the sense that they

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.440
can come back and relate
to people in that way,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.480
in terms of empathy
and the universality

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.580
of post-traumatic stress.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.322
And I wonder if that's a helpful
starting point for a veteran.

00:18:59.322 --> 00:19:00.280
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.080
I absolutely had veterans
in mind making this film.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.030
Not exclusively.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.870
But absolutely had
veterans in mind.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:15.060
I thought of it as an example
of collaboration and closeness,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.950
but back home.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.210
So you can do it here, too.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.580
And the consequences are
almost certainly not fatal.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.970
So that's a good thing.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.260
But you do get a lot
of the same closeness.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.970
And so, absolutely, I
thought about veterans.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.530
But in some ways,
I thought civilians

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:39.000
could learn about
veterans with this film.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.622
Soldiers could learn
about journalists.

00:19:41.622 --> 00:19:42.330
I'm a journalist.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.420
Guillermo's a journalist.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.190
It's all men.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.910
I feel like women
can watch this film

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.417
and learn something about men.

00:19:50.417 --> 00:19:51.750
CARRIE LAURENO: I learned a lot.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.090
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Did you?

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.960
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Unfortunate
truths about men?

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.918
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.690
Yeah.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.280
The sexes are bizarre and
frustrating to each other.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.910
And here there's four
men talking pretty openly

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.080
about everything, including
about their feelings

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:06.880
about women.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.330
Just seemed like that
might be interesting.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:17.650
And it would allow veterans
to learn about America.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.380
Among other things, we're
walking through America.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:26.660
And it's a much weirder
country than I quite realized.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.690
We all live in our communities
and we know those communities,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.190
but until you walk
through other communities,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.740
you can drive through--
sorry, it's not the same.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.890
If you walk through,
and you have

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.100
to find a place to
sleep that night,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.710
and you have to
engage with people,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.270
you really get to
know where you are.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.980
And as Brendan was
saying, the communities

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.990
that were the most
intimidating to me absolutely

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.157
were the most welcoming.

00:20:51.157 --> 00:20:53.240
And the ones where we
actually really had problems

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.031
were the wealthy
communities, like the kind

00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:56.500
of town I grew up in.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.207
Actually a really
interesting experience.

00:21:00.207 --> 00:21:01.540
CARRIE LAURENO: Other questions?

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.210
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.590
So Sebastian and
Brendan, we kind of

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.020
share a brother--
Tanner Steester.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.360
I went to basic
training with that guy.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.840
He the forward
observer that guys

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:23.030
might know from his first movie.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.640
And really, my
question is what's it

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.820
like to be journalist--
a civilian-- let

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.930
into that circle?

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.520
Into that brotherhood?

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.410
Because I say every day I'm
a student veteran leader.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.880
And I tell people all the
time, look, we're all brothers.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.314
We're all sisters.

00:21:41.314 --> 00:21:42.980
Once you served in
the military, doesn't

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.026
matter if you're in
uniform or if you're out.

00:21:45.026 --> 00:21:47.400
If you deployed, if you didn't
deploy, it doesn't matter.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.720
Once you raise your right hand
to serve, you're my brother.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.060
And Sebastian, we've
never met before,

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.176
but after seeing your
films and knowing

00:21:57.176 --> 00:21:58.550
who you're connected
with, I feel

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.552
like you're part of that circle.

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:01.760
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Absolutely.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.340
AUDIENCE: What's it
like to get into that?

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:10.301
And have that unique perspective
as far as a civilian goes?

00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:12.300
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Well,
you know, I-- thank you,

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.060
first of all.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.660
I think in any group, the
amount that you're allowed in

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.270
is connected to the amount
that you're willing to give.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.190
If you're in a group you
don't know very well,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.009
you're not really part of it.

00:22:29.009 --> 00:22:31.550
And you're probably not willing
to give very much of yourself

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.950
up for it, right?

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.944
But as you get close
to people-- as you

00:22:34.944 --> 00:22:36.610
learn to connect to
them, you love them,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.410
you're worried about
them, whatever--

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.710
the amount of yourself that
you're giving out rises.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.280
And likewise in the
other direction,

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.050
that connection rises also.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.290
And so by the end
of the deployment

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:55.240
that I covered with
Tim-- before the end,

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.095
but as it went by--
I felt completely

00:22:58.095 --> 00:22:58.970
part of that platoon.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.340
And I think they thought
of me that way, too.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.850
And one of the
things that I really

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.670
liked about the patrol,
the last patrol,

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.810
was that we kind of did
that with each other.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.080
And I think we all had to
learn to think about the group

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.490
more than about how we
individually were feeling.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.670
So when I took
Guillermo's pack, I

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.936
was sort of putting
him ahead of me.

00:23:26.936 --> 00:23:28.560
And I know that in
another circumstance

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.910
he would have done that for me.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.130
And once you're in that
kind of relationship

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.360
with a number of other
people, you're home free.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.500
That's, I think, where
we all want to be.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.350
And I think in
this society, it's

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:47.774
hard to find circumstances that
require that or even permit it.

00:23:47.774 --> 00:23:49.190
I'd like to ask
you, though-- have

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.861
you been embedded with
US forces in Iraq?

00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:54.110
GUILLERMO CERVERA: Yes, I was.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.151
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I'd love
to know what-- I mean,

00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:57.710
I'm an American with
American forces.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.930
As a foreigner with
American forces,

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.067
how did you feel with them?

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:04.150
How did they think of you?

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.050
I'm just curious.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.100
What was your experience?

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.070
GUILLERMO CERVERA: I think
the beginning is hard,

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.890
because they don't know you.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.220
And it's hard for
them to trust you.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.190
But at the end is very
similar than being

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.420
embed with the Afghans
in this example.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.150
At the end, all make a group.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.310
They accept you.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.390
And they treat you really well.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:26.270
And they protect you.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.770
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Great.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.170
GUILLERMO CERVERA: And I think
it's more a matter of humanity.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.320
They take care of
each other as a group.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.150
As the thing that happen
with us in patrol.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:44.830
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Guillermo, did
they pull pranks on you, also?

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.320
Because we harassed Sebastian
quite a bit out there.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.970
And that's when
we really told him

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.386
that he was part
of the group, was

00:24:51.386 --> 00:24:54.210
where we started pulling
really bad pranks on him.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.210
We found out he was
afraid of spiders, so.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:58.960
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: If
you're ever embedded,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.852
don't tell them you're
scared of spiders.

00:25:00.852 --> 00:25:02.060
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Or anything.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.845
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Or scared
of anything, for that matter.

00:25:03.845 --> 00:25:05.660
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Or
your mother's name.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.600
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Or
your mother's name.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.380
Definitely not
your sister's name.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.830
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
Important information.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.127
Write it down.

00:25:15.127 --> 00:25:16.460
CARRIE LAURENO: Other questions?

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.500
This side of the room.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.900
Do we have mics over here?

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.740
AUDIENCE: I got you right here.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.990
I actually have two questions.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.496
First question is how's Dave?

00:25:22.496 --> 00:25:23.620
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: He's good.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.604
I think he's over-- No,

00:25:24.604 --> 00:25:25.770
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: He's back.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:26.330
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: He's back.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.700
AUDIENCE: He's back now.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.100
Good.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.350
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I can
answer that real quickly, just

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.130
add to that.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.350
He went over with
a private outfit,

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.080
but working with the military.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.580
And then he finally
came back again.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.980
I just sent him an email
and said, hey, man.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.400
How you doing?

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.191
What are you up to?

00:25:38.191 --> 00:25:41.350
And he said he just got a
place in central Wisconsin.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.250
Way out in the
woods, like 80 acres.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.960
And he said he's been splitting
wood and hunting a lot.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.670
And so, like, OK,
you're probably good.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.690
AUDIENCE: That sounds good.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.190
awesome.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.690
OK.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:56.800
So second question.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.040
And this one kind of hits
me both from "Restrepo"

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.330
and from "The Last Patrol."

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.280
For me personally, in
the same situation--

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.390
and for a lot of folks that I
know in my current position who

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.590
haven't been in that
same situation-- for me,

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.142
it's all about control.

00:26:11.142 --> 00:26:13.600
When you're with your friends
and you're with your brothers

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.817
and sisters, you don't have
to worry about yourself.

00:26:16.817 --> 00:26:18.400
Somebody's got your
back all the time.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.817
Somebody's telling
you what to do.

00:26:19.817 --> 00:26:21.483
You're telling somebody
else what to do.

00:26:21.483 --> 00:26:22.960
And it's kind of
this big circle.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.324
But as soon as you get back,
you kind of lose all that.

00:26:25.324 --> 00:26:27.740
And you have to figure out how
to have control of yourself

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.530
again.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.710
And what I found
myself a lot is trying

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.499
to find somebody to
take control over me.

00:26:33.499 --> 00:26:34.290
Tell me what to do.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.880
Tell me where to go.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.625
And there's constant
inner struggle.

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:40.000
I want to take
control of myself.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.950
But also, I want
that same feeling

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.180
where when times are
tough, I want somebody

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.340
to tell me what to
do and where to go.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.650
And I got that same
feeling from both movies.

00:26:52.142 --> 00:26:53.100
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.850
I think, actually, strangely,
it's a really good feeling

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.800
to be in a group
where you have a job.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.350
Where you're being given
a job, sometimes, and told

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.950
to do something.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.730
Because it means that
a, you're trusted.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.940
But b, that you're also
being taken care of.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:15.630
Guillermo, you probably--
I was with Brendan and Dave

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.920
in Afghanistan in a platoon.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.690
But your experience more
has been a little bit more

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.250
independent, right?

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.800
So the patrol was probably
a little different for you

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.570
in terms of cooperating
with some other people.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.670
So what was that transit?

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.080
Did you resist, if I told
you, go do something,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.870
did you resist it at first?

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.323
Was there a transition
where you accepted that?

00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:37.666
GUILLERMO CERVERA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:38.166
Yeah.

00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:40.639
At the beginning I didn't
want to help anyone.

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:42.430
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I
noticed that, actually.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.553
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: No way!

00:27:43.553 --> 00:27:47.390
GUILLERMO CERVERA: I just
wanted to take pictures.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.100
I didn't have that experience
of being protected.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.760
When I travel around,
I am by myself.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.300
And no one protects me.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.820
It's kind of tricky.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.190
So for me, being in the patrol
was completely different.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.820
I was protected by three guys.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.120
And I felt like nothing.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.860
I don't have anything to do.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.555
Just being here
and take pictures.

00:28:09.555 --> 00:28:12.160
It was great.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.420
It was a great feeling.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.950
Because at the
beginning I didn't

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:22.230
want to get involved in the
group, but after a while,

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.409
I learned how to be
involved with them.

00:28:26.409 --> 00:28:27.700
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: What changed?

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.070
Why did it change?

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.050
When did it change?

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:31.836
How did that work?

00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.710
GUILLERMO CERVERA:
Because if I don't change,

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.930
I have to keep fighting
all the time with my brain.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:41.920
And that's why I had to
change and just relax.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.650
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
How long did it take?

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.671
GUILLERMO CERVERA:
It took a while.

00:28:46.671 --> 00:28:47.170
Yeah.

00:28:49.537 --> 00:28:51.120
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: One
of things I found

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.300
is that when you're actually
giving of to a group,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.780
that feels really good.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.400
I think that's what-- Team
Rubicon, where are they at?

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.600
They do the same thing.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.110
They give back to America.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.380
And of course, that feels good.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.480
It feels really good.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.490
So finding something like
that to give back to,

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.960
even if it's not a
group of close friends,

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.590
even if it's your
country, that's

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:16.130
going to make you feel
really, really great.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.469
And I think that that's one
of the things that saved me.

00:29:18.469 --> 00:29:19.510
Because that's what I do.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:23.570
I try to give back as much as
I can to the veteran community.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.160
And that makes me feel
better about being alone

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.535
inside society.

00:29:28.535 --> 00:29:29.910
GUILLERMO CERVERA:
But I think it

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:34.400
says a lot about relationship
between men and women.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.180
That sometimes they
are keeping fighting,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.950
and they don't
relax, because they

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.900
want to keep in control
of their own lives.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.420
And not give the
control to the other.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.280
And I think that's
a thing in the movie

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.060
shows a lot about relations.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.690
CARRIE LAURENO: Brendan, I
want to really applaud you

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.247
for what you just said
about giving back.

00:29:59.247 --> 00:30:01.330
Because I think the most
important leadership role

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.350
that-- we don't know each
other all that well, but I feel

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.850
like I know you, because
you're a movie star.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:11.456
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: I've
never been in a movie.

00:30:11.456 --> 00:30:13.080
CARRIE LAURENO: But
I want to apply you

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.050
for being so open about sharing
your story and your experiences

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:18.770
having served in the military.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.780
The only way that
people like us,

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.380
who care about veterans at
Google and other companies,

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.330
are able to do our
jobs is because there

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.000
are people like you who are
willing to tell your story.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.240
And you're a really
expressive, soulful guy.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.170
And it makes all the difference
in setting a leadership example

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.590
for other veterans to be able
to follow in your footsteps

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.640
and share so that the
rest of us can learn.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.850
And we can heal as a community.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.540
Service members go home to
communities-- communities that

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.520
want to embrace them,
and don't know how.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.470
And it's not easy, as a
civilian, to go up to someone

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:52.970
and say, thank you
for your service.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.928
And I know you in particular
don't particularly

00:30:54.928 --> 00:30:57.140
like that phrase.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.840
But it's not easy for anybody.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.290
And the work that you're
doing is helping all of us.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.384
So I think we need to all
applaud this guy for that.

00:31:06.384 --> 00:31:08.368
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:13.210
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
Thank you very much.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.420
I think that when I
talk about my service,

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.860
I talk about we're
service members.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.200
We join the military to
serve our country, right?

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.860
So when we go to war, and when
we go to combat, the things

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.800
that we see and we do
there, they're not ours.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.890
They're not ours.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.800
They're our country's.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.790
So I really think
this is the only way

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.280
to come home, is to
share these stories.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.020
Because it is our
country's stories.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.050
It's not our stories.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.182
For veterans that are, oh,
you can't hear my story,

00:31:50.182 --> 00:31:51.890
because you won't
understand-- of course,

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.100
they're not going understand.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.400
They're not going to
understand until we speak up

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.170
and talk about this stuff.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.790
And once we start speaking
up and talk about this stuff,

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.950
our country's growing
up in two parts--

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.070
it's civilians and veterans.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.710
And if we don't bridge that
gap, if we don't somehow

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.450
bridge that gap-- 22 veterans
a day kill themselves.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.060
Why you think that is?

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.160
We have to bridge that gap.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.112
The only way to bridge that gap
is to be telling our stories.

00:32:19.112 --> 00:32:20.570
And telling our
stories accurately.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:27.128
Not patting ourselves on the
back like these Navy SEALs do.

00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:31.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.390
But just honestly.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.070
What we actually experienced.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.710
What we actually saw.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.680
The things that we experienced
over there is going to help.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.740
If we start talking to
civilians about these things,

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.290
it's going to help
the civilians,

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.360
and it's definitely
going to help us.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.752
So I put that out to
every veteran here,

00:32:51.752 --> 00:32:53.960
and every one that's going
to serve in the military--

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.100
tell your damn story.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.110
It's not yours.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.230
It's not yours.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.106
So open up.

00:33:00.106 --> 00:33:02.596
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:02.596 --> 00:33:05.584
CARRIE LAURENO: Awesome.

00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:07.580
We have a question over here.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.750
AUDIENCE: My first
question is for Sebastian.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.720
Did you remember to
brush your teeth today?

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.970
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: It's Vietnam.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.540
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
I did, actually.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:20.420
Special event, so.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.140
AUDIENCE: My real question.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.570
It's mentioned in
the documentary

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:29.870
that veterans who come home from
war that have personal issues

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.910
typically have those personal
issues prior to going to war.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.110
Do you think it's those
personal issues that

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.500
draw them to war to begin with?

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.360
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
That's a good question.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.160
I know it's been
studied, obviously.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.350
It's not absolute correlation.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:50.280
But one of the indicators of
combat trauma after combat

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.350
is if you've had personal trauma
in your life before combat.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.500
And there's some connection.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.350
Some connection.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.240
Which is really
important to understand.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.570
The Israeli military
has a PTSD rate of 1%.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.050
And one of the reasons--
there's a number of reasons.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.860
I think it's a more
cohesive community.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.400
Everyone serves.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.670
Everybody serves.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.550
You don't come back
and feel like an alien.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.049
You're coming back
to a society that

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:19.019
understands what you went
through, because everyone

00:34:19.019 --> 00:34:20.810
is involved in the
military to some degree.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:21.790
And it helps a lot.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.650
But also they screen.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:28.570
They screen for vulnerability
to combat trauma.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.360
And they keep people
who are vulnerable

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.837
because of prior trauma, they
keep them out of those units.

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:33.920
It's really, really smart.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.949
So yeah, I think actually
it's an important issue.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:45.540
And your first question actually
made me think of a quick story.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.429
At one point, we'd been on
the road for a good week.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:54.580
As you saw, we got pretty
dirty pretty quickly out there.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:58.380
And after like a week, we
were along the Juniata River.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.550
It was right before the
last scene in the film.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.730
And it was a nice,
warm April day.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:10.410
And I thought, oh, none of us
has touched a drop of water

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:11.910
for a whole week.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:16.680
Maybe let's bathe
before we end this trip.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.060
And I said, hey.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.050
I think I'm going to bathe.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.170
Jump in the river.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.450
Soap down.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.220
Rinse off.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.320
Feel good.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.860
And I said, who's got soap?

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.190
And we looked around.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.856
Four guys, right?

00:35:32.856 --> 00:35:34.480
We all know we're
going to be out there

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.220
for a good week in the woods.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.960
Not one of us even
thought to bring soap.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.900
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: And
that didn't actually

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.140
correct the problem later.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:45.390
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.000
The next trip, no one
brought soap, either.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.750
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Next
week we didn't-- No.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.857
CARRIE LAURENO: Other questions?

00:35:54.857 --> 00:35:55.690
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:56.840
Thanks for doing this.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.120
So I wanted to ask,
actually, about the folks

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.570
that you met along the way.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.820
It seemed to me that through
the first half the movie,

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.790
you were asking folks,
what's dividing us?

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.966
What's wrong with the
American identity right now?

00:36:10.966 --> 00:36:12.340
And then somewhere
along the way,

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.200
it switched to what do
you love about America?

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.570
Why those questions?

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.290
And more so, how
do those questions

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.720
connect to the veterans'
identity and the veterans'

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.522
narrative that you're trying
to punch through here?

00:36:27.522 --> 00:36:28.480
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.354
It's a good question.

00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:31.480
So what I was
thinking is that when

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.030
I was with those
guys in the Korengal,

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.140
they do something called
movement to contact.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.420
And they walk down a
valley in a patrol.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.210
And, basically,
contact would mean

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.960
talking to people who
were willing to talk

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.960
to them in the villages.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.500
Or, occasionally,
contact meant firefight.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.630
Right?

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.380
But when they were
able to talk to people,

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.270
basically, they'd
say, how are things?

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.470
How are you doing?

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.250
What's going on?

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.970
Do you need anything?

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:56.470
Whatever.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:58.910
That kind of assessment
of the needs of civilians.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.130
In a very, very poor place,
it's a smart thing to do.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.420
Hearts and minds, right?

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.555
A smart idea.

00:37:03.555 --> 00:37:05.680
And I don't know if they
got honest answers or not,

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.270
but it was a good idea.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.890
So I just thought, OK.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.020
The country's coming
out of two wars.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.930
Someone should do a movement
to contact in this country.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.530
And ask people,
how are you doing?

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.260
What do you need?

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.385
What are you worried about?

00:37:19.385 --> 00:37:23.020
The same kind of thing,
but in this country.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.650
It was a good idea.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:30.010
But the problem with it is that
I found that the answers wound

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:36.930
up being basically soundbites
that I'd heard in the media.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.810
We're turning into
a socialist country.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:43.650
Or we've drifted too far
away from God, or whatever.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.800
That's just not a
helpful analysis

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.320
of where we're at as a nation.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.010
And furthermore, you're
upset, but you're not

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.740
thinking with your own brain.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.850
You're borrowing someone else's
ideas and just repeating them.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.140
You're not really thinking.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.700
I'm asking you a real question,
and you're using someone

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.125
else's-- some pundit on
TV, using their ideas.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.400
It wasn't interesting.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.970
So I thought maybe
if I asked, what's

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.740
the best thing
about this country,

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.980
no one goes on TV
to talk about what

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.210
the best thing in this
country is, right?

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.372
So there aren't any
soundbites for that.

00:38:20.372 --> 00:38:22.580
CARRIE LAURENO: Apparently
you can Google it, though.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.830
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah, right.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:24.360
Right.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.151
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: That's
my favorite answer.

00:38:26.151 --> 00:38:28.070
CARRIE LAURENO:
Thank you for that.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:28.820
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
And so we started

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.080
to get something that was
a little more interesting.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.950
There was one guy-- there
were amazing people that

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.360
didn't make it into the film.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.330
And it's the heartbreak
of making documentaries.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.880
Stuff gets left out
that just beautiful.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.210
And in Baltimore
we ran into a guy,

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.250
young African American
guy-- actually,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.860
young African guy who
was now American--

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.430
and he'd grown up in Liberia.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.690
And I was in Liberia
during the civil war.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.020
And one of the things that
stopped that civil war

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.760
was the arrival of American
forces in Monrovia--

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.990
and also other African
forces in Monrovia--

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.780
to enforce a peace between
the rebels and the government.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.420
And he was just a kid
when that happened, right?

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.680
That was like 11 years ago.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.870
So he was a young boy.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:22.410
And so he had this memory
of that America had actually

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.980
come to his country and done
something really, really good.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.010
And they didn't fire
a shot, by the way.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.040
And so he had a very
positive idea of America.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.620
But then he came here, and
he was not only experiencing

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:40.090
he was glad to be here,
but he was very, very poor.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.700
And he was an immigrant.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.990
And he was very
upset at the attitude

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.990
that he was encountering
about immigrants.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:49.150
He's like, look, you came to
Liberia to help my country.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.960
Now here I am.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.870
I'm trying to get an education
to do good in the world.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.860
And I'm an immigrant,
and you don't like me.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.510
That doesn't make sense.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.830
And he just said this
very powerful thing.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:01.570
He's like, look.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.290
We're all immigrants.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.790
Except for the American Indians,
all of us are immigrants.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.260
It's a whole country
of immigrants.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.140
So who is it to stand up and
say that one group's immigrants,

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.410
and we're not.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.530
It's stupid.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.500
And so there were people
that were very, very

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.390
upset about things.

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:21.510
And he was one of the
few who really was not

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.370
using soundbites.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.770
He was really using his brain.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.910
And it was incredible,
incredible moment.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:27.310
You remember that guy, right?

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:27.810
Yeah.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.150
So, anyway.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.280
Long answer, but.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.280
GUILLERMO CERVERA: Yeah.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.180
But when you ask what the
best thing about America,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.850
all say freedom of
speech, or freedom.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:42.730
And I really don't have
that sense of America.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.890
When you travel around,
you see what's freedom.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.370
Here it's freedom, but
a different freedom.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:50.510
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Right.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.010
Well, there's economic
freedom, right?

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.580
And political freedom.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.790
And I think we are very,
very free in this country

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:57.937
to say what we feel.

00:40:57.937 --> 00:40:58.520
What we think.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.149
Absolutely.

00:40:59.149 --> 00:41:00.940
You can stand on a
street corner and scream

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.106
that you hate the president.

00:41:02.106 --> 00:41:05.719
And most of the
countries in the world,

00:41:05.719 --> 00:41:07.010
you get put in prison for that.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.594
But not here.

00:41:07.594 --> 00:41:08.135
It's amazing.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.490
I know a lot of people who grew
up in the Eastern Bloc, right?

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.340
Those societies,
as flawed as they

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.670
are in terms of
political freedom,

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.890
economically, people
are way more equal.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.890
I mean the gap between
rich and poor is not large.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.120
It's small.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:31.480
And so do we have
economic freedom here?

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.630
A lot of us do, but
a lot of us do not.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:38.550
And that was not true of
the Eastern Bloc, as poor

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.050
as it was.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:44.650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:48.040
Brendan, I noticed in
a scene in the movie

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.370
you had an EOD t-shirt.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.590
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: I didn't
have any clean shirts.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.390
Dave lent it to me.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.274
So you've got to talk
to Dave about that.

00:42:00.274 --> 00:42:01.690
AUDIENCE: The next
round's on you.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:02.606
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.180
AUDIENCE: This isn't a
question, but more of a comment.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.730
I honestly, from the
bottom of my heart,

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.550
and behalf of my
family and my wife,

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.290
thank you for making this.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.530
Thank you for making the
films that you've made.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.370
Not from an
entertainment aspect,

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.440
but more as perspective.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.440
There are those of us that
have experienced certain things

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.260
that we might not have
the words to talk about.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.760
You mentioned, Brendan,
that this isn't our story.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.350
You're absolutely right.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:40.480
These are stories that
people here need to know.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.920
People that watch this
movie need to know.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.710
But we don't have the words.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.770
And sometimes we don't
have the capabilities.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.140
We're going through our own
things, myself included.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:55.490
These films offer a
glimpse into our own minds.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:59.420
And something that I may not be
able to tell my wife that I'm

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.880
going through, but she
can watch this movie.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.500
And there were certain
times during the portion

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.450
of this movie that she's
sitting there shaking her head.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.710
I think there were a couple
times where it really

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:13.920
clicked with her.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.130
Same thing with
"Restrepo." and I

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:18.990
can't thank you enough for that.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:24.930
It really means a lot to a lot
of people that you can do this.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.310
And we talked about
bridging the gap.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.970
You're doing it.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:29.720
Thank you.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.303
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Thank you very much.

00:43:31.303 --> 00:43:33.897
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:38.145 --> 00:43:39.270
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Real fast.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.550
When Sebastian
wrote the book, one

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.830
of things I first
said to him was,

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.020
you're explaining us to us.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.710
Thank you.

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:50.900
And that's what I told him.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.430
And it was one of
the first times

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.950
that I was being
explained to me.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.827
And that's what really helped
me get to where I am right now

00:43:57.827 --> 00:43:59.160
and be able to speak about this.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.870
Because he's helped
me along this way.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:05.210
And to tell me, dude, you're
messed up because of this.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.249
Or you're messed up--
or not messed up.

00:44:07.249 --> 00:44:08.040
He never said that.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:12.332
Yeah, he implied it.

00:44:12.332 --> 00:44:14.014
For sure.

00:44:14.014 --> 00:44:15.180
Said get your life together.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.090
Why?

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.401
Life is going great.

00:44:18.401 --> 00:44:18.900
But yeah.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.726
He's explained a lot.

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:24.830
A lot of us, he has
led the path in this.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.080
And it's thank you
from this side, too.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.310
GUILLERMO CERVERA: And I
went to also thank you.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.590
Rudy who was there,
the cameraman--

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.295
we don't see him in the movie.

00:44:35.295 --> 00:44:39.330
But at the beginning, I was
all the time telling him,

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:39.990
I hate this.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.257
I hate this.

00:44:41.257 --> 00:44:43.590
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: You were
complaining to the cameraman?

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.950
really?

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:49.730
GUILLERMO CERVERA: He
was really supporting me.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.550
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Did he hate it, too?

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:52.508
GUILLERMO CERVERA: Yes.

00:44:52.508 --> 00:44:54.200
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: He did, right?

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.780
The guys who carried the least
weight hated it the most.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.540
That's weird.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.995
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Weird.

00:44:58.995 --> 00:45:00.078
GUILLERMO CERVERA: I know.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.709
CARRIE LAURENO: A
couple other questions.

00:45:05.709 --> 00:45:07.000
AUDIENCE: Now, just real quick.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.040
As far as being
noncombatants in that role

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.620
and being combatants
in that role,

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.717
despite being on American soil
and being relatively safe,

00:45:14.717 --> 00:45:16.300
like a knee-jerk
reaction-- whether it

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.091
be in the middle of
the night, or something

00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:22.136
like that-- did you find
yourself wishing you almost

00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:24.010
had a weapon on you to
feel more comfortable,

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.646
or that your combatant
had a weapon on you?

00:45:26.646 --> 00:45:28.020
Again, just whether
it be a train

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.665
going by, or seeing the
helicopters in a situation

00:45:30.665 --> 00:45:31.910
like that.

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:33.530
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.320
We really did get shot at once.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.050
And we were in the
middle of Pennsylvania.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:40.680
And it was actually outstanding.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.890
That sounded weird.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.630
AUDIENCE: It's not that weird.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:50.840
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: But
we had bear mace,

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.941
which is, like, bears
get stopped by that.

00:45:54.941 --> 00:45:55.440
Grizzlies.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.460
So crackheads definitely
get stopped by it.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.830
And we also had a machete.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.710
And we had a dog.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.440
So some of the close-range
stuff we weren't really

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.590
too concerned about.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:09.510
But when we got shot at,
it was the funniest thing.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:14.900
We were underneath a bridge.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.260
That's how normally
you get shot at.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.250
You start out with being
underneath a bridge.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.120
And so we hear these two shots.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.380
And Sebastian grabs the
machete and runs off.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.510
And I run, going around
the hill to flank this guy.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.535
And I'm right up the
wall trying to see

00:46:32.535 --> 00:46:33.910
where they were
shooting us from.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.970
It was just the weirdest
thing, because I really

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.260
did want a gun at that point.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.050
But I'm glad I didn't.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:42.350
It would've been
a weird situation.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:46.389
Sebastian got into a firefight
in the middle of Pennsylvania.

00:46:46.389 --> 00:46:48.930
The news wouldn't have, I don't
think, would have liked that.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.240
But it was this reaction.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:51.880
Immediately.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.740
Didn't even think about it.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.740
We didn't talk about it.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.850
He ran just one way.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.110
I went up this way.

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.250
And we're about to
assault whatever

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.350
the person was up there.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:00.690
And yeah.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.499
But it felt very
vulnerable at that moment,

00:47:02.499 --> 00:47:03.790
because we didn't have weapons.

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.910
And we were going
to handle whatever

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.060
we were going to handle.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.500
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.370
We both immediately
thought-- I mean,

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.136
I thought-- we need
to do something.

00:47:11.136 --> 00:47:12.385
We didn't communicate, either.

00:47:12.385 --> 00:47:13.830
It was real instantaneous.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:16.540
But I thought, we've
got to do the thing

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.520
that this guy least
expects us to do.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.740
And for Brendan, that meant
climbing this rock wall.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.330
It's about 15 feet high.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:28.290
And peeking over the edge of it.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.450
And for me, it meant
grabbing the machete

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.960
and trying to run around
so I could get behind him.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.170
And so deal with him that way.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.260
And it was instantaneous.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.250
But what motivated me,
and, I think, Brendan,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:45.000
was just I was
absolutely indignant

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.240
that someone would try
to harm these guys.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.780
It was such an
instantaneous reaction.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.930
And it was the only moment,
I think, on the patrol

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.434
that I felt a little
Afghan, or something.

00:48:00.434 --> 00:48:01.350
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.080
It was cool.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.440
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: It was cool.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.670
The footage wasn't good
enough to put it in the film,

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:07.940
so we had to leave
it as a story.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:08.440
Yeah?

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.499
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:09.499 --> 00:48:10.540
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: No, no.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.140
He stopped shooting.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.460
He just fired a few rounds.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.335
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: The
Amish mafia, definitely.

00:48:14.335 --> 00:48:16.350
It was the Amish mafia.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.050
They got us.

00:48:20.847 --> 00:48:21.680
CARRIE LAURENO: Yes.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.330
Go ahead.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.330
Front row.

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:24.282
Ma'am?

00:48:24.282 --> 00:48:25.226
Hi.

00:48:25.226 --> 00:48:27.114
Yes.

00:48:27.114 --> 00:48:29.474
AUDIENCE: You talked a
lot about relationships

00:48:29.474 --> 00:48:31.520
you have with your wives.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.160
Or, Brendan, your wife.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.120
[INAUDIBLE] women?

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:34.694
Sorry.

00:48:34.694 --> 00:48:36.110
You talked about
the relationships

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:37.909
you had with your fathers.

00:48:37.909 --> 00:48:38.450
That came up.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:41.440
But I never heard you say
anything about your mothers.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.477
Did you discuss the relationship
you had with your mothers?

00:48:45.477 --> 00:48:46.560
And did you edit that out?

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.710
Or was it just something
that never really

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.170
was important enough to have--

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.419
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I know
this is going to sound weird,

00:48:53.419 --> 00:48:55.740
because we walked
350 miles together,

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.560
but I don't think any
of us ever mentioned

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.580
either the marriages we
were in or our mothers.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.850
I don't know why.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:04.670
Did we?

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:05.750
Did we talk about
the relationships--

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.530
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Only
when we were asked,

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.100
like, what does your
wife do for you?

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.612
And I'm like, she
keeps me in line.

00:49:11.612 --> 00:49:12.820
That was the only time that--

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:13.510
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: No,
the question there

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.093
was what do you like
best about women?

00:49:15.093 --> 00:49:16.620
Is actually what
the question was.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.070
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Oh.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:17.240
CARRIE LAURENO: Guillermo, yeah.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.907
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: So that was the
only time I brought up my wife.

00:49:19.907 --> 00:49:21.781
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Guillermo said, everything.

00:49:21.781 --> 00:49:23.504
CARRIE LAURENO:
Everything, yeah, right.

00:49:23.504 --> 00:49:25.140
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Is that a
good answer or a bad answer,

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.639
by the way.

00:49:25.639 --> 00:49:27.430
As a woman, what would you say?

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:28.388
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.130
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: I think
what Sebastian wanted to do,

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:40.670
for a man, it's the relationship
with his father's important.

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.000
And what he becomes in life.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.730
And also with the
mother, of course.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:49.380
But I think we wanted to
talk about our fathers,

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.300
only because it
affected us greatly.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.280
And my dad had a
huge effect on me.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.020
My mom had a huge
effect on me, too.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.140
But my dad shot me.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.867
So it was a little bit of a
different impact on my life.

00:49:59.867 --> 00:50:02.200
And I think that that was the
same thing with Sebastian.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.060
Sebastian had a
tough relationship.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.244
And Guillermo also had a
pretty tough relationship

00:50:07.244 --> 00:50:07.910
with his father.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:15.160
So I think those things--
our mothers were much--

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.200
AUDIENCE: Nicer?

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:16.400
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
Sometimes, yeah.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.400
GUILLERMO CERVERA: Yeah.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.970
Your mother is always with you.

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.790
For me, my mother is an angel.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:24.790
And she died three years?

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.730
Two years before the patrol.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:29.770
And she was always there.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:32.070
So I didn't have
to talk about her.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:32.570
Yeah.

00:50:35.315 --> 00:50:36.440
CARRIE LAURENO: Microphone?

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.180
AUDIENCE: Really
enjoyed the movie.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.740
Thank you so much
for doing that.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:43.970
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:45.970
AUDIENCE: But the timing
with the last question.

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:47.930
So I actually had two questions.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:51.580
But my first one is
what about the role

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.570
of women in the military
in light of your movie,

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.760
in light of the reflections
you just talked about?

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.200
What about in the
case of America,

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.410
women entering the tip
of the spear combat

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:07.210
arms-- infantry and
armor-- starting in 2016.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.850
What is the message
that you have

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:11.880
for the American population?

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.120
And service members
that are women

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.640
that might want to enter the
combat arms tip of the spear

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.140
roles?

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.650
And my second question.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.670
The only establishment
that we saw you ever

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:28.060
enter throughout the whole
journey was a church.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.429
Why is that?

00:51:30.429 --> 00:51:32.470
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I mean,
we would go into diners

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:34.130
and have a meal or
whatever sometimes.

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.870
It just wasn't always
that interesting.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:39.290
Churches were interesting to me.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.650
A, and particularly for me as
an atheist-- well, you saw.

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:44.340
I really had never
been to church.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.125
So I was sort of
fascinated by them.

00:51:49.755 --> 00:51:54.040
On to the incredibly complicated
question, your first question.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.920
I feel like the army
has figured out how

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.550
to turn front-line
soldiers, how to turn

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:03.500
young people into ideal
front-line soldiers, right?

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.260
But where their chances
of survival are maximized.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.270
And I think for women
to be in that position,

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.580
they have to turn into
the exact same thing.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:18.380
And so I think anyone has to
turn into the exact same thing.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.377
I'm a civilian, right?

00:52:19.377 --> 00:52:20.710
I had to sort of turn into that.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:22.880
I just didn't have a gun.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.080
I think in some ways
if women can learn--

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.510
and obviously,
they can-- if they

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:31.870
can learn to think and
react and act exactly

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.215
like men in that
situation, they'll be fine.

00:52:38.969 --> 00:52:41.010
AUDIENCE: Brendan, I just
wanted to add something

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:43.870
to what the gentleman said
over there about the EOD joke,

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.960
about the t-shirt.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.870
I'm a Marine vet.

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:49.800
Please don't, like-- I know
I'm surrounded by soldiers,

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.235
so I'll watch what I say.

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:53.735
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
You're outnumbered.

00:52:58.002 --> 00:52:59.710
AUDIENCE: You're not
just bridging a gap.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.680
You're not just
telling your story.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.860
You're saving lives.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.090
The stuff you guys went
through over there.

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:12.500
I can't remember what I did with
my Marines because of my TBI.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.650
And Marines don't usually
get this emotional.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:15.180
I'm sorry.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.500
But watching "Restrepo"
and "Korengal"

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.680
reminds me of what I lost.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.410
And when I want to end it
all, that's what I watch.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:24.520
So thank you.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.437
Thank you from the bottom
of my fucking heart.

00:53:26.437 --> 00:53:27.770
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Thank you, man.

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:29.042
Thank you.

00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:30.500
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.902
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.704
CARRIE LAURENO: One last
question, if there is one.

00:53:41.704 --> 00:53:43.620
AUDIENCE: I want to how
we can help-- Brendan,

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.590
maybe you can answer this
question-- when you come back.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.674
I work for the VA.

00:53:47.674 --> 00:53:49.715
And what I see-- this is
my personal experience--

00:53:49.715 --> 00:53:53.700
is that we want to help, but
the veteran says they want help,

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.350
and they already don't follow
through with the action

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:57.100
that we can offer.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.362
Not all veterans.

00:53:58.362 --> 00:54:00.070
I'm not saying that
every single veteran.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.360
But some isolate themselves.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.000
We call them.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.680
We want them to come in.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.870
We even have programs where
we actually go to their house.

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.970
What can, not the
VA, but anybody,

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:13.360
do to a veteran who's
trying to seek assistance?

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.910
Or even if they're not
trying to seek assistance,

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.637
what can somebody do?

00:54:17.637 --> 00:54:19.720
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: That's a
really awesome question.

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.395
And I've given that
a lot of thought.

00:54:22.395 --> 00:54:23.395
There's a lot of things.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.150
I'm an alcoholic, you know.

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.470
And I go to AA every
single morning.

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:34.060
Because if I don't
go to AA, I drink.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.219
And alcoholism, you
can't have willpower.

00:54:37.219 --> 00:54:38.010
It's not willpower.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.640
It's not anything that
saves you from alcoholism.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.600
It's talking with
other alcoholics

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.340
on how they got sober.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:48.554
And something happens inside of
AA that keeps me from drinking.

00:54:48.554 --> 00:54:49.220
I've had a year.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:53.294
I haven't had a year
since I was fucking 12.

00:54:53.294 --> 00:54:55.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:58.550
Not even in combat.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:01.190
So something works inside AA.

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.620
And I think-- not comparing
alcoholism to veterans,

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.130
but-- when you're talking
about serving in combat,

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:11.830
I think the most important
thing is, when you come home,

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:13.870
is meeting up with
other veterans.

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:16.330
Other veterans.

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:18.420
I'm never going to get
better from alcoholism

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.950
by seeking a shrink.

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:21.450
That's not going to help me.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:24.590
What's going to help me is
talking with other alcoholics.

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.480
Same thing with veterans.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.460
Veterans aren't going
to have-- there's

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.876
going to be certain things
that you can get from a shrink,

00:55:30.876 --> 00:55:33.330
but the real healing is
talking with another veteran.

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.756
Saying, hey, what do
you feel about this?

00:55:36.756 --> 00:55:38.200
And getting that honest answer.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.380
I think that is what's going
to save a lot of lives.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.330
And VA needs to start
setting that up.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.970
Not even a counselor
inside that setting.

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.590
Just letting a
veteran run group.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:52.900
Be a veteran-run group.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.652
Those are really
important things.

00:55:54.652 --> 00:55:56.610
And then there's also
things like Outward Bound

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:57.860
for veterans.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.000
Outward Bound for veterans.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.990
Has anyone heard of that?

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:04.840
It's an extremely
cool organization.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.770
And you go a week-long
trip with other veterans.

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:10.290
And you get to go sailing.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.790
You get to go hiking.

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.730
You get to dog sled, if
you want to dog sled.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.820
You get to white water rafting.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.810
We went on white water rafting,
me and 15 of my buddies

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.040
I served with.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.530
And that was so good for me.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.130
And it's completely
free for the veteran

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:30.160
through donations
the country gives.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.060
So if you donate to this,
you're giving back to veterans.

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.740
And it's just this
really great program.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:40.110
So I think things like that are
going to help get veterans home

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:42.090
and to connect with
other veterans.

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:43.660
I think that's the key.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.870
I think that's what's
going to save lives.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:47.850
It's not going to
be what the VA does.

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:50.690
It's going to be what veterans
are doing for each other.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.320
If I saw-- and I
don't care if it

00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:00.820
was a person I didn't know--
if there was a soldier wounded

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.160
in front of me,
inside combat, I would

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.480
go in the middle of
firefight and try

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.840
to pull that person out.

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.380
Because that's
what you do, right?

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.140
So when you have someone
inside your community

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.040
that's a veteran that's
having a hard time,

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.350
and you're a veteran, reach out.

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:19.680
You would be doing it in combat,
so what's the difference here

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.180
in the United States?

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.860
There's no difference.

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.250
So I think that
that reaching out

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.650
is going to be the key
to saving veterans.

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:30.810
CARRIE LAURENO: What does that
mean for civilians, right,

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.620
like this gentleman and
myself, and others who are here

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:36.450
tonight, who want to do
something to help and make it

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:36.950
better?

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:40.850
What role can we play?

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:43.240
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Supporting
that stuff I'm talking about.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:43.690
CARRIE LAURENO:
That environment.

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:43.960
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.290
CARRIE LAURENO: Where you
guys can come together.

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.830
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
Because you're not

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.030
going to-- civilians,
as much as you're

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:50.929
going to do to help
welcome us home,

00:57:50.929 --> 00:57:52.970
you're not going to help
us with the deep trauma.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:57.090
Deep trauma, you're going to
talk with other veterans about.

00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:59.410
I could talk to
you all day about

00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.720
how it felt to lose Restrepo.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.030
But until I talk to another
veteran that has lost his best

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:09.675
friend, it's not
going to matter.

00:58:09.675 --> 00:58:10.550
It's going to matter.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.299
It's going to feel
great to talk about it.

00:58:12.299 --> 00:58:14.550
But that understanding
is what's key.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:16.650
Understanding and
being understood

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:19.650
is what's healing
about with trauma.

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:22.025
CARRIE LAURENO: Which is why
the last patrol was helpful.

00:58:22.025 --> 00:58:23.983
GUILLERMO CERVERA: That
sharing with the people

00:58:23.983 --> 00:58:25.190
who have the same problem.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:26.385
Exactly what he had said.

00:58:26.385 --> 00:58:28.260
CARRIE LAURENO: Are you
going to do it again?

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.676
BRENDAN O'BYRNE:
We keep doing it.

00:58:29.676 --> 00:58:32.390
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: We can't stop.

00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:33.600
We keep going out there.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:34.210
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: We're just
not filming it any more.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.900
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Now we
bring-- there' no camera

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.940
and there's no funding,
but we just keep going.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.020
CARRIE LAURENO: Can girls come?

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:40.370
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah.

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:41.613
We brought a woman.

00:58:41.613 --> 00:58:42.779
CARRIE LAURENO: Oh, you did.

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:45.410
I have two final--

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:47.540
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: And
she brought the soap.

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:48.942
Finally we had soap on a patrol.

00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:51.400
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: I had this
one real funny thing real fast.

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.076
We were walking down the--
this is the funniest story.

00:58:55.076 --> 00:58:57.214
We were walking
down in Wilmington,

00:58:57.214 --> 00:58:59.130
and we're getting into
the middle of the city.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:01.189
And this car pulls up.

00:59:01.189 --> 00:59:02.730
And this guy looks
out of the window.

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:05.430
And he's like, hey,
what are you guys doing?

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:06.979
We're like, oh,
we're walking to--

00:59:06.979 --> 00:59:08.770
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: He's
with his girlfriend.

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:09.510
He's with his girlfriend.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.621
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yeah.

00:59:09.621 --> 00:59:10.662
He's with his girlfriend.

00:59:10.662 --> 00:59:11.490
And she's driving.

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:12.860
And he's in the passenger seat.

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:15.240
And we're like, yeah, we're
walking to-- at that point,

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.527
we were walking
to New York still.

00:59:17.527 --> 00:59:18.860
I was like, do you want to come?

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.026
And he didn't have anything.

00:59:20.026 --> 00:59:21.750
He didn't have a
backpack, nothing.

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.780
And he starts getting
out of the car.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:28.510
The girlfriend
pulls him back in.

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:30.751
So it's appealing, I
think, to a lot of people.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.200
CARRIE LAURENO: I have
two final questions.

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.810
Brendan, you had something,
a piece of advice

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:40.430
to share with the
cadets as they embark

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:42.597
on their military careers.

00:59:42.597 --> 00:59:43.680
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Yes, yes.

00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:49.970
One second.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.190
Yes.

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:56.010
Money.

00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:57.940
That will help.

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.740
I know there's a few
things that my leaders did

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.100
that made them successful.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.930
And one of the main things
that my lieutenants did

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:08.620
that was really
successful was that they

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.820
listened to their sergeants.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.890
And I know that that's
drilled into cadets

01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:16.440
and drilled into cadets,
but it's so important.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.729
So when you go out
into your units,

01:00:18.729 --> 01:00:19.770
listen to your sergeants.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:20.930
They know what to do.

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:21.960
They will help you.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.160
They will be the ones
that let you succeed.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:32.290
And also, the more I see
the army and the military,

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:35.420
I think it's the more
it's becoming political.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.930
And it kind of upsets me.

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:41.410
And sometimes lieutenants
and leaders sometimes

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:43.450
make the decision
best for their career

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.940
rather than for their soldiers.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.840
And I think it's very
important to realize

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.420
that true leadership means
that you put yourself second.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:59.060
You put everything in your life
second to your men or women.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.880
And that is what leadership is.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.400
So when you're put in a
situation where it's hard,

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.310
and you figure, what's
the right answer?

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.500
It's always going to be
soldiers underneath you,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.910
or the people underneath you.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.312
What is the best thing for them?

01:01:14.312 --> 01:01:16.020
I wish I could say
that to the president.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.360
I wish I could say that to
every leader in the world.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.860
Because true leadership means
putting yourself second.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.300
So that's the two things
I really, really wanted

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.202
to talk to you about.

01:01:25.202 --> 01:01:26.285
CARRIE LAURENO: Thank you.

01:01:26.285 --> 01:01:28.660
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:37.890
As sad as it is, the
reason that the four of us

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.380
are actually on
the stage tonight

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.780
is because we are united
by the death of our friends

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.470
or the trauma of
combat, and how it's

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:46.720
affected us in different ways.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.460
And as you know, I lost
a loved one to the war

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:52.180
in Afghanistan, which is how
I got involved in supporting

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.990
this community,
when I previously

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.760
had no ties whatsoever.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.820
You lost a friend.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.470
You guys deployed together,
were embedded together.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.870
You lost a very close
friend, and then met

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:06.870
Sebastian, who was
so close with Tim.

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:10.520
And Sebastian loves you for
being the person you are

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.380
and the person
you were with him,

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:16.090
you must have been in that
moment when he passed.

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:21.240
So these silver linings
become very, very clear

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.070
and bright to me-- that
the reason all of us

01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:26.680
there are here tonight having
this wonderful experience ahead

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.040
of Veterans' Day at
Google is because

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.070
of those traumatic and
difficult situations.

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:34.190
And so I just wanted
to close by asking

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:36.720
about Tim Hetherington,
your dear friend.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.770
And all three of you
knew him and loved him.

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:43.060
The last time I was on
this stage with Sebastian

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.110
was when we screened
"Restrepo" here.

01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:49.710
And Tim was in one of
these chairs right here.

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:52.810
And I wonder what he would say.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.870
What would he think about
tonight and this conversation?

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.050
And what would he say?

01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:01.000
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I
think about that a lot.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.990
I went on to make a film about
him and his death and his work.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:09.055
And then I went back into
the "Restrepo" material

01:03:09.055 --> 01:03:10.160
and made "Korengal."

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.380
And I had him in my mind.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.130
He shot a lot of that
footage, obviously.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:25.350
And "The Last Patrol,"
it happened in the form

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:29.800
that it did partly because he
was alive, and we were friends,

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.220
and we had ideas together.

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.380
And one of the
ideas that popped up

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:39.350
within our professional
relationship was this idea.

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:42.060
But it took this
form because he died,

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.550
and I was with these other guys.

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:49.550
And I just have to
think that he would

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:56.080
be tremendous-- If he
somehow could know,

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.820
right, somehow know that
this trip happened as it did,

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:04.910
and this evening was happening,
he'd be a little puzzled.

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:08.550
But I have to think he
would be really incredibly

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.280
affected by it.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.900
We're all affecting-- all of
us, with or without our deaths--

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.520
we're all affecting so
many people all the time.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.400
Hopefully in pretty good ways.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.150
And there aren't
many good things

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.570
that come from people's deaths.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.550
Obviously, we all know that.

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:29.830
But this is, I think,
maybe one of the very

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:32.810
most powerful things that
I've ever seen personally

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:37.660
come from a tragedy, was this
experience the four of us.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.030
And it's weird.

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:41.770
You don't even know what to
be grateful for, grateful to.

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:44.927
But it's tremendous, I think.

01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:46.010
CARRIE LAURENO: Guillermo?

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:48.220
GUILLERMO CERVERA: Well,
I met Tim in Libya.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.950
I was not really
good friend of him.

01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:52.830
And I met him there.

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:56.790
But we become, like, tight.

01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:59.760
These few days together.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.000
And I remember when he
died, a rebel leader who

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.660
was in the house where we were
staying, he say, many times,

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.180
this guy was a gentleman.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.740
This guy was a gentleman.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.220
And he was a gentleman.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.300
He act like a gentleman.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.340
He was a really nice person.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:20.220
You could see him
deal with the people.

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.600
He was a nice guy.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:27.160
I don't know how he will have
felt in front of America.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.140
But, of course, he will
have made amazing pictures.

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.630
I know.

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:33.690
Because America
is a place to get

01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:36.900
pictures, to get feelings,
to get a lot of things

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.040
out, good and bad.

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:44.010
And when I finished my work
of America with pictures,

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:48.970
I was really surprised, because
it's one of my best works

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:53.300
in all my career.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:58.380
Even I was in Afghanistan,
all these crazy places.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:02.310
The work I can see
more feelings is

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.120
the one I made here in America.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.430
So I'm sure Tim will have
done something similar.

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:14.830
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: When I
first got home, like I said,

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:16.127
I was a really bad place.

01:06:16.127 --> 01:06:17.210
I was trying to get sober.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.340
And I was trying to get help.

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:27.180
Tim offered up his place
for me in Brooklyn.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.120
And he said, the one thing
that I want you to do

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.130
is not to drink.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.830
And within a week, I was drunk.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.190
And I realized at that moment
that I really cared for Tim,

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:42.460
and I couldn't even hold
that promise up to Tim.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.820
And it was like
the first sign that

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:49.240
to me, my whole entire
life falling apart,

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.680
that I had a serious
alcohol problem.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.260
And I don't know how he
would feel about the film.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.220
But I know he would look at
me and say, right on, man.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.920
You got a year.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.670
Awesome.

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.970
And I think that he'd
be very proud of us

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:02.890
for doing what we did.

01:07:05.052 --> 01:07:07.385
CARRIE LAURENO: Thank you for
sharing about your friend.

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:11.710
This is wonderful.

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:13.686
I've dad said it to
you a hundred times,

01:07:13.686 --> 01:07:14.810
but I'm so grateful to you.

01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:16.809
We're all so grateful to
you for the work you're

01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:20.140
doing to help us get
these stories out as well.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.560
And for the healing
that it's given

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.620
to all of us who are
touched by any trauma

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.940
that we've been
through, whether we've

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.499
gone to war or otherwise,
being able to talk about it

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:30.790
and share it with other people.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:35.080
And the example that you
are setting by doing that

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.540
is a true form of leadership.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.506
And we're very, very
grateful to all of you.

01:07:39.506 --> 01:07:40.880
Thank you for
being here tonight.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.590
All of you.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:44.490
We wish you a happy
early Veterans' Day.

01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:46.900
Please come back and visit
us at Google at any time.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.710
We love you guys.

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:48.630
We love you gals.

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:50.990
And we're here to help,
whether we served or not.

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:53.102
There's a whole bunch of us who
have and a whole bunch of us

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:53.601
who haven't.

01:07:53.601 --> 01:07:55.580
But we're figuring
it out together.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.460
And you're welcome
here any time.

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.210
Thanks, everybody.

01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:59.350
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Thank you everybody.

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.900
BRENDAN O'BYRNE: Thank you.
