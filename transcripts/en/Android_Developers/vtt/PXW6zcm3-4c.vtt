00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.600
We've successfully created company culture revolving around innovation, new functionality, and tackling new challenges.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.400
We are the company operating the real estate information site LIFULL HOME'S.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:24.660
Users looking to move house show a trend for short periods of focused searching.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.180
We receive most inquiries from our landing pages for PC or mobile browsers.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.060
and less from our smartphone app.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.960
But I think apps allow for higher frequency, deeper communication.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.320
Our mission is to increase the volume of inquiries we receive through our app.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.960
That's why we've focused on "users first" and "user happiness."

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.260
Our aim is to develop an app that will meet user expectations.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.040
In order to achieve this, listening to our users is vital.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.280
So we started to reply to every review we receive.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.180
Three staff members take it in turns.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.599
Making things more personal lets users see the people behind the curtain.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:12.160
We conduct a survey and use the results to help improve the app's bottlenecks.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.600
Then we run an A/B test with 50% of our subjects.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.200
If it goes well, we try it with 100%.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.960
Introducing bottom navigation was very divisive inside the company.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.920
Thinking of user convenience, however, I very much wanted to introduce it.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.320
So we used Firebase Remote Config to hold an A/B test.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.480
User response was positive, allowing us to confirm its viability and adopt it.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.280
One KPI we looked at closely
was the overall app conversion rate.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.240
Introducing bottom navigation upped conversion rate by 1.5 times

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.040
and also allowed us to improve the main screen utilization rate.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.400
LIFULL HOME'S users have a clear goal.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.000
An intuitive design,good structure

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.560
and even engineering are already defined in Material Design.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.640
Everyone on our team agreed this really worked for us.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.080
We develop with the mindset of "putting the user first."

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680
We used the A/B test function from the Developer Console

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.840
to perform A/B tests for the Store's screenshots and app launcher icon.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.600
This has led to an 188% improvement in user install rates.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.160
The numbers confirm that our user-focused approach is effective.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.560
Our internal KPI was user inquiries via the app, and the number increased 166% over last year

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.200
and our rating on the Play Store increased from 3.5 to 4.2.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.800
We are incredibly grateful for the user feedback we have been receiving.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.840
We look forward to continuing our work on new Google platforms

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.680
and bringing innovative services to the industry.
