Did you get x equals negative 2? If so, great work. Let's see how we got x

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:09.368
equals negative 2. Since my absolute value is equal to 0, and 0 is positive nor

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.052
negative, there's only going to be one case, which is 3x plus 6 equals 0. If we

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:19.243
subtract 6 from both sides, we have 3x equals negative 6. Divide both sides by

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:24.228
3, and I get x equals negative 2. Are you ready for another absolute value

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.785
problem?
