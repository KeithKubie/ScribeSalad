00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.520
Welcome to the presentation on
using the quadratic equation.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.730
So the quadratic equation,
it sounds like something

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.810
very complicated.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.930
And when you actually first see
the quadratic equation, you'll

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.590
say, well, not only does it
sound like something

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.110
complicated, but it is
something complicated.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.930
But hopefully you'll see,
over the course of this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.580
presentation, that it's
actually not hard to use.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.040
And in a future presentation
I'll actually show you

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.300
how it was derived.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.810
So, in general, you've already
learned how to factor a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.810
second degree equation.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.910
You've learned that if I
had, say, x squared minus

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:40.340
x, minus 6, equals 0.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.970
If I had this equation. x
squared minus x minus x equals

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.720
zero, that you could factor
that as x minus 3 and

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.210
x plus 2 equals 0.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.955
Which either means that
x minus 3 equals 0 or

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.073
x plus 2 equals 0.

00:00:57.073 --> 00:01:03.512
So x minus 3 equals 0
or x plus 2 equals 0.

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:08.500
So, x equals 3 or negative 2.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:17.980
And, a graphical representation
of this would be, if I had the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.150
function f of x is equal to
x squared minus x minus 6.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.760
So this axis is
the f of x axis.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.670
You might be more familiar with
the y axis, and for the purpose

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.780
of this type of problem,
it doesn't matter.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.270
And this is the x axis.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.430
And if I were to graph this
equation, x squared minus x,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.380
minus 6, it would look
something like this.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.130
A bit like -- this is f
of x equals minus 6.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.900
And the graph will kind of
do something like this.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.030
Go up, it will keep going
up in that direction.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.150
And know it goes through minus
6, because when x equals 0,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.110
f of x is equal to minus 6.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.800
So I know it goes
through this point.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.520
And I know that when f of x is
equal to 0, so f of x is equal

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.960
to 0 along the x axis, right?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.600
Because this is 1.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.870
This is 0.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.160
This is negative 1.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.510
So this is where f of x
is equal to 0, along

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.420
this x axis, right?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.210
And we know it equals 0 at the
points x is equal to 3 and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.330
x is equal to minus 2.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.360
That's actually what
we solved here.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.440
Maybe when we were doing the
factoring problems we didn't

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.940
realize graphically
what we were doing.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.070
But if we said that f of x is
equal to this function, we're

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.270
setting that equal to 0.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.820
So we're saying this
function, when does

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.220
this function equal 0?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.390
When is it equal to 0?

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.720
Well, it's equal to 0 at
these points, right?

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.360
Because this is where
f of x is equal to 0.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.490
And then what we were doing
when we solved this by

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.970
factoring is, we figured out,
the x values that made f of x

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.160
equal to 0, which is
these two points.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.740
And, just a little terminology,
these are also called

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.860
the zeroes, or the
roots, of f of x.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.810
Let's review that a little bit.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.700
So, if I had something like f
of x is equal to x squared plus

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.550
4x plus 4, and I asked you,
where are the zeroes, or

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.770
the roots, of f of x.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.970
That's the same thing as
saying, where does f of x

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.300
interject intersect the x axis?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.210
And it intersects the
x axis when f of x is

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.440
equal to 0, right?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.120
If you think about the
graph I had just drawn.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.720
So, let's say if f of x is
equal to 0, then we could

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.860
just say, 0 is equal to x
squared plus 4x plus 4.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.940
And we know, we could just
factor that, that's x

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.080
plus 2 times x plus 2.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:07.090
And we know that it's equal
to 0 at x equals minus 2.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.940
x equals minus 2.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.270
Well, that's a little
-- x equals minus 2.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.380
So now, we know how to find
the 0's when the the actual

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.560
equation is easy to factor.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.500
But let's do a situation where
the equation is actually

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.850
not so easy to factor.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.750
Let's say we had f of x
is equal to minus 10x

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.380
squared minus 9x plus 1.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.580
Well, when I look at this, even
if I were to divide it by 10 I

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.650
would get some fractions here.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.130
And it's very hard to imagine
factoring this quadratic.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.860
And that's what's actually
called a quadratic equation, or

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.580
this second degree polynomial.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.600
But let's set it -- So we're
trying to solve this.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.420
Because we want to find
out when it equals 0.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.130
Minus 10x squared
minus 9x plus 1.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.090
We want to find out what
x values make this

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.260
equation equal to zero.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.730
And here we can use a tool
called a quadratic equation.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.625
And now I'm going to give you
one of the few things in math

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:18.030
that's probably a good
idea to memorize.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.330
The quadratic equation says
that the roots of a quadratic

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.810
are equal to -- and let's say
that the quadratic equation is

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.900
a x squared plus b
x plus c equals 0.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.790
So, in this example,
a is minus 10.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.940
b is minus 9, and c is 1.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:48.040
The formula is the roots x
equals negative b plus or minus

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:58.060
the square root of b squared
minus 4 times a times c,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.230
all of that over 2a.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.843
I know that looks complicated,
but the more you use it, you'll

00:06:02.843 --> 00:06:04.400
see it's actually not that bad.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.720
And this is a good
idea to memorize.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.730
So let's apply the quadratic
equation to this equation

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.670
that we just wrote down.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.260
So, I just said -- and look,
the a is just the coefficient

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.610
on the x term, right?

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.300
a is the coefficient on
the x squared term.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.570
b is the coefficient on the x
term, and c is the constant.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.100
So let's apply it
tot this equation.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.250
What's b?

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.700
Well, b is negative 9.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.970
We could see here.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.980
b is negative 9, a
is negative 10.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.970
c is 1.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.090
Right?

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.350
So if b is negative 9 -- so
let's say, that's negative 9.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:49.260
Plus or minus the square
root of negative 9 squared.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.810
Well, that's 81.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.940
Minus 4 times a.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.760
a is minus 10.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.240
Minus 10 times c, which is 1.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.110
I know this is messy,
but hopefully you're

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.470
understanding it.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.560
And all of that over 2 times a.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.050
Well, a is minus 10, so
2 times a is minus 20.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.990
So let's simplify that.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.410
Negative times negative
9, that's positive 9.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:26.460
Plus or minus the
square root of 81.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.660
We have a negative 4
times a negative 10.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.870
This is a minus 10.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.280
I know it's very messy,
I really apologize

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.380
for that, times 1.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.410
So negative 4 times negative
10 is 40, positive 40.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.040
Positive 40.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.070
And then we have all of
that over negative 20.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.300
Well, 81 plus 40 is 121.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.330
So this is 9 plus or
minus the square root

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:58.290
of 121 over minus 20.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.620
Square root of 121 is 11.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.170
So I'll go here.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.184
Hopefully you won't lose
track of what I'm doing.

00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:13.720
So this is 9 plus or
minus 11, over minus 20.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.090
And so if we said 9 plus 11
over minus 20, that is 9

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.540
plus 11 is 20, so this
is 20 over minus 20.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.730
Which equals negative 1.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.900
So that's one root.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.260
That's 9 plus -- because
this is plus or minus.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.790
And the other root would be 9
minus 11 over negative 20.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.720
Which equals minus
2 over minus 20.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.700
Which equals 1 over 10.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.690
So that's the other root.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:48.950
So if we were to graph this
equation, we would see that it

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.640
actually intersects the x axis.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.770
Or f of x equals 0 at the
point x equals negative

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.690
1 and x equals 1/10.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.080
I'm going to do a lot more
examples in part 2, because I

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.100
think, if anything, I might
have just confused

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.120
you with this one.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.680
So, I'll see you in the
part 2 of using the

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.150
quadratic equation.
