00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.076
[D. Evans] Now let's get started running code in the Python interpreter.

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:07.000
For this class you don't need to install any new software.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You can run Python right in your web browser.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You should see something like this in your web browser once the video stops.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.069
There are 2 parts to this.

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.000
There's the environment where you can edit code.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So let's type code to print 3.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Print is a Python command that prints something out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And then after the print we can have any expression we want that is valid Python,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.081
and we'll talk more about what expressions are in Python.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.046
Now we're just going to print the number 3.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:37.023
And when we click Run, it will run this code and show us the result down here.

00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:40.049
And the result of printing 3, we see the output 3.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.049
We can do more interesting things.

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.013
We can print an arithmetic expression.

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:46.038
I've got 1+1.

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:49.063
Now we run this. We see both outputs.

00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:52.000
First we printed 3. We see this 3 here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.010
Then we printed 1+1. We see the result of 1+1 is 2.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.087
We can write this more clearly by having spaces.

00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:02.000
We can have spaces between the parts of our expression,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.081
so we can have 1 + 1 with spaces between there.

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.058
That's a little easier to read.

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:10.053
When we run that we see the same result. The result is still 2.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:13.024
And we can make more and more complex expressions.

00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:19.001
Let's print the result of 52 * 3 + 12 * 9.

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:25.000
This will print out the result of multiplying 52 * 3

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.078
and adding that to multiplying 12 * 9.

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:30.075
And we get 264.

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:34.000
You can check that yourself to see that Python got the right answer.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We can use parentheses to group expressions.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.073
If we use parentheses, we can do what we did before

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:45.078
but putting parentheses around grouping the multiplications

00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:48.000
and grouping the other multiplication.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And when we run this we see the same result.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.075
Without the parentheses that means the same thing as we had

00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:58.000
when we add the parentheses like this.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If we put the parentheses in different places, it means something different.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.081
Now what it means is 52 times the result of adding 3 + 12, which is 15, times 9.

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:11.043
And so we get the result 7020.

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:15.072
We can combine any expressions that we want like this.

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:19.000
For example, if we wanted to compute the number of seconds in a year,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we could compose many multiplications.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So we'll multiply 365 days times 24 hours in a day times 60 minutes in an hour

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
times 60 seconds in a minute.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We can do all those multiplications together, and we get this result,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which is about 31Â½ million seconds in a year.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So now it's time for your first programming quiz.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You've seen enough to be able to write a Python program.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Your goal is to write a Python program that prints out the number of minutes there are

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.080
in 7 weeks, which is the amount of time we have for this course.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.000
You'll do that by entering your code in here,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.038
and then you can try different things.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:03.000
You can try running the code, see the result,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and then when you've got an answer, you can click to submit that answer

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.015
and see if it's correct.

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:10.003
[First Programming Quiz!]

00:03:10.003 --> 99:59:59.000
[Write a Python program that prints out the number of minutes in seven weeks.]
