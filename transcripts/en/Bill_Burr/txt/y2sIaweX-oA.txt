Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 3:          00:00:08       ahhh

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Just checking in on you. What's, uh, what's going on? I am actually doing this podcast. I'm in the middle of a radio tour right now and I have a 15 minute break and I'm on my way to the fucking airport after that. And after bike Cleo, we, oh, we're going to buy her some dog food, you know, so my wife has some of the Fiji, isn't it? Right? Boring. All right, get out of here. Go lay down cutie. Um, so I got a full day, so I'm trying to knock out 15 minutes before I go back to doing the radio tour, which is why I sound like I'm already off and running as opposed to my, you, I guess I'm never chilled a laid back. So I've been doing morning radio, um, to hype my St Louis and Kansas City, uh, dates that are coming up. And, uh, then also I got this, uh, Canadian tour that I'm doing. And, um, so I just spent on the fucking radio all day and everybody's just, you know, I was thought more Canadian fucking Djs were going to bust my balls about the Bruins. I guess you can't, you know, considering not one Canadian team is gonna make the fucking playoffs, which is playoffs, which is insane. Not One of them. Clio. Can you believe it? Not The fucking blue blockade. Douche is not Ottawa, Not Toronto. Toronto, Toronto.

Speaker 2:          00:01:24       Not The fucking, uh, the Calgary flames. The Edmond didn't. Oil is the Vancouver Canucks or the Winnipeg jets. You know, I don't think that's good for hockey. I mean, it's a funny thing to bring up as an American when I go up there and believe me, it will be brought up. Now I'm not going to rub your faces in it. How could I?

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       but God Damn Bruins, you know, we're a three seat now. We're, we're like, we've launched six of the last seven fucking unbelievable. Thank God for Toronto. Got To love Toronto. Most generous fucking team out there. They're always there to pick you up off the mat, aren't they? That's the only team we beat fucking laws to everybody, Rangers, Panthers, San Jose, Anaheim, the kings. And then we just fucking lost two to one hat breaker to the fucking devils. Now like we're playing bad. I still think we're going to get in there. You know what I mean? I just want us to make the playoffs so fucking clickbait. Uh, Dan Shaughnessy doesn't start writing his dumb ass fucking articles about how they need to do something. It's Selfie beat. A coach is so fucked up cause you got to deal with the Dan, Shauna, C's of the world. How unathletic does that guy look?

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       You know what I mean? He doesn't even look like he plays chess either. He just looks like a dope, let's say, and I don't, but I've never just seen a deck. Fucking guy should be run out of Boston. His whole fucking thing. He lives for the moment when the home team isn't doing well. That's his whole fucking thing. I had never forget that when the fucking, I think it was when the red sox won the world series. Finally, he was like, I don't even know how to write this article because she had doubt your negative comment.

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       I bet if a fucking plane crashed into the stadium and killed the whole fucking home team, you that, that, that article would be a breeze as you pretended to be sad. Um, oh dog. That guy drives me nuts. It drives me nuts. He should be writing for a New York newspaper. He Shits on fucking Boston team so much. Um, so anyways, anyways, where the fuck am I cleo for the love of God. Are you allergic to your bed? That's all you do. Is itch now. Huh? Look at that. Face that face. That's stupid that my dog had such a classic pooch face. It's ridiculous. Is that what they call you? Clean up? Was that your nickname in high school? Oh, poach face. Can you get over there and lay down and stop looking at me like I didn't take you out. Well, I didn't take it out. I let you down the stairs, but I also fed you. Hey, get over there. Lay down. Go on. Fucking think doesn't even listen to me anymore. Go on.

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       I shouldn't be yelling at my dog. My dogs is senior now. She's eight and a half years old, so she's officially a senior. So when I go and buy dog food, I gotta buy, you know, I got it by the advanced age shit. You know the same stuff. They're feed in your fucking Nana and your granddad or whatever the fuck you know, putting them in a fucking home. That's the worst. That's the fucking worst man. At least according to every fucking movie or news report you see, it's just like, this is a wonderful facility. They're going to be listening to Mitch Miller the entire time they are here. All of our facilities are top notch. They're going to be getting wonderful food. They are in great care. You can visit them whenever you want. Right? And then the fucking second, you drive away. You know, we fucking put a hard hat on your grandmother and make her start doing some fucking yardwork.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Isn't that how it works? I'm trying to steal her pension or is this just all some Hollywood drama shit? I Dunno. Like I said, so I'm gonna have to tap out here and then come back and about, um, what a fuck is it in like nine minutes. I want to go back out to the fucking world of morning radio. I literally had one of these guys this morning, Cleo, get over there and lay down. You know, it's worried about this dog. That thing won't shit unless I take it down the street, which is great. Is that what it is? You gotta take a shit? Is that why you stare at me? Is that what you're trying to communicate right now? Huh? Like someone who's still sound of mine but has lost the ability to speak. This is like a Metallica video. Cleo. Gee, stop fucking looking at me like that. I'm going to take you down the street. All right buddy. I'm going to do it. Fucking thing is staring all through my head. I just left you outside fucking 10 minutes. Why won't you go? All right. This is going to kill me. Okay. All right. Well I'm going to be talking to guys. We're not born there. My dog's taken a shit evidently. Um, so anyways, [inaudible] these morning fucking radio guys are hilarious. They literally sit there and they go like, uh, they'll just be talking to you. A couple of them would like the classic guys like just to clean up, get over there and laid out going. Get over there. Get over there.

Speaker 4:          00:06:34       Alright.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       I wish dogs understood. Just give me five minutes. Clio, get the fuck over there. Lay down.

Speaker 4:          00:06:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       I actually know what I think it is. I think she wants to get up on the couch with me. This is fucking loose. I have a pit bull in the, any sound of wind. Wind freaks her the fuck out. A Sasquatch could literally come into my house and she'd be like, all right, let's fucking do this. Okay. But if she hears a noise and she can't see where it's coming from, she just freaked the fuck out right now I have the heat on. I think that's bugging her and then all of a sudden she becomes like this. She turns into like a Chihuahua. You know, those dogs always look like they feed in for something. Like, come on man. Just give me another hit, man. She starts getting that look. She starts like she's not shaking yet. Thank God. Um, but anyways, a couple of these morning djs with a classic, like they just taught like to call you up, be like, hey bill, how you doing? Uh, So-and-so from K, whatever. Believable, blah, blah. Yeah. So listen, we're going to be talking here in about, uh, about a minute coming out of this commercial. Is there anything, any subjects you want me to hit on? Uh, and thing, uh, you want me to steer you towards I, you know, whatever I'm talking about. I love, love La and he is that guy. All right. We'll be on a right at the end of this break and then all of a sudden it just goes,

Speaker 5:          00:07:54       wow. Yeah. Alec Bode Bell Scalar that have

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       it. Also, you just like, dude, what happened to the guy I was just fucking talking to

Speaker 5:          00:08:07       drab to add his age. 18. We have a rough to add. We got some laps coming your way.

Speaker 4:          00:08:13       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:08:13       Cut. Went to the local Yuck, Yuck. Fuck, fuck bond. We got bill, but have a lab. Well, what's been on your mad?

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       Um, I almost said it to the guy, be like, dude, what happened to the guy I was just talking to five minutes ago? Um, other than that, the rest of them have been fine. I have no fucking idea what I'm doing here. But anyways, I'm getting ready to, I'm ready to, um, to do this tour here, going through Canada. And uh, you know, I had those pick shows last week, so I feel like I might have been doing spots around town. I'm fucking ready to go. I'm going to be doing the treadmill by the way. My Home Gym, the gym that I'm going to have at home, they're a [inaudible] doing the floor. It's a three day process cause I got the fucking the, what's it called? It's, I got the, it's called the lava finish. Assam Shit. I know. Stupid fucking name, but it looks sick, man. It's fucking, it's got to look shiny and clean, exciting and new.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       Lift some weights and become a shredded freckled con. He's Bill Burke. He's tired of looking like a sack of mashed potatoes. He's going to do some tips. Walked down the street shirtless and get sun poisoning. Um, yes. Everything's coming. So today, all the gym shit is dropping off today. Right. Which was so fucking funny. Cause today I'm going to leave. So it's coming ups and they're just like a, you know, basically, you know we're going to be there sometime between 3:00 AM and 12 midnight. Could you just try to be home in? Of course I'm not going to be here now. I got to tell the lovely Nia and I was just like a sweetie, what did you have planned tomorrow? She's like, well I was going to go to the show. I was like, cancel it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       She got so fucking mad at me. [inaudible] all this stuff to do. It's like it's one fucking day to have a free gym for the rest of your life. Okay. You're going to get to go out there. You're going to listen. You're going to get to listen to your music as opposed to the gyms. Music. Now I know that you can put headphones on, but every has those ear buds and the fucking jamming in your ears and you're basically blowing out your ear drums, giving yourself tinnitus or tetanus. However the fuck you say it. Um, cause you don't want to listen to, uh, what's that song? They always play a, we are soul to soul, right?

Speaker 5:          00:10:37       It takes two to make a thing go wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       You know, they play that for some reason Jim music stopped in the early nineties. That girl is poison. They don't even play shit like that. Did they stay place?

Speaker 5:          00:10:51       I don't want to fall in love,

Speaker 2:          00:10:54       you know, like songs like he goes, is that Banana Rama, Huda Gouda. Fuck, I remember this song, you start thinking of the chick you were dating at the time. You start thinking about all the fucking, all the time. Oh, who's getting who the chick you wanted to date but didn't have the balls to, so you hooked up with that fucking monster who is working in customer service, right. To be a little more accurate here. Um, yeah, I, I don't like, uh, I'm not into that shit. So anyways, so she has to, she the poor things gotta be home all day today. You know, with any luck, it's actually between, like they said, between 10 30 or 10 and five or some shit. So hopefully I'm really hoping that it's gonna. Um, it's gonna come early, you know what I mean? For the, uh, the amount of pouting that she did about, you know, you know what's so funny too, is whenever somebody says they can't do something and they go, why, why, what are you doing? And then they tell you what to do and it's like, yeah, you're not doing shit. You know, cause you're so focused on what you want them to do for you. It's just like, yeah, you know, I, I lost my passport and somebody found his ID. He didn't do that tomorrow. Yeah. I have a dialysis. I don't know if I told you I have, you know, double kidney failure, so I have to do it. If I don't do this, I'm gonna die. You can't put it off the fucking eight hours for me.

Speaker 6:          00:12:13       Wait, come on.

Speaker 2:          00:12:15       It's kind of going into that mode. Um, but anyways, Jesus Christ, who the fuck? I don't even want to look. Who the fuck am I Bruins playing next? It's funny when the Bruins are winning, you know, kind of paying attention. But whenever they were in trouble, that's when I fucking sit down and watch because I'm a real fan. I'm the, I'm there during the bad times. That's half the reason why I watch so many games this year. I was just there going like, well, they got rid of the whole fucking team. You know, this is going to be a tough year. So, all right, I'm going to see a, I don't know. I'm a fucking nerd. Like I watch, I like watching the, the rebuilding of a team so you can be there. I remember when they brought that guy up, dude, I fucking called it. How about the fucking filthy flyers?

Speaker 2:          00:12:58       They all the capitals. Hey, capital fans, you guys finally gonna fucking push through a you east coast San Jose Sharks. You ever gonna make the fucking finals? Can you do that for your God damn fans? Huh? Um, all right, let's look up the Bruins here. Scores, news, video stats, standing schedules, players. Fuck are the teams teams. There we go. Oh by the way, I've been going onto that French site. I've been figuring shit out. Um, I'm sticking with the dude. I'm like 33 33 days in here. Alright, watch episode 12 during an off day in California. Well the hell is this guy frank for Trento and the Bruins. Rookies explore La. Oh, rough stretch of the ice improves with a win over the leafs. Why? I don't understand watching these fucking soap operas about your Goddamn teams, you know, behind enemy lines or whatever the fuck they were always doing. What do they do that in the NFL?

Speaker 6:          00:14:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       You know, jockish what is somethings like unnecessary roughness, what do they call it? What does that thing, that fucking thing they do on HBO where Rex Ryan's like, Hey, we'll beat any fucking team and it's fucking league. You know that he gets fired a fuck. Our next game is tomorrow night it gets to St Louis Blues and then on Monday we play the fucking Blackhawks. Both of those are away games. Then we have the hurricanes, then we have the Redwings and then we have Ottawa.

Speaker 6:          00:14:41       Fuck yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       this is fucking unbelievable. Are We? Are we going to blow this? Oh wait, what the fuck was that story about what we got there? What we go here. This is some rookie. Why can't you fast forward your way through the Goddamn, I don't want to watch episode 12 of rookie sitting on a fucking beach in La talking about hockey. I don't give a shit. I thought they was showing me some new prospect that Bruins have. God knows, but bring them up. We could use them. Ninth annual cuts for a cause. Everybody gets say head shaved and hopefully at least you know, half of one half of 1% will actually go to the fucking cause through what? I'm so down on every goddamn charity now. That'd be fun. I mean, I have to be honest with you. I've done charities my entire fucking career, but I have never seen just the sheer number of charity. Oh, there it is. Hey, all right. Going to call you back. Talk to you. In a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:15:44       All right. I'm back. Just knocked out another two and I am done. Probably talk politics too much on that last one. Everybody wants to talk politics. I got Sally and Bella. Yeah. That with all this stuff, let's go out and politics. There's gonna be a great solidly Uncle Bait. It's like, yeah, no, it really isn't. And this one for some reason is depressed the shit out of me. You know what I mean? Jesus Christ, eh? It's just, you know, I'll tell you right now, you can take that Donald Trump. You can want him up in a ball. Okay? You sticking right up. You know who's who? Huh? You roll her down the street into the fucking garbage bin. All right? And then you fucking, then you gotta take Bernie Sanders, right? And you've got to give him that gun that fucking Scarface had at the end of the fucking movie.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       And then you just gotta send him in. You know, you got to send them into one of those banker fucking meetings and he just comes it when, if know when they're doing the, the annual international bankers slash family picnic, right? So you've got everybody there, you've got the evil cuts, and then you have the spawn of the evil cuts and you just got to go in there. I mean, even then, right? What are you going to do? Let's just say we buy into the fairytale that everybody who's super fucking rich is fucking evil. And then regular people were fucking good people. What will, you know? Then we'll have their level of power, then we move up and then we become them, right? And then, you know, you know it's going to happen. You're going to be here, you're gonna have power. You're gonna have influence here.

Speaker 2:          00:17:20       Come though, right? Did it come the whores? It comes to temptation. There's the pile of gold. You're supposed to be watching for everybody else. You know, you could do the right thing or you could go out and get yourself. You fucking Bentley, you Lamborghini, you could stay with your wife or you could start banging at 22 year old Victoria's secret model. You know, decisions. Yeah. Becomes tough. You know, and it did this, it's like an earthquake when the earth splits, right? And your morals are on one side and all the whores in the gold are on the other and it's very hard. You know, you gotta jump over early, jump over early or it get you, you go, you go too far down and then it's just, what can you tell? You're just caught up in it if fucking caught up in it, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:24:09       I watched the first one just cause I want to see them dramatize whatever he was doing in the back of the Bronco. And I can't, I tell you, as much as the tragedy happens, whenever I see clips of that, it always makes me think like, dude, I would love a white full size bronco. That's such a bad ass vehicle. It's big, it's safe. You know what's great about those, those full sized Broncos back in the day was the a, I've talked about this before. What do you call the, the, the middle area between the front two bucket bucket seats or captains chairs, I believe they used to call them. Um, what I loved about the console there in the middle, when you open that thing up, that was big enough that if you insulated it, you could throw ice in there and have a 12 pack of Budweiser.

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       You know, they make it so hard to drink and drive and enjoy yourself. You know, nowadays, back in the day, if you had a big truck like that, okay. You know, your, your biggest problem was how am I gonna What Am I gonna pee into while I continued driving down the street, taking everybody's life into my hands. You know, I shouldn't even say that. A friend of mine got fucking hit by a drunk driver and I ain't doing like fucking 90. Her Damn car looked like it was torn in half. And I got to tell you the way they make these fucking cars nowadays, it's amazing. Oh, by the way. So I found more information on the 27 Lincoln Continental. Evidently it's going to start at like, like 45 grand or something like that. They're trying to take out the Mercedes Benz e-class and rather than going performance and that they're trying to go elegance.

Speaker 2:          00:25:41       Like we're a little more, you know, you ride on a cloud over here as opposed to the, Whoa, Whoa, I have a fucking Mercedes-Benz. I don't know if that's the right way to go. But, um, I also talked to the guy who, um, who rebuilt my truck, um, and I, I called him up. I said, hey, this is the prototype, the concept card has the suicide doors. He goes, oh my God, that looks fucking sick and all that type of shit. And I go, they're not making them that way. He goes, I was like, can you do if I buy this car and I ship it to you, can you fucking put suicide doors in it? He goes, I got it. You know, he had to look it up. He said, basically, you're making the car a lot more unsafe. You're weakening the overall frame.

Speaker 2:          00:26:25       When you take out that middle piece, that's between the front and the second, uh, in the back door, the B frame, fucking post, whatever the fuck he called it. Um, and I'm thinking like, you know what, I haven't been in an accident. You know, I drive like a fucking old man. I can take out the middle fucking the B beam post fucking thing, whatever the fuck you call it. Right. You know, I feel like it's like, you know, when you have to get a permit, like you can knock down a wall yourself in your house and interior wall, as long as it's not a load bearing wall. I feel like that's what I would be knocking out on my continental. So then I would have like this, the suicide doors, led lights, that thing would look fucking sick. And then I would like rear end a smart car and I'd go through the fucking windshield, or I'd just go into a spin and I'd be objected out.

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       Those two food, those two like cool doors. So, um, I dunno, you would think this day and age if they, if they want it to, is that way suicide doors went away where they considered not safe. I learned that doing the Seinfeld comedians in cars where I asked him two times, like an idiot. I go, why can't they make cars that look cool like this anymore? And he basically answered saying, because of the safety regulations are so strict that they're basically basically creating in such a small space, all of them, um, that they're all gonna kind of look the same. And then we saw another car and I said, look at that thing. I was like, why? Why can't they, why can't they make cars like that anymore? And Jerry just went, I already answered that question. It felt like such a fucking dope. Um, anyways, so, you know, it's funny as I just talked to some people on the radio in St Louis and uh, I was telling them how, how much I was not looking forward to watching my team having to try to get a point or two off of them that's coming up Friday.

Speaker 2:          00:28:24       And uh, they were like, well, you know, who knows, maybe when you come out here, St Louis will be in the playoffs, she can go to a game. And I was like, that was the one happy hockey thought I've had in the last, I'm not going to lie to you like I was, I've been so busy that I didn't even notice like the first three games that we lost. Um, and also like I wasn't, I'm not one of those guys that looks at the standings. I just knew we were three seats. I'm like, all right, so we're in, I'll watch, you know, as many games as I can towards the end of the season and I'll enjoy us the first round of the playoffs, I'm going to be sitting there, right. My Budweiser, my little shorty there, right. A little fucking thing at Jamieson, they have one of those up period.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       Right. So by the end of it, I'm either like, you know, happy that we won or I just passed out drunk. You know, if we start to lose the game, then I do two to Budweisers and two Jameson's in the third period. Then you just, you fall asleep and the next day you wake up and you're so fucking hung over, you don't give a shit that you lost. You just trying to get yourself physically back to where you need to be. That's how I do it. That's the way an alcoholic doesn't. I don't do that. Okay. You fucking literal cuts. Why would somebody do something like that? So anyways, I am going to be in Wednesday, tomorrow night. Oh, let me read the dates to wrap up the podcast here. Well, the first half of it before we then listened to some Andrew [inaudible] mood music and then we move into some of the classic stuff, um, from back in the day from podcasting back in yesteryear.

Speaker 2:          00:29:49       All right, so I'm going to be at the coliseum. It's seizes, doesn't that sound impressive? It's probably a 40 seat room. Um, I'm going to be there. Uh, tomorrow night, April 1st. Oh, April falls, April 2nd. I'm going to be at the Casino Roma in Ramah, Ontario. Wherever the fuck that is that I'm going to be at TD placed stadium in Ottawa, Ontario. And then I'm doing the lol festival in sub Sudbury Arena Ontario, which is actually a, uh, it's a minor league hockey arena. The way they, you know, they set it up so you can still do standup in it too. I'm not like fucking center ice. It's not get crazy here. Huh. And then later on this month, the 22nd 23rd and 24th of April, I'm going to be doing a run St Louis, Missouri, Kansas City, Missouri in Ames, Iowa. I have not been to Iowa since I did the rich bitch tour with Charlie Murphy and Darnell Rawlings way back in the day.

Speaker 2:          00:30:48       And I believe we did one of the penguins comedy clubs. And that's the last time I was there. I am so excited to go to Iowa in April. I've never, the only time I've ever been to Iowa has always been the dead of fucking winter. And all the crops are cut down. And it's like you're walking on the surface of the moon. It's overcast and all of that. And I told you for the longest time, I was like, how did slip not come from out here? Like my idea, I should say, of what Iowa was, you know, just, you know, beautiful pony tailed girls running through fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:31:22       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:31:24       fucking stocks of corn. You know, if their flannel shirts tied off going, hey yo Galen, you know, I'm just the girl next door does everything. They got a southern accent, you know, apple pies in the window. Like that's what I pictured. And then you get there and you're like, oh my God, this is what Armageddon looks like going to fucking Iowa in the middle of January and February. I'm telling you, you've never seen anything like all the crops are cut down. The gray sky meets the baron earth and you're like, I get it. I get slipknot, I get math, I understand madness. I get this. This is fucking insane. So I'm so excited to go there and actually see it when it's lush. And I watched like, wow, these people feed the country. I want to see that. All right. So anyways, looking forward to that. Um, anyways, so that is the podcast. Can I say anyways one more fucking time? That is the podcast. Uh, thank you guys for listening. Have a wonderful weekend. Yukons and I will talk to you on Monday and um, thank you to everybody that's going to come out to the shows here in Canada. Okay. All right. I'll see you

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:33:21       who's at big going on on a Minnesota with that weird last name that has like three letter bs and an n in it or some shit. I don't fucking know. Anyway, let's plow ahead with the podcast. This is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, March 1st a that aunties door and um, yeah, I had a hell of a fucking weekend out there in Houston, Texas. I want to thank everybody who came out to the Improv and um, I had great shows Friday night that led into Saturday night and Saturday night. I think I might've had two of the best shows I've had in recent memory. Um, they would just, everything sort of clicked. I kind of, I was sitting in this restaurant, um, eh, this is, this is how clean living I am. Okay. It's right before 7:00 AM I have been a salad with fucking a chicken breast in it.

Speaker 7:          00:34:13       Right. I got my laptop. I'm typing out this fucking script, finishing it up, drinking a glass of water, getting the shit out of the way. And I just remember like having this feeling like this, this is what Tony Robbins does. You know, that's how he has that fucking psycho. Terminally happy fucking smile on his face, you know? And um, I don't know. I realized some shit in that moment. I brought it to stage and started riffing. The whole fucking thing worked and I recorded it. But the beautiful thing about the universe is when you hit something great happens, something else has to balance it out. Like I get to see Peyton manning fuck up the Superbowl and thus make me feel vindicated. And then two weeks later, a crushing fucking overtime loss. It wasn't crushing cause they used, they used to beat us by fucking, these will be this like seven to one.

Speaker 7:          00:35:04       All right, you got to admit, okay, you can hit a Fox. Remember that back in the day it was a joke. Our hockey was a joke. First of all, 90% of the people in the league were all from Canada. Granted there were only six fucking teams, but still, um, and you guys used to crush us and now we're breathing down your neck and you better enjoy that gold medal. Cause I got a feeling that's the last one you're going to be fucking having for awhile. How do you like that? Huh? Nah, you wait till fucking next year buddy. Now can you guys handle that shit talk and all right. Anyways, so twice this, I had incidents with people in the crowd. Um, and both of them were women. And uh, I'm the first to tell you that I do have fucking issues with women, but the, uh, the first night, um, I was on stage and there was this woman right down.

Speaker 7:          00:35:52       I don't know if it's stage left to stage right from where I'm fucking at at stage left. All right? So I think that's the proper terminology. Why the fuck do you guys need to know stage left stage, right? You're in the crowd. You know, I go down to midas. Do I need to know what fucking wrench they're gonna use? I don't need, okay, so stage left. All right, I'm looking down and, uh, this fucking girl is, she's, you know, she's talking, continue on with my jokes. It looked down and she still talking. So finally I say, hey, it is sweet tits.

Speaker 7:          00:36:25       Why don't you, uh, what's the problem? What are you talking about? And then she does the usual, hey ma, you know, I wouldn't say she was attractive. If she was in from a small town, she'd be a Hottie, you know, just out of percentages. But, um, so she did the usual like, what, what I have a, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. You know, 10 minutes later I look back, she's still fucking talking. It gets a little more heated. I basically went to her table about six times until I finally told her to shut the fuck up and then I don't really even fucking remember. Then all of a sudden, next thing you know, she's hammered and she's getting kicked out when I got like five minutes left in my show. So she threatened to sue the place and all this type of shit.

Speaker 7:          00:37:04       Now, usually that's the end of the night. You know, the whole crowd is fucking clapping as she's leaving because she's been fucking annoying. Everybody around them who paid to see the show. All right, so a, usually that's the end of it. But you know what this psycho did. She actually sent a letter to the Improv and she tried to pretend that she wasn't herself. She tried to pretend that she was an impartial member of the audience who completely agreed with her and thought that I was a fucking idiot. So, uh, I want to read you a little bit of this fucking letter here. Um, to whom it may concern, I attended bill burrs first show on Friday the 26th and was utterly appalled by his performance. I love comedy. Oh, this is what you always have to do whenever you bitch. Um, and you're not there in person, so they can't see what a radiant human being you are.

Speaker 7:          00:37:59       You have to then after you state your bitch, you then have to fucking show how easygoing you are as a human being. So anyway, she saw my show. She was utterly appalled by it, by my performance, and then she goes, I love comedy and I certainly expect there to be rudeness, crudity and what can be offensive topics. That's what comedy is all about. It makes it fun. That being said, okay, now she's established how fucking cool and laid back she is back to trash and old fucking heavy duty. Here she goes. That being said, Bill Bird took it way too far and he was quite unprofessional to say the least. While there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at. Yeah, that was the part where you were sober, your fucking lightweight. That was the beginning of the show when you weren't fucking on your ninth fucking drink and you actually paying attention to the show.

Speaker 7:          00:38:49       So yeah, initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at and I think this person is trying to write as if it's medieval times and I should be like fucking holding this thing like a goddamn scroll. I know that isn't mean evil ish, but she's used, she's doing that biblical thing. What she's using extra fucking words to try to sound intelligent. Well, initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at instead of me. At first it was funny. Um, anyways, the show ended up, the show ended up being a complete disappointment. Okay for it. Okay. This is our complaint here for at least 30 minutes. He, blasphemy, God and the name of Jesus Christ. He outright degraded the Catholic religion. All right. Now that's complete bullshit. I only blessed to meet God, the name of Jesus Christ and the Catholic religion for about seven minutes.

Speaker 7:          00:39:36       30 minutes. What am I fucking George Carlin. I can't talk about anything but 30 minutes. Maybe you weren't so fucking hammered. You dumb cunt. You know, you'd have a better perception of, of, of how much time had elapsed. Oh Jesus. All right, let's continue. Although I'll get this. This isn't another thing. Another thing was she's, she's pulling this move again. He outright degraded the Catholic religion, although I do not belong to this religion. So now you supposed to be like, wow, she's not even part of that religion. And even she found it offensive. Have you guys picked up on that? On Youtube at all? Like when someone wants to trash Obama, um, they'll say like a Bama is the worst president ever. And then they'll write and I'm a Democrat, you know, like you can prove it either way. Just trying to cut people off the past before they go, fuck you, you Fox News watching right wing, whatever, you know.

Speaker 8:          00:40:30       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:40:31       Women need to shut the fuck up. And I'm a girl, that dumb shits. Okay. So evidently she was, she was offended and she's not even a, she's not even Catholic anyway, she said it was offensive and what he said went on and on again, while this type of thing should be accept a expected, he took it way too far and there was a young lady who like I and my friends was becoming offended. Yeah, of course she was because she's you, you fucking psycho. Can you believe that? She thinks I'm this fucking stupid. I don't know what this point is. Probably not obvious to you guys, but wait till I finish the rest of this. All right. I'm probably going to sound like some maniac here, but I don't give a fuck. I said, there was a young lady who like I and my friends was becoming offended and said a few words instead a few words to someone at our table, you fucking lie and sack a Twat.

Speaker 7:          00:41:23       Anyways, a she, he said when he rudely addressed her, that's when I said a lady, I guess lady is rude. Hey Lady, could you do me a favor and look at the show at some point? Um, he said when he rudely addressed her, she told him that she was Catholic. That never happened. He had no apologies or considerations. Just utter disrespect. Okay. First of all, she never said that. She never said she was Catholic and if she did, she said, it's so quietly that I couldn't hear it. So how the fuck could this random fucking woman in the crowd here what she said, Oh fucking thing. It's going to make me mad again. All right, let's continue. After he finally got off that subject, his show just got worse. This is when she's on about her six strength. It appeared to my friends and I that he may have been getting heat from some of the audience and that he felt uncomfortable.

Speaker 7:          00:42:15       This may very well be the reason why he continued to pick on the lady [inaudible] this is why I'm picking on her, not because she, I as I'm doing my act, by the way, I keep looking down and she's getting some sort of Martini thing that looks like there's a beer in it. I don't know what the fuck it was. It's one of those chick fucking drinks, you know? Like what if we take root beer and second fucking roofie in it, you know, she was drinking those things. Okay. And uh, so now she goes in this very Mel, uh, he goes, this may very well be the reason why he continued to pick on that lady even at one point telling her to shut the fuck up. Yeah. I told you to shut the fuck up because you were talking the entire time. You twat anyways.

Speaker 7:          00:42:58       Ah, this is downright unprofessional. Who said that someone can not say a few words to people at their table. Did you see how obvious this is that this is this the actual fucking woman who would give a fuck this much that you would write three pages. They were quietly speaking and not making any noise whatsoever. Oh, yet you heard her say that she was Catholic on the other side of the stage. There was another table talking quite a bit more and they were louder due to the drinks yet he did not pick on them. Do you want a fucking, all right, let me just fucking relax here. This is even funny anymore. Like I totally lost. I've, I've lost the whole humor in this. This is fucking making me so mad. They were more disruptive than anything, although he of course made jokes about it.

Speaker 7:          00:43:41       All right. There was this table next to me. They were also drinking, but they were more doing that church thing where I would say something funny and then they was sorta like fucking repeating it. So they were a little bit rowdy, but they were acceptable. This woman who was fucking out drinking everyone at the other table had basically essentially her fucking back to me to the point that if I fucking punched her in the back of the head, I would have got two minutes for boarding pat. Possibly a fucking game misconduct. Alright, there's something for you. We'll Olympic hockey fucking people. Anyways, let's, let's continue here. Actually, that would be roughing, wouldn't it? Let's say I took the mic stand and I turned it sideways. I could have cross checked around the fucking neck. All right, here we go. Now we are convinced that his wrong demeanor was due to his discomfort. After realizing that he had offended some of the audience in order to justify himself and ease any tension coming from the audience member. He said something along the lines, don't listen to me. I'm just an idiot up here speaking. Pray for me please. That was obviously a demonstration of his uneasiness. That's this is, this is how drunk she was. What I was doing was I was, I was telling people in the crowd that if they were religious that I respected their religion. All right?

Speaker 9:          00:44:51       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:44:51       I just ha, I just personally don't buy into it. Okay. So I'm only stopping right now to say this because I know some of you, you get so religious, you get so into it that you can add, you get so holy that you can actually commit murder. You know, God's usually as a tool or you know, vengeance. I think that was the line I used. I said, okay, you shouldn't be getting mad at me. You should pray for me to help me see the light. And everyone got a huge fucking laugh at it about it. Okay. And this lady is basically us. I can't wait to email her back. I don't know. I, I've, I've flip flopped a hundred times in my head what I was gonna say.

Speaker 9:          00:45:31       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:45:31       You know, I just can't wait to, uh, I think I'm just gonna write back something really quickly. Okay. Like, Ruth, you actually pretending to not be the dumb drunk bitch in the crowd is one of the funniest things I've ever read. Something to that effect. Basically let her know that I know that it's her and I'll see you next year. At the Improv, you're con. Um, anyways, I am very supplies prize at your club. This is where she tries to, um,

Speaker 9:          00:45:53       yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:45:54       This is where she tries to get me banned from the club. I'm very surprised that a, your club hosted this comedian. It was a true disappointment. I am embarrassed as I was the one who suggested the Improv when my friends and I were planning to on seeing a comedy show. I do hope that you will consider not having this comedian back as he gives your club a bad name. If this is a, this had been my first time to the Improv, I never would've returned. You might consider hiring some local talent. There are several good comedians in the area. We are good friends with one of them. If you like his name, I'll be happy to give it to DPP a bit. Bit. All right. As for the lady who we picked on, she and her table were unjustifiably asked to leave. There was no grounds on having them escorted from the show right in the middle of it.

Speaker 7:          00:46:34       That's how drunk she was. She got escorted out 50 minutes into my one hour set and she's like, she was escorted out in the middle of it. Do you understand how drunk this woman was? I talked for Geez about Jesus for 30 minutes. No, actually it was seven minutes. I was escorted out in the middle. No, you were actually escorted out 50 minutes into the show when you were on. You're fucking six drunk. You're drunk. Can't, there were no grounds of on having them escorted from uh, from the show right in the middle of it. Again, they were not being disruptive or at all this, this, this impartial person just wants to keep talking about how innocent this fucking lady is that she never met. If it hadn't been for bill burr picking on them, no one would've even noticed him. Okay. The kids you tell, this is just the, the fucking drunk argument they had in the crowd and in the car on the ride home, the loud table.

Speaker 7:          00:47:19       And the other side though is the one that took away attention from his show. I do understand that it is private property and then anyone could be asked to leave at any time, but this was wrong to do. This is a time to do it. I personally believe that she should receive an apology from the Improv, but mostly from bill burr. That's clearly not my call. Just the thought. What a fucking, ah, I don't know. Did I take too long reading that fucking thing. There you go. You want to be a standup comedian? That's what the fuck you have to deal with. She's actually like a total fucking control freak. And what happened that night was she completely lost on all levels. You know it's weird. You become like a part time psychologist as you're breaking down the crowd as a comedian and she sat at the power position at the table.

Speaker 7:          00:48:05       The table is at like a fucking, we'll say like a 30 degree angle coming in stage left. This is going to get technical. All right, you fucks. Don't don't, don't leave me here. She, you know, she didn't sit at like the the chair furthest away. If you sit furthest away, everybody you're at the table with has the back of their head to you. So then when you want to fucking talk, it's, it's a difficult time. What she did was not only did she sit in the first chair, she sat on the first chair closest to me, so the, so all she had to do is turn around. She had the whole fucking tables attention. And when she stood up, when she went to leave, her whole table stood up like a bunch of fucking minions. You know, like you remember that dude, he used to carry the fucking umbrella for puffy.

Speaker 7:          00:48:45       That's how they all got up. It was pathetic. And people like that surround themselves with fucking weak people like that because any normal people, person, you know, think about that. All you guys listen to right now, if you're, if your buddy was being a drunk fucking asshole and got booted from the club, would you get up and leave immediately? Stand up like the fucking general just got up. I mean, I guess maybe you would. Could you be, well, Kay's drunk. Maybe he's going to go fucking walk out in a p on a cop or something. I guess maybe. I Dunno. Anyways, you know, before I emailed her back, what do you guys think I should write back and come up with something clever other than calling her a con like I did. I think I'm just going, I'm going to write back something to the effect that I realized that it was her and um, I don't know.

Speaker 7:          00:49:26       I don't fucking know. Was that just a big waste of time? Should I not have been bothered with all of that? You know, I don't know then and I had another incident with another fucking person. I Dunno. I, I have issues with, with a beautiful women. I really do. This is actually a bit I want to do on stage and I'll just, I'll, maybe I'll do part of it for you here at bay. The basic idea, I just, I don't respect them on a certain level. I feel like I had to do something to achieve in life. All they had to do was basically they were born beautiful. This, it's really not an accomplishment. I guess you go to the gym, you stay beautiful past a certain age. It is an accomplishment I guess, but you know, I dunno for, in order to, as a guy to get around beautiful women, you have to accomplish all this shit in life and all they have to do to get to where the fuck you're at. After accomplishing all this shit is basically take a shower and feather their hair back like Farrah Fawcett and they're in the fucking VIP. You know? I also don't like them because a, I don't know. I don't know if they're smart. They, if they're smart, they're absolutely stunning though. I have to admit that. But you know,

Speaker 6:          00:50:36       okay.

Speaker 7:          00:50:37       If they're, if they're dumb, that's like, it's like you got a Lamborghini, but you find out it has a four cylinder in it. Or even worse, my fucking hybrid. Did that make any fucking sense? You know, they have that one default emotion. Oh my God. And they give 58 different reads. You know, if they see something cute like a little puppy, they're like, oh my God. You know, if you do something sweet from, Oh my God,

Speaker 6:          00:51:03       okay,

Speaker 7:          00:51:04       you know, you do something that they fucking hate. Oh my God, fucking idiots. They got three words floating around right

Speaker 4:          00:51:11       there. And then with VIP, you know, [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:51:54       and somebody said, uh, was actually saying like, I was trying to figure out why I was finding these fucking women's so attractive other than the obvious that they were good looking women. This guy actually said, hey, bill, uh, beside the obvious hot women vigorously scrubbing the floor, I really set that up bad. He's saying, this is why men find women curlers attractive. I just blew that joke. He said, besides the obvious hot women vigorously scrubbing the floor, I have to, yeah, you so deserved a huge laugh on that and I just fucked you out of it. I'm sorry about that. Um, anyways, he says, I have figured out why we love watching this so much. When they release that stone, the way they let it slide out of their hand is reminiscent of the way a skillful woman releases your cock after delivering a massive hand job.

Speaker 7:          00:52:43       First of all, I hope you're a surfer cause that's the only reason why to the massive hand job, Bruh. I'm fucking massive hands job. Or maybe you just have a fucking bit or maybe I'll just, you have a fat cock. I Dunno. So anyways, she goes, uh, they don't drop it. Don't push it. Just let it slide out naturally as I go to sleep with my boxes around my ankles. Oh, I forgot. That was creepy. I know. I read it. I was supposed to just read the beginning joke cause I thought the joke was fucking great. I forgot the fucking picture in his, Ugh guys, with those fucking insect looking legs on guy's legs, like insects with that fucking hair all over skinny fucking legs were a mess. Fucking mess. I'm like praying mantis legs. Anyways, I'm a long time ago. I talked about unacceptable. This is when, you know, the podcast sucks and I'm just plowing from fucking topic to topic and there's just no sort of a no segway other than dead silence. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:54:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:54:19       did somebody do a Bob Dole impression? [inaudible] just the worst. Can I tap out at this fucking point 37 minutes in a bad wedding stories. I'm, hey bill, I haven't listened to your podcast since the beginning. Decided it was about time I emailed you and told you how much I enjoy it. Thank you very much. Uh, [inaudible]. Okay, let's get to the, uh, let's get to the marriage thing. Um, okay. I got a marriage story when I was 23. I was dating a girl and she got pregnant. Ah Dude. Okay. Uh, so we decided to get married. Okay. Stupid. Fucking move number two, even though a month before this I was thinking about dumping her ass. Stupid mistake number three. Actually that was the smart move. That was, that was the three card Monte right there. Don't knock her up. Don't fucking marry you're white. Knock her up. Marry her dumper ass.

Speaker 7:          00:55:17       You know which one had the marble? You fucked up. All right, so all the plans are made, our families meet each other. Okay. Just cause I, you know, had to do that stupid three card, Monte joking, a desperate attempt to try to be remotely funny. At this point. You don't, it was, I have a blue wind screen this week. I'm going to blow that. I'm going to, I'm going to blame it on that one. You know my fucking dog ate the orange one, so I'm going to blame it on the blue wind screen. Anyway. So basically, sky's 23 years old. He knocks up this fucking girl. He decides to get married even though he did. He thought about dumping our month before. So anyway, so all the plans are made. Um, families meet each other, invitations are sent out, all that bullshit. So three days before the wedding, I'm watching some stupid movie where this guy tells his other guy that his dad told him before his wedding.

Speaker 7:          00:56:04       It's never too late to change your mind, to which his friend says, but you're not married. And I guess it is. That's a laugh. So anyways, uh, so taking this as a sign from God that I just happened to be watching this movie. I canceled a wedding. Great. Fucking move. All right. Which is suffice to say, brought a shitstorm into my life. The worst part is that I actually felt so bad. I marry that check. Three months later I'll, dude, you were out. You were fucking out. So basically I was a pussy. Yeah, yeah, but too, that's a hard thing. You were dealing with a lot of shit at 23 your parents were crying. She was knocked up. Yeah. I wouldn't say you were pussy. You gave into peer pressure anyways, we were married for seven years with every year being worse than the year before. So we're divorced.

Speaker 7:          00:57:00       So we're divorced now. So I guess I should have gone with my gut to wrap this up, I got a little gripe with, with chicks. My ex used to ask me when the marriage was going down, if I could go back, would I not meet her? Which I would say, fuck yeah, I would avoid you like the plague. Which she would say, uh, but w at which point she would say, but you wouldn't have our two kids, don't you love them? And then he would say, yeah, but then I'd say, but I would never have met you. So I would have never had the kids. So in that scenario, the kids aren't even a thought. This of course would lead to a huge fight about my lack of caring, a moral to the story. Don't use logic when talking to chicks. Aright. That's actually not the moral to the story.

Speaker 7:          00:57:49       What it is, is you got to think how women think, you know, which you know, if you're lucky, at some point when you're 90, you'll know, you'll understand 10% of what the fuck is going on in that brain. Um, basically when she's asking you that, she was asking that, I would guess one of two reasons. One, she was insecure that, you know, you knocked her up and then you married her and you know that you were gonna marry her. Then you broke it off and then you fucking married her. Uh, believe it or not, I'm sure that's not how she dreamed of getting married. She probably dreamed of meeting her soulmate and they were so hopelessly in love that everyone in the crowd had tears in their eyes for, they never found a love. Soap is great as there. She could have been thinking that and she wanted you to reassure her or she probably was just banging you, you know, it didn't want to fucking marry you and didn't think that you were the one either.

Speaker 7:          00:58:45       And all of a sudden she got knocked up and she's probably sitting there looking at the Sadie your fucking head. One mornings you're eating pancakes, trying to find where in the world she loves you. You know, on what fucking level, you know, just watching your temples going in and out as you're chewing, just fighting that fucking urge to slam a toaster over your fucking head. You know, just wondering how the hell did I end up with this fucking guy? Why did I say Yes to this guy? Why did I let him fucking drop a fucking load in me? What is wrong with, and just trying to make the fact that you had these two kids justice justice enough. You know, that's what the fuck was probably going on. But uh, I dunno dude, you didn't really talk about how much of a nightmare the wedding was that that was the meat of the story there. I think you at the beginning and the end, but what are you thinking is she's coming down the aisle. What is your family thinking? You're knocked her up and then you dumped her and yet now you're like, oh fuck it all marry or anyways, and you're only 23 they know you don't want to do it. Those weren't tears of joy, my friend, you know, what are you thinking is you're up there, you know, was your Cumberbun like wringing wet with flop sweat as you was standing up? I can't imagine that.

Speaker 6:          01:00:09       Ah,

Speaker 7:          01:00:11       has anybody ever just ran out the side door? Cause I can definitely see like, oh my God, I don't know what to say. How do I get out of this shit? And then just in a panic when they started,

Speaker 10:         01:00:21       Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,

Speaker 7:          01:00:29       you turned around looking, where is she a what? A fucked and I have some wedding music underneath this would've would've been hilarious stuff. I bet if I fucking prepared, you know, you're looking for the bitch, where the fuck is you? And then she comes around the corner and you're trying to make yourself lover and she comes around the corner and you just see that fucking face and you see those eyebrows and you know we're going to be touching by the time she's 40 and you just fucking run out the side door in those cheap tuxedo bowling shoes.

Speaker 6:          01:00:58       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:01:00       And you know what I mean? And you're in such a fucking panic, you know, there's no way that you're going to be able to get your car keys out in time, get them into the door, open the door, lock the door, and get in there. And it's like people are gonna be coming out running out of the church like some fucking Zombie movie is. You're trying to get your car started. I made the move there is you. If you're, anybody does that, don't go to your car. You keep running. Okay? Most people get married in the suburbs, so headed head for a wooded area. All right? Go Online. Learn how to turn your fucking Cumberbun into a tent. Hang out there for a couple of days. Let Shit cool off. Grow a beard. Come back to town, get some provisions that point you'll be so fucking filthy. You just another homeless guy wearing a suit.

Speaker 7:          01:01:50       You know what I mean? Just let her forget all about you and then maybe they'll think that you're mentally ill and then, uh, you know, one day you just show up on your mother's front steps and she faints her dad catches you and punches you in the face cause he's a former marine. You know, haven't we all seen this movie? I'm trying to say, run out the fucking door. Run out the fucking door if you're in that situation, during that situation. All right. Uh, Bill, longtime listener, first time writer, uh, got a wedding story to tell you. I'm 23 years old now. The 23 year old. I've been to a, here's one for you. Don't go to a wedding or get married at 23. They all seem to have bad stories. Um, I've been to a few weddings and let me start by saying in this story, it wasn't actually a wedding I witnessed.

Speaker 7:          01:02:35       It was a wicking, a Wiccan hand fastening. Okay. Now though, for those of you not familiar with the Wiccan religion, uh, I just want to state at this point, neither am I. Um, I can't remember if that's the one that actually has all those uh, pagan symbols that, you know, the Catholic Church then said that they were devil signs according to the, uh, fucking Rosetta Stone or whatever that fucking movie was. I read the book too. What the fuck is the name of that Davinci Code? Whatever it was called, a Wiccan hand fastening. And I know that because my sister didn't invite people to our wedding, she invited them to her hand. Fascinating. That's why he knew it was a Wiccan hand fastening and not a wedding because she said, I'd like to invite you to my hand. Fascinating. Jesus Christ. Um, he said, if you're 41, you still don't know what a hand fastening is.

Speaker 7:          01:03:33       Congratulations. Thank you. Because I didn't, so anyways, he goes, I'm 17 at the time, my sister's 23 or 24, we both still live with our parents are boyfriend and unemployed, alcoholic living off money. His mom left him when she died. Ah, there you go ladies. There you go. You don't have to settle for less when this guys like him out there. Um, anyways, um, the fuck am I, why didn't I make this tight, bigger? Jesus. What a flop this podcast is. So anyways, so this fucking alcoholic was over for dinner one night. He tapped his fork on a glass of few times to get everyone's attention. We were three feet from him and immediately my stomach knotted up because I knew this moron was about to say something stupid. You got gotta I got to meet you. You guys are fucking funny writers, man. Some really talented people. Listen to this fucking podcast. You guys write better than I do. Anyways, basically he announced his engagement to my sister in front of my mom and dad pulled out two onyx rings and they put them on each other's middle fingers. You know, I went to the Onyx Strip club and now Houston last night. How funny is that? Anyways, it was dead silent. And um, the look of a repressed horror on my mom's face was unmistakable. It was so awkward. So I just started clapping going Yay, quietly, because nobody else joined in.

Speaker 7:          01:04:58       Oh, that's great. Is that your role in the family? You're the person who always tries to make it better. Uh, God bless Ya. Anyways, it was just dead silence and my sister and her boyfriend kissing each other like everything was fine. A few months later I found out they were financing those rings and going into payments on them. Every, my sister's collecting child support and neither of them have a job and they are financing onyx hand fastening rings. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I can't believe there's more to this story. All right, here we go. Fucking knee deep. I got to go the rest of the way. All right. Anyway, so I finally, finally gets to their hand fastening day and they're doing the ceremony right on Newport beach. It's in the middle of the day on a, on Sunday in the summer, they didn't have, oh, they didn't reserve a piece of beach or anything. They just showed up and go, hey, let's have the wedding here.

Speaker 7:          01:05:59       Um, the family we had, oh fuck. I gotta sit closer to the damn screen. I can't read anymore. The family we have near the beach mostly all showed up. All the people who live near the beach mostly showed all. There were about 30 or 40 of us. None of us, none of us are dressed in beach clothes. Half of them are in suits and dresses. There are no chairs. There's not even an altar. Everybody's just standing around hot and they can't sit down because there's no chairs and they don't. They don't want to ruin their clothes. My sister shows up in an all black gown with a veil. The boyfriend is wearing like a Tux with his face painted like one of the misfits, kind of like a skeleton face. Jesus Christ. It sounds like the episode of the office. Anyways, they don't do any traditional wedding stuff.

Speaker 7:          01:06:45       They just go right up front of the crowd with their Wiccan priest or whatever. The wicked priest is basically just a friend of theirs. He reads a bunch of a bunch of stuff from a book in some other language. My sister and the boyfriend are responding in some other language. Nobody has any idea what's going on. Then all of a sudden the boyfriend pulls out this crazy looking knife with a what? A hilt. I don't know what that is. Uses it to cut my sister's Vale, then pokes the end of it into his finger until he's bleeding. He sticks the knife into the sand and wraps his bloody hand around my sister's neck while they kiss the stone. Hippy priest holds up his book and said something loud in that different language. I assume it was he equivalent equivalent of I now pronounce you husband and wife.

Speaker 7:          01:07:35       I'm sure being comedian. You've heard the sound of 50 people gasping simultaneously. Family members in suits and dresses are just walking away. At this point. A lifeguard saw with the boyfriend did with the knife called the cop and the day ended prematurely with him getting cuffed and driven away in a police cruiser. Jesus Christ. Anyways, thanks for the podcast. I really enjoy Jesus Christ. How about a fucking round of applause for that story? All right. I think I have to read up on the Wiccan religion. You know, one thing I did like about that, I did like the fact that they just showed up and just decided to have a wedding and they avoided all those other costs. Um, cause I wanted to say halfway

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       through that like, you know, they didn't have, they didn't reserve that piece of the beach or anything and I was thinking like, well, you never had to back in the day. You know what I mean? You just fucking had a wedding. There was, it wasn't like nine zillion fucking dollars. It didn't matter where you were, but I guess you have to do that now. Uh, because there's nine zillion people and uh, and bankers run the fucking world. Hey, speaking of that, did you get, somebody sent me an email the other day, evidently Europe elected a president. You hear that Europe elected a president, not England, not France, Europe, the entire continent now has a fucking president has one guy in charge of all of them. See that just like those three d TVs that are only a few months away, that new world daughter is going to be available right down at the best common sowed come and fucking soon.

Speaker 2:          01:09:07       If you go on to read about the, uh, the bailout, uh, rolling stone has a great article and, uh, usually I try to stay away from their politics because there's so brutally to the left. It's fucking ridiculous. Um, you know, they never trashed Democrats or when they do, it's so like light hand. They just doing it just because they trashed a republican so bad. They're trying to show that they're fair and balanced like those other fucking maniacs. Um, Fox News actually has a store now when you go through the airport, which I think is hilarious, they sell water and that type of shit. So I dunno. It's going to be, what is gonna be one fucking news channel. This is going to be one president and one fucking currency of money and you better do what they say.

Speaker 4:          01:09:49       That's going to be the end of it. My friends [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].
