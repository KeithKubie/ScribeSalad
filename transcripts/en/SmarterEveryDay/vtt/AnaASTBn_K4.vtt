00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.965
(whooshing)

00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:05.215
(smacking)

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.310
- What's up, I'm Destin,
this is Smarter Every Day.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.530
This is the tip of a bull whip

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.640
and that crack you hear is this
breaking the sound barrier.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.030
My question is why or how?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.000
Like, if you think about it,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
your arm's never leaving your body

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.580
and something's going faster
than the speed of sound

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.560
in just a few hundred milliseconds
and over several feet.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.710
That's a big deal.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.130
OK, now would be an excellent time for me

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.030
to explain April, April Choi.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.280
So April is an engineer
first and foremost.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.180
I think all this whip business

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.010
is just a reason for you to explore--

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.576
- Fluid dynamics?
- Fluid dynamics.

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:40.420
(cackling)
I really do.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.660
So April on the internet,
you may have seen her,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.320
Guinness Book of World Records whip stuff,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.153
she's good with whips.

00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:48.030
But what's really interesting
about April, is your brain.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.160
- There's something in fluid dynamics

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.270
known as the no-slip boundary condition.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.350
That means air molecules
that are right next

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.380
to this fluffy part stay
next to that fluffy part.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.340
- [Destin] And so, it's
pulling that air with it.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.550
- It depends whether or not you're using

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.030
a Lagrangian framework,
which centers on here,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.470
or an Eulerian framework that
centers on the overall mesh.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.303
- That's what I was thinking.

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:07.320
I was wondering if it was

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.640
a Lagrangian or Eulerian framework,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.020
but I wasn't going to say anything.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.060
The first thing we did
was create a new tip

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.850
for the bull whip and
attach it to the whip

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.100
and after that we set
up the camera system.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.510
The way we're getting this shot

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.150
is using the schlieren technique,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.410
and this is what took us
so long to coordinate.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.280
Basically, we have a
point-light source right here

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.400
and that light is coming
out, it's spreading out,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.770
it's hitting this mirror,
this parabolic mirror,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.720
and as it comes back, what it's doing

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.910
is it's converging to
this point right here.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.030
You can see there's the
light coming through

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.170
at the focal point.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.790
And then we've got red
and green gels right there

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.667
and (whip cracks).

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.709
(laughing)

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:47.980
That's scary.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.570
Go watch Derek's video on schlieren,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.760
it's better than this one.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.630
We're just gonna show you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.250
how a whip breaks the sound barrier.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.320
That is unnerving.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.433
After everything was set up,
we literally got crackin'.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.933
(whip cracks)

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.259
OK, that triggered.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.092
Let's see what it did.

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:09.810
We learned two major things
in my buddy's garage.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.370
First a question, though.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.160
What point in the whip extension

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800
do you think the crack happens?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.640
Growing up, I used to
play Castlevania a lot,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.060
so for me, it made sense
that the crack of the whip

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.410
would happen at full extension of the whip

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.810
'cause that's what you want to
do with the bad guys, right?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.480
You want to keep them as far
away from you as possible.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.770
When we set up a high-speed camera

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.900
expecting the whip to crack

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900
like it does in Castlevania, the shockwave

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.987
would always enter the field
of view before the whip did.

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:34.860
(thundering)

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.430
Therefore, it was clear
that the crack was happening

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.750
before the whip was fully extended.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.400
So it's cracking way back there.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.313
- It's cracking before we think.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.325
- I learned something.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:47.158
I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:47.991
I didn't know that either.

00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:49.780
- It actually happens as the whip unrolls,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.010
not at the end like I thought.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.920
And in order to visualize
what's happening,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.910
we switched from the overhand strike

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.350
to the sidearm strike.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.280
What you're about to see
here are two engineers

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.470
that have researched this stuff

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.350
and were totally blown away
because the experiment worked

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.610
and we're starting to see
things for the first time

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.250
that we totally didn't expect.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.620
OK.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.973
We are getting somewhere.

00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:12.287
(laughing)

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.093
(whooshing)

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.510
(thundering)

00:03:23.112 --> 00:03:24.790
(snapping)

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.290
The second thing that
we learned in the garage

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.240
is there may be a
mechanism that's causing it

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.858
to accelerate just before
breaking the sound barrier.

00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:31.691
(whip cracks)

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.800
Those strands right
there are not in tension.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.633
You see that?

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.230
- Yeah, they're just, it's chaos.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.756
- [Destin] And then there's this moment--

00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:39.748
- [April] Where they all come together.

00:03:39.748 --> 00:03:41.160
- [Destin] Where they all come together

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.570
and when it starts to pull,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.640
that's when the initial shockwave starts.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.220
- [April] So it's the collapse.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.367
- [Destin] The collapse
is when it happens.

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:49.410
- [April] And the drag
coefficient's going down.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.960
- The fact that we're
seeing a new mechanism

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.330
is a really big deal.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.260
So obviously, we have to
take this more seriously.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.400
We just figured out how whips work.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.990
We should totally publish this.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.823
- Yeah.

00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:00.010
- Whip shockwaves have been studied

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.980
from the experimental
perspective in Germany in 1998

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.760
as well as the theoretical perspective

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.040
at the University of Arizona in 2003.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.950
The Ernst-Mach Institute
paper, by the way,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.920
freakin' amazing.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.480
There's a dude in it that looks

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.960
like a moose wearing
bells and a clown suit.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.061
(laughing)

00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:15.894
I don't know what's happening.

00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:17.050
It's actually a great paper.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.883
You should totally read it.

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.030
They talk about wishing they
had a faster high-speed camera

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.740
so they could see what happens at the tip.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.650
Also, the paper at the
University of Arizona,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.350
they try to measure with math

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.820
the entire length of
the whip as it unrolls.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.680
They try to describe that movement.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.660
But what if we could design one experiment

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.030
that would do all of this?

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.580
Like all of it at the same time.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.210
It would measure the
three-dimensional position

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.870
of the wave as it goes down the whip.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.980
It could also measure the tip velocity

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.160
as it goes supersonic.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.110
What if we could do that?

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.750
And that's exactly what we're about to do.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.590
Under the guidance of my doctoral advisor,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.170
Dr. Kavan Hazeli at the University
of Alabama in Huntsville,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.010
we've assembled the team and we're about

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.500
to figure this junk out.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.570
We designed the experiment
and gathered together

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.320
in what's called the atom lab.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.050
It uses an array of cameras to track

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.790
anything with reflective tape on it.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.210
The way it works is essentially this.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.360
You have a camera and you have

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.330
a little infrared light around it, right?

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.170
If you have a piece of
reflective tape out there

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.580
and you shine the light
from the infrared camera

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.290
onto the reflective tape, it
bounces back to the camera

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.340
and it shows up as a really bright dot.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.930
So we simply put reflective
tape around the whip

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.820
every 250 millimeters down
the length of the whip.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.820
We also put reflectors on her arm

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.790
so we could better understand

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.410
the mechanical input to the whip.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.060
The image from one
camera would essentially

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.270
be an array of white dots
at 500 frames per second,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.370
but if you coupled this data with the data

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.180
from other cameras, you can triangulate

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.180
each individual segment of the whip

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.280
at 500 frames per second giving you

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.210
true three-dimensional data.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.090
OK, here we go.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.420
This is the kind of data we
can now get from a whip strike.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.413
- [Man] Three, two, one, go.

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:48.900
(whip cracks)

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.080
- The footage you're now watching

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.500
is 5,000 frames per second.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.530
You can can that the Vicon
cameras up on the wall

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.770
are taking data at 500 hertz,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.110
which means they're
flashing every 10 frames

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.750
on the high-speed camera here.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.200
You'll notice that the
whip unrolls normally,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.670
very similar to how the paper

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.790
from the University of Arizona

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.450
described it mathematically.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.130
Let's make a few observations here.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.660
First, there seems to be a wave
that moves down on the whip.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.860
As the hand moves forward and then stops,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.550
it transfers momentum
into the whip itself.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.190
Then, one segment of the whip,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.290
as it unrolls and straightens out,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.130
seems to transfer all of its momentum

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.270
into the next segment,
and then the next segment

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.820
and so on and so forth.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.770
As indicated by this red line
moving along the bottom here,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.470
you can see the velocity
of that straightening out

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.920
of the whip moves forward.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.750
We can then look at the atom lab data

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.300
and measure the input
momentum in three dimensions

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.770
and use that information as a
tool to help us build a model.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.415
So the whips coming up towards the mirror.

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:47.332
(muffled mumbling)

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.950
That's awesome.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.134
Is that awesome?

00:06:53.134 --> 00:06:54.600
- Yes.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.433
- Another thing to look at

00:06:55.433 --> 00:06:57.330
is what's happening on
the top of the whip.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.410
The velocity is speeding up.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.160
Most researchers think this has to do

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.950
with the conservation of momentum.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.330
The whip is tapered so
each smaller section

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.130
on the way down has to speed up

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.180
to maintain the same amount of momentum.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.350
This is the exact reason we
took so much time up front

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.750
to measure the mass and
dimensional properties

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.310
of the whip all the way down.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.250
This is where it gets
most interesting for me.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.470
If you look closely at the atom lab data

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.800
you'll notice that right
at the tip of the whip

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.570
the markers seems to disappear

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.400
right when the whip accelerates.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.730
This is because the
trackers lose the position

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.120
of the whip markers when
they're traveling their fastest.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.470
Even if the atom lab
didn't lose the track,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.660
you can tell that the
frame rate of the atom lab

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.040
isn't sufficient to
determine the acceleration

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.040
through the most interesting
part of the wave,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.810
which, of course, is the shock formation.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.470
This is exactly why we set
up the schlieren camera.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.740
The atom lab gets all
of the wave kinematics

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.240
on the macro scale and
then the phantom can record

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.290
the tip velocity and actually capture

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.076
the formation of the shockwave.

00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:55.674
(light guitar music)

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:58.007
(whooshing)

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.990
I'm not gonna explain any of
our preliminary conclusions

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.500
but at this point we're
doing two types of analysis,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.310
obviously how that wave propagates,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.680
but also the tip velocity of the whip.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.810
If you watch closely,
it looks like the tip's

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.860
getting pulled along
behind that shockwave.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.475
This is super complicated and
we're still analyzing this.

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:18.808
(whooshing)

00:08:19.764 --> 00:08:22.014
(smacking)

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.970
What we do know is that
the popper isn't necessary.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.080
Dr. Kanistras really
wanted us to visualize

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.100
the end of the whip with only a knot on it

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.670
and just look at how happy he was

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.793
when his hypothesis was proven correct.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.633
- There you go.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.313
There you go.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.370
There you go.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.240
- So it's like this.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.110
For the first time in history,
we have true X-Y-Z data

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.380
from the handle all the
way to the tip of the whip

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.510
and we can straight up write
an equation for whip dynamics

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.370
as a function of mass of the whip,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.040
length of the whip, mechanical input,

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.560
maybe even aerodynamic drag.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.870
I know this sounds crazy,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.840
but I'm already changing
my habits in everyday life

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.060
because I understand whip dynamics better.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.893
Have you ever done this?

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:05.820
You're in your car, you
reach for your charging cable

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.380
and you pull it towards you real quick

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.200
and it whips you really hard?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.860
That hurts like a mother.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.020
The reason that happens is whip mechanics.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.460
I cannot be the only person in the world

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.293
that's ever done that.

00:09:15.293 --> 00:09:16.350
You don't want to just pull it quickly

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.730
because that conservation
momentum builds up

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.500
and you get lashed in the face.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.130
So bull whip was probably
the first manmade invention

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.240
to break the speed of sound.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.170
But my favorite manmade invention

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.020
to break the speed of sound was the SR-71.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.790
This is not an SR-71, this is the A-12,

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.900
the predecessor to the SR-71.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.390
There are 13 of these built.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.970
I'm now going to simulate
running to the back

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.280
at the speed that this aircraft can fly.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.430
Ready, watch.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.780
That was fast wasn't it, OK? (laughing)

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.980
I'll go back and do it slower

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.410
and tell you about the
aircraft on the way.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.410
OK, we're back at the front.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.670
So, I want to tell you about Audible.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.490
Audible is sponsoring this video.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.360
There's a book called Skunk Works.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.550
You can get a free
audiobook of your choice

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.020

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.250
or texting the word smarter to 500500

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.820
to get any audiobook of your choice.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.320
In this case, your choice is Skunk Works.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.437
I've already made your choice for you.

00:10:05.437 --> 00:10:07.270
You have to listen to this book.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.148
It's about the development of the SR-71

00:10:09.148 --> 00:10:11.870
and the F-117 stealth fighter.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.510
I'm sorry, I just passed
the hot naughty bits.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.343
Look at this.

00:10:14.343 --> 00:10:15.500
So think about the shockwave.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.700
As you're going mach
3.3, which this could do,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.540
think about what happened.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.030
The shockwave would go right
there and it'd spread out.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.300
But you had to get air
inside the cowling there.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.133
It's amazing.

00:10:25.133 --> 00:10:25.966
Anyway.

00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:29.540
Go to audible.com/smarter,
download Skunk Works,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.570
listen to it with your ear holes.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.403
You're gonna love it.

00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:34.370
This thing would heat up in flight.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.470
They had to make it out of titanium.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.410
All kinds of cool stuff in the book.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.610
I just want you to go
to audible.com/smarter,

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.700
download Skunk Works, or text
the word smarter to 500500.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.840
You're gonna learn stuff,
it's gonna make you smarter

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.360
and you're gonna know more about
breaking the sound barrier.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.360
Um, I have two blasters and if I fire

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.040
the one that you're
thinking about right now,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.150
feel free to subscribe.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.120
Or not, whatever.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.084
Ready?

00:10:58.084 --> 00:10:59.870
(sirens blare)
(chuckling)

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.990
They're on the same thing.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.470
That's a, they cycle...

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.303
(sirens blare)

00:11:04.303 --> 00:11:05.220
See, but now they're not.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.480
The gap in my data is spacial.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.270
I'm not gonna get any of that.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.173
And the gap in your data is temporal.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:14.050
- Right, yes, you're right.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.480
- [Destin] But with our powers combined,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.670
we're gonna track a whip.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.610
- [Man] Right, the fact that my (mumbling)

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.700
is accurate position.
