00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.119
In this video, we'll do
some basic data analysis

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.500
using our WHO data.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.640
To access a variable
in a data frame,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.190
you always have to link it to
the data frame it belongs to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.060
with the dollar sign.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.820
To see this, let's
first try typing Under15

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700
and hitting Enter.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.800
R responds with an error.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.049
That's because R won't recognize
this variable name since it

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.050
doesn't know to look
in the data frame WHO.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.530
Now type WHO$Under15
and hit Enter.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.130
This outputs the Under15
vector of the data frame WHO.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.430
We can compute some statistics
about this variable,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.220
such as the mean, using
the mean function and then

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.870
in parentheses
typing WHO$Under15.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.950
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.319
This tells us that
the average percentage

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.740
of the population
under 15 is 28.7.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.539
We can also compute
the standard deviation

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.740
using the sd function.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.030
So type sd and then in
parentheses WHO$Under15.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.140
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.670
This tells us that
the standard deviation

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.910
of the percentage of the
population under 15 is 10.5.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.520
We can also get the
statistical summary

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.259
of just one variable using
the summary function like we

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.690
did before for the
whole data frame.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.430
To do this, we can type
summary, and then in parentheses

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.930
WHO$Under15.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.820
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.090
This gives the minimum
value, the first quartile,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.320
the median value, the
mean, the third quartile,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.330
and the maximum value
of the variable Under15.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.720
The first quartile is the
value for which 25% of the data

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.280
is less than that value,
and the third quartile

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.470
is the value for
which 75% of the data

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.990
is less than that value.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.550
This output tells us that
there's a country with only 13%

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.370
of the population under 15.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.310
Let's see which country it is
using the which.min function.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.100
So we can type which.min
and then in parentheses

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.650
our variable WHO$Under15.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.380
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.020
This returns the
number 86, which

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.630
is the row number
of the observation

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.700
with the minimum
value of Under15.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:06.170
To see which country is in row
86, we can type WHO$Country,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.550
for the country name, and
then in square brackets 86,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.070
and hit Enter.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.160
So Japan is the country
with the minimum percentage

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.090
of the population under 15.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.120
Now let's see which country
has the maximum percentage

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.550
of the population under 15.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.320
We can do this with
the which.max function.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:40.090
So type which.max and then
in parentheses WHO$Under15.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.110
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.910
This tells us that
the 124th observation

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.910
has the maximum value
of the variable Under15.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.680
We can look up the country of
the 124th observation by typing

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.080
WHO$Country and then
in square brackets 124.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.910
Close the square
brackets and hit Enter.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.000
So Niger is the country
with the maximum percentage

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.990
of the population under 15.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.579
Let's now create a scatter plot
of GNI versus fertility rate.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.410
You can do this using
the plot function.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:27.500
So type plot and then
in parentheses WHO$GNI,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.450
the variable we want
on our x-axis, comma,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.470
and then WHO$FertilityRate, the
variable we want on our y-axis.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.420
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.610
A scatter plot should appear.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.140
Income, or GNI,
is on the x-axis,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.420
and fertility rate
is on the y-axis.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.880
Each point in the scatter
plot is a country.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.110
We can see that most
countries here either

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.350
have a low GNI or a high GNI
but a low fertility rate.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.600
However, there are
a few countries

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.110
for which both the GNI and
the fertility rate are high.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.720
Let's investigate.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.150
We'll use the subset function
to identify the countries

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.450
with a GNI greater than
10,000, and a fertility

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.700
rate greater than 2.5.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.210
So go back to your R console
and then type Outliers--

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.050
this is what we'll call
our subset-- equals subset,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:44.420
and then in parentheses WHO
comma GNI greater than 10,000

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:52.570
and FertilityRate
greater than 2.5.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.140
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.230
When we used subset
before, we only

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.310
had one condition
to define which

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.190
observations to
keep in the subset.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.140
Here we have two conditions,
separated by the and symbol.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.180
This means that
both conditions must

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.510
be true for all
observations in the subset.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.720
We can see how many rows
of data are in our subset

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.390
by using the nrow function.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.080
So type nrow for number of
rows, and in parentheses

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.980
the name of our
subset, Outliers.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.050
This tells us that there are
seven countries for which

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.290
the GNI is greater than
10,000 and the fertility rate

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.190
is greater than 2.5.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.170
Now let's output just
the country names, GNI,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.090
and fertility rate of
these seven countries

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.290
to investigate further.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.260
There's an easy
way of doing this,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.320
and we'll use this technique
several times in this class

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.090
when we just want to extract a
few variables from a data set.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.350
So type the name
of our data set,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.840
Outliers, and then
in square brackets

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.640
we'll make a vector of
the names of the variables

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.290
we want to output.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:15.240
So c, and then in parentheses,
"Country" for the country name,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.420
comma, "GNI" comma, and
then "FertilityRate".

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.570
Close the parentheses, close the
square brackets, and hit Enter.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.680
This shows us the values
of these three variables

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.570
for the seven
observations of outliers.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.880
We can see that one
of the seven countries

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.950
is Equatorial Guinea, a country
that is very rich per capita

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.250
due to oil production,
but the wealth

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.690
is distributed very unevenly.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.250
In the next video,
we'll see how to create

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.710
different types of plots in
R and then build some summary

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.260
tables.
