well back then about 40 years ago there

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
well back then about 40 years ago there
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.610
well back then about 40 years ago there
was very little information in lay

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620
was very little information in lay
 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.830
was very little information in lay
language and we had to turn to largely

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
language and we had to turn to largely
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.390
language and we had to turn to largely
health care providers and mostly our

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400
health care providers and mostly our
 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.030
health care providers and mostly our
doctors to try to get information and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040
doctors to try to get information and
 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.980
doctors to try to get information and
there was tremendous sexes and

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990
there was tremendous sexes and
 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.740
there was tremendous sexes and

paternalism and condescension within
 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.140
paternalism and condescension within
medicine so it wasn't a great place to

medicine so it wasn't a great place to
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.910
medicine so it wasn't a great place to
turn to get questions answered it was

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920
turn to get questions answered it was
 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.710

always considered inappropriate you were

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720
always considered inappropriate you were

always considered inappropriate you were
speaking out of turn so we had educate

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720
speaking out of turn so we had educate
 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.960
speaking out of turn so we had educate
ourselves that was number one but number

two there was also a great deal that was

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730
two there was also a great deal that was
 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.880
two there was also a great deal that was
done in the field of women's health and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890
done in the field of women's health and
 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.900

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.910

that wasn't evidence-based as we'd call

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920
that wasn't evidence-based as we'd call
 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.250
that wasn't evidence-based as we'd call
it today it was simply because that's

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
it today it was simply because that's
 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.930

what physicians did they thought it was
 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.370
what physicians did they thought it was
the right thing to do there was no

the right thing to do there was no
 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.070
the right thing to do there was no
evidence basis for it so we had lots of

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080
evidence basis for it so we had lots of
 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.170
evidence basis for it so we had lots of
unnecessary hysterectomies even then

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180
unnecessary hysterectomies even then
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.750
unnecessary hysterectomies even then
unnecessary cesarean sections although

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760
unnecessary cesarean sections although
 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.510
unnecessary cesarean sections although
the problem is much worse now and we had

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520
the problem is much worse now and we had
 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.970
the problem is much worse now and we had
overuse of certain prescription drugs

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980
overuse of certain prescription drugs
 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.310
overuse of certain prescription drugs
like mood altering drugs in those days

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320
like mood altering drugs in those days
 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.380
like mood altering drugs in those days
we had valium and Librium things like

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390
we had valium and Librium things like
 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.050
we had valium and Librium things like

didn't have good data on so that women
 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.410
didn't have good data on so that women
couldn't make good decisions about

physician so we were in this vacuum and

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110
physician so we were in this vacuum and
 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.960
physician so we were in this vacuum and
we were among the first calling for more

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970
we were among the first calling for more
 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.460
we were among the first calling for more
research on women's health issues of

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470
research on women's health issues of
 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.950
research on women's health issues of
course but we realized that we often

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960
course but we realized that we often
 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.420
course but we realized that we often
were the best experts from our own

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
were the best experts from our own
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.370
were the best experts from our own
bodies and that we needed to understand

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380
bodies and that we needed to understand
 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.710
bodies and that we needed to understand
better how our bodies function and what

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720
better how our bodies function and what
 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.540
better how our bodies function and what
we were going through at any given point

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550
we were going through at any given point
 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.450
we were going through at any given point
so back then it was a there was a

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460
so back then it was a there was a
 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.340
so back then it was a there was a
knowledge gap there was also a dearth of

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350
knowledge gap there was also a dearth of
 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.920
knowledge gap there was also a dearth of
information and there was also this need

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930
information and there was also this need
 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.020
information and there was also this need
to really learn to be assertive and

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030
to really learn to be assertive and
 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.120
to really learn to be assertive and
learned to speak up so as the early days

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130
learned to speak up so as the early days
 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.800
learned to speak up so as the early days
of the women's movement and many women

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810
of the women's movement and many women
 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.770
of the women's movement and many women
were socialized to be demure to not

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780
were socialized to be demure to not
 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.830
were socialized to be demure to not
speak up to not rattle the cage totally

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840
speak up to not rattle the cage totally
 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.150
speak up to not rattle the cage totally
inappropriate when it comes to getting

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160
inappropriate when it comes to getting
 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.070
inappropriate when it comes to getting
good health and medical care so we

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080
good health and medical care so we
 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.440
good health and medical care so we
needed to change the socialization of

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450
needed to change the socialization of
 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.070
needed to change the socialization of
women that was a big tall order over the

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080
women that was a big tall order over the
 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.140
women that was a big tall order over the
years however as we grew and as we

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150
years however as we grew and as we
 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.420
years however as we grew and as we
produced more editions of our book we

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430
produced more editions of our book we
 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.520
produced more editions of our book we
recognized the need not just to

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530
recognized the need not just to
 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.710
recognized the need not just to
demystify health and medical care and to

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720
demystify health and medical care and to
 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.839
demystify health and medical care and to
understand certain things but to

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849
understand certain things but to
 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.839
understand certain things but to
move on to get a closer alliance with

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849
move on to get a closer alliance with
 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.179
move on to get a closer alliance with
public health and that's when we really

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189
public health and that's when we really
 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.040
public health and that's when we really
started to work with epidemiologists and

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050
started to work with epidemiologists and
 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.169
started to work with epidemiologists and
to understand better that it isn't

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:03.179
to understand better that it isn't
 

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:04.850
to understand better that it isn't
really through medicine that we achieve

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860
really through medicine that we achieve
 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.739
really through medicine that we achieve
good health and well-being it's often

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:06.749
good health and well-being it's often
 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:08.689
good health and well-being it's often
they would improve measures in public

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699
they would improve measures in public
 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.119
they would improve measures in public
health and its really the food we eat

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129
health and its really the food we eat
 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.129

the air we breathe the water we drink

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139
the air we breathe the water we drink
 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.439
the air we breathe the water we drink
and also the level of violence in our

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449
and also the level of violence in our
 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.480
and also the level of violence in our
streets in our immediate community that

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490
streets in our immediate community that
 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.639
streets in our immediate community that
ultimately have the greatest impact on

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:19.649
ultimately have the greatest impact on
 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.070
ultimately have the greatest impact on
our health and of course poverty if you

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080
our health and of course poverty if you
 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.510
our health and of course poverty if you
want to look at determinants of good

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520
want to look at determinants of good
 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.070
want to look at determinants of good
health and well-being poverty is the

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080
health and well-being poverty is the
 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.439
health and well-being poverty is the
single most important determinant so if

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449
single most important determinant so if
 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.239
single most important determinant so if
we could work on profit poverty with

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:29.249
we could work on profit poverty with
 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.859
we could work on profit poverty with
reduction we would probably do the most

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:30.869
reduction we would probably do the most
 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.919
reduction we would probably do the most
to improve women's health and well-being

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:32.929
to improve women's health and well-being
 

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:37.189
to improve women's health and well-being
so all these issues kept percolating up

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199
so all these issues kept percolating up
 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.629
so all these issues kept percolating up
where we were working on the environment

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639

become more and more medicalised over
 

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:50.179
become more and more medicalised over
time why were we doing so many

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189
time why were we doing so many
 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.249
time why were we doing so many
hysterectomies why was the cesarean

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259
hysterectomies why was the cesarean
 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.339

improvements in outcomes and that's
 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.909
improvements in outcomes and that's
really the telling story and then along

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919
really the telling story and then along
 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.040
