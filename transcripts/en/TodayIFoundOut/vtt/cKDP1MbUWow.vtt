00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.290
While opium itself has been commonly used
since at least 3400 BC, heroin is a relatively

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.540
new invention, derived from opium.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.160
Heroin, more technically known as diacetylmorphine,
was first synthesized in 1874 by chemist Charles

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.070
Romley Alder Wright, working at St. Mary’s
Hospital Medical School in London, England.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.320
He discovered the drug after playing around
with mixing morphine with various acids.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.090
Specifically, he created it after boiling
acetic anhydride with anhydrous morphine alkaloid

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.470
for a few hours, which resulted in what we
now commonly call heroin.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.540
After running a few experiments with it on
animals, though, he abandoned his work on

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
the drug.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.850
Twenty three years later, a man named Felix
Hoffman, working at Bayer, in Germany, managed

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.050
to independently synthesize Heroin when he
was trying to produce codeine.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.119
This new derivative of opium was found to
be significantly more potent than morphine

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.200
and so Heinrich Dreser, head of the pharmacological
laboratory at Bayer, decided they should move

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.970
forward with it, rather than another drug
they had recently created (Aspirin).

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.910
It should be noted that Dreser was apparently
well aware of Wright having synthesized Heroin

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.399
23 years before, but despite this, he claimed
heroin was an original Bayer product and by

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.290
early 1898, they began the animal testing
phase of the product, testing it primarily

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.690
on rabbits and frogs.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.160
They next moved on to testing it on people,
primarily workers at Bayer, including Heinrich

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.610
Dreser himself.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.630
After successful trials, Heroin was presented
to the Congress of German Naturalists and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.250
Physicians as more or less a miracle drug
that was “10 times” more effective than

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.540
codeine as a cough medicine and worked even
better than morphine as a pain killer.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.520
He also stated that it had almost no toxic
effects including being completely non-addictive.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.860
Dreser particularly pushed Heroin as the drug
of choice for treating asthma, bronchitis,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.610
tuberculosis, and phthisis.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.310
If it seems odd to you that he should push
Heroin as a cough medicine, over its pain

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.500
killing effects, it should be noted that at
the time tuberculosis and pneumonia were among

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.390
the world’s leading causes of death and
one of the leading methods to treat this was

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.780
using codeine, which is fairly addictive given
regular use.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.150
Because Heroin worked well as a sedative and
respiration depressor, it did indeed work

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.490
extremely well as a type of cough medicine
and allowed people affected by debilitating

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.660
coughs to finally be able to get some proper
rest, free from coughing fits.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.030
Further, because it was marketed as non-addictive,
unlike morphine or codeine, it was initially

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.050
seen as a major medical breakthrough.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.840
Just one year after its release, Heroin became
a world-wide hit, despite it not actually

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.940
being marketed directly to the public, but
rather simply to physicians.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.180
Heroin was soon sold in a variety of forms:
mixed in cough syrup; made into tablets; mixed

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.140
in a glycerin solution as an elixir; and put
into water-soluble heroin salts, among others.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.980
At the end of this first year, it was popularly
sold in over 23 countries with Bayer producing

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.980
around one ton of it in that year.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.290
Obviously, it quickly became apparent that
Bayer’s claims of the drug not being addictive

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.380
were completely false, with reports popping
up within months of its widespread release.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.250
Despite this, it continued to sell well in
the medical field.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.760
Finally, in 1913, after the number of Heroin
addicts began to skyrocket and it became likely

00:03:39.760 --> 00:04:10.980
that it would shortly be banned in many countries,
Bayer decided to stop producing 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:20.630
the drug.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.490
The originally trademarked name of Heroin
is thought to derive the German word “heroisch”

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.130
(heroic), due to the way the workers who tested
Heroin on themselves reported that it made

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.130
them feel.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.410
Bayer ultimately lost the trademark for Heroin
in a few key markets at the same time they

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.710
were forced to give up their trademark on
Aspirin, thanks to WWI.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.970
During WWI, Bayer’s assets, including their
trademark rights, in the U.S. and the Triple

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.279
Entente allies (UK, France, and Russia) were
confiscated and it became common to simply

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.120
refer to all brands of the drug as “Aspirin”
in those countries, among others.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.020
Finally, after the signing of the Treaty of
Versailles, Bayer officially lost their trademarks

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.181
on Heroin and Aspirin in the U.S., France,
Russia, and the UK.

00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:05.129
Interestingly, one of the common early uses
of Heroin was to help treat people who were

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.449
addicted to morphine, even though Heroin ultimately
proved to be more addictive.

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.050
Humorously, when morphine was first isolated
from opium in 1805, one of its early uses

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.009
was as a “non-addictive” drug to treat
people who were addicted to opium.

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.050
Felix Hoffman didn’t just help introduce
Heroin to the world, in 1897, he also was

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.830
one of the first people to synthesize a version
of something called salicyclic acid.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.150
His version, though, didn’t have the extreme
negative stomach pain side effects normally

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.490
associated with that particular chemical.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.599
“His” drug, acetylsalicyclic acid, is
more commonly known as aspirin.

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.240
Hoffman was not technically the first to synthesize
aspirin.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.120
That distinction goes to French chemist Charles
Freferic Gerhardt who did it in 1853.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.490
However, Gerhardt’s method resulted in an
unstable and impure form of aspirin.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.800
Hoffman’s method had no such deficiencies,
though others had also managed to achieve

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.831
this feat before Hoffmann (resulting in numerous
lawsuits being filed against Bayer over this

00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:06.289
after they introduced Aspirin).

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.870
The salicyclic acid aspirin is derived from
actually has been used for medicinal purposes

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.080
for thousands of years.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.639
This chemical is naturally found in the bark
of a Willow tree.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.680
Indeed, Hippocrates himself somewhere between
460 BC and 377 BC described a powder from

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.969
the Willow tree used to treat symptoms such
as headaches various types of pain, fever,

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.059
etc.

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.710
When aspirin was first recommended to Dreser
for Bayer to move forward with, he rejected

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.360
it, stating “The product has no value”.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.270
Today, over 40 billion tablets of aspirin
are consumed annually.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.580
Once Heroin’s star began to fall as people
began to realize how addictive it was, he

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.490
revisited his decision on Aspirin, which quickly
became Bayer’s best selling product.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.819
After Heinrich Dreser left Bayer, he once
again is thought to have picked Heroin over

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.330
Aspirin, this time to his doom when he eventually
died of a stroke.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.360
It is rumored that in his waning years, he
began taking heroin daily, rather than aspirin,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.910
to treat his health problems.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.080
What is ironical about this, of course, is
that a daily dose of aspirin may well have

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.770
prevented his stroke.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.580
Both morphine and codeine were isolated from
opium in the same year, 1805, with morphine

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.340
being reported to be about ten times as potent
as opium itself.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.439
As such, it quickly became one of the more
popular medicinal and recreational drugs in

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:25.869
many places in the world, particularly the
United States where it was used very commonly

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:28.979
as a pain reliever.

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:33.460
When heroin is orally ingested, its effects
are drastically reduced due to the fact that

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.970
it is converted to morphine when it is metabolized
by your body.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.629
This may partially explain why the addictive
effects of heroin were not instantly apparent,

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:45.999
as is often the case with modern methods junkies
use to partake in this drug which result in

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.779
it being able to cross the blood-brain barrier
extremely quickly.

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:50.819
Today there are an estimated 15-20 million
people who are addicted to heroin.

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:54.440
While heroin is outlawed in most countries
in the world, it is still not so uncommonly

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.089
used medicinally in the UK for treating various
things such as for post-caesarian section

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:00.680
and other post-surgery pain.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.249
It’s also used to help relieve pain in cancer
patients and for others who have chronic pain.

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:08.830
However, in recent years this usage has begun
to tail off, in favor of other drugs, such

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.830
as morphine.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:15.830
Today, medical use of heroin in the UK accounts
for an estimated 95% of the legal usage of

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.999
heroin in the world.

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:24.710
Bayer was started by Friedrich Bayer and Johann
Friedrich Weskott in 1863 as a chemical company

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.620
making various paints, rather than pharmaceuticals.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.460
Another major company today that started out
making dyes and now is famous for making something

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.600
completely different is Crayola.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.719
Aspirin is thought to have significantly contributed
to the death toll in the 1918 flu epidemic

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:45.210
due to the fact that high doses of aspirin
can be toxic and these high doses can lead

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.760
to fluid build up in the lungs, upping the
chance of infection.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.280
Bayer had their legacy significantly tarnished
during WWII when they became part of the Farben

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.230
German chemical company conglomerate that
is known to have used slave labor during WWII,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.340
including managing slave labor camps.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.100
Further, Farben was the group that manufactured
Zyklon B. Why is this important?

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.200
Because Zyklon B was the cyanide based pesticide
used in the Nazi gas chambers.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.920
Bayer was forced to separate from Farben after
WWII.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.170
One of Bayer’s executive officers during
WWII, Fritz ter Meer, who was the chairman

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.580
of Bayer’s supervisory board, was tried
and convicted during the Nuremberg War Crimes

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.200
Tribunal and sentenced to seven years in prison.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.750
He reportedly was involved in various experiments
done at Auschwitz on human subjects.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.500
Specifically, the charges he was convicted
of were: “guilty of count two, plunder and

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.750
spoliation, and count three, slavery and mass
murder.”

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:47.030
Bayer currently grosses around $45 billion
per year, with about $2 billion per year of

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.030
that as profit.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:10:11.640
They also have well over 100,000 employees.
