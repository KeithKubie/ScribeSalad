00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:01.274
- Another one we've just ordered,

00:00:01.274 --> 00:00:05.109
which was off the daily special menu.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.174
Oh, this looks amazing!

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.069
Oh, there's something on the bottom, too.

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:10.388
What is that?

00:00:10.388 --> 00:00:11.744
Or is that just--

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:12.610
I don't know what that is,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.193
but I will attempt to get some.

00:00:18.563 --> 00:00:21.813
(exciting Latin music)

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.038
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:28.041
with Migrationology.com
in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.180
It's about 6:45am.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.514
We gotta check out of the hotel

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:35.642
and then we're going to
walk over to Fridhemsplan

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:39.524
and catch the bus to the
airport, Arlanda Airport.

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:41.257
Time to move on.

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:43.964
It's been way too short
of a time in Stockholm.

00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:47.490
I've really enjoyed our stay here,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.766
I hope to come back and visit again,

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:53.011
but on this trip, it's time to proceed.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.261
(exciting dance music)

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:02.360
We just checked out of
Courtyard Marriott in Stockholm.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.313
We had a fantastic stay,

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:07.979
and both the food was really
good at the breakfast buffet,

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.692
and also I want to actually shout out

00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:11.825
to all of the staff who were very friendly

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:14.437
and very helpful during our stay.

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:16.329
It's about a 5-10 minute walk

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.747
to get to Fridhemsplan from here.

00:01:18.747 --> 00:01:21.997
(exciting dance music)

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.706
We made it onto the bus,

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:33.739
it's gonna be about a 45-minute
ride until the airport.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.989
(exciting dance music)

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:54.181
That only took about 30 minutes on the bus

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:56.154
and we are gonna check in to our flight.

00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:58.781
We're flying with Lufthansa Airline today,

00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:01.277
and we are flying to Barcelona,

00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:03.527
but we need to make a stop in Germany,

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:05.065
just a really quick layover.

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:06.458
Ying, don't get stuck.

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.458
Oh, two revolving doors.

00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:14.240
(machine beeps)

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:20.489
We got through Customs and Immigration,

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.101
checked in, and having
now a quick breakfast

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.601
at the SAS lounge.

00:02:27.178 --> 00:02:29.845
(slurps coffee)

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.511
I just want to say in the two days

00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.383
that Ying and I have been in Stockholm,

00:02:37.383 --> 00:02:39.357
we have thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:41.113
Stockholm is an amazing city.

00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:42.869
I would love to visit again

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:47.279
and also to travel more in
this whole Scandinavian region.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.666
Stockholm is definitely an expensive city

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:52.017
and food is expensive,

00:02:52.017 --> 00:02:54.150
but I really enjoyed the food,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.746
the quality, especially.

00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:57.082
Although you pay a lot for the food,

00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:59.375
the quality in incredible.

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:00.768
One more thing I forgot to add,

00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:02.945
I'm gonna miss the pepper in Sweden.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.296
(grinder scratches)

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:06.879
I love this pepper.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.176
I can just drown my food in
pepper, I love it so much.

00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:21.666
Okay, that should be good.

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:24.916
(exciting dance music)

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.273
We're going to fly to Frankfurt,

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:33.885
and this should be
about a two-hour flight.

00:03:33.885 --> 00:03:35.859
I'm gonna take a nap for this flight,

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.008
and I will see you all when
we arrive to Frankfurt.

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.258
(exciting dance music)

00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.425
We are served a light
breakfast on this flight

00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:55.297
that has just arrived.

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:57.886
We have a little dish of meat.

00:03:57.886 --> 00:03:59.085
Is that salmon?

00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:01.378
No, maybe it's like turkey or something.

00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:05.545
There's some cheese, some
fruit, and I got a croissant.

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:09.869
Mmmm.

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:13.976
Is it like smoked turkey?

00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:15.131
(airplane noise drowns out speaker)

00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:16.785
- Oh, yeah, that's good.

00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:18.120
Maybe it's some kind of ham,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.287
because on the bottom here
is maybe smoked chicken.

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:26.820
Croissant, oh and this is really hot.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.570
I'm going to eat it with
some of this cheese.

00:04:32.952 --> 00:04:36.242
- Would you like anything
else, water or juice?

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.781
- [Mark] That croissant is really hot.

00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:41.031
(exciting dance music)

00:04:51.343 --> 00:04:53.424
- [Mark] Bye-bye, thank you.

00:04:53.424 --> 00:04:57.171
(exciting dance music)

00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:58.666
- We made it to Frankfurt,

00:04:58.666 --> 00:05:02.773
but because our plane
taxied for about 30 minutes,

00:05:02.773 --> 00:05:05.696
we only have about ten minutes
'til our next flight leaves,

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:08.554
so we gotta make a mad
dash for our next gate.

00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:11.887
(exciting dance music)

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.722
The good news is the
gate was not too far away

00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:16.580
from where we were let into the airport,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.769
and I think the flight is
leaving a few minutes late.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:21.583
This is going to be
about a two-hour flight

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:23.020
to Barcelona now.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.956
- [Attendant] Welcome aboard flight 1821,

00:05:25.956 --> 00:05:27.283
please make yourselves comfortable.

00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:28.116
In a few moments,

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:30.597
we will depart Frankfurt
to go on to Barcelona.

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:32.295
I'm sorry about the delayed departure

00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:33.311
out of Frankfurt today.

00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:36.079
The reason was delayed--

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:38.013
- We are somewhere in the sky now,

00:05:38.013 --> 00:05:41.206
and on this flight they
also served us a snack.

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:44.399
There is some fruit,
there is some cured meat,

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.649
and some cheese, and a stick of cheese.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:49.890
I'll try this.

00:05:52.345 --> 00:05:55.345
I guess it's a type of ham, I think.

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:58.367
Oh yeah.

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:01.423
Is it beef?

00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:04.411
I think it's beef.

00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:06.578
I'm gonna try this cheese.

00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:16.994
Oh yeah, that's a good cheese.

00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:19.504
It's like, kind of dry.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.754
(exciting dance music)

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:52.305
- [Attendant] Welcome
to Barcelona Airport,

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:53.440
ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.154
Please remain seated with
your seat-belt fastened

00:06:56.154 --> 00:06:57.910
until the fasten-seat-belt
sign above your head

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.825
has been switched.

00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:01.320
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.932
- Okay, that was a good
flight with Lufthansa.

00:07:03.932 --> 00:07:06.283
We have just landed in Barcelona.

00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:09.033
It is about 3pm in the afternoon.

00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:14.293
My metro track going this way.

00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:16.648
There are a number of different ways

00:07:16.648 --> 00:07:19.362
to get from the airport to
the center of Barcelona,

00:07:19.362 --> 00:07:22.772
and we're gonna catch the metro.

00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:23.904
Two.

00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:25.660
(machine speaks foreign language)

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.493
Confirm.

00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:28.619
- [Ying] Yup.

00:07:30.534 --> 00:07:31.367
(speaks foreign language)

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:32.200
- [Mark] I think so.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.450
(exciting dance music)

00:07:42.568 --> 00:07:44.300
I didn't really realize that Barcelona

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.912
had such a complex network of a metro,

00:07:46.912 --> 00:07:49.147
but we got our metro tickets,

00:07:49.147 --> 00:07:51.440
and we're gonna have to transfer two times

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.501
to get to our station
which is Passeig de Gracia.

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:57.282
I know we keep on going now.

00:07:57.282 --> 00:07:58.838
(announcer speaks foreign language)

00:07:58.838 --> 00:08:02.088
(exciting dance music)

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.201
That took about 45 minutes on the metro.

00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:13.451
(exciting dance music)

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:18.313
We have emerged into
Barcelona for the first time.

00:08:18.313 --> 00:08:21.027
We're right in the heart
of the city, I think, here.

00:08:21.027 --> 00:08:24.277
(exciting dance music)

00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:35.172
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.113
206,

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:40.866
this way or this way?

00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:42.839
(chuckles) I think this way.

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:44.175
Oh, here we go.

00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:45.092
201 to 210.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.483
Okay, we got all checked in,

00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:50.357
we are staying in the Cotton House,

00:08:50.357 --> 00:08:53.506
which is a hotel by Marriott.

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:54.624
- [Ying] Right, turn right.

00:08:54.624 --> 00:08:55.707
- Turn right.

00:08:57.743 --> 00:09:00.326
Oh, look at these padded doors.

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:03.359
- Push, push it.

00:09:07.571 --> 00:09:10.821
(exciting dance music)

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.409
- Let's go for a quick tour,

00:09:18.409 --> 00:09:21.404
this will be my first
glimpse at the room as well.

00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:22.237
Bed.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.977
We have a balcony outside, fantastic.

00:09:26.977 --> 00:09:28.832
This is a very artistic hotel,

00:09:28.832 --> 00:09:30.665
a very boutique hotel.

00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:36.804
Then the sink is here in the hallway.

00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:38.836
Where's the bathroom?

00:09:38.836 --> 00:09:40.273
This is the bathroom? (laughs)

00:09:40.273 --> 00:09:42.106
Oh, there's two doors?

00:09:42.943 --> 00:09:45.693
Which door leads to the bathroom?

00:09:46.571 --> 00:09:49.140
Oh, this is just the toilet.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.640
Toilet on its own,

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:56.142
and then this must be the shower.

00:09:57.281 --> 00:10:00.053
Bath, well very, very clean.

00:10:00.053 --> 00:10:01.867
All bath and shower together.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:05.200
Wow, look this size of that shower head!

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.965
(laughs)

00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:09.678
Ying, can you see the shower, honey?

00:10:09.678 --> 00:10:10.635
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:12.072
- That thing is huge!

00:10:12.072 --> 00:10:15.149
Very clean, very new feeling,

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:18.472
and very artistic, very
trendy, boutique style.

00:10:18.472 --> 00:10:20.228
We're gonna hang out at
the hotel for a little bit,

00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:21.244
do a little bit of research,

00:10:21.244 --> 00:10:23.537
and try to figure out where
to eat dinner tonight.

00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:27.063
Ying and I are both really
hungry, and it's about 6pm,

00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:29.516
but a lot of the main dinner restaurants

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:32.695
don't open 'til 8 or 9pm in Barcelona,

00:10:32.695 --> 00:10:36.862
so we are gonna attempt to have
our first tapas experience.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.707
This is tapas time.

00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:42.957
(exciting dance music)

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.458
Luckily, there was one open table.

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:09.708
Yes, I'm ready.

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:12.623
Cabreos huevos.

00:11:12.623 --> 00:11:13.700
What else did you want, Ying?

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.658
- [Ying] Octopus.

00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:17.106
- Maybe pescado frito?

00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:18.689
- [Ying] Thank you.

00:11:20.144 --> 00:11:21.580
- I think when you order tapas,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.038
it's often a good idea

00:11:23.038 --> 00:11:25.548
to just order one or two plates at a time,

00:11:25.548 --> 00:11:27.521
and then just kind of relax and hang out,

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:29.176
but Ying and I are
really hungry right now,

00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:31.904
so we just ordered a bunch of plates.

00:11:31.904 --> 00:11:34.821
I'm starting off with a white wine.

00:11:40.128 --> 00:11:41.129
That's great,

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:44.454
and the weather here in Barcelona
right now is incredible.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.621
It's warm, but the wind makes it cool.

00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:49.949
It's perfect.

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:52.837
It's absolutely perfect
weather for sitting outside.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:53.670
Gracias.

00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:55.710
We got a table outside.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.987
They also have inside,

00:11:56.987 --> 00:12:00.775
which is packed and kind of intimidating.

00:12:00.775 --> 00:12:04.519
Since I don't know the tapas
etiquette and culture so much

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:06.493
so it's nice to be able to sit out here.

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.467
The first thing that I could not resist

00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:11.819
is a little piece of
bread, a baguette slice,

00:12:11.819 --> 00:12:15.346
with jamón, famous Spanish jamón on top.

00:12:15.346 --> 00:12:18.346
I have been waiting for this moment.

00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:26.300
Oh, yeah.

00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:30.288
It is insane.

00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:33.729
It's tender, yet it has that

00:12:35.663 --> 00:12:38.330
cured, slightly chewiness to it.

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.628
Oh, and it's smoky.

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:45.333
That's amazing, then the
baguette down below is crispy,

00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:46.852
almost like a crouton.

00:12:46.852 --> 00:12:48.448
Oh, that is ridiculously good,

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:51.641
maybe I'll have to order an
entire plate of the jamón.

00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:52.474
Wow!

00:12:59.014 --> 00:13:00.131
It's amazing.

00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:00.964
Gracias.

00:13:02.777 --> 00:13:06.732
(background chatter drowns out speaker)

00:13:06.732 --> 00:13:08.482
- [Mark] Oh, gracias.

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:21.212
(speaks foreign language)

00:13:21.212 --> 00:13:22.087
I'm gonna start with this one,

00:13:22.087 --> 00:13:23.523
because he just brought it out.

00:13:23.523 --> 00:13:25.337
They bring out the tapas fast,

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:27.218
and they are hot and fresh.

00:13:27.218 --> 00:13:28.898
Then it's this pile--

00:13:28.898 --> 00:13:30.712
I'm honestly not exactly sure what it is,

00:13:30.712 --> 00:13:32.265
but it came out with
fried eggs on the top,

00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:33.804
and then he sliced them all up,

00:13:33.804 --> 00:13:36.887
and that yolk just oozed all over it.

00:13:42.134 --> 00:13:44.634
That is amazing. Is it potato?

00:13:45.486 --> 00:13:48.635
It's like very, very finely shaved

00:13:48.635 --> 00:13:51.785
deep-fried, like shoestring.

00:13:51.785 --> 00:13:53.004
Yeah, I think they're potatoes.

00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:54.658
It's almost like a potato chip

00:13:54.658 --> 00:13:57.386
because they're so thin and so crispy,

00:13:57.386 --> 00:14:01.334
but then with like, perfectly oozy eggs

00:14:01.334 --> 00:14:04.744
all over the top of them,
just coating them in the yolk.

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.077
That is awesome.

00:14:10.027 --> 00:14:11.086
Wow.

00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:12.262
We also got a--

00:14:12.262 --> 00:14:14.497
This is a plate of fried small fish.

00:14:14.497 --> 00:14:16.906
I'm not sure if they're anchovies.

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:17.863
I think they're anchovies.

00:14:17.863 --> 00:14:21.196
Let me squeeze on a little bit of lemon.

00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:33.369
Yeah, I think they're anchovies.

00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:37.179
Delicious, crispy, fried fresh,

00:14:38.282 --> 00:14:41.751
and just with a very thin batter,

00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:43.565
and then just with that squeeze of lemon,

00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:45.482
and then fried peppers.

00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:50.814
Wow.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:54.595
Those are amazing.

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:56.307
They're not spicy at all.

00:14:56.307 --> 00:14:58.179
But they have that
wonderful green chili-like

00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:01.212
blistered, fried flavor to them.

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:02.295
They're soft.

00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:06.280
Those are fantastic, and
just salted perfectly,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.732
and you can tell that the
salt is really good quality.

00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:11.069
Oh, yeah those little pieces of salt.

00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:12.564
Wow, that's awesome.

00:15:12.564 --> 00:15:14.973
Okay, I could eat another plate of this.

00:15:14.973 --> 00:15:18.640
Eat the whole thing,
with the stem included.

00:15:22.592 --> 00:15:23.592
I love that.

00:15:24.522 --> 00:15:29.369
So simple, but just focused
on the single ingredient.

00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:32.301
This is fried squid, and the way it's cut,

00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:35.384
it almost looks like pieces of onion.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:38.543
Yeah.

00:15:39.775 --> 00:15:41.211
It's very tender,

00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.999
and then I like how it's
just a light batter coating,

00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:47.074
so the batter is not overwhelming,

00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:50.491
but that helps to give it some crispness.

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:53.233
Another one we've just ordered,

00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:56.382
which is off the daily
special menu is octopus

00:15:56.382 --> 00:15:59.804
which is sliced up and then sprinkled in,

00:15:59.804 --> 00:16:03.197
I can see salt, as well
as, maybe that's paprika.

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:05.114
Oh, this looks amazing.

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:08.900
Oh, there's something on the bottom, too.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.983
What is that?

00:16:11.108 --> 00:16:12.009
Oh, I don't know what that is,

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:15.375
but I will attempt to get some.

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:16.875
Kinda like a bean.

00:16:22.914 --> 00:16:23.747
Wow.

00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:28.016
What could that be on the bottom?

00:16:28.016 --> 00:16:29.554
It's slightly cheesy.

00:16:29.554 --> 00:16:32.611
The octopus is, again, very tender,

00:16:32.611 --> 00:16:36.070
but kind of muscular at the same time,

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.205
and then just dusted in that salt.

00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:41.556
It's particularly impressive.

00:16:41.556 --> 00:16:43.370
Not only was that food good,

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.519
and Ying and I finished it very quickly,

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:49.828
but this environment, this
ambiance, and these chairs

00:16:49.828 --> 00:16:51.961
are extremely comfortable.

00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:54.835
This is just made for
relaxation and hanging out,

00:16:54.835 --> 00:16:57.766
and chit-chatting and just enjoying food

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.421
and relaxing with friends.

00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:02.251
That was a wonderful
experience and delicious food.

00:17:02.251 --> 00:17:03.687
Over here on this side of the road

00:17:03.687 --> 00:17:07.214
is where the main restaurant tapas bar is,

00:17:07.214 --> 00:17:10.247
but then, over across this small street

00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:12.859
is the patio where all of
the outdoor seating is.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.109
(exciting dance music)

00:17:22.946 --> 00:17:24.861
We just walked back over to the hotel,

00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:27.212
and I think we're gonna end the day there

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:29.505
because I don't think we're gonna wait

00:17:29.505 --> 00:17:31.102
for a dinner restaurant,

00:17:31.102 --> 00:17:32.974
and I have a lot of research to do,

00:17:32.974 --> 00:17:35.165
but I'm gonna try to figure
out a full schedule for us.

00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:37.618
We're gonna be in Barcelona
for the next three days,

00:17:37.618 --> 00:17:39.098
so stay tuned.

00:17:39.098 --> 00:17:42.276
Just from walking around a
little bit this afternoon

00:17:42.276 --> 00:17:45.526
and having that first tapas experience,

00:17:46.673 --> 00:17:50.840
you can just feel that the
culture here in Barcelona

00:17:51.854 --> 00:17:54.467
is so focused on food,

00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:59.430
and the food is such a huge
role in the social culture,

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.346
which is fantastic.

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.218
This is gonna be an
awesome trip to Barcelona.

00:18:03.218 --> 00:18:04.117
Stay tuned.

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:05.670
Thank you for all for
watching today's video.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.326
Please remember to give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it,

00:18:08.326 --> 00:18:10.735
and I will see you on the next video.

00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:12.273
Thank you again for watching.

00:18:12.273 --> 00:18:15.106
(recording beeps)

00:18:15.965 --> 00:18:18.630
(speaks foreign language)

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.797
(strains)

00:18:25.668 --> 00:18:29.137
- Ying loves to call this
pillow the guillotine,

00:18:29.137 --> 00:18:30.554
this neck pillow.

00:18:31.952 --> 00:18:35.285
(exciting Latin music)
