- Good evening, everybody.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.650
We're going to go ahead and
start the after-screening panel

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.390
discussion.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.840
Note to self, never agree to
be the first person that speaks

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.280
after a screening of Dawnland.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.690
But we're going to
go forward anyway.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:33.260
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.310
My name is Shelly Lowe.

I want to thank everybody
for joining us this evening.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.530
I hope that you
enjoyed the film.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.740
I want to thank Adam Mazo,
who is here with us tonight,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.850
who essentially made the film
with the Upstander Project.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.490
And I also want to think
Professor Bruce Duthu--

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.200
I know he's trying
to hide all the way

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.820
in the back of the room--

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.030
who co-produced
the film and served

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.470
as an advisor on the film.

Professor Duthu is at
Dartmouth University.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.890
I also want to thank

created the little postcards
that you have on your chairs.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.540
This image is of
traditional wetu

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.300

students and alumni

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.020
built in Harvard Yard in 2009.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.420
And we had these specifically
made for our screening

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.190
tonight here at Harvard.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.130
I'm going to introduce
the panelists,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.820
and I'm going to turn it over to
our moderator, Professor Robert

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.970
Anderson.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.220
We will have some reflections
from our panelists,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.440
and then we will
open up the floor

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.330
to questions for the panelists.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.300
We'll do that for
about 20, 25 minutes.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.280
We will have to end
after that, but we

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.170
encourage anyone
who wants to come up

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.390
to speak to the
panelists afterwards,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.590
And I will turn it over
to Professor Anderson.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.740
- Thank you, Shelly.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.840
Well, I want to
get to the audience

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.460
as soon as we can
for your questions.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.960
But I think we
have to all agree,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.350
it was a moving and
powerful movie and just

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.430
a tremendous work product
that you came up with

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.030
and tremendous experience
and work that you did.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.060
I'm going to ask each of you to
just spend a couple of minutes

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.140
reflecting on the film
and on just what you

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.540
think about the issues.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.882
And you're all either
directly involved

00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:49.340
or have brought
experience in here.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.923
And I'm going to
start on the far end,

00:06:50.923 --> 00:06:53.650
so that we can let Esther
have the final word

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.180
before we move to
questions here.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.070
So Ronald, I'm putting
you on the spot

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.310
here to talk a little bit about
just what you thought about it.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.470
How does it compare to
what's happening in Canada

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.369
with your experience up there?

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:05.160
- Right, thank you.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.548
Thank you.

00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:10.810
I'm very pleased to be here
and to see so many people who

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.970
are interested in this film
and this important issue.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.400
As I was watching
this film, I had

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.920
to think about it
comparatively, because I

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.580
spent about six years
studying Canada's Truth

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.620
and Reconciliation Commission
on Indian residential schools

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.950
when it first started
holding hearings in Winnipeg

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.130
in 2010 and all the
way to the presentation

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.080
of its final report
in December 2015.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.870
And then looking at what
happened a little bit beyond.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.210
And Canada's TRC was, of
course, on a much grander scale,

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.530
but the issues were
very much the same.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.670
In Canada's TRC, I heard
the word cultural genocide.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.910
In one memorable
meeting in Montreal,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.180
former Prime
Minister Paul Martin

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.660
got a fairly solid
ovation when he

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.220
said, let's call
a spade a spade,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.370
this was cultural genocide.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.600
He was warmly applauded.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.910
But I heard some people next to
me saying, no, it was genocide.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.735
So the issues that were
raised were very similar.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:36.150
What I saw here was
much smaller in scale.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.390
And I was also particularly
interested to see

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:47.790
the social workers
give their testimony.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.080
We had to sort of piece
together the chronology of who

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.770
had worked when and
to look at how--

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.290
actually, if you got
the chronology right,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.130
you saw that some of
the attitudes of people

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.610
who represented the
social work community

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.550
had shifted a little
bit, from the women who

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:14.290
worked in the 1960s to people
who are still at the job.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.760
One of the things that
Canada's TRC didn't do well,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.230
which wasn't entirely its fault,
it had to do with the mandate,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.600
was actually bring
clergy in, who

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.530
were the equivalent
of the social workers.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.850
They were the ones who
represented the perpetrators.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.610
They were the ones
who ran the schools.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.540
And because there was a
compensation agreement that

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.850
accompanied the work of
the TRC, they strongly

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.090
disagreed with and didn't
like the accusations,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.380
and they didn't like the
characterization of history.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.640
Many of them stayed away.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.080
They stayed away in droves.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.200
And they had their own
sense of indignation,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.860
which is one of the reasons
behind the title of my book,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.210
Truth and Indignation.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.880
That there was really
no reconciliation

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.580
between the people who ran
the schools and the people who

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:15.570
were often the survivors
of abuse in those schools.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.990
One thing that I noticed was
missing from the film that

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:26.340
I'd be curious to hear about--
and perhaps Esther Anne could

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.740
fill this in--

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.490
was the families,
the families who

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:38.070
took in the children, the
non-indigenous families who

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.840
took in the children.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.020
What were the attitudes
that they had?

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.620
Did they share the same
ideas as the social workers?

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.270
And what motivated them?

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.540
What were the
differences among them?

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.560
That's one of the pieces I would
have liked to see more about.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.200
But on the whole, I
was very impressed

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.575
and moved by this documentary.

00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:02.770
- Thank you.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.270
Adam?

00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:07.950
- I think you asked our
thoughts on the film.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.158
I thought the film was great.

00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:10.428
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.200
Are we done now?

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.816
- No, you can't
get off that easy.

00:11:15.816 --> 00:11:19.950
So talk about the process.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.740
Going into the communities,
there's always been a lot of--

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.550
well, you had Esther on your
team, which was a bonus.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.350
But I hear complaints
all the time

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.900
about outsiders coming
into the communities

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.330
and taking information,
misusing it,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.150
making a name for
themselves and leaving.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:45.240
And then things are left
behind and not much happens.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.932
- Thank you.

00:11:45.932 --> 00:11:47.140
Thank you all for being here.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.340
And Esther and I were smiling
at each other about your comment

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.990
about being on our team,
because we were working

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.510
alongside of each other,
but definitely there

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.730
were challenging
moments, particularly

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.190
when we showed the film to
Esther and a lot of the folks

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.960
that are in the film--

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.960
a rough cut-- a year ago?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.940
A little more than a year ago.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.630
And there were a lot
of things that they

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.620
felt could be improved and
changed, to say the least.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.680
And so the final cut
that you saw tonight

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.630
is certainly considerably
different than what

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.770
they saw privately.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:28.530
So our gratitude to Esther
and to so many Wabanaki folks

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.960
who invited us into the
process and welcomed us

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.920
into their homes.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.570
And it's important to mention
that there's an entire team.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.210
It's not just me.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.980
My colleague Bruce, who's
here, co-producer on the film.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.930
And then Mishy Lesser who's
here, our learning director,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.830
author of the Dawnland
Teacher's Guide.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.350
And then a number
of other colleagues

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.810
scattered around the country,
like Tracy Rector and Heather

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.940
Rae, Executive Producer.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.090
There's a whole lot of us
working to make the film.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.220
And a lengthy process of me
and Ben, the co-director,

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.110
explaining ourselves,
asking for consent,

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.510
and reaffirming consent over
and over and over again,

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.602
every room we were in,
every place we would go.

00:13:09.602 --> 00:13:11.310
Talking about why we
were making the film

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.768
and trying to
acknowledge that we'd

00:13:12.768 --> 00:13:16.260
come from a long line
of colonizers who've

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.060
come into Wabanaki communities
specifically and taken and not

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:26.172
given back, and vowing to
try to not be like that.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.630
Hopefully we've
managed to do that.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.310
That's been the
aspiration the whole time.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.890
And we spent a lot of time
just being in community

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:40.367
and not filming and trying to
be clear about our intentions

00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:42.450
and trying to understand
what our impact would be,

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.180
even when those two
didn't necessarily align.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.730
There are plenty of times where
I stuck my foot in my mouth

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.590
and said stupid things,
and Esther called me

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.390
out on those I think 100%
of the time probably.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:52.950
Maybe 99%?

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:53.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.920
- I wasn't the only one
that called you out.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.795
- She wasn't the only
one that called me out.

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:57.690
That's for sure.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.210
So we made plenty of
mistakes along the way

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.670
and tried to remain
committed to making sure

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.430
that the ultimate goal
was that this film would

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.900
be useful for Wabanaki people
and honor the truth-telling

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.250
that they did.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.560
Not just in the
film, but there's

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.900
so many other folks who
told their truths who

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.470
are not in the film, but you
can see them in the archives.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.400
I think particularly,
it's heartening

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.860
to see that there's
a recognition

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.950
of the importance of
truth-telling and the courage

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:29.700
that it takes.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.430
I think particularly after
the events of yesterday,

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.960
maybe there's even
more awareness

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.570
in our society about
how difficult it

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:41.490
is to tell the truth in the
face of tremendous power,

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.340
patriarchy, and colonialism.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.010
So we hope that
Dawnland can contribute

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.490
to that dialogue of
holding up truth-telling

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.180
and how incredibly
difficult it is

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.540
when you're talking
about some of the most

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.760
horrific or the most traumatic
memories that a person can have

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.670
and sharing those on the record.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.510
So it's about the Wabanaki
people, ultimately.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.400
That's what this film is
about and who it's for.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.220
- Thanks.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.720
Esther?

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:25.180
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.290
My name's Esther Anne.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.430
I am Wabanaki, a people of
the place where the sun first

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.600
looks our way.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.660
I'm Passamaquoddy from
Sipayik, or Pleasant Point--

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.190
the people who spear pollock.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.010
And I live with
Penobscot people,

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.720
place of the white rocks.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.860
Thank you for having
me here tonight.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.470
This is kind of too close.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.710
It's interesting.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.990
I was sitting here thinking
about what you said

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.480
about people having a lack--

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.910
we have such a level of distrust
and mistrust, legitimately so.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.110
But I was just talking to the
students at the lunch today,

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.610
and I was remarking
about how I think

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.770
it seems like in our
tribal communities,

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.810
people were more leery
of the commissioners

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.480
and the commission and that
agreement with the state

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.580
than they were of
the filmmakers.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.330
Really, I think people
were way more open.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.580
And we had some
conversations a couple times

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.110
about the different worldview
that native people have as

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.450
opposed to these filmmakers
that are coming in.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.820
And how generous and open
especially Wabanaki people are.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.380
And how when they
would invite these guys

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.510
into their homes or to go
elver fishing or to go hunting

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.550
or to go blueberry raking, I
don't think that they really

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.190
necessarily understood
at the same level

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.860
that Adam and Ben did, that
these guys were always working.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.000
They were always on.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.350
And it was in Aroostock
County when I invited them up

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.922
to my campsite, and Ben
drags out the camera.

00:16:59.922 --> 00:17:01.380
And I was like,
what are you doing?

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:01.964
Put that away.

00:17:01.964 --> 00:17:03.546
And he's like, no,
I'm always working.

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:05.859
And I said, then you need
to explain that to people.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:10.780
Because native people don't
necessarily think that way.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.450
But it turned out all right.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.650
I would really like these
guys to document your process

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.780
that you went through and
how you change from when

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.640
you started to when you ended.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.050
Because I think you,
too, have changed a lot.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.790
I've witnessed a transformation
in your level of understanding.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.339
- In a negative way?

00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:34.380
- Your sense of humor is
a little bit better now.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.970
You can take a joke.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.210
- Only slightly.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.990
- You're a little
bit more assimilated.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.190
You're late for things.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.266
No, I'm just kidding.

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:43.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.340
So I don't know what
else to comment on.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.930
I think it would
be better if there

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.596
were things you wanted
me to comment on,

00:17:48.596 --> 00:17:52.085
because I could
talk way too long.

00:17:52.085 --> 00:17:54.676
- Should we respond to
what Ronald mentioned?

00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:55.176
- Yeah.

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:55.801
Go ahead, yeah.

00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:58.012
- Did you want to say
anything about [INAUDIBLE]??

00:17:58.012 --> 00:18:00.220
- I would say that it might
be missing from the film,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.290
but it's not missing
from the archives.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.940
So there are
statements from people

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.810
who were provided foster,
were resource families

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.880
and foster families,
siblings and parents

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.440
that took children in.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.244
So they're there,
but I don't know

00:18:13.244 --> 00:18:14.410
why they didn't [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.230
- And in terms of the film,
we made a conscious decision

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.820
to not focus on non-native
people for the most part.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.570
We felt that the process
of the commission

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.120
was pretty important
and at least necessarily

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.030
needed to involve a lot
of the non-native people.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.220
But when it came to the
non-native foster families,

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.220
obviously their story is
important and relevant,

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.840
but we just felt like, for
the purposes of the film,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.150
the focus should be on the
commission and the people

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.640
sharing their truth with
the commission, particularly

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.390
Wabanaki people.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.100
- Good, yeah.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.210
- You could probably make 10
films with everything you have.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.120
- Well, I think I'd
like to open it up

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.950
to the audience for
people to comment.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.415
And Bruce Duthu's back there.

00:18:52.415 --> 00:18:54.850
I don't know if Bruce would
like to say a few words.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.710
Maybe not, and that's
why he's not up here.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.520
But just generally, I've
observed and followed

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.300
the Indian Child Welfare
Act since it was passed,

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.020
just before I started
practicing law for NARF.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.972
And I've followed
the implementation

00:19:10.972 --> 00:19:11.680
and worked on it.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.260
And I see an incredible
retrenchment nowadays.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.950
And I saw your
statistics at the end

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.170
about the continuing
problems with placements.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.260
And we've got very conservative
groups, like the Goldwater

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.600
Foundation, bringing lawsuits
to try to set aside the statute.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.450
And fortunately, we've got
great groups of native lawyers

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.810
around the country that
are working together

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.330
to put this together.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.750
But even so, it's
a constant battle.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.120
And we saw what we
confront yesterday,

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.870
or at least my feeling
was, there it is.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.540
And so it's a struggle.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:53.950
But getting the story out like
this is incredibly important.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.740
And I've just noticed that
it's the younger people that we

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.770
have to educate--

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.990
the social workers,
the younger people.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.080
And for them to be able
to experience something

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.420
like this when they're
learning about what

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.340
they're going to do in the
future is incredibly important.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.700
So I'm hoping that somebody will
come up to the microphone here.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.180
So if you want to come up and
ask a question or comment,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.837
thank you.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.270
- A red flag went up in my head
when I saw stolen children.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.130
People don't get stolen.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.900
They either get kidnapped, or
if they're in an abusive family

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.260
recently, they get removed.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.620
So that really had
me thinking about,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.680
who is shaping the
narrative here?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.020
And so I'm wondering,
what was the process

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.880
like of the filmmakers with
interviewing those Indian folks

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.650
about the kidnapping,
which implies

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.750
a crime that was committed?

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:58.390
As opposed to stolen, which
devillifies the crime?

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.470
- What was that last bit?

00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.969
Sorry.

00:20:59.969 --> 00:21:01.490
As opposed to stolen, which--

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.531
I just want to make sure.

00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:05.500
- Devillifies-- it makes
it not like a villain.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.330
It makes it smoother.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.720
It makes it not a crime.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.988
- Sugarcoat, maybe?

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:15.970
- Good question, thank you.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.345
- Glad I don't
have to answer it.

00:21:17.345 --> 00:21:20.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.290
- So in terms of the--

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.768
what was your name, by the way?

00:21:23.768 --> 00:21:26.210
- I didn't give it.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.030
- OK.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.910
In terms of the interviews-- you
probably noticed in the movie,

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.740
for the most part,
the vast majority

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.150
of the interviews that
we show in the movie

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.566
are interviews
that were conducted

00:21:36.566 --> 00:21:41.420
by the commission as opposed to
conducted by us as filmmakers.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.060
We were present for a
lot of the statements,

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.200
but not all of them.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.940
So we focused,
obviously, on selecting

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.330
who we would
include in the film,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.930
but we weren't conducting
a lot of those interviews.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:59.100
In terms of the language,
it's a great question.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:05.052
I think we feel like stolen was
pretty strong and considerably

00:22:05.052 --> 00:22:07.010
more aggressive than a
lot of the language that

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.660
is used among
academics when they

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.150
talk about this kind of thing.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:15.200
And it's an important
conversation

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.300
to be having about
that language.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.572
And I'm going to keep
thinking about it, because

00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:20.280
of your question.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.280
So I'm grateful to you for that.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.870
- One thing that--

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.384
the Upstander, they
have a teacher's guide.

00:22:26.384 --> 00:22:27.800
And they talk about
the connection

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.490
between stealing children
and stealing the land.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.980
So maybe that had
something to do

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.630
with them choosing that word,
because it's more analogous

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.770
or whatever.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.670
But I don't know.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.420
I'm just guessing.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.080
- Should we ask Mishy to come
up and tell us a little bit more

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.140
about it--

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.630
- Yeah, we could ask Mishy.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.066
She could probably--

00:22:43.066 --> 00:22:44.570
- --since she's
the author of it?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.255
- Oh, OK.

00:22:46.255 --> 00:22:49.010
There's a comparative
dimension to this too,

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.580
in that in Australia, the
children who are forcibly

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.940
removed from their families
and placed in foster homes

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.810
are referred to collectively
as the stolen generation.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.250
These words, these
terminologies,

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.610
have a tendency to leap across
continents and get picked up.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.580
- So my colleague Mishy Lesser's
the co-creator of the Upstander

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.230
Project and the author of
the Teacher's Guide and is

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.250
at the microphone.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.430
- Thank you.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.170
I was going to say,
similarly, that there

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.155
is a lot of scholarship
that talks about taking.

00:23:18.155 --> 00:23:20.690
But the compelling
question that overarches

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.920
the whole educational endeavor
that accompanies this film

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.850
is, what is the relationship
between the taking of the land

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.230
and the taking of the children?

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.080
And so land dispossession--

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.160
And here we are in
a setting that's

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.620
devoted to teaching
and learning.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:45.800
We could map connecting the
dots between land dispossession

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.290
and the taking of the
children across the centuries.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.920
And our goal by teaching
this film with the Dawnland

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.790
Teacher's Guide is so
that students come away

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.460
knowing how to
wrestle with evidence

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.280
and begin to create an argument
to answer that question.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.282
- Next question.

00:24:05.282 --> 00:24:07.490
- Thank you for the film
and thank you for being here

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.550
tonight.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.015
My question was about
the children reuniting,

00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:13.290
who are now adults,
with their families,

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.230
and how they found them.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.750
Some of them seemed to have
known their birth names.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.662
And I just didn't
know how they--

00:24:20.662 --> 00:24:22.620
after they had been taken
into foster families,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.560
were they still in touch
with their families?

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.685
Or did it come up in the
process of still wondering

00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:28.910
who their birth parents were?

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.710
- I think all of that.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.960
I think all the
stories were so varied.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.260
I provided a statement
to the commission.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.070
I didn't sit in on
any of the statements,

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.920
but I sat in on a lot of
circles in our communities

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.260
that weren't
archived or recorded,

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.510
and I've heard
stories like that.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.780
Even some of the folks who
have shared their story--

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.802
we have siblings that
are talking about things,

00:24:56.802 --> 00:24:58.760
and they haven't talked
to each other about it.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.620
So that happens a
lot, the silence.

00:25:04.704 --> 00:25:05.204
- Hello.

00:25:05.204 --> 00:25:06.620
My name is Jelani.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.180
I'm a graduate student in
history here at Harvard.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.800
I had a question about the
Secretary of State's statement

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.050
towards the beginning of the
film about the governor's

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.800
concern about the possible
requests for reparations.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.950
And I was wondering
if reparations,

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.290
monetary or otherwise, were
ever part of the discussion

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.760
with the state government.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.100
And if not, why that was
not part of the strategy.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.900
Thank you.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.740
- Reparations was a topic
that the organizers--

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.470
the group of us that created
this commission process--

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.720
we talked about
reparations a lot.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.960
And even when we were
organizing the commission

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.320
and we decided to ask the
tribal governments and the state

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:54.070
government to sign on, we were
real conscious about not saying

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.550
that that was our end goal.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.690
And we also didn't ask
them to give any money.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.300
I mean, they didn't
have to do anything.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.550
We were going to bear
that burden on our own,

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:10.200
because we wanted to increase
our chances of them saying yes.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.400
So reparations, we had a lot
of discussions about this.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.130
And within our group and
within tribal communities,

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.080
people have all kinds
of different views

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.470
about reparations, as they
do about what is justice

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.470
and how forgiveness
comes into that

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.760
and what restoration looks
like and repairing of harm.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.410
And we had folks that
were really victimized,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.290
like Denise, my sister-in-law
that's on the film.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.420
And she's like,
there's no amount

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.450
of any kind of reparation
that could give me back

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.580
what has been taken from me.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.240
And then you had other folks
that have a different view

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.100
and believe in reparations--
structural reparations,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.350
monetary reparations.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.570
So it's really personal.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.030
But that was the biggest fear
that the people at the state

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:00.530
had.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.044
Because they know
that a reparation

00:27:03.044 --> 00:27:04.710
comes when you have
to repair something.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.960
So they knew that
something had happened.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.550
And that's what
they were afraid of.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.840
So, yeah, when Matt was chosen
to be on the commission--

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.880
the governor of the state--

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.480
he was not happy.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.250
He was pretty scared about it.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.620
But the commission, I
think that they must

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.180
have dealt with the issue, too.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:29.332
But I wasn't privy to their
process or their deliberations.

00:27:29.332 --> 00:27:32.100
I was anxious to see their
report and recommendations

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.950
like everybody else.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.500
So I'm sure it comes
up all the time.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.470
Because even for people to
acknowledge that there was harm

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.290
is one thing.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.260
But for them to take that step.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.890
And just like
watching this film,

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.660
you got an emotive response.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.860
It felt horrible, right?

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.580
You feel bad.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.340
You feel whatever.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.390
But if you go home
and nothing changes,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.890
then what was the point?

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.582
We have to motivate,
and we have to start

00:27:58.582 --> 00:27:59.790
living our lives differently.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:05.070
We have to start
looking through things

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.416
through a lens of colonization,
which means we have to undo it.

00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:10.290
And that's something
different for all of us.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:15.250
So we can't leave
here and be the same.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.620
- And if we, as white folks,
seriously look at reparations,

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.270
we have to look at, what
is it that we have taken?

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.020
And it's the land.

00:28:27.142 --> 00:28:28.380
- It's a powerful film.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:28.880
Thank you.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.580
I have an artistic
question, which

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.860
is it felt like there was
a very powerful moment

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.732
before we went to the
scene at the fire at night.

00:28:38.732 --> 00:28:40.190
And what was the
decision that went

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.620
into including that
as the final scene

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.666
and ending on the words
of the Secretary of State?

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.634
- Tell her Sandy
hates that scene--

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.590
- Thank you.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.310
- --because they didn't
listen to Sandy White Hawk,

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.430
because she didn't
like that ending.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.720
- We had a lot of
conversations about that scene.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.210
It made a lot of
sense to us to end

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:11.030
at the fire, because so much
started and would start and end

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.110
at the fire each day, with
the commission doing its work.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.060
But also, at least my very
minimal understanding,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.520
in Wabanaki communities
the fire is really central.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.720
So it made sense.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.910
We played around with the
idea of starting the film

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:31.250
and ending the film there,
and it just felt like a moment

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:37.070
to be at the fire
as a viewer and sit

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.730
with all of the feelings that
you've had watching the film.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.820
And then also hear that--

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:48.500
we hope-- that epic line
from [INAUDIBLE] at the end--

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.560
reconciliation,
that's the long road.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.920
And in terms of the last voice,
the last voice is the music.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.092
It's the singers,
singing the song.

00:29:59.092 --> 00:30:01.550
I mean, sometimes the lights
come up and we miss that part.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.716
But the last voice
is the music--

00:30:04.716 --> 00:30:09.320
the Wabanaki people and
our Tuscarora composer

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.700
singing that song.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.420
So yes, Matt gets
the last spoken word.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.780
But we intentionally--
we learned

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.820
from many, many
viewings of the film

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:23.540
that if he didn't say
that, then we, as viewers,

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.397
didn't understand
that they were there

00:30:25.397 --> 00:30:27.230
in the middle of the
night up until sunrise.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.446
And that was an important
thing to understand.

00:30:29.446 --> 00:30:31.820
Otherwise, people thought
maybe, OK, they were just there

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.050
after dinner or whatever.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.730
And that seemed
important to know.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.930
- And that time of day is
a very significant time

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.950
for native people.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.650
So it's a very sacred time.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.870
So the scene's grown on me.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.780
- Well, I have to
say, I thought,

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.900
what a white-man thing to say,
to look at his watch and say,

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.625
one hour, the sun will be up.

00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:53.229
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:54.020
- But it's perfect.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.381
It's perfect though, right?

00:30:55.381 --> 00:30:55.880
- Oh, yeah.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.810
Very much so.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:57.605
- It shows.

00:30:57.605 --> 00:30:59.230
- So let's have a
couple more comments,

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.930
and then we can
come up and mix--

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.721
- Are you saying we're
running out of time?

00:31:02.721 --> 00:31:05.290
- I think Shelly
gave me the signal.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:05.790
- Great.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:06.560
Thank you very much for that.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.760
That was incredibly moving,
incredibly powerful.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.590
My question was
more about language.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.180
And a lot of this
language came across

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.370
in a lot of the
interviews was people

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.740
talking about being beaten
for speaking your languages

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.787
and whatnot.

00:31:17.787 --> 00:31:19.620
And I was wondering,
mostly for Esther Anne,

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.380
if you could talk a little
bit about the role of language

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.970
revitalization in, I suppose,
mostly in Wabanaki communities.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.050
What's going on with that now?

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.510
- Yeah, I think Roger
Paul can speak to that.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.011
In It, Rog.

00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:32.843
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:32.843 --> 00:31:34.860
- Yeah, Roger can you
come to the microphone?

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.070
Roger's at MIT right
now doing great things.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.247
- Roger's a language teacher.

00:31:40.247 --> 00:31:42.330
I was looking at him when
I was introducing myself

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:42.790
in my language.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.220
I was looking over,
and he's going, yep.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.220
So I know I did a good job.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:45.678
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:45.678 --> 00:31:46.594
- You did a good job.

00:31:49.342 --> 00:31:51.455
- Thank you for that question.

00:31:51.455 --> 00:31:52.370
I'm Roger Paul.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.930
I'm a language teacher in
the Penobscot community.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.720
I'm Passamaquoddy.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.890
And it's always good to hear
Esther speak in the language.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.105
I've been a teacher all
my life of the language.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.050
It was before this
happened, when

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:14.280
I grew up on the reservation.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.850
It was before the new Indian
Child Welfare system was.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.130
I was the old Indian
Child Welfare system,

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.370
where my aunts and uncles
would shift us from reserve

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.740
to reserve in Canada
and the United States

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.650
to keep us from getting taken.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.680
When I was six is
when I first had

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.750
to learn how to speak English.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.000
So I still have trouble
with some English

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.140
and do say it backwards.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.440
But language to our people--

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.720
and some of our
people do still speak.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.990
And I make it my
job to make sure

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.640
that our children learn it.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.330
Because when we speak in
our traditional language,

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.780
we're actually describing
the world around us

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.290
through the eyes
of our ancestors.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.270
In those words,
you see the world

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:11.040
the way the ancestors saw it and
the way it was intended to be.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.750
And if it's OK, one quick
story about why I teach two,

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:21.450
is in our language, the word for
dirt is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.910
Now, in the English language,
when I learned the word dirt,

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.810
they used it to vilify,
to make something bad.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:27.750
That oh, that's dirty.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.666
Don't even think that.

00:33:28.666 --> 00:33:30.090
That's something dirty.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.520
But in our language, the
word is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.890
And when we break up that
word [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:39.210
it actually means "a
substance full of life."

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:44.760
And I asked an elder one
time, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.930
why do we say that
soil is full of life?

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:54.000
So he held up the soil
and said that in this hand

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.550
are the molecules
of our ancestors

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:01.470
that have sacrificed so much
for us to be here today,

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.170
and we need to honor that.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:08.460
And all of creation
that lives comes

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.230
from molecules that give
new life in the earth.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.960
And that's why we
call her our mother.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.870
So from that day forward--

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:23.800
and I apologize for getting
emotional about this--

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.250
when that elder
taught me that, I

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.420
knew I could not
let our children

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.060
know just the English
definition of dirt.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.989
They needed to know our
ancestors' definition.

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.374
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:34:39.374 --> 00:34:40.856
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.340
- I was thinking during the film
about why the white people did

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.659
this to the native people.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.850
And one of the things
that was discussed

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.670
was the fact that
the Carlisle Indian

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:04.600
School was seen as a progressive
innovation at that time.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.920
And I call myself a
progressive, so I really

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.530
thought there's a struggle
there about why something

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.470
was seen as progressive
at one time,

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.760
when it was actually
destructive.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.950
And so there's just something
to think about there, for me.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:26.500
And also, there was
that anecdote about--

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.390
one of the social
workers said something

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.000
about how the apple
falls from the tree.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.330
And it occurred to me
that that logic could also

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:38.165
mean that taking of
children from their families

00:35:38.165 --> 00:35:40.590
might not apply only to natives.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:45.010
It might apply to people
of different communities

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.160
and even to working
class whites that

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.602
are seen as having a
problematic family structure

00:35:51.602 --> 00:35:52.310
or what have you.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.900
So this is actually
part of something

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.470
bigger in the white society.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.401
So that's--

00:35:58.401 --> 00:35:58.900
- OK.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.170
One more person is
waiting patiently.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.610
- Thank you.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.910
That was really powerful.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.680
I've heard so much
about this film.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.900
I'm a folklorist.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.780
I'm based here, but I've done
a tremendous amount of work

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:15.480
with particularly the artists
in all four of the tribes

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:21.500
in Maine-- basket makers,
carvers, performers.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.180
Several observations.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.330
One, the question
about reparations,

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.490
I think that's particularly
important to Maine

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.150
because of the land
settlements in the 1980s.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.760
And a lot of people
don't know about that

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.120
or haven't really put it in the
context of tribal lands now.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.360
And I say that,
because last July,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.770
I produced the
traditional folklife area

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.850
at the Lowell Folk Festival.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:58.040
And we had, at the festival,
the Penobscot drummers.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.980
And I had one of them
on my Foodway stage

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:07.430
doing fry bread, which people
have different opinions about.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.430
But the point was,
people in the audience,

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:15.460
instead of talking about the
culture of the fry bread--

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.360
our theme was Brits--

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.290
they were asking him so many
questions about Indian life,

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.410
life on the reservation.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.530
He's a young guy.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.580
He didn't know about
the land settlements.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.310
Well, that happened
a long time ago.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.680
So I'm just pointing that
out, that connection.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.000
And also to say that, in
general, a lot of the things

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.420
didn't surprise me at all that
people didn't show up for some

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.720
of the circles and meetings.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.090
I'm not native, but I've
worked with the communities

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.320
for several decades and
have that level of trust.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.090
But also, my job is
bringing some of the culture

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.710
out into the wider world.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.340
So there's an opportunity
for learning on both sides.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.090
Last question, you
mentioned the archives.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:12.790
I just wondered where
your archives are from--

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:18.310
both the interviews, and
also, is the film outtakes,

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.470
is that archived anywhere?

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.850
And thank you, again.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:26.980
- So the archives are all
stored at Bowdoin College

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.760
and they're available online.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.640
You can read the written
testimony and there's audio.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.810
And is there any video?

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.340
I don't think--
there's some video.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.500
A lot of audio testimony.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.070
So there's 150, I think.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:47.080
About 90 from Wabanaki people
and the rest from non-natives.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.700
So yeah, they're
there in the archives,

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.560
just all that ready to be
looked at and researched.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.400
Rachel George from the Truth
Commission is back in Canada

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.630
getting a doctorate.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.540
And she's doing some
follow-up research,

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.400
following up with
some folks that she

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.780
had met through the process.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.810
And one of the things
we asked her to do

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.440
was to work on cataloging
those statements so

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.550
that we can know where to
look for different things.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.650
Which is real important
to the ICWA Workgroup,

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.624
because we're always developing
tools to train caseworkers.

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:22.540
And it would be really
good if we can pull out

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.537
some of those excerpts
from caseworkers

00:39:24.537 --> 00:39:25.370
saying this or that.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.940
But we don't have the
time to get in there.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.580
So she's going to catalog them
and do a thematic analysis,

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.870
so that'll be wonderful.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.200
- And the outtakes
from the film--

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.630
there is a short
film that we produced

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.430
that you can go
and see at the Abbe

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.620
Museum in Bar
Harbor up in Maine,

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.550
for folks who are up that way.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.056
And we're also hoping to put
together some other short films

00:39:47.056 --> 00:39:48.430
that we'll put
out into the world

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.304
hopefully in the next
couple of years related

00:39:50.304 --> 00:39:52.750
to people who we met through
the Truth Commission,

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.090
including Georgina,
the elder who

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.210
spoke up early on in the
film at Indian Township,

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.657
about sitting in the
bathtub full of bleach.

00:40:00.657 --> 00:40:02.740
We filmed a tremendous
amount of footage with her,

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.530
and we're hoping to make
a short film about her

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.700
in the next year or so.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.650
- OK.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.252
Well, let's thank the panel.

00:40:11.252 --> 00:40:12.728
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:17.648 --> 00:40:20.108
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:20.108 --> 00:40:23.300
If you have more questions,
come on up and visit.
