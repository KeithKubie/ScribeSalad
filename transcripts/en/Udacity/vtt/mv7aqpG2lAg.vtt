00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.320
And finally, you can even
imagine switching from a full

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.590
screen activity to a dialog at 600dp.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.040
Dialogs are often a good way
to maintain some context for

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.300
simpler detail screens, keeping part
of the previous screen visible, and

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.140
relieving some of the pressure to fill
up the screen with more information.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.100
Since an activity's theme controls
whether or not it's shown as a dialogue,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.630
we can switch between themes
using resource qualifiers.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.100
Here's a quick example of some code for
that.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.479
We have my MyTheme,
which inherits from BaseTheme.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.324
And BaseTheme inherits from
the standard Theme.AppCompat, or

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:39.620
Theme.Material, or
whatever theme you want.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.070
But for larger screens, we replace
the definition of base themes,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.880
such that it inherits,
from Theme.AppCompat.Dialog.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.710
The reason we don't just replace,
MyTheme, here is so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.120
that we can put our theme
attributes in one place.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.210
This kind of clever two
step theme inheritance

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.000
really helps minimize code overlap.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.510
And another quick note here.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.500
We use the smallest width, or sw
qualifier, instead of just the width, or

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.900
w qualifier.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.340
This ensures that the value won't
change when you rotate the screen.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.950
After all, it'd be a little weird if,
turning your

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.545
phone from portrait to landscape,
popped your screen into a dialog.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.880
&gt;&gt; That was an introduction to some
of the standard things you can vary

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.900
in your UI to make better use of space.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.630
This is by no means an exhaustive list.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.880
The key is to work out when your UI no
longer works, at a certain size, or

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.330
when it breaks, and to make to changes
to adapt it to the available space.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.960
Let's go to Nick to see some
examples of this in action.
