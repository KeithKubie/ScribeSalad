MARISA MCCLELLAN: My
name is Marisa McClellan,

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.320
and I write a blog
called "Food in Jars."

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.810
And my first book was
called "Food in Jars"

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.220
and came out about
two years ago.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.460
And then this new book has been
out for just about three months

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.370
now and is called
"Preserving by the Pint."

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.744
And what I really like about
this book --I mean, granted,

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:19.400
I like it, I wrote it--
is that every recipe in it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.415
starts with either a
pint, a quart, or a pound

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:23.790
or two of produce, which makes
it really great for people

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.110
who live in urban areas.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.145
I live in Philadelphia, in
Center City, Philadelphia,

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:29.520
on the 20th floor
of a high-rise.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.450
And so this book was
born out of my need

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.730
to continue to can while not
filling my apartment from floor

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.620
to ceiling with jars.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
Although, doing what I do, it's
pretty much wall-to-wall jars

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.420
as it is.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.570
I have a very tolerant husband
when it comes to mason jars.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.550
He has a lot of LEGOs,
so we balance out.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.896
What's nice about this
book is that so often, when

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.650
you read canning recipes, it'll
say you need a flat, or five

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.880
pounds, or a very large quantity
of produce just to get started.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.600
Whereas, what I
did with this book

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.480
is that I started
picking up the quantities

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.270
that you get at farmer's
markets or in a CSA share,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.022
or at the grocery store,
or what you're getting out

00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:14.230
of a small backyard garden,
or at a community garden.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.090
And try to build recipes
around those units of measure,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.710
so that instead of needing
that flat or that five pounds,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.750
you could start with just a
quart of pickling cucumbers,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.310
or a quart of
yellow plums, which

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.600
I'm going to make the
yellow plum and vanilla

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750
jam out of the book today.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.780
So these aren't really
true, true yellow plums,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.821
but they're close enough.

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.570
So we're going to call
them yellow plums.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.528
I wrote the recipe
originally with shiro plums,

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:39.620
which are these really light,
almost translucent plums, which

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.580
are really delicious.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.620
But just about any plum
will work in this recipe.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.340
So let me ask first
off, who are my canners?

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.220
Who has canned before?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.720
Anybody?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.830
OK, a few folks.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.380
Who has never canned before?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.360
Who is terrified?

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.050
OK.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.190
I have a terrified hand here.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.180
So often, when I do these talks,
these classes, a lot of people

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.360
come who really are
interested in canning,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.364
but they are sort
of afraid that they

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:11.150
are going to make
a batch of jam,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.210
or do a couple jars of
pickles, and share them

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.370
with their friends and family,
and two weeks later, they're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.390
not going to have any
friends and family left.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.590
Right?

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.750
That's the fear, that you're
going to kill everyone

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.820
with your canning, because
this is the United States.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.780
We are very food safety-anxious.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.720
And it is true that
botulism, which

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.300
is the thing everyone's
scared of, is problematic.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.210
You don't want to get botulism.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.460
The good news is that it's
really hard to grow botulism

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.960
in canning jars and your
home-preserved foods.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.810
And in fact, it is impossible
for most of the things that we

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.760
make at home, because when it
comes to dealing with botulism,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.210
trying to avoid its
development in your jars,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.710
botulism cannot grow in
high acid environments.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.290
And just about everything that
we can at home is a high acid

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.060
preserve.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.110
And when I talk
about high acid, you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.230
use pH to determine whether
it's high acid or low acid.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.960
So if something has
a pH of 4.6 or below,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.584
that is a high acid preserve.

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:08.000
And you know that
it's a high acid

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.552
preserve also, because if the
recipe is telling you to can it

00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:12.260
in a boiling water
bath, you can only can

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.140
things in a boiling water bath,
canners, that are high in acid

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.810
already.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.893
So your jams, and your
pickles, and your chutneys,

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:20.550
and your jellies, and
your tomato products,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.434
although I'm going
to put a mental

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:24.100
asterisk next to
tomatoes, because we're

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.000
going to come back
to those in a second.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.670
But all of these
high acid preserves

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.470
that can be canned in
a boiling water bath,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.410
it is impossible for botulism
to grow in those environments.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.640
Because botulism-- when
we talk about botulism,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.920
we're talking about
the botulism spores.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.050
So the botulism toxin is
killed at the boiling point.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.220
But those spores are very hardy.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.640
And they take temperatures
of around 235 to 240 degrees

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.830
Fahrenheit to be killed.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.990
And at sea level on our
planet in this atmosphere,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.430
we are never going to be able to
boil water beyond 212 degrees.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.240
And then the higher up
in elevation you go,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.130
the lower your
boiling point goes.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.150
And so when you can
something, and you

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.020
need to kill off
botulism spores,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.660
or you need to
inhibit their growth,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.220
you either need to make the
environment highly acidic,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.450
so they can't develop.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.892
Or you need to elevate
the temperature in order

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:13.600
to kill them off.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.160
So if you're working with
these high acid preserves,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.909
you don't have to
elevate the temperature,

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.324
because the acidic environment
prevents their germination

00:04:20.324 --> 00:04:21.660
into the toxin.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.930
But if you do low
acid foods, then you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.160
can get into the whole
pressure canning world.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.130
I always tell people it's
better to sort of walk

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.930
before you can run.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.888
So you want to start
getting really comfortable

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:33.640
with canning, do the
boiling water bath,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.260
feel happy and at ease
moving jars of food

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.760
in and out of pots
of boiling water.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.926
And then once you feel
really comfortable with that,

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.250
you can go, proceed, get
yourself a pressure canner,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.724
and start doing cool things
like homemade flavored beans,

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:50.140
or chicken stock, or vegetable
stock, and stuff like that.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.750
But for now, I like
to start everybody off

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.310
with the boiling
water bath process.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.810
How's everybody feel about that?

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.420
Feeling good?

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.394
Got the science?

00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:00.810
You didn't know there was going
to be so much science when

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.505
you came to a cooking
demonstration, right?

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:05.430
But I like to get
everybody on the same page,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.804
make sure that everyone feels
comfortable with the safety

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:09.910
part, and then go from there.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.370
So any safety
questions after that?

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.790
Everybody's good?

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.290
Everybody's happy to be here?

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.790
Yeah.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.165
AUDIENCE: So if you're making
something with tomatoes,

00:05:18.165 --> 00:05:19.595
you [INAUDIBLE] cannot get
botulism [INAUDIBLE] or you

00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:20.094
can?

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:22.540
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Yes.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.750
So tomatoes.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.230
So most fruit already
naturally has a pH below 4.6.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.580
Like these plums, the
pH range for plums

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.000
is typically like
3.0 to 3.7 or 8.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.970
Tomatoes, we think of tomatoes
as being very high acid.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.820
But actually, because we, as
Americans, have a sweet tooth,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.640
over the last 50
years, tomato growers

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.635
have responded to that
by breeding tomatoes that

00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:47.260
are lower in acid
than they used to be.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.185
So what we've done is
made a very sweet tomato

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:51.520
that is no longer safe for
canning in a boiling water

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.180
canner unless you
do what's called

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.550
acidifying the environment.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.560
So anytime you can
tomatoes, you either

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.520
add bottled lemon
juice or citric acid

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.190
to the preserve to ensure that
the acid levels in the jar

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.500
are high enough that the
pH is low enough in order

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.520
to prevent any possible botulism
germination from occurring.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.770
And you either use citric
acid or bottled lemon juice,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.690
because they both have
a consistent acidity.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.460
You can't use fresh lemon
juice, because the acidic levels

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.390
of lemon juice varies
greatly on a fresh lemon.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.420
But bottled products,
there's a requirement

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.420
that they all have a consistent
acidity across every bottle.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.440
So you know that you're
getting the same thing

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.737
with every bottle of
bottled lemon juice.

00:06:33.737 --> 00:06:35.820
There are also a few other
fruits that you acidify

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.460
like that-- figs, white
peaches, and white nectarines,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.430
Asian pears, and then
melons, and mangoes.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.846
So sort of more of the
tropical fruits and things

00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:47.720
where they just don't
taste as acidic to you.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.900
If it doesn't
taste as acidic as,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.660
you know, like, a white peach
doesn't taste nearly as acidic

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.420
as a yellow peach.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.003
That's your indication
that, huh, this

00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:56.370
might not have as much acid.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.260
Maybe I need to boost it
a little to make it safe.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.390
Everybody good?

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.650
OK, cool.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.750
So I have chopped up about two
pounds of plums right here.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.410
And I'm going to measure in
approximately about a cup

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.710
and a quarter of sugar.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.420
I'm using sort of fancy
organic evaporated cane juice.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.640
It doesn't really matter.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.600
You can use plain
old granulated sugar.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.950
You can use whatever you have.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.590
I've brought this,
because I wasn't

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.400
going to tear the bag
while I traveled here

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400
from Philadelphia today.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.359
So it's all about practicality.

00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:33.650
I didn't bring a measuring cup.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.550
That was one thing I forgot.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.480
But I'm going to
eyeball it, and it's

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.030
going to be about right, because
this is a pound and a half.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.655
And so I'm going to use about
a little more than a third

00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:43.155
of the bag.

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:44.610
AUDIENCE: Did you peel them?

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.151
MARISA MCCLELLAN:
I didn't peel them.

00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:48.120
You never need to peel
plums, because they

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.510
are-- if you peel a plum,
they are unbalanced,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.180
because they're sweet on the
inside and tart on the outside.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.465
So if you peel them, you
lose the tart balance.

00:07:55.465 --> 00:07:57.080
And so I didn't peel them.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.130
In fact, that's
why these recipes

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.980
are so handy is that you
don't have to peel them.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.370
You can just chop them and
mix them with the sugar.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.724
So I've got my sugar in here.

00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:07.140
And we're actually
going to let it

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.440
sit for just a couple minutes
before I apply the heat.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.000
You never want to apply
heat to undissolved sugar

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.770
unless you're trying
to make caramel.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.929
And caramel is
delicious, and I highly

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:18.970
encourage you to make it.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.011
But I don't want to
caramelize the sugar in here,

00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:23.010
because once you start
caramelizing sugar,

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.842
it's very easy to
start burning it.

00:08:24.842 --> 00:08:26.300
And I don't want
this to get burnt.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.112
So I'm just going
to let the fruit sit

00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:29.570
with the sugar for
a minute or two.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.070
And the sugar will
start to pull out

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.400
the moisture from the fruit.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.740
And then that moisture will
start to dissolve the sugar.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.970
So it will be this nice,
syrupy fruit cocktail

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.340
before I apply the heat.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.005
One fun tip.

00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:45.130
And I'm also going to add
the juice of half a lemon

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.760
here just to help things start
to dissolve a little bit more

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.360
and to add more balance to
the fruit and the sugar.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.075
So one nifty thing you can do
at this point is-- for instance,

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:57.950
you go to the farmer's
market, you come home.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.560
You've bought a quart of plums,
and they're a little bit riper

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.760
than you thought they were.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.921
Or in the travel from
farmer's market to home,

00:09:05.921 --> 00:09:07.170
they got a little bit beat up.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.586
And you're like,
huh, I don't know

00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:11.129
if these are going to last
me throughout the week.

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:13.170
So what you can do is
actually chop them up right

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.910
at that point, mix
them with the sugar,

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.545
and put them in a container, and
put them in the refrigerator,

00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:18.870
and just let them sit for
a day or two until you have

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.780
time to come back
and make the jam.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.510
It's a really good way to
break up the work of canning,

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.940
particularly if you have
busy lives, which I'm just

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.382
going to guess
that all of you do.

00:09:28.382 --> 00:09:30.090
And so you can chop
up the fruit one day,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.150
and combine it with the sugar,
let it sit for two or three

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.275
days, up to two or three
days, in the refrigerator,

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:37.115
and then come back to it the
next-- when you're ready to can

00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:39.170
it up, make the
jam, and can it up.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.078
And so it's a good way
to sort of say, OK,

00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:42.702
I'm going to touch
it this day, and I'm

00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:44.285
gong to touch it
that day, but I don't

00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:46.510
have to dedicate a
lot of time to this.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.479
Although, you're going to see,
this doesn't take that long.

00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:51.520
It took me all of 10
minutes to cut up the fruit.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.050
And then once we apply
the heat to this,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.810
this jam is going to cook
in about 12 to 15 minutes,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.890
maybe a little longer.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.630
I often demo on induction
burners, which are amazing,

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.090
because they offer such direct
heat and they cook really fast.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.380
So it's a very
handy fuel source.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.411
Any questions about
all this so far?

00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:10.910
Yeah.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.699
AUDIENCE: Is it
advantageous to leave it

00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:14.032
in the refrigerator for a while?

00:10:14.032 --> 00:10:16.270
MARISA MCCLELLAN:
What it simply does

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.740
is that it helps pull
out all the syrup.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.360
So you're sort of at that
syrupy, ready-to-cook time

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.230
faster.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.730
So you might shave two or three
minutes off the cooking time

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.670
if you let it macerate
for a day or two.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.160
Or even an hour, you'll
get that syrupy effect.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.151
Anybody else?

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:34.650
All right.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.130
Cool.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.630
Oh, yeah.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.591
Go ahead.

00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:38.701
AUDIENCE: Is it possible
to use less sugar if you

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:39.520
want it less sweet? [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.800
MARISA MCCLELLAN: I was actually
just about to talk about that,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.460
so that's the perfect question.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.610
So when it comes to
canning, making a preserve

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.610
like this-- and this jam is only
going to have four ingredients.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.000
It's plums, sugar, lemon
juice, and a vanilla bean,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.450
which I'll get in
there in just a second.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.944
So sugar doesn't just sweeten.

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.610
It's not just playing
a sweetening role.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.640
It's also playing
a role in creating

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.192
the consistency of the jam,
and it's also a preservative.

00:11:02.192 --> 00:11:04.400
So when you reduce the sugar
in a preserve-- and this

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.010
is actually considered a
fairly low-sugar jam recipe

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:13.210
in the context of the
traditional canning canon.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.380
Often, the recipes that
our grandmothers made

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.850
would be one part fruit
to one part sugar,

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.720
because they were
really just trying

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.380
to preserve the fruit
as best they knew how.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.944
And they knew that to be, you
need to use a lot of sugar.

00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:26.360
And so over the
years, we've found

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.720
that you can get a nice
set with less sugar.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.640
But at a certain point, when
you pull out too much sugar,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.640
it becomes very hard
to get it to thicken

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.314
unless you use a low
or no sugar pectin.

00:11:39.314 --> 00:11:41.230
And there are some really
good ones out there.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.680
One that I particularly like
is called Pomona's Pectin.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.395
And what's cool about it is--
so what's going to happen

00:11:47.395 --> 00:11:50.890
is as we cook this
jam, the water

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.560
is going to evaporate
out of the fruit,

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.268
and the sugars are
going to concentrate--

00:11:54.268 --> 00:11:56.970
both the sugar I added as
well as the sugars that

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.470
are natural to the fruit.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.840
And so as they
concentrate, sugar

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.810
has this really nifty ability
to change physical consistency

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.750
as you heat it.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.040
So as you heat the sugar up
and the water evaporates out

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.080
of the pan, you're
going to enable

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.410
the sugars to elevate
beyond the boiling point.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.910
And so what we're
going to try to do

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.230
is cook them to
around 220 degrees.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.610
And at that point, those
sugars will start to thicken.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.260
And it's actually
known as the gel phase

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.740
for sugar, for heating sugar.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.430
And so as that
sugars thickens, it's

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.460
going to bond with the pectin
that's natural to the fruit.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.570
And so it reaches that 220 mark.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.800
And because I'm making a
small batch-- you'll notice,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.582
I didn't add any pectin to this.

00:12:37.582 --> 00:12:39.540
And some people think,
well, you can't make jam

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.623
without additional pectin.

00:12:40.623 --> 00:12:43.039
But pectin is actually
the fiber that

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:45.080
holds up the cell walls
of fruits and vegetables.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.510
I'm going to turn this on, so
that we don't-- I don't lose

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.820
too much time just
talking without cooking.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.321
So pectin is the
fiber that holds up

00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:53.986
the cell walls of
fruits and vegetables.

00:12:53.986 --> 00:12:55.710
It exists in all
fruits and vegetables,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.610
and some things have
more of it than others.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.300
So you can always tell whether
something has a lot of pectin

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.810
or a little bit of pectin
by its physical consistency.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.290
Because if it's got more
pectin, it's sturdier.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.579
So like a lemon, you can
throw a lemon across the room,

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.495
and it still looks like
a lemon when it lands.

00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:12.340
It's very sturdy.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.449
Whereas, like this is a
fairly not super-ripe plum.

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:17.990
I could probably chuck this,
and it would still land and look

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.490
like a plum.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.870
But if I had a really
ripe peach or something,

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.410
and I lobbed it
across the room, peach

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.030
puree all over the
greens over there.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.295
So it's just a good way
to tell, does something

00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:31.920
have a lot of pectin or a little
bit of pectin by its, sort of,

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.760
ability to withstand force.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.790
Another good example
is strawberries

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:37.600
versus blueberries.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.390
When you drop a strawberry,
it is strawberry splatter.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.670
You drop a blueberry,
and it bounces.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.670
So it's ways that you can
tell whether something

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.545
has a lot of pectin or
a little bit of pectin

00:13:47.545 --> 00:13:48.840
is by how it withstands.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.210
I also like to think of it
like the lunch bag test.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.710
You drop an apple
in your lunch bag,

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.149
you walk around for four hours.

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:57.690
That apple is still going to be
edible and look like an apple

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.860
when you go back to eat it.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.220
You do that with a pear,
and it's pear pudding.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.844
So again, you can
see how something

00:14:02.844 --> 00:14:04.510
has more pectin or
less pectin dependant

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.710
on its physical consistency.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.630
So for this preserve, plums
have a fair amount of pectin.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.630
And so what we're doing
with this small batch

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.310
is that we're going
to elevate-- and you

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.810
notice I'm doing
it in a frying pan.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.320
This is not just that this
was the only pan available.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.340
In fact, they had to
go hunt for this pan.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.559
I was like, I need a
stainless steel pan, please.

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:23.100
And so they went
and hunted for this.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.030
So it's this pan's inaugural
use here at Google.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.260
I feel very honored to be
taking it for its maiden voyage.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.060
I like a frying pan or a
skillet for preserves like this,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.200
because you get a lot of surface
area and very little depth.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.530
And you don't have
high walls on the pan,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.087
preventing the
steam from escaping.

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:41.670
So what's going to
happen is that this

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.930
is going to cook up to
a boil really quickly.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.170
We're going to get to that
220 point relatively fast.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.430
And then, we won't have
cooked all the sort of starch,

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.540
all of the structure
out of the pectin,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.640
by the time the sugars
get to 220 degrees.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.870
And so they'll bond.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.880
And so this is how you can
get a really nice consistency

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.540
for your jam without
any additional pectin,

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.740
because we're making
a small batch.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.830
Now, if you wanted to do
this with even less sugar,

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.640
you would use a low or no sugar
pectin like Pomona's Pectin.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.150
And Pomona's Pectin is cool.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.570
It's called a
low-methoxyl pectin.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.830
That's kind of its category.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.910
And so instead of needing the
sugar to bond with the pectin

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.040
in order to create a set,
when you buy a box of Pomona's

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.990
Pectin, it comes with
two packets in it.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.520
One is a little packet that
has calcium powder in it.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.740
And the other one has
pectin powder in it

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.440
that is made from dehydrated
lemon and lime peels that

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.850
have been dehydrated,
ground, and sifted.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.090
So it's essentially just
a very, very fine powder

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.500
of lemon and lime essence.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.240
And with that
pectin, what you do

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.394
is you make a solution
with the calcium powder.

00:15:45.394 --> 00:15:47.560
And then you add that
solution to your cooking fruit

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.980
without any sugar.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.314
And then, once the
fruit has softened,

00:15:51.314 --> 00:15:52.730
you add the pectin
powder that has

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.105
been stirred into
your sweetener,

00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:57.370
whether you're using some
honey, or maple syrup, or sugar,

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.210
or coconut sugar,
whatever you're using.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:05.720
And when the pectin hits the
calcium, sort of spiked fruit,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.910
the pectin and the calcium
bond and create a set.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.780
So it's not ever going
to be quite as, sort of,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.285
luxurious and soft
and sort of-- you

00:16:17.285 --> 00:16:20.030
know how when you get sort of
like a good handmade, regularly

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.560
sugared jam, it has a little
bit of movement and body

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.347
and is kind of spoon-able.

00:16:26.347 --> 00:16:27.930
When you use Pomona's
Pectin, it likes

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.550
to set up a little
bit more firmly.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.630
And so you get something that's
more like an all-fruit spread

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.420
that you can buy at
the grocery store.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.586
But it's a really good way
to create a preserve that

00:16:35.586 --> 00:16:39.380
is spreadable and still
delicious with less sugar.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.270
The one thing to know
about Pomona's Pectin

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.920
is simply-- oops, I just
lost a-- nobody saw that.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.710
Is that when you take
out a lot of sugar,

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.260
you have to compensate for
the flavor someplace else.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.420
So when I make really low
or no sugar preserves,

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.839
I like to add a lot of
lemon, or a lot of lime,

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:57.880
or a lot of orange,
something that's very acidic,

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.380
so that you are balancing
out the lack of sweetness

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.030
with some other bright flavor.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.260
So it's just something
that's good to know

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.593
if you want to explore those
low and no sugar preserves,

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:10.319
that you need to compensate with
lots of spice and lots of acid

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.902
to create something that's still
going to be balanced and have

00:17:12.902 --> 00:17:14.270
a lot of flavor.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.230
All right.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.819
How's everybody doing?

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:17.700
Good?

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.502
Any questions?

00:17:19.502 --> 00:17:20.960
Doesn't just have
to be about this.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.326
Any food preservation
questions, I'm here for you.

00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:24.826
Yes.

00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:26.951
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between jam, jelly,

00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:27.546
and preserves?

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:28.420
MARISA MCCLELLAN: OK.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.800
That's a really good question.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.780
A jelly is a preserve made
with just fruit juice,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.460
or sometimes not
even fruit juice.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.314
It can be-- like I've known
people who make beer jellies.

00:17:39.314 --> 00:17:40.730
But it's essentially
a liquid that

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.420
has had either added
sugar or added sweetener,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.050
and often pectin to make it sort
of a solid, clear, spreadable

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.490
preserve.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.350
And so preserve is sort of
just the all-purpose word.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.540
And then also,
preserve is often used

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.150
to refer to sort of
bigger pieces of fruit

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.760
in syrup that isn't
quite as set as jam.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.980
Jam is a whole
fruit preserve that

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.850
can either have
additional pectin or not,

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.760
but is sort of fruit
and syrup all together.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.742
And then so the preserve is
sort of this all-purpose term.

00:18:11.742 --> 00:18:13.200
And then you've
got a fruit butter,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.240
which is a fruit puree
that has been cooked

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.610
down slowly and over low
heat over time, so that you

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.270
concentrate the
fiber in the fruit.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.197
You cook out the water, you
concentrate the sweetness.

00:18:23.197 --> 00:18:25.280
I'm sure everybody's had
apple butter in the past.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.571
You can do that with any fruit.

00:18:26.571 --> 00:18:29.620
So I've done blueberry butters,
and strawberry butters.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.050
Sweet cherry butter
is awfully good.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.280
And so you can do that with
a lot different fruits.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.230
Jelly, jam, preserve, butter.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.940
Curd.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.560
Fruit curds are a
fruit juice preserve

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.900
that's set up with egg yolk and
then has butter added to it.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.050
So it's a very
rich, spreadable--

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.180
I'm just kind of finding all
the different terms for you now.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.467
AUDIENCE: Compote.

00:18:57.467 --> 00:18:58.550
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Compote.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.299
That's a good one.

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:03.530
So compote is a less sweetened,
typically in a thin syrup,

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.110
fruit that's been cooked down.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.925
It's not going to have as much
sugar, honey, or whatever.

00:19:07.925 --> 00:19:10.050
It's going to be-- and
often, they're made quickly.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.452
So often, compotes
are just like,

00:19:11.452 --> 00:19:12.910
oh, I have this
peach and this plum

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.100
and these few cherries
that need to be used up.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.850
Let me just cook them
down, and then we'll

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.380
put them over oatmeal is kind
of compote's driving force.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.080
A conserve is a jam that has
either citrus peel, or nuts,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.300
or dried fruit added to it.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.610
Ooh, a chutney.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.826
Chutneys are sort
of like a jam, only

00:19:28.826 --> 00:19:30.200
it's a sweet and
savory preserve.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.900
So it's like fruit, and sugar,
and vinegar, and spices,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.910
and onions, or garlic,
things like that.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.250
And so it's really got both the
sweet and the savory element

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:39.907
in one jar.

00:19:39.907 --> 00:19:42.490
Just to note, if you ever make
chutneys, and you open the jar,

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.260
and you find that it's really
overpoweringly vinegary,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.030
I find that chutney
has a lot in common

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.514
with wine in terms of
its needs to breathe

00:19:49.514 --> 00:19:50.680
after you've opened the jar.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.545
Because you've made the chutney,
you've slapped the lid on it,

00:19:53.545 --> 00:19:54.520
you processed it.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.640
And then it sort of has
been just hanging out.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.015
And it needs a
little bit of time

00:19:58.015 --> 00:20:00.780
to release some of that vinegar.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.510
I just realized, I need to
get my vanilla bean in here

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.630
as things simmer away.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.600
Fresh vanilla beans
are a really great way

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.229
to add a lot of flavor to jams.

00:20:10.229 --> 00:20:12.270
They can be really expensive
if you just buy them

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.940
by the one or the two
at the grocery store.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.350
I tend to buy them in bulk.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.770
I am a little obsessive
about this sort of thing.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.600
But anybody can
buy them in bulk.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.770
You don't have to just
be a preserver to do it.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:28.090
And a pound of grade B
vanilla beans are about $55.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.020
So when you buy them
at the grocery store,

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.930
you'll pay $10 or
$20 for two beans.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.950
And if you buy them in
bulk, you'll spend $55,

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.880
you'll get 150 to 180 beans.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.990
And so if you're interested
in adding vanilla bean

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.880
to your pantry, it's always
fun to go in with a friend

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.306
and buy, like, a half pound
or a pound, and split them up.

00:20:49.306 --> 00:20:51.680
And then you can do cool stuff
like make your own vanilla

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.417
extract, or vanilla finishing
salts, or flavored sugars,

00:20:55.417 --> 00:20:56.250
and stuff like that.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.530
So it's a fun, little
pantry addition

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.150
if you find yourself loving
the flavor of fresh vanilla

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.800
bean in your preserves.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.410
And all I did was I split the
bean down the center, I exposed

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.652
the two, I exposed the interior.

00:21:09.652 --> 00:21:11.360
And then I just used
the flat of my knife

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.475
to scrape those seeds out.

00:21:12.475 --> 00:21:14.058
And then I added the
seeds to the pan.

00:21:14.058 --> 00:21:16.300
And now I'm also going to
drop the pod into the pan

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.000
in order to extract as much
flavor from it as possible.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.560
I always tell people to
add the seeds to the pan,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.680
because I had a friend
email me one day and say,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.136
I made your preserve, I
made your pear vanilla jam,

00:21:28.136 --> 00:21:29.510
and you didn't
tell me what to do

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.420
once I scraped the vanilla bean.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.929
So I threw away the
scrapings, and I just

00:21:33.929 --> 00:21:35.095
popped the pod into the pan.

00:21:35.095 --> 00:21:36.810
And it broke my heart,
because the seeds

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.080
are where all the goodness is.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.935
Like, you get some
flavor from the pod too.

00:21:39.935 --> 00:21:41.810
But I just like to make
sure everybody knows.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.940
You're going to scrape
those seeds out,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.110
and you're going to
add them to the pan.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.320
So let's take a look
at how this is looking.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.080
One of my favorite ways to
tell whether jam is finished

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.180
is by looking at the
droplets on a spatula to see,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.810
is it thickening up?

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.330
Because what this does
is, as it thickens,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.566
it's going to change
consistency as it cools down.

00:22:02.566 --> 00:22:04.440
So when you run your
spatula through and then

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.609
hold up the droplets, it's
going to cool down rapidly,

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:09.775
this little sample that
you've taken out of the pan.

00:22:09.775 --> 00:22:12.460
And so you can look and see,
do I have thick droplets?

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.280
Do they look thick?

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.480
Do they have a wide base that
are hanging onto the spatula

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.450
as I wiggle it?

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.954
This one's not there yet.

00:22:18.954 --> 00:22:20.620
But it's nice to set
a baseline and look

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.390
at the droplets over
the time that it's

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.272
cooking to see how
it's setting up.

00:22:25.272 --> 00:22:27.105
Another way-- and you
can't really see this,

00:22:27.105 --> 00:22:28.900
but I'm going to
explain it to you--

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.050
is that one of the nice things
about making this in a skillet

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.940
is that you can tell that it's
thickening up as you stir,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.220
because when you
pull a line through,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.730
as it gets closer to being
done, that space will stay open.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.050
And so you can very easily tell.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.090
You'll be able to kind
of sculpt it in the pan.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.530
And so as it continues
to cook, you'll

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.827
be able to see it kind
of thicken up in the pan.

00:22:52.827 --> 00:22:54.783
AUDIENCE: How long
does the vanilla bean

00:22:54.783 --> 00:22:57.340
stay for in the cabinet?

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.470
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Oh,
how long in the cabinet?

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.300
I am working through
a batch that I

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.752
bought almost two years ago.

00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:04.710
And what I do is I triple
wrap them in plastic,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.310
so I have three Ziploc
bags inside of each other.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.170
And I just keep them in a cool--
like in the corner of a kitchen

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:12.680
cabinet.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.570
They don't need to be in the
refrigerator or the freezer.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.910
And they really last awhile.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.810
And if they do harden
up, you can just

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.820
put them in some warm water
for a minute or two before you

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.440
use them.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.400
And it's enough to
sort of re-plump it.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.930
And then you can get
good flavor out of it.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:27.730
Yeah.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.640
They give a lot.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.170
And the nice thing, too, is
that once this jam is finished

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.030
cooking, we can actually take
that vanilla bean out, rinse it

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.810
off, dry it off,
and then you could

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.610
let it sit on
your-- let it cool,

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.590
or dry on your counter
for a day or so.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.520
And then put it
in a jar of sugar,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.850
and it will still be able
to flavor that sugar.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.925
If you're making some
homemade vanilla extract,

00:23:47.925 --> 00:23:50.825
you can drop that pod that
has been cooked and scraped,

00:23:50.825 --> 00:23:53.540
and it'll still add flavor
to the vanilla extract.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.600
So you can get a
lot out of them.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.630
Can you guys smell this?

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.150
Are you getting
the smell of this?

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.190
Shoot.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.585
It smells really good right
here, let me just tell you.

00:24:02.585 --> 00:24:03.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.840
All right.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.960
Oh.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.690
Does someone have a question?

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:08.190
All right.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.850
So another way that you can
tell the jam is getting near

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.710
to its done point
is that as you stir,

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.350
it's going to sizzle
a little bit more

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.840
frantically as you stir it.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.430
And so I always try to
say to people that it's

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.430
going to tell you
both visually, it's

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.600
going to tell you as
the smell, the aroma

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.580
get stronger, that
it's almost done.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.080
And it's going to get glossier,
and you're going to hear it.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.455
You're going to
hear that sizzle.

00:24:30.455 --> 00:24:32.167
So it's talking to you.

00:24:32.167 --> 00:24:33.250
The pan is talking to you.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.161
So just as long as
you know the language,

00:24:35.161 --> 00:24:37.410
you're going to be able to
know that your jam is done.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:38.951
So I'm going to be
quiet for a second

00:24:38.951 --> 00:24:42.870
now and stir, and see if you
guys can hear the sizzle.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.389
Did you hear that?

00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:46.680
So that's an indication that
the temperature is hotter,

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.720
that the jam, physically, is
hotter than 212 degrees now.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.679
And I'm cooking at high.

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:55.470
The name of the game
is evaporation, right?

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.470
So you want to have your
temperature up as high,

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.630
cook as hot and fast
as you possibly can

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:04.800
without burning yourself
and without burning the jam.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.400
I don't want you to hurt
yourself when you make this.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.540
So if you need to sacrifice
and have a couple minutes

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.020
longer cooking time
to prevent yourself

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.830
from getting a second degree
burn from splashing jam

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.030
on your arm, please turn
the temperature down.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.550
But do try to keep it up as high
as you can manage and control

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.659
without doing harm to yourself.

00:25:23.659 --> 00:25:25.825
So let's talk a little bit
about the canning process

00:25:25.825 --> 00:25:27.550
now, because that's really
what we're here for, right?

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.776
You don't want to
just hear about jam,

00:25:28.776 --> 00:25:30.067
you want to hear about canning.

00:25:30.067 --> 00:25:31.740
So this is my canning
pot for today.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.970
And this is my teeny, tiny
small-batch canning pot.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.290
I use it at home a lot.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.200
It's really handy.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.600
It's not designed for canning,
but it works really well

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.100
for canning.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.959
This pot's called
the 4th Burner pot.

00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:43.500
And what I really like about it
is that it's tall and narrow,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.410
so you can stack a
couple jars inside of it.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.750
And here, I'll show you what
I have in here right now.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.970
I just have two of these
little wide-mouth half

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.910
pints stacked one on
top of each other.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.632
And this batch is going
to make probably enough

00:25:56.632 --> 00:25:58.590
to fill these jars with
a little bit left over,

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.790
so that we can taste
when we're all done.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.021
Although, I didn't bring
anything to taste on.

00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:04.770
We'll cross that bridge
when we get there.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.853
There's snacks everywhere.

00:26:05.853 --> 00:26:08.560
I'm sure we can find a cracker.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.580
So what I like about
this pot, the reason

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.260
it's such a good
pot for canning is

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.860
that it comes fitted
with this little rack.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.940
Any time you can,
you want to make sure

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.139
that you are-- any pot
can be a canning pot.

00:26:20.139 --> 00:26:21.555
You just need to
make sure that it

00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:25.790
has a rack in it to ensure
that the jars are elevated off

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.100
the bottom of the pot, so
that the water can circulate,

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.540
and so that they
don't rattle and break

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.250
on the bottom of the pot.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.833
Because you know how
when water boils,

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:34.420
the little bubbles originate
from the bottom of the pan,

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.450
and they move upwards
with increasing force.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.250
And so when they
bubble and boil up,

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.000
they can actually rattle those
jars enough to break them.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.900
And so you just want
to have something

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.941
at the bottom of the pot.

00:26:43.941 --> 00:26:47.100
When you're dong larger
batches, you a silicone trivet

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:47.600
will work.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.694
This is my favorite sort of
modified canning rack, modified

00:26:50.694 --> 00:26:52.860
in the sense that I drop
it in the bottom of the pot

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.330
and call it a canning rack.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.269
It's a silicone trivet.

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:58.560
It's called the blossom trivet.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.150
They sell it on Amazon.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.900
If you go looking for one,
click through all the colors

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.697
before you buy it, because
they vary in price, $3 or $4,

00:27:07.697 --> 00:27:09.030
depending on what color you get.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.260
So the algorithm.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.420
Who knows?

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.745
So depending on whether you
want black or pink or orange,

00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:20.780
you might pay $3
or $4 more or less.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.380
But orange was the cheapest
the last time I bought it,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.450
so that's why I
have an orange one.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.242
Oops, we're getting a
little sticking here.

00:27:27.242 --> 00:27:27.741
All right.

00:27:27.741 --> 00:27:29.260
I'm going to stir
and pay attention

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.310
to this for just a moment.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.810
All right.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:33.875
Let's look at our
droplets one more time,

00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:35.750
and then I'll talk about
the canning process.

00:27:39.772 --> 00:27:41.230
So you see how much
thicker they've

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.470
gotten in just a couple
minutes of cooking?

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.210
That sugar is concentrating.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.440
The water is cooking out.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.410
We're getting a lot of
steam happening here.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.618
And I would say in just
another two or three minutes,

00:27:50.618 --> 00:27:52.780
this is going to be
done, which is great.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.430
See?

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.670
It doesn't take all
day to make jam.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:56.360
It's very nice.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.430
We'll talk a little
bit about pickles,

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.980
too, because pickles are another
one where people are selling

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.655
us, sort off-- you
know, you buy a $12 jar

00:28:03.655 --> 00:28:07.980
of pickles or a $15 or
$20 jar of pickles--

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.420
it cost them $2 to
make those pickles.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.900
You can do that at home.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.060
Very easy, very delicious.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.020
There's nothing better
than a homemade pickle.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.546
But so let's talk about
the canning process.

00:28:17.546 --> 00:28:19.550
Let me turn this
down a little bit.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.249
So any pot can be a
canning pot as long

00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:24.290
as it's tall enough to
hold a rack at the bottom,

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:25.840
have the jars fully
submerged in water,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.670
have a little bit of water
covering them at the top,

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.919
and then have some room at
the top of the pot to boil.

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:33.665
So a stainless steel stockpot,
it can be a great canning pot.

00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:35.640
If you have a pasta
pot with an insert,

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.600
that's a really
good canning pot.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.320
This 4th Burner pot,
an asparagus pot,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.010
which is sort of a less
fancy 4th Burner pot.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.540
Whatever you have,
you can make it

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.820
work as long as the
pot is tall enough

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.560
to fully submerge the jar.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.120
So I've heated up the jars.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.812
I brought this pot to a boil
before I cooked the jam.

00:28:54.812 --> 00:28:57.020
And then they've just been
hanging out, sitting here.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.630
They don't have to be
sterilised before we

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.457
put the jam in the
jars, because we're

00:29:01.457 --> 00:29:03.790
going to boil the jars once
they're full for 10 minutes.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.330
And if you boil something
for 10 minutes or longer,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.700
that is your sterilization step.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.450
So you don't have to
worry that everything

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.430
has to be perfectly,
meticulously immaculate.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.660
All we need is for it
to be clean and hot when

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.100
we put the finished jam in it.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.390
And we're going
to wipe the rims,

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.030
put the lids and
rings on the jars,

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.370
and put them back in the water.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:27.550
One thing is that when we
put the jam in the jars,

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.595
we always want to make sure
to leave some head space.

00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:33.740
And head space is simply
the amount of space

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.281
to leave from the
top of the product,

00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:37.670
so how much it's filled
up, to the top of the jar.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.420
And you typically
want about-- let

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.960
me get it turned
to the right place.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.370
You want about half an inch.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.700
And the reason for that
is that that half an inch

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.180
of head space, that oxygen
that you trap in the jar,

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.240
is going to create the seal.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.100
Because when you
fill up these jars,

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.680
you're going to fill them up so
that the product is somewhere

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.580
in between where the
continuous thread overlaps.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.159
So every mason jar has
a continuous thread.

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:01.950
And then there's a
point where it overlaps.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.700
You just want your
product to be somewhere

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.220
in between the top
and the bottom thread.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.929
You've trapped that
oxygen in there.

00:30:07.929 --> 00:30:10.220
And when you put the rings
on, you tighten them enough,

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.100
so that they meet resistance,
they're fully on there.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.516
But you don't
tighten them so much

00:30:13.516 --> 00:30:15.160
that the oxygen can't escape.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.380
Because when we put the
full jars back in the water

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.880
and we apply heat
to it, that oxygen

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.421
that we've trapped
in that head space

00:30:21.421 --> 00:30:23.640
is going to start to
vent as we boil the jars,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.320
because the heat makes
the oxygen agitate,

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.370
and move around,
and exit the jars.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.540
And so throughout
the boiling process--

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.210
you guys are all
science-y people,

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.670
and I'm probably explaining this
terribly for science-y people.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.624
But it's basically,
they're venting.

00:30:37.624 --> 00:30:39.790
The jars are venting
throughout the boiling process,

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.380
so that when we take
them out, everything

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.463
that had been expanding
during the boiling process

00:30:43.463 --> 00:30:44.570
starts to contract.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.580
And as it contracts,
you form a vacuum.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.572
And as that vacuum
forms-- because there's

00:30:48.572 --> 00:30:50.280
nothing there to hold
that space anymore,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.405
because we vented all the
oxygen out that was there

00:30:52.405 --> 00:30:55.380
before-- that lid pulls down.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.110
And it pulls down
in a way where you

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.560
create a natural vacuum
that is then backed up

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.300
by the sealing
compound on the lid.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.130
And so these lids
are in the water,

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.630
because I want to
soften this rubber

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:07.800
ring, this sealing compound.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.770
It'll soften continually
throughout the boiling process.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.390
And then when we
take those jars out

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.960
and that vacuum
starts to pull, it's

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.168
going to pull this lid in
tighter and tighter contact

00:31:18.168 --> 00:31:19.280
with the rim of that jar.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.940
And then as the
jars are cooling,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.230
the sealing compound hardens.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.840
So it's sort of a double seal.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.840
You've got a natural
vacuum backed up

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.800
by this hardening
sealing compound.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.080
I always like to say that
it's like when you were a kid

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.080
and you put a cup on your
face, over your mouth,

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.770
and you sucked
in, and sucked in,

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.810
and sucked in until the
cup stuck to your face.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.730
That's basically what's
happening in the jar.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.555
And then it's as if someone
put, like, super glue on the cup

00:31:43.555 --> 00:31:45.430
without you knowing it,
and you sucked it in,

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.890
and it stuck to your face,
not that anyone would do that.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.940
It's sort of a ridiculous
analogy, I know.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.090
But that's kind of-- if you
want to think about sort

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.790
of a real-life scenario of
how the vacuum is forming

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.640
and what's backing it up, that's
kind of what's happening there.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.592
So let's look at our jam.

00:31:59.592 --> 00:32:01.175
I'm going to turn
this all the way up.

00:32:01.175 --> 00:32:03.065
Did I kill my-- I think
I killed the-- yeah.

00:32:03.065 --> 00:32:05.580
Killed the heat.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.560
So it's almost there.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.370
I'm just going to bring it
back up to an active boil

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.500
for just a second more.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.470
It's still got this little--
once it sits in the pan,

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.470
it spreads a little bit
more than I like it to,

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.680
and it's got little bits
of water around the edges.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.610
So I just want to cook
that last bit of water

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:24.860
out and make sure that it's
going be nice and thick.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.130
AUDIENCE: You never use
frozen fruits, right?

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.200
MARISA MCCLELLAN: You
can use frozen fruits.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.660
When you freeze fruit,
you take those cells,

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.870
every little cell in the fruit.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.420
And when you freeze it, the
water inside those cells

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.240
expands, and it bursts
all the cell walls.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.400
And so then when it defrosts,
it releases its liquid,

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.070
and it's not going to have
as much pectin content,

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.707
because you've
sort of bust open--

00:32:48.707 --> 00:32:51.290
you've broken down that pectin
in the cell walls a little bit.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.415
So you're going to have to
work a little bit harder

00:32:53.415 --> 00:32:56.270
to get frozen fruit to
come to a set point,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:00.370
because if I'm making
jam with frozen fruit,

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.480
I always make sure
to use some pectin,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.605
because you're going to
need a little pectin boost,

00:33:04.605 --> 00:33:06.889
because you've sort of
stressed the natural pectin

00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:07.430
in the fruit.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.224
But you certainly can do it.

00:33:09.224 --> 00:33:12.010
AUDIENCE: What did you use to
pull the lid out of the water?

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:14.060
MARISA MCCLELLAN: This
is called the lid wand.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.270
It's a plastic stick
with a magnet on the end.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.490
And it is the best
tool ever, because you

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.240
can move your lids in
and out of the water

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.680
without burning yourself.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.960
When it comes to
canning, there are really

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.010
three tools that I recommend
as sort of must-haves.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.765
This is pretty handy,
and it costs, like, $3.

00:33:29.765 --> 00:33:30.937
So you know.

00:33:30.937 --> 00:33:32.308
AUDIENCE: For all colors?

00:33:32.308 --> 00:33:34.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:35.221
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Yes.

00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:37.262
These days, I see it mostly
in fluorescent green.

00:33:37.262 --> 00:33:40.660
But if you look hard, you
could still get the blue ones.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.060
So you want a lid
lifter, a jar lifter,

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.970
and then a wide-mouth funnel.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.380
And those are really your
three pieces of equipment

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.620
that you really want to have.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.360
You want a canning
rack, but you don't

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.810
have to even have this guy.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.750
If you have a round
cake cooling rack,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.671
like a stainless steel
cake cooling rack,

00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:56.920
that can be your canning rack.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.785
You can even drop a kitchen
towel in the bottom of your pot

00:33:59.785 --> 00:34:02.160
and call that your canning
rack, because it's essentially

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.951
padding the jars at
the bottom and allowing

00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:05.420
some of the heat to circulate.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.002
All right.

00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:07.210
So we hear all that sizzling.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.110
That says to me that
this jam is done.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.479
There's not as much water
coming out at the edges.

00:34:13.479 --> 00:34:15.020
And the bits of
fruit-- like, there's

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.510
not as much distinct
fruit pieces,

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:19.760
which is what you want to see.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.685
I like a fairly chunky jam.

00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:23.310
I don't want it to
be perfectly smooth,

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.135
but you want the fruit
to have broken down.

00:34:25.135 --> 00:34:27.800
And look at how thick it is
now that it's on the spatula.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.659
That's what you want to see.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:29.159
All right.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.530
We're going to
call this guy done.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.651
One little tip is to always
stir your jam for a minute

00:34:34.651 --> 00:34:36.942
or two after you've turned
off the heat-- not a minute.

00:34:36.942 --> 00:34:40.830
You know, 15
seconds, 30 seconds.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.300
Basically, what this does is
it helps let that last steam

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.610
escape, and it tightens
it up just a bit more.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:51.659
And you're just going to get
a slightly better texture.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.310
You can also tell
that it's done.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.060
Here, I'm going to
tilt this a little bit.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.280
Can you see how nice and thick?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.850
And when I pull the
spatula through,

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.960
that that space stays open?

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.010
That's what you're looking for.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.560
So the reason I used a
stainless steel pan today

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.559
and I asked them to find me
one, as opposed to aluminum,

00:35:08.559 --> 00:35:10.100
is when you're making
jam, you really

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.790
want to use a nonreactive metal.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.090
You either want enamel, cast
iron, or stainless steel,

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:17.500
or anodized aluminum.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.280
Because if you use a bare
aluminum pan, or a bare cast

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.964
iron pan, you can
leach a metallic flavor

00:35:23.964 --> 00:35:25.130
into your finished preserve.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.090
So aluminum and cast
iron are reactive metals.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.350
And so they react with acids,
and they release a little bit

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:37.300
of themselves into
whatever you're

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.017
cooking in that pan,
which is great sometimes

00:35:40.017 --> 00:35:41.600
if you're someone
who's iron deficient

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.766
and wants to get a little
extra iron into your diet.

00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:45.250
You can use a cast iron pan.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:49.100
But with preserves, you end
up leaching a metallic flavor

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.710
that doesn't ever go away.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.600
And about once a summer,
I hear from someone

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:58.690
who writes that they have
made 15 pints of salsa

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.720
in a giant aluminum pot.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.410
They cooked it for
a couple of hours,

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.846
and now it tastes like
they're licking aluminum foil.

00:36:05.846 --> 00:36:07.220
And they ask me
what they can do.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.636
And unfortunately,
there's nothing

00:36:08.636 --> 00:36:10.100
you can do in that scenario.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.530
You either have to get
used to the taste of tin,

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.900
or you have to throw
the salsa away.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.760
And it's really heartbreaking
for people who spent a day

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.620
and a half making a batch of
salsa to hear that it cannot be

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.120
eaten.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.680
So you really want to look for
stainless steel or enamel cast

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.750
iron, or anodized aluminum.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.740
I tend to stay
away from nonstick

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.280
when I'm making preserves
simply because I'm

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.150
cooking at a fairly
high temperature.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:40.050
And nonstick doesn't do
well at high temperatures.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.080
It starts to break down.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.470
It's just not good for the pan.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.690
So if you want to maintain
the quality of your nonstick,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.720
cooking it over high
heat for 10 or 15 minutes

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.386
isn't going to be the
best way to do it.

00:36:49.386 --> 00:36:53.940
So I recommend something where
you can cook the heck out

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.570
of it, and nothing's
going to happen.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:56.070
All right.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.790
So we're going to pour
the jam into the jars

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.616
with our wide-mouth funnel.

00:37:01.616 --> 00:37:03.240
Sometimes I do this
blind, looking over

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.592
the top of the pan,
and I'm not going

00:37:05.592 --> 00:37:07.550
to do that today, because
we're recording this,

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:12.430
and no one needs to see me pour
jam all over the counter top

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.120
here.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.210
So nice color, right?

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.600
It's kind of a
little bit peachy.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.975
You can see how
pretty this would

00:37:18.975 --> 00:37:22.900
be if you had, like, a pure
yellow plum, too, because it

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.330
would be, like, translucently
yellow and perfect.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.842
But I like it like this, too.

00:37:28.842 --> 00:37:30.030
All right.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.282
So our jars are filled.

00:37:32.282 --> 00:37:36.222
I just like to give
them a little wiggle.

00:37:36.222 --> 00:37:37.680
They could both
probably use, like,

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.820
one more tablespoon
of jam, but I

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.270
want to leave us enough to eat.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.220
So I'm not going to
top them off quite as

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.360
much as I might if I
was doing this at home.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.852
And then I'm going
to grab my lids.

00:37:47.852 --> 00:37:48.810
Actually, that's a lie.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.899
I'm going to grab a
paper towel, and I'm

00:37:50.899 --> 00:37:52.565
going to wipe the
rims just to make sure

00:37:52.565 --> 00:37:53.990
that there's nothing
on there that

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.995
could prevent a good
seal from forming.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.210
All right.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.000
So lid one.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.170
And you always want to place the
lids independent of the rings,

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.760
just so that you
know that you're

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.150
getting the sealing
compound in direct contact

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.160
with the whole of
the rim of the jar.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.320
If you place them
with the rings,

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.210
if you have them
all attached, you're

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.605
just not getting that
perfect placement.

00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:23.080
And I didn't sterilize these.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.340
I didn't even heat them up.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.056
It's really hard to screw a
ring on if it's piping hot.

00:38:27.056 --> 00:38:28.930
And there's really no
reason, because they're

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:32.620
going to be in the pot with
the jars for the 10 minutes.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.530
So it'll be fine.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.430
So again, you just turn it
till it meets resistance.

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.610
You don't have to, like,
go like that with it.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.790
You just want to turn it so
that the oxygen can escape

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.150
and that you can
get a good seal.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.340
And I promise, the
oxygen will leave.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.690
The water won't go in.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:52.190
You can trust me.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.440
It's just not going to happen.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.240
Because the force of the
oxygen is going to be, sort of,

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.590
constantly venting throughout.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.981
So it prevents any
water from leaching in.

00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:00.980
And I am stacking these.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.810
You can stack your jars.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.300
That sort of blows the mind of
some people when they can on

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:05.655
occasion.

00:39:05.655 --> 00:39:07.460
They're like, what,
you can stack the jars?

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.510
You can stack the jars.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.630
No big deal.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.130
All right.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:13.122
So we're going to just
bring this up to a boil,

00:39:13.122 --> 00:39:14.080
boil it for 10 minutes.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.450
And at 10 minutes-- and
so I don't set the timer

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.840
until it hits a
full rolling boil.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.180
Once it's at a
full, rolling boil,

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.720
that's the point at
which we set the timer.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.980
I'm also just going to make
a little public service

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.500
announcement right now.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.160
And no shame if
you've done this.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.560
But this is the end
of the jar lifter

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.290
that you put on the jars,
and this is the handle.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.562
I've often seen people
use them upside down.

00:39:39.562 --> 00:39:41.270
And you don't get
nearly as secure a grip

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.250
if you're trying to grip on the
jar with the handle portion.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.860
Do you guys know
the website Food52?

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.360
Anybody?

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:46.422
A few.

00:39:46.422 --> 00:39:47.600
I'm seeing a few nods.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.860
They have a picture
on their website--

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.234
or at least they
did last summer.

00:39:50.234 --> 00:39:52.790
They were selling
canning tools, and they

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:56.030
were using, in the picture,
the jar lifter the wrong way.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.860
And so what can you do?

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.670
But for you at home,
when you go home and can,

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.110
make sure you do
it so that you're

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.776
going to get the best,
most secure grip.

00:40:05.776 --> 00:40:08.060
Because otherwise you're
going to feel really insecure

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.130
as you lift piping hot jars
in and out of boiling water.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.640
And no one needs that extra
stress in their lives.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.210
So yeah.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.451
Any questions?

00:40:17.451 --> 00:40:17.950
Yes?

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:19.309
AUDIENCE: I noticed you didn't
try to get out the air bubbles.

00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:21.135
Is that not really
an issue for jam?

00:40:21.135 --> 00:40:23.260
MARISA MCCLELLAN: It's
really not an issue for jam.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.260
Anytime you make
jam, it's just kind

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.690
of going to flow into the jars.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:29.340
And if it's a
really thick jam, I

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.630
might run a chopstick around
the inside of the jar.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.680
But most of the time I
only try to really-- I'm

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.970
active about getting
the air bubbles out

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.700
if I'm making, like, pickles or
something that's really thick.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.850
So let's talk about pickles
a little bit, shall we?

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.420
So basic pickles.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.350
The basic ratio for
pickles-- anytime you

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:49.630
want to pickle anything, it
is one part vinegar, one part

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:53.280
water, and one tablespoon
of a finely milled salt

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.230
per cup of vinegar you're using.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.650
And that can be your pickle
brine for everything.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.670
And then with that
ratio, you can

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:05.100
pickle green beans, cucumbers,
okra, broccoli, cauliflower,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.183
Brussels sprouts.

00:41:08.183 --> 00:41:09.516
What else do you want to pickle?

00:41:09.516 --> 00:41:10.190
AUDIENCE: Turnips.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.450
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Turnips.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.990
You could do a
thinly sliced turnip.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:15.122
Some thinly sliced radish.

00:41:15.122 --> 00:41:16.330
AUDIENCE: Watermelon rind.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.010
MARISA MCCLELLAN:
Watermelon rind's

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.509
going to be a little different,
because you add sugar to it,

00:41:19.509 --> 00:41:20.760
but it's basically the same.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.570
You're going to use a little
less water and a little bit

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.955
more sugar, because you want
to create more of a syrup

00:41:24.955 --> 00:41:27.180
and you want it to
be really flavorful.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.460
But yeah, watermelon rind
is a delicious pickle.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.970
I'm writing a new
book right now, too.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.490
This just came out, but
I'm writing a new book

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.270
about naturally
sweetened preserves, too.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.740
So I'm doing a honey-sweetened
watermelon rind

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.950
pickle in that book, which
so far, it is amazingly good.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:45.431
So that's a fun pickle.

00:41:45.431 --> 00:41:45.930
Yeah.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.210
So basically, you take
that same standard ratio,

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.422
you put your spices at
the bottom of the jar.

00:41:50.422 --> 00:41:51.880
So for, like, a
garlic dill pickle,

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.021
a couple of garlic cloves, a
teaspoon or two of dill seed.

00:41:56.021 --> 00:41:58.020
You want to you use dill
seed and not dill weed,

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.500
because the dill seed is going
to hold up better over time.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.370
Dill weed sort of
breaks down, and it

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.510
makes your pickling
brine kind of murky.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.080
And one of the ways where
we tell whether something's

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.480
gone wrong with a
preserve is how it looks.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.700
And so if your brine changes--
if it goes opaque, and changes

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.750
a little bit of color,
that's an indication

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.520
that something might be
going wrong with the jar.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.900
Often, if you've
used dill seed, it's

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.525
just that the dill seed is sort
of dissolving into the vinegar.

00:42:24.525 --> 00:42:26.820
But it gives you sort
of that peace of mind

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.400
knowing that you're not having
something that's going wrong.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.430
So put your spices at
the bottom of the jars,

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.830
pack those vegetables
in pretty tightly,

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.000
and then pour the brine on top.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.220
I don't have a jar anymore, but
when I have a full pickle jar,

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.280
I just tap it on
the counter first

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.969
to help release any
trapped air bubbles.

00:42:45.969 --> 00:42:47.760
And then you go around
with either a wooden

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.640
or a plastic
chopstick, or a really

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.340
kind of long, narrow
silicon or rubber spatula,

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.720
and help release
the air bubbles.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.720
The reason you want to
release those air bubbles

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.774
is that if you trap air bubbles
inside of a canning jar,

00:43:01.774 --> 00:43:03.690
the same thing is going
to happen to those air

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.856
bubbles that are trapped
throughout the product that

00:43:05.856 --> 00:43:09.000
happened to the air that
you leave in the head

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.020
space of the jar, right?

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.602
So as you heat the jars, the
oxygen's going to agitate,

00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:14.060
it's going to try
to leave the jar.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.726
But if you've got
these air bubbles down

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:18.060
inside the jar, what
ends up happening

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.800
is that they push brine
out, or liquid out,

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.020
as they try to escape the jar.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.900
And so if you've
ever canned pickles

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.010
or, like, a thick--
like, a fruit preserve,

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.685
like peach halves, you'll
often have liquid loss.

00:43:29.685 --> 00:43:31.797
It's called
siphoning in canning.

00:43:31.797 --> 00:43:33.630
I don't know why, but
that's what they mean?

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:38.000
Why can't we just call
it liquid loss, really?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.910
Every niche has its
vocabulary, right?

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.584
That's one of the
canning vocabulary words.

00:43:44.584 --> 00:43:46.000
So then you end
up with jars where

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.230
you've lost an inch
or two of liquid.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.017
And it's not bad in
terms of it's not

00:43:50.017 --> 00:43:51.850
going to make you sick,
but the stuff that's

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.970
not submerged in the
brine, or the syrup,

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:58.370
or whatever canning
medium you've put it in,

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.390
it's going to discolor
and lose quality faster.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:05.540
And so by bubbling those jars
you prevent the liquid loss,

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.230
and so you make a
product that's going

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.550
to last longer on the shelf.

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.980
Let's talk a little bit
about what can go bad,

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:13.856
or what can go wrong.

00:44:13.856 --> 00:44:16.105
So with these high-acid
preserves-- and we're boiling,

00:44:16.105 --> 00:44:18.230
so I'm going to set
a timer real quick.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.852
With these high-acid
preserves, you're

00:44:19.852 --> 00:44:21.060
never going to have botulism.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.894
But things can go
wrong on occasion.

00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:24.810
But you're always going
to be able to see them

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.940
or smell them immediately upon
opening the jar.So you're never

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.274
going to accidentally eat
something that is bad,

00:44:30.274 --> 00:44:31.690
because you're
going to look at it

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.080
and go, huh, I don't
want to eat that.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.140
You're going to
open a jar, and it

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.750
will have changed
color dramatically.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.800
Or it will be bubbling, which is
an indication of fermentation.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.250
It'll smell boozy and
not in a good way.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.960
It will smell bad.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.050
Something will be wrong.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:51.383
And you'll look at it and
think, huh, this is not right.

00:44:51.383 --> 00:44:52.469
Let me get rid of this.

00:44:52.469 --> 00:44:53.635
It's not going to be unsafe.

00:44:53.635 --> 00:44:55.480
It's something you can
put in a compost bin

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.220
or down the garbage
disposal or in the trash.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.340
It's not a hazard.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.256
But it's just something
you don't want to eat.

00:45:01.256 --> 00:45:03.920
And so you make sure that you
notice, you pay attention.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.733
You don't ever open a
jar and sort of start

00:45:05.733 --> 00:45:08.310
to eat it without looking
at it for just a minute.

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.160
You know, you might
have a jam emergency

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.790
and be like, I
need jam right now.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.730
Well, just give
that jam a once over

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:17.780
before you start pouring it
into your yogurt or whatever.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.420
So another indication
the jar has gone bad

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.750
is that the seal will go bad.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.860
Because what happens
is if things ferment

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:30.660
or they start to develop some
sort of bacterial or yeast

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.180
infection, or whatever,
that off-gasses.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.480
That process of
that microorganism

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.900
growing off gases,
and that off-gassing

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.940
will pressure up against
the lid and break the seal.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.517
And so that's why,
you know, it's

00:45:44.517 --> 00:45:46.850
like if you ever hear the
warning to not eat bulging tin

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.891
cans from the grocery
store, the same thing goes.

00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:50.570
Because in the
grocery store, there's

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.940
no way for that
can to break open

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.630
unless something truly
disastrous is happening inside.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.720
But for a mason jar,
that off-gassing

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.160
is going to produce enough
force to break the seal.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.940
And so you're going to know,
when you open that jar,

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.273
if the lid comes off too
easily, that it's not something

00:46:05.273 --> 00:46:07.130
you want to eat.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.450
That's really it for that
kind of safety thing.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.770
As far storage goes,
cool, dark place.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.780
Keep it out of sunlight.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.689
I live, again, high-rise.

00:46:17.689 --> 00:46:19.230
I don't have a
basement, I don't have

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.350
any sort of natural, good
place to store preserves.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.690
So I have some under my
couch and some under my bed.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.100
And I have a coat closet
that's sort of double depth.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:33.140
And so you spread the coats, and
its a wall of pickles and jams.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.076
And it works out quite well.

00:46:35.076 --> 00:46:37.392
But because sunlight
is the enemy,

00:46:37.392 --> 00:46:39.350
it's going to start to
discolor your preserves.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:40.808
And as they discolor,
they're going

00:46:40.808 --> 00:46:42.280
to sort of lose
flavor and texture.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:42.589
And so you just want
to keep them out

00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:43.830
of sunlight if possible.

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:47.110
AUDIENCE: Is it
better in the fridge?

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:50.250
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Well, once
you've done the processing,

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.170
it's shelf-stable, so
it doesn't have to be.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.670
Like, if that's your only
good place to store it

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.919
and you don't have anything
else in your refrigerator,

00:46:55.919 --> 00:46:56.740
sure, go for it.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.809
But the nice thing about
making jams and stuff

00:46:59.809 --> 00:47:01.850
like this, for me, is
that-- and that's why I can

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.290
these small batches is that
I have a small refrigerator.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.789
And if I put everything I make
over the course of the summer

00:47:06.789 --> 00:47:08.440
and fall in the
refrigerator, there's

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.640
not room for anything else.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.610
And my husband
doesn't like fruit,

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.140
and he doesn't
really like pickles.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.220
And so, um-- I know.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.700
He has many other
fine qualities.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.927
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:18.927 --> 00:47:21.510
MARISA MCCLELLAN: He finds our
refrigerator a little bit scary

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.400
on a regular basis.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.970
And I'm a food writer.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:26.090
There's a lot of stuff
happening in my kitchen.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:30.260
And so if I had a refrigerator
that was entirely full of jars,

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.520
he would never open it,
and he wouldn't starve,

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.180
but he would not eat at home.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.780
And so we like to
make sure that he

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.100
can use the refrigerator
whenever possible.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:41.990
So that's why.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.650
But yeah, I mean, if that's
your best space for it,

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:44.566
then that's fine, too.

00:47:44.566 --> 00:47:48.950
AUDIENCE: Once you open a
jar, how long is it good?

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:51.180
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Like a
jam with this much sugar--

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.930
I mean, this isn't
tons and tons of sugar,

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.390
but this is a ratio
of about two to one.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.050
This jam is going
to last for months

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.092
open in the refrigerator.

00:47:58.092 --> 00:48:00.175
If you make something
that's really low in sugar--

00:48:00.175 --> 00:48:02.740
because sugar is a preservative,
the less sugar that's

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.052
in a product, the less
time it's going to last.

00:48:05.052 --> 00:48:07.010
And when it goes bad,
it'll either, again, will

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:08.843
start to ferment in the
fridge a little bit,

00:48:08.843 --> 00:48:13.640
like, get a little fizzy,
or it'll start to grow mold.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.040
A month or more.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.865
Almost always.

00:48:15.865 --> 00:48:18.520
And pickles, pickles
last forever.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.280
You know, the thing
to do is to make

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.810
sure you're using sort
of good jar hygiene.

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:24.530
So anytime you go
into a jar of jam,

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.905
or chutney, or pickles, or
whatever, use a clean utensil,

00:48:26.905 --> 00:48:30.200
so that you're not introducing
any sort of potential bacteria

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.902
or foreign funk to the jar,
so that it stays good longer.

00:48:35.902 --> 00:48:36.402
Yeah.

00:48:36.402 --> 00:48:38.354
AUDIENCE: How long
does something

00:48:38.354 --> 00:48:39.402
last once it's jarred?

00:48:39.402 --> 00:48:41.110
MARISA MCCLELLAN: So
the USDA always says

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:43.930
to use your home preserved
food for best quality

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.676
within a calendar year.

00:48:45.676 --> 00:48:47.300
But there's no, like,
alarm bell that's

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.040
going off on day 366 or 367.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.460
It's just that as things
age, they decline in quality.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.260
But I have found that with
a jam like this, three years

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.650
is, like-- by year
three, it's going

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.680
to start to lose its
texture a little bit

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.870
and be a little bit funny.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.740
But I always think of it--
I don't give something away

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.090
that is older than two years.

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:08.650
But within the first
two years, it's still

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.775
going to be delicious, it's
still going to be safe,

00:49:10.775 --> 00:49:12.755
it's going to give
someone a good, long time.

00:49:12.755 --> 00:49:14.380
And that's about what
they use in terms

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.629
of commercial production, too.

00:49:15.629 --> 00:49:18.420
Like if you buy something
at a grocery store

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.180
or at a farmer's
market, about two years

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.600
is how far out they're
putting their best-by date.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.835
Any other questions?

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.330
Do you guys want
to taste some jam?

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:29.880
All right.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.370
Awesome.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:38.390
So I think Chris went in
search of things to put jam on.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:41.855
AUDIENCE: Pretzels and chips.

00:49:41.855 --> 00:49:43.340
MARISA MCCLELLAN: Perfect.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.050
AUDIENCE: They're kind
of unflavored, so.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.664
MARISA MCCLELLAN: That works.

00:49:47.664 --> 00:49:50.000
Awesome.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.460
So thank you guys
for coming today.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.293
This was really fun.

00:49:52.293 --> 00:49:55.046
I hope you had a good time.

00:49:55.046 --> 00:49:56.670
This lovely lady in
the back has books.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.200
And if you want to buy one, I'd
be happy to sign it for you.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.050
I'll personalize it
any way you want,

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:05.080
and I will correct the typos,
because there are a few.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:05.599
And yeah.

00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:06.140
So thank you.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.010
My name's Marisa.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:09.240
My website is
foodinjars.com And I

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.270
hope that you all
make something.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.170
So thanks.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.720
