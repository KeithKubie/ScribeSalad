Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on you. This isn't even a podcast. This is just me poking my head into your cubicle or your office door. You're fucking cardboard box wherever you live in, wherever you work, whatever you're doing. Are you making American great again? We go make it great again. Remember what it was great bad's going to happen again. Making America great again. Um, what's going on? How are you? I'm in a good mood. My, my, my lovely daughter is entered a new phase of just nonstop crying. Ed. Um, I think she's going to be a ric flair fan because the only thing I could do to get her to stop was, you know those exercise balls that uh, the ladies use them. You know, cause they're always trying to work their glutes and their fucking thighs cause that's where they put the weight on. You know, guys are always over there doing sit ups a gate. Yeah. Yeah. Doing that shit. Right. Do it shit from rocky hanging upside down. Well maybe if I hang upside down and fucking do a setup, you know, that'll offset the fucking nine slices of pizza I'm going to have tonight. The pizza wins. Okay. You don't need to hang upside down. You don't even need to do fuck. You don't really even need to do setups, which you need to do is you need to get some salads and you're like,

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       you got to start looking at bad food. Like it's some fucking check that you know is great in the rack. Right. But it, she's just, you can't bring it home to your parents. She's a fucking lunatic. That's, that's what bad food is. And the food version of great in the rack is salt, sugar high. That's all this, right? Just send you shit through the roof. You like, yeah. You know, and you just keep grabbing one fucking handful after another is something in the back of your head in the Becky head is just screaming. No. Like when you're dating a psycho, why am I going to go out to a farmer's market with this fucking lunatic? Why am I pretending that there's a relationship here? Do you have a bag of chicken? She's got a window right behind her bed and halfway through bang, or you like, what am I just opened this and we'll fucking crawl down?

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       Yeah, I'm sure women have thought that. You know what I mean? Blade on that backs getting fucking railed by some sweaty fucking, I don't know, Banker Assistant. And then he's got a skylight. Go. What if I was like Spiderman right now? I could just some fucking webs. It just go right up and out of here. Leave them all confused. Half excited on the bed. That's what they need to have with the future. Everybody. They're trying to have better cameras on your cell. Phone's better recorders. Fucking, I don't know. Something else. Whatever the fuck are. They always have to be three examples. So you fill in your last one. This podcast will be interactive. What did they come up with? Something that when you're with somebody, right, you could just, you just hit a fucking eject button. Look, every house has like a fucking, like even if you're on the bottom floor and you just got to stand in the right place and you remember those old school offices would, they would like send messages around through that little fucking vacuum thing. You know, you put the thing in the tube, just do it. Just disappear and go into somebody else's office. Sort of the original fucking emails. They should have that for people you know

Speaker 2:          00:03:30       and yeah. I'm telling you, I didn't like the way you talked to my sister and just remember we have that data satellite Saturday and you just, yeah, you just

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       go over to the fucking portal and you just gone, hi.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       Hi honey. Stop it. You're scaring me.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       Hello. You still there? She walks over and need just fucking gone. Then it'd be the new thing instead of getting dumped. You got port hold. What's wrong with Maggie Paul? She got porn hold right in the middle. I think she was nagging him. You know how Maggie is? She's very, very particular and she, she, I know. I love her too. I love her too, but she can be hot. She can be. She's a lot. She, she is. And then that's when the other girlfriends go. She gets a lot. She's definitely a lot, you know, and then they fucking clink their little fucking glass at Rosie, whatever it is. Women doing the afternoon, ladies, what do you do in the afternoon? What does that little wind break you take? You know, like you fucking Ernest Hemingway, you know, that's what I want to say. Uh, I got it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       I'm going to say something like that at that writer's thing on Sunday. Just talking about how much I booze now, because I fucking sit in a writer's room anyway, so going through that keeps my, my daughter quiet during this phase that she's going through, which is fucking awesome. Even though she's crying her brains out now. She's like, she's like looking at Shit, you know, she's like taking it in and everything. It's an amazing thing, right? So we got this exercise ball. The thing that the ladies have right now, maybe someone like Bill Clinton who puts on weight like a bitch, right? Um, lemme just big milky fucking thighs. The, uh, is during his first semester, whatever the fuck they call it is first trimester of being president. Remember that Shit when he'd go jogging in those fucking short shorts, um, all I do anyways, uh, you sit on that exercise ball okay. And you bounce up and down. And the only thing that keeps it quiet as if I just, if I don't want, I'm bouncing up and down. If I just keep going,

Speaker 3:          00:05:37       whoo, whoo.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       You know? And as much as it was driving me nuts, as much as I was feeling my old spine compacting, every time we went down, um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       I held out this, this glimmer of hope that maybe she's going to be Rick Flair Fan, ric flair fan. It's not easy to say. So anyways, um, how was your Thursday? You're almost there to get, they give you a paycheck yet that was always the best. You get your paycheck, then you go out for lunch. Right. Do, do you want to get a beer? Which I want, but just have one. We'll just have one. You know, that whole fucking thing. What the fuck is it? You know what it is? Is Quality of life I would say. What is it about life that you just can't, you can 90% of the time you're not doing what you want to be doing.

Speaker 4:          00:06:25       You know?

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       If there was no, I guess if there was no infrastructure or assist society, man, we probably only live for fucking 30 years, but just imagine but 30 years you could do whatever the fuck you want but then no one would have done anything and no one want to taking the time to make a beer factory so then you wouldn't have a bar and then what would you do? You'd just be sitting around trying not to get eaten by animals. All right, so are, there we go. We just figured out why you have to go to work every week but isn't Thursday exciting? I think that's the point I'm trying to make here. Thursday's are exciting because they give you that piece of paper with the numbers on it and then you write your name on the back of it and then you go down to those fucking crooked banker cons. You give them that piece of paper with the numbers on it and then they give you a piece of paper back that added more numbers to the numbers that were previously on that piece of paper. And then you walk around buying shit. Isn't that what you do?

Speaker 4:          00:07:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       I have no fucking idea. That was another thing I liked about that old guy who smoked 12 cigars a day and he lived east 109 he's still going like one of the oldest World War II veterans out there. Um, what I liked about him was he paid cash for everything, paid cash for everything, you know, just completely, you know, I wonder if you just slip through the cracks after awhile you came into this world and you just paid cash for everything and you never went on the Internet.

Speaker 4:          00:07:49       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       somebody is still take a fucking selfie with you. And then that would be it. Everybody, like, who is this guy who is this mysterious guy that's never been on the Internet and pays cash for everything? You know, all the advertising world would be all obsessed. We don't know what kind of toothpaste to use as we can't have that start to fucking spying on him was like a drone and shit. Um, I don't know what's going on here. I just had a bowl of cereal. Maybe that's what it is. I thought it was a healthy bowl. Do you guys like the checks? Family of cereals? I'm big on the checks families. Speaking of which so many cereals have just fucking disappeared. When my wife was pregnant, when she was pregnant. Oh my God. Um, when she was pregnant, um, she was requesting all these fucking cereals, you know, from back in the day. For some reason I'm thinking they'd be the ending of Star Trek right now. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:08:45       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       She wanted alphabets. They don't fucking make those anymore. Some, some how you can go to target, you know, that involves, that involves like, you know, going into a mall. It's one of those anchor stores, you know, which is the goal of anybody with the small business. Someday I'm going to be an anchor store and a fucking mall, then then I'll be happy. Right. And you got to fucking deal with the parking garage and then you like following somebody like a serial killer, is it trying to get back to their fucking car? And then they get in there and they start checked in the text messages and the person behind you starts beeping and it just becomes like, you know what? It just becomes one of those things where you just had to be like, you know what? Fuck this cereal. Fuck alphabets. Fuck booberry count. Chocula Frankenberry sugar corn smacks, honeycomb. Fuck all of these cereals. I don't know where they are anymore. You know what they're like, they're like old music acts that play casinos. You know what I mean? Like loverboy.

Speaker 4:          00:09:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       there's somewhere right now, this weekend, and they're going to sing. Everybody's working for the weekend right there somewhere. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do you want a piece of my heart? Tell me that lead singer didn't kind of look like Dan Marino back in the day. Um, anyways, that's why I like old cereal is like, they're, they're on the casino tour. Did Not grow up my grocery stores as far as serial goes. Food in general. When you're in all the grocery stores, that's you're at the height of your career, right? You're Bruno Mars, you doing the fucking prince thing at the grammys, right? And then somewhere, you know, but you're on the deer, right at the fucking mid level shelf to your headline, headlining, maybe even the top shelf, but right at fucking eyeball level, whatever average hiatus, you're right fucking there. Sandwiched between the CEC cereals of uh, check family of cereals. And then you've got the corn flakes on the other side. You're right there. You're big stupid fucking face. And whenever sugary Horse Shit, you're selling to the public, right? And then somewhere along the line he, it just, you know, you run out of hits, you collaborate with the wrong people, people's palettes change and then you get, you get, you get pushed out, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:11:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       You start going to those places where, you know, you can only get them in certain cities. You are only in target like Michelob.

Speaker 4:          00:11:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       Michelob light, Michelob light. The only place I've been able to buy that was in the city of New Orleans. Once Michelob ultra came along, it just completely fucked over Michelob light. I don't know where it went. So first beer I ever got drunk on. I love that beer. I love me some make a low black and um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       I dunno. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I was just asking the guys you'd like to check cereals. You know, I didn't want to do a whole eighties fucking comedy routine on cereal. Did I? You know, I'll fuck it. Let's keep going. Then he got Wheaties is like the Frank Sinatra, you know, like the rat pack. Like they're never going away. They're timeless. Fucking classics, you know, fly me to the moon. It is fucking shit. That's really not good for you. Fucking Bruce Jenner didn't eat this. That's not why he won the gold medal. In other words, he's a whore. Um, anyways, he got Wheaties. What are the classics? Grape nuts. They're hanging in there. They're on the bottom shelf. Grape nuts. His bottom shelf. You know, they're still there. They're still playing the fucking, you know, the play in the big rooms, but not the Abrams, you know, was another one that's hung around for a long fucking time.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       Brighten up flakes. So the Billy Carter of the fucking grape nut family. All right. I'm done with this fucking shit. Anyways, let's, let's talk about what's really important out there. Nick Depaulo, one of the fucking greatest comics I've ever seen is new special is on right now on Seeso T. I actually at 8:00 PM tonight, you got to fucking watch this thing. You don't have to, but I would really appreciate if you did, it's called inflammatory. It's debuting today, February 16th at 8:00 PM on Seeso TV, s e s o a TV to subscribe to his pod podcast. Just go to connect pal.com/nick all lowercase connect pals, c o n n e c t p a l.com/nick. Um, that's what I'm doing. I don't know what you're doing, but that's what the fuck I'm doing. Um, oh Joey roses also has a special on comedy central, but comedy central is weird cause they don't stream.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       They're not weird. They're old school. You know what I mean? You know what? They're not streaming anymore. So that channel there at target right now and Netflix, Netflix elbowed him out. See sews elbow there that they're the new, the new, uh, though they like the millennials of fucking TV networks and they just cut in all these cons out, you know, and these other guy, right? A kid you had to buy cable, Eh, yard to watch commercials. Um, all right, there's the elephant in the room and I have to address and I know every fucking French content from Montreal with your silly socks. Oh, you're clapping right now, aren't ya? Huh. All right. So as I, you know, not everybody saw it coming. You knew a Clo Julian was going to take the fall for some of the moves that we've made and uh, you know, it, and I was saying the entire fucking time that this guy wanted us our first cup and 40 years, you know, um, why are we blaming this fucking guy?

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       Yada, Yada, Yada. Please don't fucking fire. And what do they do? They fire him. So I tweeted out, congratulations to any NHL team out there that's looking for a great coach that knows how to win a cup. All right. Now having said that, I had no fucking idea. I ain't no fucking idea that the Montreal Canadians, we're going to fire their coach was a Tarion. They fired him all right. And fucking picked him up. And um, as much as I hate to say this is a Bruins fan, we fucking deserve it. You know, I dunno. You know what happens is everybody does it. They, they were doing well with Pat Burns at Pat Burns. Got fucking sick of them. I always thought pat one a copy then 86 and 93 with him. I guess he didn't, he existed in the middle like don Mattingly. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:15:32       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       And um, I dunno, I have no idea, but I think I'm going to say right now, the Canadians are going to win a cup with Cloe. Julian, if before you get excited, you want for your fans. If they will want a cup, if they're dumb ass fans in the media, don't run them out of town first. God knows they love doing that. Fucking dopes have you concept there. You know what I mean? Why don't you get out there and skate around for the little fucking pocket square fucking bitch moaning and complaining. The most arrogant fans on the face of the fucking earth. Without a fucking doubt. Montreal Canadien fans. New York fans are pretty bad, but there's just something about him did dumb. You just hear it. They fucking breathe through their mouths to eat big sandwiches. They walk around in sweatpants that get, you know, a guy like Paul Versey you consider considers dressing up, Eh, uh, putting on a new pair of jeans and some Air Jordans and a sweater. I swear to God, if Paul put that outfit on, he'd be like, I'm ready to meet the president. Okay, that's your average New Yorker. But they've written so many songs blowing that city that people think they're a cut above just cause they, you know, their parents had unprotected sex there. You know all those songs. Yeah. Phi can make it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       Dad Do, will you? Will you make it anywhere? Most New Yorkers can't even live outside of New York. They have a fucking panic attack. The second they get out of the two, one, two, seven, one eight fucking area code, they're horrific. They hold onto it like they move out here to La and they keep wearing this stupid fucking New York badge. You know, like some washed up athletes still wearing his highschool fucking jacket. They just keep, they come out to La and all they do is shit all over. It's like, go back. You're dumb cunt. You know, you're going to go back. You're out here. Why don't you enjoy it? The learn how to surf. Go have a fucking Burrito. Go on a hike. I'll write already with the fucking New York Shit. Oh, the Adh fucking plays where you get the fucking linguine. You're the fucking 78 can fucking if today.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Um, I don't know. Look, I'm fucking, I'm not going to take responsibility for anything that I say in this podcast. Um, first of all because, uh, I'm not an adult and second of all, because, uh, the lack of sleep I've had recently, um, yeah, so the New York fence, this, there's still an element of the, of just, you know, they're morons. They're like Boston fence, Philly fans. We're all mouth breathing fucking morons now. The Canadian fans, okay. The Canadian fans, because they don't live in the United States, they live in Canada. They actually have to take the time to learn about other countries. You know what I mean? Which makes them appear to be more intelligent. But I'll tell you, there's some of the most racist fucking people I ever met in my life. They lose a playoff series. They burned down their fucking city. They ran, Patrick was out of town.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Okay? The fucking Hornets nest that closed. Julian just stepped into, if they can somehow keep those people at bay and this stupid ass media, the fucking media, those Fed Fox, like they're gonna go out there and start skating if they don't run him out of town. I'm telling you right now, if all of you fucking Montreal counts can give, just keep you fucking Yap shut. Okay, go buy yourself another pair of loafers and some silly fucking socks. If he can just shut your fucking mouth and stop acting like, you know how to run a team, this guy could bring your cup. I'd say you got a 50, 50 chance cause they're not gonna be able to, they, you know, they can't sit on their hands. They can't, they speak French. You know, there's something about speaking French. All of a sudden you think you know stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       Unless you're in France, I want to go to France. So those people are cool. You got to Montreal. I don't know what the deal is. Um, so much of that was just absolute misinformation and I really enjoyed all of it. Um, you know what? Congratulations to quote Julian. I'm really happy we went to another original 16. I hate the fucking Canadians, but I'm adult enough to not, uh, to not sit there. I mean, I hope he wins another fucking cup. I don't want the Canadians to do it, but I liked him too much to, to have to fucking root against them. I will only root against him when it's hard because he's with the Canadians. But like, obviously if the Bruins are playing, I'm going to root against them. But, uh, he's just a fucking class act, you know, he said he's going to keep the rivalry going on, but he said something nice about the players and all of that. And uh, we'll see. We'll see. The only thing that can screw this up is the moron, Canadian fans and their media. You know, if you can run Patrick out of town, maybe this ends the curse, the curse of Patrick Walk, who knows? We shall see. But uh, I just became a, when he went to Montreal, I just became a huge penguins and Washington capitol Fan.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       I will be rooting hard, not against cloud. I just don't want to see the fucking, I love that they haven't won one in 20, 24 fucking years. They're going on a quarter of a century for any other franchise that's totally acceptable, but not for them. They have to win a cup. That's all they have. This is what one thing have sympathy. I will say actually I, you know, I love the city Montreal. I'm fucking around with you guys. Beautiful women. And you guys got fucked in 1994 and that would have been so for baseball if the Montreal expos even made it to a world series, forget about winning. I'm winning the whole damn thing. And they had a young Pedro Young Randy Johnson. I mean they were fucking stacked. And um, I love nationally baseball. My whole time growing up, whenever I used to watch this week in baseball, it was always a faster game.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       It was hit and run. They had all the astro turf, which I thought was cool when I was a kid. And uh, you know, I will, you know, I watch the Red Sox, we were all American league. We QC just keep signing one fucking home run, hit her after another, another lefty. I'll tell you if this guy please in Fenway park, he's going to hit 80 home runs. And all he did was just ground into double place. Like the pitcher doesn't know why he was brought to town. They just fucking low and inside high and inside those kinds always loved those pitches. Low. The low ball, they'd fucking, whatever the fuck they would do at sync around my a big baseball guy, they'd always would ground out and then they just work them right up the ladder in that fucking high heat on the inside. They could never lay off.

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       It's g three into the attic. Red sox leaving another six rudders stranded. It's not possible, but that's what it felt like two runners. Right. All right. All right.

North Garden lifetime against the Canadians. I had no idea. He had never won at home. That's fucking weird to me.

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       My baby was the other guy. Can't remember his name was that goaltender. We won the fucking cop. The guy would go to the White House and then took a year off to go find himself. And then I never heard from him again. I think you went to the panthers. Anyways, let's fucking plow ahead here. Shall We? Um, oh Billy, no booze. No cigars is still fucking cruising along. I took my life insurance test and a fucking guy took blood. Jesus Creek, he was, I couldn't find the vein. He fucking hacked up my arm big time. That's going to bruise a little bit. And you know what he was right. But anyways, I kind of liken not smoking cigars. I haven't smoked since last year. I like saying that. So, um, I think I'm gonna go on, go on a little run, you know, no booze, no cigar. I'll tell you a kid. We'll keep your fucking sober,

Speaker 4:          00:32:33       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       instead of looking fondly for that fucking glass of Scotch at night. Now are you thinking about is oh my God, when this kid goes to sleep, when this go kid goes to sleep, I'm going to sleep and I am going to have to log on to treat all fucking not away. That's all I, that's all I care about right now is just getting a little bit of sleep. But uh, but it's been fucking awesome man. I'm already watched and change in watching now. When she looks at stuff, she could really like kind of take it in. And I was still waiting for the first smile. I still think it's, she just has gas. If she's going to the bathroom. Um, he started smiling and he think they're smiling at you and you're like, oh my God, you smelling me? And then you know, you kind of drift out of their line of vision to see if they're still looking at you and then they just continue looking where your head was.

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       It's just like, oh, all right, I guess you're not. Um, so anyways, so if I'd done my contractually obligation obligated 33 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever the fuck I'm supposed to do on this. Um, by the way, still loving my car. I'm loving it more than ever. I had to put my truck in storage. Uh, so what I do is on the weekends I just drive my car over to the storage. I switched them out and um, eventually, eventually my next, uh, my next house, cause the layout of my house. I don't know if this is going to work with one kid or if we decide to have another one. I don't know if it's gonna work out because it's either, we're upstairs in the kids downstairs, we're downstairs and the kids upstairs and it just doesn't fucking work out. So I don't know. Maybe I'll have to move.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       I have no idea. But I will tell you this, the next fucking place that I move, I don't give a fuck about a view I'll, I give a shit about is a fucking driveway that you know is act that isn't built for a model t fucking fort that is built from modern day cars. I would love to have the fucking circle driveway. You know those people like on Dallas [inaudible] mandate a big fucking ranch, you know, they have their own fucking street just driving all the way down there and I'm just have anything, a little carport someplace in my truck that, that is, that's all I don't give. I mean, when I pictured my dream house, I don't even think about the house. All I think about is to driveway, the garage, the garage. I got a gym and I got a fucking a little drum room, you know, and I got a place in my truck and my car and when I come out I don't have to move like 20 fucking cars to get my fucking car on.

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       I don't have to move 20 guys have to move my car, my wife's car. But I feel like a valet, you know, that's all I give a shit about. I don't give a, I don't give a fuck about the rest of the house that the rest of the house is for your wife. They liked that shit. This social. Okay. Men need to get away from shit. If I can have in this fucking garage. All right. If I can just have a little place where I can work out and I got a place where I can play drums and I got my old truck and I got my car. I mean, what the fuck else do I need? You know, right there. I'm good. Like I actually think my dream house is just a garage with a room above it, you know? And the garage has enough room for two cars. A modern in a classic. The back is the gym and then the drum room. And then upstairs is a little fucking kitchen. Flatscreen TV, right. Little fucking humidor and whatever the fuck else you need

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       do. Maybe that's, you know, something. All this whole downsizing in life. That's a fucking great idea. Oh Shit. That fucking divorce guy's house. That's all it is. And you just make an entire fucking street, you know, so they can still make the child support payments. They can still pay their alimony and all they, all these fucking women out there whining about how they know, hey, I don't make as much money. Yeah, you do. You get your check and his check. So many of you do and you're still going to those fucking rallies standing out in the rain, listening to Alicia keys. Yeah. The fuck out of here. Um, what Nia, everything that I've said, you're going to stare at me for that. They need to listen to this idea. Come here. Come here.

Speaker 4:          00:36:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:55       Can we? I have a great idea. She goes, don't be like what an asshole like you. Ooh, what are we at the bus stop? Come here. I'm saying that that insult was on the level of somebody standing at a bus stop. I'll look at the blue QT cakes. What do you say to I love on softer feeding. Huh? You have a daughter now. So what does that mean? You know what that means? Yeah, it means I have to be extra funny cause now I got two of you ladies. I'm paying for her. You funny is this, is this what you consider funny? Move out of the way. I want to put it down. Don't kiss me and try to make it cute. Oh, shut up. Listen to me and sit down. I get an idea to force the divorce guys house.

Speaker 4:          00:37:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       All right. So all it is is it's a two car garage in the back there's a little gym. If you play drums like me, there's a little drum room and above it is just this, just like almost like a loft and that's your kitchen, your flat screen TV, your bed. Just the only thing that you need. Because when I think of our dream house, I don't even think of the house. That's, that's all I want. Is that, do you think that would work if I had a whole street of fucking divorce, divorce guys, they're all paying alimony. All play child support. All you strong women go into court. You go to a woman, I can't afford to do, what am I going to do in the real world and they have to give no idea when anybody goes through and divorce and having to get alimony or any of that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       So yes I do. Cause I've divorced, man. I've talked to divorcement. You talked, have you talked to any divorce women about it or are you just on one side? Yes, I did. Oh, I talked to a lot of them on Rodeo drive, man. The money, the money, I get my check and I get his fucking check to town. Curse in front of the baby. Okay. A man, the money, I'm in the money, I get my check and I get his freaking too. That's better. Huh? You like that? That was take two. You guys just got the extra the outtake. Alright. Um, oh, look it up. Look up cute cheese. All right. Um, I gotta I gotta close this up here. Um, thank you guys for, for listening. I can't say this word for my daughter. You know what I say? You so and so's have a great weekend. I'll talk to you guys. Go F yourself. Go F yourself. Don't take any s from anybody. Um, I'll talk to you guys on Monday and, uh, congratulations to Clode. Julian, forgetting the respect you deserved. You were unemployed for what? Two or three days? Uh, best of luck to you even though you with the Canadians, unless you play in my thoughts. All right, I'll see you

Speaker 8:          00:39:31       foil the Chet cats walking it. Don't vote a drip. The Suva, Chris, we'll start out through the [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          00:40:05       [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          00:40:06       Hey, what's going on? It is

Speaker 10:         00:40:09       edit is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, February 16th, 2009 in the year of the fucking, what is it? What is it the year of in China? What animal is it? Do you ever, that's one of those dumb conversations you have in a bar when they'll have like a poster of land on the wall. Like what year were you born in? You were born the year of the monkey. I can see that. I can see that. No, totally. I can see that. Shut up. You're dumb cunt. Okay. You don't have anything to say. It's okay to just not say anything. You don't have to just start looking at shit on the walls and trying to force a conversation. Why don't you just stare straight ahead and think about how you ended up here. You know how you can change things in the future so you won't have this screaming sound of fucking regret in your head all the time to the point that you're going to need to try to drown it out with some stupid fucking shit about a poster on the wall in this shithole bar.

Speaker 10:         00:41:17       Oh God. That felt good. Um, it's raining out here right now in California. Rainy days and Mondays always get me out. I fucking hated that song. Who Sang that song? That was the carpenters. You know there's a woman to let shit get to her, Huh? Oh, it's raining out. I think I'll go throw up my breakfast. That's your fucking, that was, that was really, really fucking mean. That was really mean. I apologize to the Karen carpenters state for that one. I'm gonna make a donation to a, the bulemia fund. You know what? Someone's going to take that joke really seriously and I'm going to get some more fucking hate mail, which I get on these things quite a bit, sometimes quite a bit. Sometimes you like that I say quite a bit and I'm thinking in my head, no, I really don't quite a bit. It's actually sometimes, so I try to fix the lie, but anyway, someone's going to fucking, uh, not even a lie.

Speaker 10:         00:42:12       It was just like, I was just exaggerating cause you know, it's just what you do. You know what I mean? Like he just exaggerate. You just get used to exaggerating whatever the fuck it is you do. You know what I'm doing right now and doing the exact thing. I just was given that hypothetical woman who was talking about the poster in the bar. I was giving her shit about doing it and then I turned around and I did it, you know, so now someone else has to have a podcast, trash and me and that's how it starts. Did that make sense? I didn't think so. Um, yeah. So if you guys, if you've never been out here to California, at least the southern part of it, uh, people always, you know, they talk about the weather out here, how it's like groundhog day, how you know, every day is the exact same.

Speaker 10:         00:42:54       Only good if he did 70 and beautiful loads, you get sick of it. And I used to be that person, but I kind of am starting to understand the weather out here and it's pretty fucking fascinating. Basically what happens is at the beginning of the year, usually I guess this time of year, around January, February, it rains almost every day for a month. Almost every fucking day it rains. And what it does is obviously it builds up. Oh Jesus. I've really talked myself into a corner here. I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but it's not going to stop me from plowing through this. I was like, it builds up the shrubs and green things. Like I didn't even know what fucking word to use there. Just basically a Hollywood hills, you know, they usually like, you know, Brown and that type of shit because we live in a desert. But, uh, after a month of this stuff, everything becomes really green and really beautiful and uh, you know, then it stops raining and then it's 70 degrees out and everything's green and it's fucking gorgeous out here.

Speaker 10:         00:43:54       But what happens is over the, over the course of the year, because we live in a desert, uh, all that Green Shit starts to turn Brown and it starts drying out. And then when the Santa Ana winds come across, it drives the shit out of it. And then that's around fall. And that's when we have fires out here. And the funny thing is, is the fires are completely natural. People out of here for some reason, they act like they're fucked up. Like, oh my God, the fire. I just jumped over the flow of Holy Shit, let's get to have, and we sit there and we try to put the fire out, which we shouldn't be doing. Nature is taken it's fucking course. It's burning out all that green shit. And what the firemen dude is, they put the fucking fires out and they leave a bunch of brown shit.

Speaker 10:         00:44:46       You know, that should have burned up but now isn't. And then next year the fire's going to be even worse than, it's just the typical shit. Like we think it's a tragedy because nature is doing what it naturally does. And it's not nature's fault. Some fucking idiot built a house in the middle of Shit that turns brown every year and catches on fire. You know what I mean? Would you know, would you sit in a fireplace? Would you build a house in a giant fireplace? I wouldn't do that. So what I'm trying to say is the fucking living in the hills is overrated. Do you want to live down here in the flat lands while the apartment buildings and well, one palm tree catches on fire. I mean the amount of people jogging by with water bottles can put that shit up with those fucking people who live up in the hills.

Speaker 10:         00:45:35       The crazy, not to mention all the fucking desal dries out because there's so little water, right? Because we live in a desert, the soil dries out to like literally like the top six inches is like fucking bone dry. So then when it rains like this, that's what causes your mud slide because evidently it can't absorb it. It's like Dandruff and it just washes down and it goes into the side of the guy's house. And I watch it on the news and I laugh. Um, what the fuck? What the fuck am I talking about? Why do I read some stories? I've got, you know, some, I gotta tell you something. I got some great questions this week. I got some great stories and some great underrated overrated. I really feel like my 14 listeners, which I think is actually up to 22. I don't know what the fuck it is.

Speaker 10:         00:46:24       I just like say in 14 you guys are really upping your game here. And um, Oh, before we get into the stories, everyone who submitted me who made the finals for that DVD competition, could you please resend me your addresses? Half of you haven't. Two of you sent me your addresses and I lost the emails because I'm a fucking moron. But um, I don't want to get, I don't want to get charged with some sort of a, I don't want to be on like the news, you know, those investigative reporting things. You had a podcast. It was only doing okay, so they decided to give away some DVDs, but the DVDs never came. Um, I wanna I want to send them out. So for the love of God. All right, Bill, why don't you shut the fuck up and read the story? Okay. Here's a great story for you.

Speaker 10:         00:47:07       Um, you know, I do my whole little rants about the, uh, the automated checkout lines in, uh, in grocery stores. And how [inaudible] they're bullshit. I don't think it's technological advancement. It's technical, technological advancement will be if I just walked up and somehow I just stood there and magically this machine knew what fuck I owed and then I paid and then I left. That would be an advancement. But to come up with an automated machine where now I go up, there is no cashier and then I become the cashier to me is not technological advancements. That's me working at the grocery store for free. So one of my disciples who actually believed in this said, hey bill, here's something that happened to you yesterday. You might appreciate. He said, I was in a stop and shop yesterday. So I'm guessing that's east coast right though. Let's go to the stop and shop, get a fucking 30 pack.

Speaker 10:         00:48:02       This throws dude, I was in stop and shop yesterday and just grabbing a couple of things. There was one lane open and the four empty self check, uh, registers. So basically one lane's open with the cashier and then there's four of those automated things that are wide open. And, uh, so he says [inaudible] remembering the point you made in the podcast a few weeks ago about the whole self check concept. I got back into the open line, um, behind five or six people, I guess that's the cashier line. The girl who stays by the self check lanes came over and said she noticed that only had a few things and that I could you just use the self checker and be out of there quicker. I just said, no, that's okay. I'm not going to do your people's job for you. After she heard that, she was like, excuse me. So it was like nothing.

Speaker 10:         00:48:54       I have no problem waiting. I'm just not doing your job for you. So she walks away and about a minute or two later a manager comes over to me and ask if there's a problem. So I keep my composure at this point and tell him there's no problem. Then I just rather wait online than ring up my own stuff. He then goes on to tell me that his employee told him that I was being rude and disrespectful and that he was going to ask me to leave the store. I said to him, are you serious? I didn't even raise my voice. I just told her I'd rather wait in line and that the other people online standing next to me can vouch for me. Of course when he asked the other people what happened, nobody said a Goddamn word to defend me because I was apparently in aligned with a group of Helen Keller's typical spineless fucking pussies.

Speaker 10:         00:49:41       Right. So this is his final point. He says, I understand that the girl was just trying to help me out by suggesting that I, I use that line to get out of the store quicker. But when I calmly told her that I was fine, she didn't have to make up some bullshit story to spite me. When the day comes, when cashiers are phased out and all there is is self check registers and that content is out of a job, I will have a nice chuckle to myself. You know something Mike, I can't get mad a on that one. I actually got annoyed by that girl and if she lost a job, but you know, I don't know. I think you're right on that one. Although I got to admit, you know, you, you know to use the narrows line in Goodfellas, you a yeah, you insulted a little bit, a little bit.

Speaker 10:         00:50:32       He kind of insulted her. You've got to go nicer next time and just say, listen. You know what I mean? I don't want you to lose your job. Those two of those machines, I'd taken your job and I don't want to be a part of that. So I'd rather stand in line here so you guys can keep making a paycheck if you set it that way. But you kind of went a little bit, a little bit when a little hostile and you will like, yeah, I'm not doing your job for you. You know? I mean, I don't know. Did you have, you know, so go fuck yourself tone. I have no idea. But you know something. I totally back you when you think that, you know. Well I would, I would have been living in that situation. I wouldn't have been able to control myself when that manager came over, I would've been like, I didn't say anything and I would swim in like, you know, these machines are bullshit. At that point I would occur. So they'd be like, I'm sorry, so you need to, you need to leave the store. So, um, I don't know that make any sense. It's like, I agree with you and I scolded you. I agree with you. When she doesn't have a job, I'll be fucking happy too. And you know, I dunno.

Speaker 10:         00:51:36       I don't know what the, well that's, that's, that's a, that's a rough one. That is rough one. I'm just fucking out of it today. I had a real fucking bad time last night of comedy clubs. I, two different people coming up to me saying shit like, uh, you know, I'm not even going to fucking say it. It's just one of those things where another comic comes up to you and as they compliment you on a joke, you know that they're going to steal it. You know, they do that shit, you know, you know, I really liked that joke you did about the blah blah blah blah blah. You know, it's just amazing. You know when I watch comics, all the different takes people have on things. Now let me guess. Your take is the same as my take, except you switched to words. You fucking Cock sucker.

Speaker 10:         00:52:19       I'm all right. Next story. Hey Bow. Uh, thanks for driving that faggy hybrid. He says always nice to read on a fucking Monday. Hey Bill, thanks for driving that faggy hybrid every bit you guys save ensures that that ensures just that much more for me to use in my muscle car. Was wondering if you've got something that looks like a car or did you get the one shaped like a butt plug? All kidding aside. I dig you stand up podcast, all that shit. Awesome. Um, no hybrid. Looks like a buck plug. I [inaudible] I didn't know what a buck plug looks like. I imagined it looks like something that you stick in the sink. And then when a butt plug looks like, I'm like, oh, he's calling me a fag. But he knows what a butt plug looks like. You know something? I'm going to chime in early on.

Speaker 10:         00:53:10       The underrated overrated. You know what's overrated? Muscle cars. Muscle cars are so fucking overrated. It's ridiculous. If you've seen those things, those auctions, they have these fucking baby boomer Geek fucking rich douche bags are spending like 150 grand to get a 68 Mustang. The fuck is wrong with you. Fucking idiots probably can't even change the oil. They want to go in there and get the, you know, the body off restoration playing 150 fucking thousand dollars for a Mustang, the Mustang. You know what I mean? If fucking idiot, you could literally go buy a piece of Shit Mustang, you know, not piece of shit, but it's got a decent body and just throw new fucking engine in it. Why would you spend 150 grand? What is that? It's got the original well roll the window down handles. You know, in 1968 these were actually shut up. It's not worth 150 grand.

Speaker 10:         00:54:06       Those cars are so fucking grossly overpriced. Those are overpriced. Those vintage guitars. I don't, there's any musicians, those fucking beat up fucking fenders and Les Pauls from 40 50 years ago that I, you know, can't play. You can't fucking play. There's no reason. There's no guitar that's worth 50 fucking thousand dollars. And they got the shit kicked out of them. They're all worn out. They look like shit. I don't understand it. So we bought the point the other day. Well let's Stevie Ray Vaughn, he used to play an old guitar. He got an a pawn shop. He probably paid fucking 30 bucks for it can tell you right. Not that thing was 50 grand. He would've been playing a Ukulele on the Texas flood album. Um, but anyways, I, why did people think they are so manly? If they have a muscle car, I don't fucking understand it.

Speaker 10:         00:54:55       It's like you can get one for 15 grand. Sounded like I couldn't afford to buy one. I just fucking idiot. And it just automatically makes you gay. I gotta admit it's a little tires, this little tires or make it faggy and you know what? The guys, right? They are faggy they all saggy. Look, I don't know if they look like blood plugs, you know? Sorry. You know what? At the risk of having the FBI come to my door to find out what I'm doing, I'm actually going to go on the Internet right now and I'm going to fucking Google images but plugs, you know what I picture I picture like I literally picture like a little plug in and it has like the threads. Like you'd literally screw it in and then it's got that little metal ring. He just, because he does sort of pull it out. All right is, but with two butt plug, I'm going to have to fucking burn this fucking iPod after I do this images. All right bud. Plug search images for a buck plug. Here we go. Jesus Christ. That looks like a fucking grenade. Customed buck. There's a Paris Hilton but plug and it's, it's shaped like a hand. Oh my God. He's a horrific Fox tail buck plug.

Speaker 10:         00:56:18       Cause a family circus with a butler. Wow. These are creepy sex toys. A creepy. Okay. These are gross. Um, in to save you guys. Well, I can't explain what they look like. I guess they look like they look like Christmas trees with the stand. That's the only way I can describe it. It's the same shape. That's grubs. That's fucking gross seed. See what to see the level. You just fucking brought this podcast down too. That was really disgusting. Um, anyways, we know something. The audio of this will save me if the FBI comes. I'm like p towns and I was just the one research. Um, all right, next one. Hey Bill, I saw you on, uh, on comedy central and December and I'd been listening to you ever since. I know how strongly you feel about people. What the fuck is this using the self checkout, which I agree with and I was wondering how you feel about people paying bills online.

Speaker 10:         00:57:22       This is a great question. How do you, what do you feel about people paying bills online? Um, I'll tell you what I feel. I think you're out of your fucking mind. If you pay your bills online. Um, I know it's easier and it's more convenient, but uh, you know that bullshit where they sit there and they try to say like, this is a completely secure site. You don't have to worry, but that this fucking nerds out there breaking into the fucking computer at the Pentagon, you sh he should never pay your bills online. He shouldn't buy anything online. You shouldn't do any of that. You're rolling the dice. Cause I'm not gonna lie to you. I do it. I do it. But every time it's fucking stupid. I, I, I won't pay my bills online. I certainly won't do that. Online banking, you're going to put your fucking, your be a balance.

Speaker 10:         00:58:12       You fucking, uh, account number, all of that shit. You're going to put that online yet you're outta your writing, your mind, you out of your mind. But this guy is basically saying, ah, I'm probably beating a dead horse, but the less mail that needs to be delivered, the less carriers they need. My brother is a mail carrier and it fucking pisses me off that people don't want to pay 42 cents to mail a letter. I mean, come on, I'm a tight ass myself, but you can't, you can't buy shit with 42 cents. What do you think? Um, I dunno man, email, email people back and forth. I mean, there is an element of technology to it, but I will tell you this, like, I will forever pay bills by you using, uh, the male. I'm a male man. I just, I dunno. It just seems, I mean, not saying that people can't fuck with you mail, but I dunno.

Speaker 10:         00:59:04       I think you're out of your fucking mind if at the very least, if you do your banking online, you're out of your fucking mind. Unless you don't have shit anyways, so you don't have any money. Who gives a fuck? Right. That's one of the great things about being broke. You know, when you want to punch someone in the face, she can, you don't have to worry about getting sued by, I guess you've gotta worry going to jail and you can't afford a good lawyer. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Um, anyways, let's talk about shit I have coming up. Um, I'm going to be at a wiseguy comedy club, uh, this weekend in Ogden, Utah. And this is my, uh, the first time I've ever been out. I did a college, there are a number of years ago. Uh, but I can't remember the last time I was out when the fuck was I on Utah.

Speaker 10:         00:59:47       I don't remember. But anyways, it's, the show was on a February 20th. And the website is www.wiseguyscomedy.com. If you're on my website, you can click on the link. It's right to the left hand side of the page and clicked on Ogden. Uh, I'm going to be there for one night, one night, only two shows. And uh, and that's it. Wait a second. What the fuck are they saying here on the website? Oh, they got it right. They got it right. So there you go. So if you saw many comedy central wrote a whole new fucking hour and a, yeah. So while you Mormons, whatever the hell you guys are out there, you Byu fans, come on out to the show and I'll make you fucking laugh. And then I'll go back to my hotel room and stare out the window wondering what happened. It's actually a scary place to land, if I remember correctly.

Speaker 10:         01:00:40       Salt Lake City is surrounded by mountains, so they kind of have to fly over them. And then at the last second do like a military landing, just dropped like 10,000 feet, I believe. Um, Alrighty. Here we go. Let's get into the podcast. Questions for the week, for the week. All Right, Bill, question number one. Uh, every now and then, every now and again on shows like access Hollywood entertainment tonight or x or extra, they let the everyday working class person know how much television and movie stars make. Every time I hear the ungodly amounts, I'm disgusted as well. I should be. Alrighty. Fully understanding the gluttony involving the government and the banks. Uh, what about these repulsive repulsively overpaid stars? Um, I don't, why are you comparing celebrities to a banks that stole from everybody's 401k? You know, what's the worst to star can do? Put out a movie high bid.

Speaker 10:         01:01:42       Say It's good and you're out 10 bucks. You know what I mean? And they usually, most of them fall off after three years. And, um, I dunno, I don't think they're grossly overpaid. I think they are overpaid because the actors underneath them don't make as much as they used to. And the main person, I guess gets most of the money. But, you know, look, you fucking make a movie and you have me star in it, or you have Tom Cruise star in it. You know what I mean? You can't say, Tom Cruise isn't worth the fucking money. You put Tom Cruise in it. It's guaranteed the fucking things going to make $100 million. Basically. He's been doing that for 25 years. I don't think that that guy's overpaid. So, uh, and I, I don't, I don't agree with that. I don't think that you could, you know, government stealing money and bank stealing money.

Speaker 10:         01:02:28       You can say that. Celebrities, uh, I dunno. I don't think that's the same thing. Not to mention celebrities have no privacy. What's so fucking ever and uh, I think they get paid right about what they deserve because when you get to that level of fame, you need a huge house with a wall around it. You need your own movie theater, you need your own tennis courts cause you can't fucking go anywhere. You know, because eventually you're going to have to pick your nose and it's going to be on the cover of a magazine. So you need, you know, 200 foot shrubs so you can comfortably get the underwear out of your ass and do what fucking human beings do. Does that make any sense? All right bill. I watched a lot of standup comedy. I critique it to death. I analyzed the joke delivery, wording, timing, everything does the size.

Speaker 10:         01:03:17       What could've been done differently to make it funnier when I watched you perform a, everything you do and say seems to be spot on and it went perfectly planned. I was wondering, when you watch your own specials, do you find parts that you are unhappy with or feel you could have done much better or differently? Yeah, the whole fucking thing. I won't when I, when I go to edit it, I watch it one time I watched it one time with one eye closed and, uh, and then I never watch it again. I'm going to be one of those people, like if I ever get my own TV show, I will never watch one episode of it.

Speaker 10:         01:03:55       Yeah. It's not a fucking natural thing to see the back of your head or see what the side of your face looks like or to hear what your voice sounds like. Oh. To watch you hold in a glass. It's not natural to be outside of yourself watching yourself. It's just fucking, you know, you're having, it's like this outer body experience. It's just, it's fucking weird. And uh, I dunno if you're comfortable doing it. I don't, I think that's, I don't know more power to you, but I can't fucking do it. So yeah, I always think of, I think about stuff all the time. Well, my, uh, you know, certain times my Hbo Special Man, I, I, that one was a number one wasn't too hard to watch because that one went great. Why do I do this? Wasn't too hard to watch, but those, I only watched him one time, but like a, a bunch of shit earlier on earlier on in my career.

Speaker 10:         01:04:47       You know what it is, it's when it's on TV, that's when it freaks me out. Like if I fill my sense self last night, you know, at the comedy store or whatever, I could go home and I could watch it and I wouldn't have a problem watching it and I could actually enjoy it. But the second I know it's going to be on TV and a as a fucking cell phone, my girlfriend's cellphone, California dreaming Hump Gaze us fly. Hey, it's your phone. Um, anyway, um, what was I gonna say? Yeah, so, but the second I know it's going to be on TV, that's when it freaks me out. And then I'm like, oh my God, you know, anywhere from fucking a thousand people to fucking whatever. How many people fucking watch comedy central, however many of that is, are going to see this shit. And then everything I do, any little screw up that I do becomes, you know, 900 feet tall and I freaked the fuck out and probably comes down to the fact that I don't like myself.

Speaker 10:         01:05:49       Aw, that's sad though. Why don't you like yourself? Um, I don't know. Working on it. All right, Bill, what would you attempt it? This is the person that asked me a bunch of new agey questions. What would you attempt to do if you knew you would not fail? Uh, jump off a tall building. You know, I guess I would've failed by jumping up, jumping off a building and living, you know, I just want to feel that that adrenaline adrenaline rush feels like, cause you're like, ah, kids, you're going down. I do something like that. Um, I know that person wanted something a lot deeper than that. Let me see here. What would you, what would you attempt to do if you knew you wouldn't fail? Uh, what would I do? Ah, Jesus Christ. I'd probably try to do some Gandy Shit, you know, if I wouldn't get assassinated, I wish I had that kind of charisma.

Speaker 10:         01:06:43       If I could lead a Gandy revolt against these fucking automated cashier machines, you know, I shoot small, you know what I mean? Gandhi. You know, what did he get? He got England to fucking leave India. What things does he get? He gets shot in the back of the fucking head. Or at least Ben Kingsley did. I never, I don't know much about the real Gundy. Actually. You know what's funny when I pictured Gandhi, a picture Ben Kingsley as Gandy. Um, number two, Bill, you had two identities. If you had two identities, one is yourself and one is an animal. What kind of animal would you be? You know, something. I feel like I'm in a really bad date right now. Uh, what kind of animal would I be? Something that could run the fuck away really fast from these questions? Um, if I could be one animal, I think it'd be a bird. Cause I've always thought how to fly.

Speaker 10:         01:07:36       What kind of animal would I be? Uh, something poisonous so I can fucking bite you on your ankle. No, that's mean, I don't know. What's my favorite animal? I like bears. So stupid. Question number three, Bill, what is one of the most valuable lessons you have learned so far to proofread the questions? Know what does the mall, I'm really trashing this person. He's a good question. You know what? Don't don't. Don't be if you, if you're the person who wrote this, you listen to me right now. Don't feel bad that you wrote these. Okay, this has nothing to do with you. This has to do with me, and all of a sudden you're tapping into an emotional level in me that I'm not comfortable exposing. All right? This is feeling like I have to relax and open up and it's just really fucking creeping me out.

Speaker 10:         01:08:21       All right, let me fucking white knock on my way through this last one. Bill, what is one of the most valuable lessons you have learned so far? Whether you learned it, watching someone else go through the situation or you expected at yourself, experienced it yourself. Uh Oh, uh, yeah. I would say that life doesn't have to be hard, that you don't have to be miserable and that you don't have to be surrounded by a bunch of cons and that a, if that's how you grew up, you know, without even realizing it, you go out into the world and you surround yourself with those same kinds of people just because you're used to it. And then maybe one day you get to, what I figured out about a year ago, it was like, hey, you know, I really don't have to hang out with a bunch of assholes. You know?

Speaker 10:         01:09:11       I think that's why so many marriages don't work out. It's because you just want to get away from your family and then you go out and you end up marrying the exact same kind of, uh, fuck. I was just having this conversation last night over a couple of bears. You know, whatever misery you grew up with, if you're not careful, you go out and you marry it. You know, expecting change. Don't, don't, uh, I guess that's what I, I've, I've, uh, I can't even say I learned it. I noticed it. I noticed that. I was like, Hey, look at that shit over there. All right, good. That's, you guys really want to freak me out. Ask me some new agey questions and that'll be a new section of the podcast. We get to watch me squirm and be fucking uncomfortable. Probably up to right now. 29 minutes.

Speaker 10:         01:09:57       All right. I'm gonna try to keep these a little bit shorter here. All right. Hey, bill, have you ever gotten revenge on a person, on an object or an object, like a printer in office space? That movie? Um, I gotta admit I'm not a big revenge person. Uh, I don't feel comfortable with it. I always like that goes to a really dark, dark place that's like a, you holding the hand of the devil when you, when you do some shit like that. Like I walk away, if someone really fucks me over, I just let them learn. I walk away like, I've never, uh, you know, you know, if I ever dated a girl and she fucked me over something, I just always, I just said, fuck it. I walked away. It's just not worth it. It's not worth it. I'm not doing it. And I know me is not only, you know, have I just gotten fucked over and now I'm going to seek revenge and his odds are that I'm going to get caught seeking revenge.

Speaker 10:         01:10:56       And that's the worst because that's like one time I had like I want to, first time I lived out here in La, I came back from being on the road for two weeks and there was a, there was, uh, a note on my door saying that, that they needed to check my smoke alarms and that they will, they needed to check them by this certain date. And by the time I got off the road, the date was literally like a week earlier, right? So evidently they had the legal right to go into my apartment because if there was a, if my smoke detectors, you know, our faulty, a fire, my apartment affects the other units. That was their reasoning. So I walked in there and I could just immediately tell that someone who had been in my apartment. And, uh, there's one of these deals back in the day when I really did the road for a long time.

Speaker 10:         01:11:45       Like when I came back, you know, from the, I've been on the road so long, like all the water and basically evaporated out of my toilet, you know what I mean? Those was like half an inch of water, like that type of shit. Right. And I was sitting there and I sat down, I was like, fucking eat. I don't know what it was. Some sort of a say ESP, I don't want the fucking proper term is, but I could just feel it. I was like, something's not right. And I got up and I looked through my apartment and I was mentioned missing a camera. I was missing a watch and the person had picked through my CD collections. Evidently they will a rap fan, cause that's all they took. And uh, you know, nickel and dime shit. So I went downstairs to the management and I was like, you know, I come back from being on the road.

Speaker 10:         01:12:34       You say you're going to check my smoke detectors and I walk in there, I'm just gonna Watch Mrs CD's. I missed some cameras. The place is still locked from the inside. And the guy immediately just snapped on me, says, look, I don't appreciate you calling the were accused and Booboo, booboo, booboo. And I'm like, I didn't accuse anybody. I didn't accuse anybody. I don't appreciate you standing here getting upset with me. Like on this guy. Just, he totally tried to grill his way through the shit and at one point he's just like, whatever. He's like, I have the power, I have the power. He literally said that and I wanted to reach across and just rip this guy's fucking throat out. So my girlfriend at the time goes, you know who the guy is? I'm like, yeah. She goes, you know where his car is? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:13:16       She goes, you should go down and fuck up his car. And I really thought about doing it, but I was like, all right, you just went down to the guy's office. You just had a really heated argument with that fucking guy. There was people there witnessed it. You know what I mean? There's camera's in the garage. If I do it, I know I'm going to get fucking caught. So, uh, actually I did get revenge. What am I talking about? I know what I did instead I stood outside the office and uh, what did I do that's no, no, no. I think it was still part of the arguments. Someone came walking in and they were getting ready to rent a apartment in the building and I told him the story. I go and I came back off the road and there's stuff missing and I'm talking to this guy and this guy is yelling at me.

Speaker 10:         01:14:04       I'm telling you the elevators to slow. And the two people like thanks a lot. And they walked out. And then I looked at the guy and I said, let me tell you something. I'm a comedian. I don't work days. I will sit out here every single day in a lawn here and I'll tell every person who comes walking in there and I saw the guy getting nervous and I knew I was completely full of shit because I had to go on and on the road again the next day. And uh, so yeah, I never seek revenge and it still bugs me and I tried to lie to myself going, you know what? He'll get his, that guy will get his, and you know what I've realized, uh, those guys don't get this. They continue to rob and steal, but I don't know, maybe they miserable. Do you guys believe in that shit?

Speaker 10:         01:14:43       Do you think that they, you know, rent vengeances mindset of the Lord, you believe in that shit? I kind of believe in it and then I'll let them sometimes I think, well, it didn't just some rich people, right? The Bible. So I would feel comfortable being poor. Yeah. And we fuck you over. Don't take vengeance on us. Don't worry. This invisible guy after we'll dead, we're dead. He'll take care of us. That's the one thing why I don't believe in the Bible, cause everyone who preaches it is living this, this, this lifestyle that they would not get into heaven. You know, like look at George Bush. George Bush is a Jesus Freak. The guy's out of his fucking mind. You know, he's out of his fucking mind. Would Jesus, you know, somehow take us to war. I'm not trying to get political here, let's say, and the guy did the right thing or the wrong thing.

Speaker 10:         01:15:30       I don't fucking know. But I'm just saying, you know, if I was truly a Jesus Freak, I would not advocate going to war. And one of the things that scares me about fucking people get into religion is the more religious they get, the more violent and unaccepting they get up. Other people. That is one of the most hackiest things I've ever said because other people have made that point. But it's fucking true. It's true. Like I don't give a shit about gay guys, you know, they can fucking blow each other all day long. What the fuck do I care? Then I'd heard anybody, you know, I don't want to see it, but we have laws against that. Don't blow your boyfriend out in the fucking street, you know, but I think you ought to be able to do it on a Futon, you know, behind some walls.

Speaker 10:         01:16:11       I don't think you're going to hell. I mean, for me it would be a hellacious experience, but you know, all right. Just continue on a bill. You made your point and now you're going to ruin it. All right, plow ahead. All right. Hey Bill. On TV, they sometimes talk about how it costs $11 trillion to have Chris rock come to your house and do 15 minutes of stand up. How much will it cost to have bill Burke come over to a fan's house and perform, stand up for 50 minutes? When a great fucking question, um, it would cost you, I do it for, I do it for 12 bucks, but I would have some riders attached to it that would up the performance price. Okay. First off, um, there has to be some sort of stage. Okay. And it literally could be that brick part that comes out from your fireplace.

Speaker 10:         01:17:03       I'll stand on that. I may be an Ottoman. You know what's an automation? Is the thing you put your clothes in or is that the thing you put your feet on? I'm talking about the thing you put your feet on on one of those things. And also I have to be helicoptered in. Do you have to have a backyard as big enough? It's big enough for me to land in. Okay. And then I'm going to get off the helicopter and I'm going to be wearing a scarf. Silk scarf that you pay for that I will never address during my performance. No one at the party is allowed to make eye contact with me. Everyone will sit around the fucking Automato that thing you put your feet on Indian style and I will do my jokes and I will not look at any of you. I will.

Speaker 10:         01:17:47       I will fucking be staring at the toaster the entire, I want to toast her in the back of the room. I'll do this to 12 bucks. You pay me $12 you helicopter me in, you by the scarf. I will stand on a fucking ornament and I will do, I'll do 25 minutes for 12 bucks. All right, you got the fucking 12 bucks and the money to book the helicopter. I will do it. I'm really talking to myself and do a fucking youtube moment and um, that's it. But no one can make eye contact with me. Just like pope of Greenwich Greenwich Village. And you don't say good night to nobody that when she got to stare at the fucking floor when she walks out, um, you know something that's, that's the tandem. I'm waiting to get back together. Everybody talks about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon back in the day. What about Mickey Work and Eric Roberts? Can they get together again? Nikki work is back. I think it's time for those guys to do another fucking movie before the two Goddamn old. So there you go. There's your, there's your answer. 12 bucks, the helicopter ride. No eye contact, a scarf and a fucking Ottoman. And you've got yourself a comedian, but not for 50 minutes. All right. Give me 24 bucks. I'll do the 50 minutes.

Speaker 10:         01:19:04       Alright, here we go. Um, overrated. Underrated. Okay. Uh, underrated. Um, how awesome. Whoever the first guy was to coin the phrase mustache ride. I have to admit, I've never heard of this, this phrase, how much confidence and creepiness does one have to ooze in order to say something like that to an actual living, breathing woman? Probably happen sometime during this, the 70s, when everyone was sporting a mustache and a leisure suit. Oh, is that what you did back in the day? Actually, I didn't like stick a mustache ride. Eh, I don't know. I've never heard of that one. Um, oh, here's a good one. Uh, underrated. What red wine will do to your erection? True Story. A while back, I had a girl over for dinner at my place. I drank about three glasses of wine I was expecting to make out with her. It was kind of a first date, so I wasn't expecting the opportunity to get laid.

Speaker 10:         01:20:03       So evidently this guy kept drinking. So while the opportunity arose to get laid and I didn't, I was sitting on the edge of my bed pulling my dick like I was trying to get an old lawn mower to start and nothing, you know, embarrassing this to be jerking off in front of a girl while apologize. I think I've been there. Um, I can never look that girl in the eye again. I've heard the term whiskey Dick Button. Never heard a mention of red wine. How come? No one ever told me that that could happen. Um, I think whiskey Dick just sort of was supposed to be all encompassing of alcohol in general. I think whiskey Dick, I guess has a decent ring to it. Beer Dick doesn't sound good wine. Dick. Actually whiskey Dick doesn't sound good either. I've never liked that either. I don't like that. Expression can be some sort of alliteration going on there for beer cock. That's not good. Wine. Willie, Willie, Willie. Why? No, I don't know what it is, but no whiskey. Dick Means all alcohol. But no one ever explained that because I you, you took it literally like, Oh, don't drink whiskey. I won't be able to get an erection, but evidently I can drink fucking red wine all night. Like some fucking divorced, 48 year old woman with two kids. What's wrong with you as a man that you sit there drinking red wine? Was that her idea?

Speaker 10:         01:21:30       Were you wearing a scarf? I bet you where you should have been helicoptered in that the have bottle of red wine. All right. Overrated. How excited people get over getting their tax refund. You know something that's one of the best overrated ever. That's a fucking great one. Uh, someone's like, I'm getting 3000 back from the government, 2000 back from the 16,000 they, they took from me throughout the year. And the kicker is that while I was sitting in my accountant's office, I don't really use government. I realized I don't really use government services. I don't have any kids in school. I live in New York City, so I don't drive on state roads. I'm 27 and I've never needed a cop throughout my whole life. I never called the fire department. I'd never been on welfare. The only thing that governor has done for me in the past year is pick up my garbage and make sure I get more HD channels.

Speaker 10:         01:22:22       I realize I have to pay taxes and ultimately I don't mind doing it, but in hindsight, 13,000 is way too much to pay to have someone take away your garbage. That's more than a thousand bucks a month. I could drive a top of the line Lexus for that type of money. Yeah, and put your garbage in the trunk and take it over to the dump. Exactly. Well know what the funny thing is about people getting their tax refund back. They're all excited and they don't read. They never stopped to think that you gave the government an interest free loan. Like you could have had that three grand plus the money that you owed the government shitting in your bank account or whatever, earning interest and then the end of the year you could just give him the money that you owed him. He should. What does that he claimed zero. Is that what it is?

Speaker 10:         01:23:07       That's what you should do. And then you get some sort of psycho accountant to whittle the fucking charges down and then you pay him. That's how you do it in order is most people, they don't want to deal, you know, and they just kind of look at that dude, it's money in the bank. No, it isn't. It isn't money in the bank. It's money lost. That's what it is. And then what do they do when they get their fucking money back? What do they do? They go out and they take it and they go out and buy a shiny liability that went on. I brought a fucking flat screen dead. That's what I did. And that's great. That's great. He realized the second you hung it on your wall. It's worth 600 bucks now. You dumb fuck. Um, underrated mom and pop hardware stores, emailing classic Bruce Lee Kung Fu movies and good girls.

Speaker 10:         01:23:55       Oh, good girls is so underrated. So underrated. Why do we always pick the horse fellows? Huh? Why? You know why? Because you dick your Dick. It's gift fucking Dick. I don't even explain it. I don't even need to explain it. It just goes back to that dump discovery channel thing. The same way the lions, you know the lionesses is sitting there and when they look at the herd, do they go after the best gazelle? Now they go after the weakest one cause it's the easiest kill. That's what it is. It's fucking wanted is all right. A overrated, um, giant corporate stores. I phones Jackie Chan movies and Valentine's Day, really one day out of the year where the price of roses, teddy bears and chocolates skyrockets because some naked baby wants to fly around, shoot narrows and people's asses. Just surprise your girl on a random day with that shit.

Speaker 10:         01:24:53       She won't expect it and will appreciate a hundred times more than if you did it on Valentine's state. Could not agree with you more. I got to say something. You guys are really up in your fucking game here. You know, great questions, great underrated, overrated, great stories. I mean I didn't have to do shit this week. I just sat here and fucking read it like a fucking local newscaster, which is kind of good cause I think I was kind of off my game today sitting here, my freezing fucking cold apartment. I got this awful heater. You know what I mean? It's the only place where I live in. It's a really cool building, but it's old as fuck. It's like one of those old time Hollywood, you know, back when it said Hollywood land, that's when this thing was built. It was made in the uh, late 1930s. I like living in an old places like that, but you know, sucks the heat them. And I always like think about the conversations, you know what I mean? Like shit that happened. Like, you know, I bet Charlie chaplain came over here and bank some want to be starlet in my shower. Is Little Hitler mustache getting all fucking wet. You know, I'm just picturing Charlie Chaplin still wearing that fucking that hat and making that I'm fucking you real good face. You know when you bite your lower lip.

Speaker 10:         01:26:18       Oh he was probably all nervous too because what happened to fatty Arbuckle? But he still had to do it. You know, cause he didn't pick a good girl. He doesn't, he went over here and fucked the whore. You know? That's what I always want. You ever wonder about? You want to get it all apartments? You just wonder what the fuck happened. You know like this, this place was around like right before World War II. All the conversations that have taken place, all that stuff, the amount of people from different generations bitching about how this heater doesn't work. I don't know. The red scare, Kennedy getting whacked the white flight in Detroit. I don't know why I just brought that up. You know why? Cause the guy fucking shaves my head from Detroit and he lived through all that shit. Detroit is such a sad fucking city. This guy was telling me how back in the day some of the richest people in the world lived in Detroit back when the big three was the big three in the Ford family.

Speaker 10:         01:27:14       They all live there and because they had all this cash, all these great department stores, all these museums in Detroit, look at it. Years later. Eight Mile Eminem, kid rock these angry fucking white kids cause they grew up in a fucking BFI. Been once a Vfi been bill. Well that's the name of the fucking waste management in Massachusetts. A garbage dumpster dumpster. Right. All right. I guess that's it. That's, you know I had rainy Monday energy on this one, but um, what are you gonna do? You can't have a bitch about these fucking things cause they're free. All right? And if you are, go fuck yourself it cheap. Fuck. You know, I've actually had, you know, people criticize my podcast. Dylan wasn't as good as lists. Weeks. Rarely do you feel cheated out of money. You fucking cunt. You know, and Howard, it is the Babel by yourself.

Those kinds of people, people who actually knew like have eaten that day, but they haven't eaten in six hours so they feel like they're starving.
