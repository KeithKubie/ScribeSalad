00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.650
Let's now expand our
knowledge of calculus

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.600
to the third dimension.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.170
So first of all, just what
does a function look like

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.810
in three dimensions?

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.280
And actually we'll go over
the different types.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.640
Because you can have a line in
three dimensions, or kind of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.600
a curve in three dimensions.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.920
You can have a surface.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.310
You could have a vector field.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.540
There are different types of
representations we'll see,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.890
when we start working
with three dimensions.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.330
But I think the most
intuitive-- and none of these

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.920
are directly intuitive-- I
think you have to really be

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.370
able to visualize them.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.950
But the most intuitive, to
me at least, is a surface

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.620
in three dimensions.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.790
And eventually, we can expand
this into n dimensions.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.940
But then it becomes very
hard to visualize.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.160
So we had our traditional
x and y-axis before, but

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.380
now let's give another
dimension of height.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.890
Let's say that this is my
x-axis-- and I'll draw

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.030
the positive quadrant.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.920
That's my x-axis.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.920
That's the y-axis, and
that's the z-axis.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.410
And the convention is to kind
of follow the right hand rule,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.510
where the x-axis-- taking the
cross product of the x-axis

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.970
with the y-axis-- is
equal to the z-axis.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.910
What do I mean by that?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.550
This is x-- those colors really
don't go well together.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.070
This is y.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.230
This is z.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.520
What do I mean by
the cross product?

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.420
So if this is the
unit vector in the x

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.390
direction-- so that's i.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.670
Let's say this is
a length of 1.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.980
This is in the
y-direction, so it's j.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.670
Oops.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.460
j, little cap.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.300
And that cap just means
it's a unit vector.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.660
It's in y-direction, but
it has a magnitude of 1.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.940
And I'll use a
different color for z.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.130
z is up.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.720
And the unit vector
for there is k.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:50.060
And this is just a convention,
that i cross j is equal to k.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.190
And that's just the
convention, you know,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.130
for drawing the x-axis.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.460
Do we make increasing x
pointing out this way?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.470
Or do we make increasing
x point inwards?

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.780
And this gives us
the convention.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.540
So i goes in this direction.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.260
I'm trying to make sure I
can do my hand properly.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.600
So let me draw the
cross product.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.430
So if you take the first
vector, put your index finger

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.920
in the direction of the first
vector, middle finger in the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.510
direction of the second vector,
and your other fingers can

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.730
do what they need to do.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.920
So this is going in
the direction of i.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.640
That is going in the
direction of k.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.430
Sorry, of j, right?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.590
In the y-direction.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.980
And then you have your palm of
your thumb, and then your thumb

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.720
is going to open up
in this direction.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.380
Your thumb is going to
point up, which is

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.780
the direction of k.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.450
So that's just a-- good
to know, where did that

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.320
convention come from?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.140
This is kind of called a
right-handed coordinate system.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.910
But let's get to the
meat and potatoes.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.220
So how do we define a surface
in three dimensions?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.490
Well, we can define z as
a function of x and y.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.830
So let's do that.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.930
And just the notation, z is
equal to a function of x and y.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.110
And all that means is that if
I give you an x-value and a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.170
y-value you get a z-value.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.660
And so, I don't know,
let's pick one.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.370
z is equal to x plus y.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:30.210
So this z is equal to, I don't
know, x squared plus y.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.050
So how do we plot the
points on the surface?

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.820
And I'll show you, actually,
computer generated surfaces

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.330
that are far more professional
looking than anything I

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.353
could possibly try to draw.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:56.770
So let's say, what's f of-- f
of, I don't know, 2 comma 1.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.350
Well, that would mean x is 2,
so it's 2 squared plus 1.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.690
Well, it equals 5.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.630
And if we had to plot that
point of the surface-- and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.660
maybe I'll actually graph this
one in a little bit-- we

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.040
go along the x-axis 2.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.870
So 1, 2.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.070
We go along the y-axis 1.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.910
So if you take this point--
this is x is equal

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.380
to y is equal to 1.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.510
And then we go and then we
say, well, z is equal to 5.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.120
So we can go up here, I don't
know, we'd go up 5 units.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.700
And we would plot that point.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.200
And you would see, if you
kept doing that, you

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.530
would plot a surface.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.680
You'd plot a surface.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.360
And let me clean this
up a little bit.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.550
So the natural question that
you might want to ask--

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.140
and actually, let me
show you a surface.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.550
I'm afraid that when I
manipulate this graph, it'll

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.560
slow down my computer and
I'll start sounding

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.230
like I'm melting.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.880
But I'll take that risk.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.820
Just bear with me.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.850
So here is a surface I use,
using this Java applet grapher.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.600
And it's actually free.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.260
I'll give you the link for it.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.000
But this surface right here,
this is-- I'll actually show

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.680
you the graph of this.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.110
It'll start taking the
partial derivative.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.130
Don't worry about this wall.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.170
We'll get to this in a second.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.770
But this is a
function of x and y.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.320
You can see this is the
x-axis, the y-axis.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.960
The height is the z-axis.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.920
This'll probably really slow
down my computer, but you

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.480
can actually rotate it.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.090
Look at that.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.910
I don't want to slow.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.190
I don't want to slow things
too down while I'm trying

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.580
to do my screen capture.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.270
Anyway, I think you'd
understand, where you pick an

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.680
x-point, you pick a y-point,
and then z-- this surface right

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.800
here, without this line
intersecting it-- this

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.700
surface right here, is
a function of x and y.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.070
So the question is,
well, how do we apply

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.830
calculus to surfaces?

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.640
Because-- actually, let me
bring that thing out again.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.800
Because if you look at this
surface, if you were to pick

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.780
any arbitrary point on this
surface, and say, what is

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.470
the slope of that surface?

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.000
Well, it kind of has no
meaning, because you have to

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.970
kind of pick a direction.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.370
If you said, what is the
slope of the tangent line?

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.230
Any point on this graph
actually has an infinite

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.570
number of tangent lines.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.600
I mean, think of it this way.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.240
Take a bowl or something that
maybe-- you know, like this.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.370
And then take a, I don't
know, a toothpick.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.420
And make that toothpick tangent
to the bowl, and you can see

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.880
that on any point on the
bowl, you can just rotate

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.200
that toothpick around.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.510
So you kind of have to pick the
orientation of that toothpick.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.030
So what we're going to learn is
when you take a derivative in

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.390
three dimensions, you have to
specify the direction that

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.360
you're taking the
derivative in.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.890
And this is why I actually
drew this wall here.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.450
This wall is the equation
y is equal to 0.3.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.545
So you can kind of view it.

00:06:43.545 --> 00:06:47.950
Along this wall, y is
a constant, right?

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.700
So if we assume that y is
constant, then maybe we could

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.160
take just the derivative
with respect to x.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.510
So we would essentially
take the slope of this

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.270
curve right here.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.730
And let's figure
out how to do it.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.110
So first of all, what is the
equation of this surface?

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.980
And I just picked one that
they had on Wikipedia.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.850
But the equation of that
surface is-- and I'm going to

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.896
remove this now, so I don't
sound like I'm melting.

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:13.890
The equation of that surface--
and let me just clear out

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.695
everything, just because we'll
probably need the extra space.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.580
Go back to the pen tool.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:31.910
The equation is z is equal to x
squared plus xy plus y squared.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.980
So we said if we want to take a
derivative, it's hard to-- you

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.930
know, you can't just say
there is one derivative.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.980
We have to pick a direction.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.200
We have to hold everything
else constant and take the

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.300
derivative with respect
to just one variable.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.400
And that is called the
partial derivative.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.920
I know it sounds fancy,
but you'll see.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.050
It's actually no harder than
taking a regular derivative.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.560
You just have to make sure you
remember which variable is a

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.450
variable, and which
one is a constant.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.260
So let's say we wanted
to hold y constant.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.430
And we just say, for any
constant y, how much does z

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.610
change with respect to x?

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.660
Then we take the partial
derivative-- this

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.195
is the notation.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.410
You can view it as a d
with the top curled.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:17.080
The partial derivative
of z with respect to x.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.130
It equals-- all we do is we
take this expression-- we take

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.270
the derivative of x-- and we
just assume that y

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.660
is some constant.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.470
So what's the derivative
of 2x with respect to x?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.460
Well, it's just 2x.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.640
What's the derivative of
xy with respect to x?

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.945
Well, y is just a number.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:33.710
It's just a constant.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.890
Remember, we're taking an
implicit derivative here.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.430
y is just a constant.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.300
So if you have some constant
times x, the derivative of

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.050
that is just the constant.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.240
Plus y.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.490
And then what's the derivative
of y squared with respect to x?

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.410
Well, we're assuming y
squared is a constant.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.580
It's just a number, right?
y is just a number.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.955
So the derivative of just
the number with respect

00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:54.230
to x is just 0.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.470
So the derivative of that is 0.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:03.130
So the partial derivative of z
with respect to x is 2x plus y.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.770
Now, what does that mean?

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.540
Well, that means if I were--
and actually, let me give you

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.460
a little notation, before I
show you what that means.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.610
Another way to write this exact
same thing is if we wrote that

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:20.380
f of xy is equal to the same
thing-- x squared plus xy plus

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.090
y squared-- the partial of f
with respect to x we could

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.640
have written as this.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.210
The partial derivative of f
with respect to x-- and still

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.140
a function of x and y, right?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.950
It still depends on what
constant y you're using--

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.270
is equal to 2x plus y.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.060
Anyway, I thought it's nice
to see that notation.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.100
Now, what does this mean?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.370
Well, what is the slope of z
with respect to x at, say,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:54.080
when x is 1 and-- actually,
let's pick smaller numbers.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.530
When x is equal to, I don't
know, when x is equal to 0.2

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:04.420
and y is equal to,
I don't know, 0.3.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.280
Well, we could use this.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.730
The partial derivative of f,
with respect to x, at the

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:16.330
point 0.2, 0.3 is equal to 2
times x-- that's 0.4--

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.800
plus y-- plus 0.3.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.730
So the slope of this function
with respect to x at the 0.2,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.492
comma 0.3, is equal to 0.7.

00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:30.480
Let's see if we can
visualize that.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.190
So that wall represents the
line y is equal to 0.3.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.700
And we want the slope at equal
at-- x is equal to 0.2.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.320
So this is x is
0.2, right here.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.140
So the rate at which the
height, or the rate at

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.750
which z is changing with
respect to x, is 0.7.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:56.430
So every time x increases
1, z will increase by 0.7.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.850
So the slope is a little
bit less than 1.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.890
I think you see that, right?

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.600
The tangent right here is
increasing with increasing

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.330
values of x, but a little
bit less than 45 degrees.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.120
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.340
See you in the next video.
