00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.400
[TRACE]In the 90s, we heard about the AIDS
epidemic on every local newscast.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.300
We were irrationally afraid of toilet seats,
pay phones, even kissing people; sex became

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300
scary.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.899
And while we don’t see those Public Service
Announcements anymore...

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.720
AIDS hasn’t gone away.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.520
It’s still a global epidemic.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.230
To date, over 39 Million people have died
of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.230
commonly known as AIDS.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.890
Current drug therapies mean it’s now possible
to live a normal life span with HIV, but that’s

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.640
expensive and not a long term solution.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.470
What we really need is an HIV vaccine and
a cure.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.520
So, how close are we?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420
[TRACE] Only one person has ever been cured
of HIV56 - Timothy Ray Brown.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.280
In 2007, he was undergoing cancer treatment
and was cured of the HIV virus.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.300
Researchers still don’t understand exactly
why or how.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.829
[DR MARGOLIS] The things that he went through
to cure his cancer also ended up curing his

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.580
HIV and the treatment was rather dreadful
and had many terrible side affects and had

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.000
an expected fatality rate of around 70%.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.160
[TRACE] After fighting this virus for nearly
40 years, with only one person cured, (which

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.530
was a fluke we don’t completely understand,
and can’t replicate, in which it will probably

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.760
kill you) we’ve still learned a lot.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.950
Once scientists figured out how the virus
worked, they needed to figure out how then,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.170
to eradicate it.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.500
. But that was easier said than done.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.530
You see, the virus’s RNA invades your cells
and changes your DNA.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.870
So the challenge was finding a drug that could
kill HIV, but not your own cells.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.510
By 1996, they were able to make advances in
antiretroviral combination therapy meaning

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.659
that HIV was no longer a death sentence.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.950
Like a gang of defensemen dragging down a
football player, the drugs work together to

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.100
stop HIV in it’s tracks.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.080
After killing millions of men and women, this
cocktail let people live relatively normal

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080
lives.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.689
Doctors could then take the time to look for
a cure.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.349
[DR GREENE] There's certainly an AIDS epidemic
that continues.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.889
In fact, it is pandemic in proportions throughout
the world

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:24.959
[DR THUMBI] HIV/AIDS is probably the most
serious public health crisis we’ve had in

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.760
Sub-Saharan Africa, in Africa, in the world
in fact, since the beginning of time.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.299
In terms of the numbers of people infected
and the scope and the socio-economic impact

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.430
of the problem.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.340
[TRACE] To fix the AIDS epidemic, we need
a vaccine and a cure.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.650
A vaccine to stop the HIV virus from spreading
and a cure for the people who already are

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.650
infected.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.749
[DR THUMBI] The most significant problem that
we face in making a vaccine against HIV is

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.440
the genetic variability.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.299
Viruses that look similar but are not alike,
And so in making a vaccine, we have to make

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.989
a vaccine that would be able to protect against
all the strains of HIV that exist in the body,

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.139
but also that exist throughout the world.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.269
[TRACE] This is why it’s so difficult to
get rid of HIV once it infects your body.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.439
Remember, the virus’s RNA invades your cells
and changes your DNA.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.639
The anti-retroviral stops it, but doesn’t
kill it.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.590
[DR MARGOLIS] In the future, treatments might
get even better or more long-lasting, where

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.909
one could have an injection or an implant
of drugs that lasted for months or even a

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:37.909
year.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.309
[TRACE] There are vaccination trials going
on now with some success.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.709
But if you’ve followed science news, you
might have made this connection already...

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.629
this virus hiding in our DNA, and we’ve
got a new DNA-editing technique CRISPR-cas9.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.849
Why don’t we just use that?

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.249
CRISPR-cas9 uses a protein called cas9 to
cut DNA wherever it’s programmed to.

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.309
It’s part of our own cell's internal immune
systems!

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:04.079
Cas9 could be told to search for a specific
sequence, like a bit of HIV...

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.959
If it finds the virus, the cas9 could cut
the HIV out of the cell, and let the DNA heal

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:10.959
itself.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.430
This can be done today...in the lab.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.750
We can’t yet do it in humans...

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.220
Drugs to control the virus are still the best
way to live a semi-normal life.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:30.470
[DR GREENE] I can’t say how many years for
a cure, i can tell you there are many many

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:40.060
people throughout the world that are working
hard on new cutting edge technologies to find

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.060
a cure.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.850
[DR THUMBI] I don't think we are close, to
be honest, to a cure, but we are making progress,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.440
and it's my firm belief that we should continue
to do research, and hopefully we'll have some

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.210
scientific discoveries in the future that
will lead us to a cure.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.060
[TRACE] Look, we’ve come a long way, but
we’re not there yet.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.660
The research into the fight against AIDS has
taught us so much about how our body functions

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.690
it’s taught us a lot about other diseases
as well, like Hepatitis C or Zika.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.570
And every year there are new breakthroughs
in the fight against HIV.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.260
There are scientists around the world working
on this problem day-in and day-out.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.900
So, how close are we to curing HIV and AIDS?

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.600
A cure could be a while or it could be tomorrow...

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.550
Take a second and subscribe to How Close Are
We to help illuminate humanity’s path to

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.140
other major scientific discoveries.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.920
Did you know gay men are often turned away
at blood drives?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.780
Even during times of severe need!

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.780
Why?

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.780
Find out in this video here.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.380
