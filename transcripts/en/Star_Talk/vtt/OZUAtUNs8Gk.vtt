00:00:01.256 --> 00:00:06.113
(applause)
- Brooklyn in the house.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.503
Welcome, can anybody hear me?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.220
Welcome, did you hear that?
- Yes.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.932
- There you go, Brooklyn in the house.

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:24.370
(applause)
(audience cheers)

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.290
- Thanks for comin' out and
givin's us your Friday night.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.149
This is a special
presentation of StarTalk.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.860
StarTalk at BAM.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.700
And in this presentation you're gonna get

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.850
three versions of what our
StarTalk franchise is all about.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.403
The first one lasting
30 minutes is StarTalk.

00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:45.201
(laughing)

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:49.040
StarTalk flagship, where I'm the host

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.410
and we have special guest
talking about special topics.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.990
We then go to another 30 minutes featuring

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.190
StarTalk All Stars and
that's where we have

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.440
a cadre of counter parts to me,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.040
who are experts in other fields of science

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.200
and they each have their own radio show,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.160
with a comedian similar format,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.290
but they get to do it their way.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.900
StarTalk All Stars, you'll
get a sampling of that

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.850
for 30 minutes and then we will end with

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.590
one of our favorite new
franchises of StarTalk,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.570
StarTalk Playing with Science,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.010
which is all about the science of sports

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.620
and tonight we're gonna talk about

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.300
the physics of figure skating

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.030
and we'll get back to that in a minute.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.280
But right now, we will
begin StarTalk at BAM.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.320
I'll bring out my comedic co-host,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.190
the one, the only, Chuck Nice.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.415
Come on out.
(applause)

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:45.248
(audience cheers)

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.523
- Chuck.
- What's up buddy?

00:01:47.523 --> 00:01:49.511
- Oh man.
- How are you man?

00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:50.660
- This is my man.
- It's good to see ya.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.150
- Very cool, and so tonight,
we're gonna talk about

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.383
the physics of the early universe.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370
And I realized, this
whole event was introduced

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.530
as a radio love fest, but
he didn't say it right.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.579
You gotta save a radio love fest.

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.550
(Neil laughs)
You gotta do that right.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.331
- Yeah, exactly.

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.910
I think you just made
the universe pregnant.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.160
(laughing)

00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:29.425
- Love fest, let me introduce
a colleague and a friend.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.030
One of the smartest people on Earth,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.025
Theoretical Physicist,
Brian Greene, everybody.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:38.275
(applause)

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.930
Brian Greene, best known
for popularizing concepts

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.150
like String Theory and the Multiverse.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.634
- You just made String Theory pregnant.

00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:56.890
(laughing)

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.950
- You're best selling author
of The Elegant Universe.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.993
A beautiful book.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.500
That person read your book.
- One sold.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.703
- Right there, that person read your book.

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:08.780
(laughing)
- I know the rest of you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.903
are just posers.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.060
- [Neil] That was followed
with Fabric of the Cosmos.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.893
A beautiful book.

00:03:15.893 --> 00:03:20.490
Hidden Reality was a third book
and then you are co-founder

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.335
of the World Science Festival.
- That's right.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:24.730
(applause)

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.190
- [Neil] It's a bit audacious to call it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.150
the World Science Festival?

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.500
- Well, we were gonna
call it the universe but,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.150
pulled it back to world.
- It's great.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.550
It's a World Science
Festival, held in New York.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.050
- Also in Australia, so
it is world in that way.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.310
- Co-founded with your wife?
- That's correct.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.883
- Very good.
- Smart man.

00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:47.200
(laughing)

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.033
Very, very smart.
- How to keep

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:49.870
that marriage goin'.
- There you go.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.900
- So Brian, there's recent news

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.320
of the earliest star

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.020
ever formed in the universe.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.290
So were you on top of that story?

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.570
- Been following it, yeah.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.860
- Because what we know as astrophysicists

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.053
is you get the Big Bang, got that.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.730
Then you have the Cosmic
Microwave Background, got that.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.160
But nothin's formed yet.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.660
You gotta make stuff that you
can recognize in modern times

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.170
and there's this long period,

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.370
hundreds of millions of years,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.580
where nothing is happenin'.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.070
And so we call that the Cosmic Dark Ages.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.213
Say it right, Dark Ages.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.770
Let me hear dark.
- Dark.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.603
Ages.
- There you go.

00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:34.604
You give him a B plus?
- I'ma give him a B plus.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.665
- I'll work on it, I'll work at it.

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:37.960
(laughing)

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.920
- The Dark Ages, before
the first stars had formed.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.430
There was the hunt, the eternal hunt.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.563
Can we find that first star?

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.210
Recent news announcement said what?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.010
- Well, there's now evidence
that those first stars

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.070
may have formed about 180 million years

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.310
after the Big Bang and
it's hard to find them

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.560
because they're not
actually sitting out there

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.450
waiting for us to see them directly.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.400
You have to find an indirect
test to see their presence

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.230
by virtue of their impact
on their environment.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.790
And in a very clever experiment,
that's what was done.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.500
- And how'd they do that experiment?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.413
- You mentioned the Cosmic
Microwave Background Radiation.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.145
People know what that is?

00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:20.978
Let's just hear.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.030
- There are some people
at home, listenin',

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.443
that may not know.
(laughing)

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.300
I'm just sayin' for their sake,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.667
maybe you should tell 'em.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.399
- This is heat leftover from the Big Bang.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:42.270
The Big Bang's very hot,
as the universe expands,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.230
it cools down, but the
heat doesn't disappear,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.300
it's still there and indeed,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.630
we can see that heat coming to us

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.910
through powerful satellite
borne telescopes today.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.410
Now that is a fantastic
discovery in its own right,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.310
that won the Nobel Prize,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.520
the discovery of the Microwave
Background Radiation,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.820
but now imagine this.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.120
- It's won the Nobel Prize twice.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.060
- That's true, yes, absolutely.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.920
The initial discovery and then--

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.090
- The flowers.
- I gotta tell ya.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.210
That's very good.
(laughing)

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.780
The same thing, five
years later, oh my god,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.259
we should give it to him again.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.083
(laughing)
- Give it to him again, right.

00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.420
That was a bad ass thing
we found in the universe.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.060
- And it was found by mistake.
- Mistake, yeah.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.330
- So you do know about this.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.180
You said mistake before I did.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.113
- I didn't mean to.
(laughing)

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.170
- How did the Cosmic
Background tell us this?

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.810
- The theory was that when
these initial stars formed,

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.990
they would be very large,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.440
much larger than the sun and very hot

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.460
and they would emit a lot
of ultraviolet radiation.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.470
And that radiation would have had

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.960
an impact on the environment.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.660
A lot of hydrogen around it
would've ionized the hydrogen.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.710
Why does that matter?

00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:02.150
When you cause the hydrogen
to change in that way,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.203
it has an impact on the
microwave background radiation

00:07:05.203 --> 00:07:07.740
that otherwise would've passed through it.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.430
- With no incident.
- With no incident.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.840
- And now it's been perturbed.
- That's right.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.100
Now actually, some of it gets absorbed,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.850
which means when we look out,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.140
there should be missing
parts of the spectrum

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.860
that are being absorbed by this hydrogen,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.532
which itself is being
affected by these early stars.

00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:25.440
- So we're not seeing
the stars themselves,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.420
we're seeing some kind of
smoking gun of the stars?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.590
- Yeah, we're seeing a shadow
of some sense of the stars.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.032
- Oh my god, it's just like
the Russia investigation.

00:07:35.032 --> 00:07:37.282
(laughing)

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.140
- So Chuck, I didn't tell ya.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.840
The reason we have such Big Bang expertise

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.920
is 'cause we have both
independently appeared

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.910
on The Big Bang Theory.
(laughing)

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.860
- That's true actually.
- Actually I was only on once.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.510
Were you on once or--
- Only on once.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.854
- Oh, they didn't invite you back?

00:07:57.854 --> 00:07:58.687
- No, they didn't.
- They didn't invite me back--

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.010
- Invite you either.
(laughing

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.495
- Welcome to my world.
(laughing)

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:05.935
- I thought you did really well.

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:06.768
- I thought you did really well.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.090
- I'm so not an actor
and I depend on people

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.310
allowing a little latitude for that cameo,

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.683
non actor delivered lines.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.270
You'd say okay they're
not really an actor,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.420
but we'll let it slide.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.141
You were good.
- Well thank you.

00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:24.960
I appreciate that.
- And plus, Sheldon gave

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.660
both of us a hard time.
- He did.

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:30.380
He told me that I should give up physics

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.643
and consider reading to the elderly,

00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:34.770
(laughing)
but he said don't read

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.823
your own books to the elderly.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.130
- He was pissed off
that I was an accessory

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.330
to the demotion of Pluto.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.050
He said Pluto was one of his favorites.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.199
(laughing)
- And you told him

00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:52.123
to get over it.
- To get over it, yeah.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.460
But he's scripted to just get angry,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.713
so he just got angry.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.950
I couldn't rely on a natural response.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.283
- That's 'cause he's not real.
(laughing)

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.120
- This early star, does it
tell us something backwards

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.100
towards the Big Bang that
we should know about?

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.290
'Cause you're a Big Bang guy.
- Yeah, it does.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.880
The curious thing is that
the signal is stronger

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.110
than the theory predicted.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.890
The signal's there in
the sense that you've got

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.330
this missing part of the spectrum.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.480
- So you have people saying what would

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.950
a first star look like, let's map it out,

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.030
now you compare it,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.700
and now we got somethin'
stronger than that.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.790
- That's right.
- So that means you gotta go

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.320
back and recalculate what?
- You've gotta tweak

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.120
the theory and people are
suggesting that dark matter

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.530
may play a key role.
- See how he did that?

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.020
Gotta tweak.
- Tweak.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.650
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.310
- So I don't know what he's cookin' up.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.500
He just tweakin' stuff.
- But the tweak also kinda

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.440
spilled over into the dark matter,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.483
so I'm not sure what this means.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.734
- I don't know what either
of you are talkin' about.

00:09:57.734 --> 00:09:59.860
(laughing)

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.820
- What of the Big Bang
do you have to tweak

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.820
in order to allow our hypothesis
to match the observation?

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.670
- Well it may be that the dark matter

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.630
interacts with ordinary matter in a way

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.960
that differs from the
conventional description.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.350
This is very speculative.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.570
We're right at the beginning
of this kind of experiment.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.420
- At what point do you say
I need to tweak my theories

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.580
and at what point do you say,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.570
I need to throw out my theory?
- Well, that's the art.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.870
That's the art of science.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.170
Some people criticize scientists
for sticking to theories

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.120
long after the data seems to suggest that

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.160
they really need to move on.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.910
People say that even about String Theory.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.790
They're wrong, but--
(laughing)

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.993
It's an art and it's a personal choice.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.070
- To his face, just to be clear,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.930
'cause I'll say this again publicly,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.650
but I did really say this to his face,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.850
- Oh snap.
(laughing)

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.530
- When I asked Brian, I said
Brain, I remember y'all,

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.493
I'm that old, from the 1980s.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.280
String Theory was being born
and I said wow, this is great.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.480
A new understanding of the universe.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.330
General relativity married
with quantum physics,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.030
a marriage that Einstein
died trying to find.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.293
How soon will you have this?

00:11:15.293 --> 00:11:17.230
Said we're about five years out.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.410
About five years and then
10 years later, how far?

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.120
We got another five years.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.380
And then 10 years after that,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.185
just another five years.
- I'm consistent.

00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:29.435
(laughing)

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:32.200
- It's the year 2018.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.180
Brian, how--
- 'Bout five years I'd say,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.587
somethin' like that.
- How close are you?

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.650
So then I said, so Brian, why?

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.640
He said well, it's a hard problem.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.640
So then I said or every one
a you working on this problem

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.120
is an idiot.
(laughing)

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.960
- He did.
- I said that to his face.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.557
- Brian, I'm gonna go with hard.

00:11:55.557 --> 00:11:57.807
(laughing)

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.490
- I said that rib jokingly.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.240
At what point do you say,
we're simply not smart enough

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.483
to even answer the question
we ourselves posed?

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.490
Or do you just say it's hard?

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.050
'Cause Einstein figured
out general relativity

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.070
basically by his lonesome in 10 years

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.980
after he had special relativity.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.073
And you got how many dozens of you guys.

00:12:23.154 --> 00:12:24.880
(laughing)
- Yeah.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.483
- [Neil] For 35 years.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.513
- I gotta tell ya,

00:12:28.513 --> 00:12:30.879
the reason I accepted to
be on the show tonight is.

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:33.129
(laughing)

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.480
Here's the situation.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.940
If we were not making progress,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.140
then I wouldn't need you
to tell me to give it up.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.170
I don't believe in re-incarnation.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.460
I think you live once and
I don't wanna spend my life

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.040
workin' on a theory if
I really don't think

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.000
it has a promise to reach the goal

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.470
that we have set for ourselves.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.170
- [Neil] So you're honest with yourself.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.663
- Totally honest.
- We have so much in common

00:12:57.663 --> 00:12:58.496
'cause I don't believe in it

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:00.063
'cause I don't wanna be a turtle.

00:13:00.937 --> 00:13:03.187
(laughing)

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.593
- Okay.
(laughing)

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.410
- No, you said I don't
believe in re-incarnation.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.190
For some reason, I think
I'm coming back as a turtle.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.710
- I hear what you're sayin'.
- Oh, yeah,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.270
we both missed that.
- Shh, went like this.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.325
- And you're the astrophysicist.

00:13:18.325 --> 00:13:21.433
- We both missed that.
(laughing)

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:24.540
- They got it.
- Here's the thing.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.940
- They did not get that.
- Oh they got.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.579
Did you not get that?
(applause)

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:31.020
(audience cheers)
- I was thinkin'--

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.110
- Stupid people unite.
(laughing)

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.030
- I was thinkin' the
turtle was a reference

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.200
to sort of the Hindu on
the back of an elephant.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.530
The elephant's standing on turtles

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.832
and it's turtles all the way down.

00:13:42.832 --> 00:13:44.678
- See that's why you got
doctor in front of your name.

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:47.493
(laughing)
And I tell dick jokes.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.250
- Where were we?
- I know exactly

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.410
where we were.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.690
Go 'head.
- I know exactly

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:00.850
where we were.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.480
What I'm asking you as
a theoretical physicist,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.840
leading theoretical physicist,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.040
we have an observation, an
astronomical observation

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.700
and it forces you to go back and tweak.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.500
Are you tweaking Big Bang,
you tweaking quantum physics?

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:18.120
What are you tweaking?
- In this particular case,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.840
you really are tweaking something that

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.590
we yet don't understand
fully, which is dark matter.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.430
So that's ripe for being tweaked,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.263
but look, there are other things.

00:14:26.263 --> 00:14:28.610
- Dark matter is mysterious
gravity of the universe.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.950
We have no idea what's causing it.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.530
- But I'll give you another example,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.590
which has happened recently.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.010
There've been measurements of the rate

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.060
of the expansion of space

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.140
and those measurements, very recently,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.090
are seeming to be incompatible

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.143
with earlier measurements
done in a different way.

00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:46.040
- [Neil] You see a whole
other recent result.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.780
- A whole other recent result, exactly.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.220
And this one, if it's correct,

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.710
this is one that could really change

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.633
our understanding of the
early universe dramatically.

00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:58.500
In order to get the measurements

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.450
that are done on the expansion of space

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.190
looking at the microwave
background radiation

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.190
and those that are coming from

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.760
looking at supernova explosions,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.300
to get those compatible, right now,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.810
is gonna require perhaps,
tweakin' the dark energy.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.210
It may require tweaking
our understanding of

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.106
the gravitational force.

00:15:15.106 --> 00:15:16.660
There are many things that may come into

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.840
that particular reconciliation.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.950
- Tweak our understanding of
the gravitational force itself?

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.710
- Yeah, whenever you
talk about dark energy,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.123
everyone knows what dark energy is?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.573
- Some people at home may not.
(laughing)

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.800
- This energy filling
space that we believe

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.660
yields a repulse of gravity
that's causing the universe

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.390
to speed up in its acceleration.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:45.040
- When it theoretically
should be slowing down.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.230
- That's right, ordinary
gravity pulls things together.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.750
It should be slowing down.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.840
The shock that we got in 1998
is that's not slowing down,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.383
the rate of expansion speeding up.

00:15:54.383 --> 00:15:56.123
- Against the wishes of gravity?

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:57.893
- Here's the thing,

00:15:57.893 --> 00:16:00.170
we didn't understand gravity well enough.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.120
Gravity can not only be
attracted, it can be repulsive.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.760
And that really wasn't taken
into account until about 1998

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.110
when it comes to Cosmology.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.080
Now, the possibility is
maybe this outward push

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.770
is itself getting stronger over time.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.600
- So that means thinking it was one thing,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.870
would be an incomplete
understanding of that phenomenon.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.470
- Yes, and that's what science is.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.930
- Which would actually change everything.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.560
- But that's what science is.
- Which is why,

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.973
you have to tweak String Theory.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.543
- Yeah.
(laughing)

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.500
- If it affects gravity, then
every moment of our models

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.110
from the Big Bang forward
would have to be rethought.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.230
Put back in the computers,

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.590
say now what are you gonna give me

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.650
with this new understanding?
- Literally.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.710
Because these equations are so complex,

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.640
there's so many features
that come into play

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.040
that you have to put it on a computer

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.410
and simulate and see what happens.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:00.150
- Does that affect any
thinking of what's going on

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.210
before the universe began?
- People play with those

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.950
sorts of ideas, but it's hard to know

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.170
if that question even makes sense.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.120
It makes sense to say what
happened before you were born?

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.940
What happened before the Earth formed?

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.500
Those sorts of phenomenon
certainly were preceded

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.410
by something else in the universe.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.260
But the Big Bang may have
been not just the beginning

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.780
of the universe as we
think of it as stuff,

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.640
it could've been the
beginning of time itself.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.790
- This past Sunday,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.320
we aired my interview
with Stephen Hawking,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.270
went to the dude's office in Cambridge.

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:36.170
I asked him, what was
around before the Big Bang?

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.613
He gave an answer and nobody
understood the answer.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.763
Check it out.

00:17:43.204 --> 00:17:44.610
- I have no idea what he was--
- What was he saying?

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.660
- I have no idea, I
haven't seen the podcast.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.751
- You gotta watch the show.
- Yeah, I will.

00:17:48.751 --> 00:17:50.783
You didn't prep me on this one.

00:17:53.116 --> 00:17:55.178
- Allow me to explain what he was sayin'.

00:17:55.178 --> 00:17:57.428
(laughing)

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.030
- You can give me two or
three ideas that people have

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.250
about what preceded the Big Bang.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.310
- Absolutely.
- Whether or not

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.260
they're your ideas.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.130
- One idea is that the
Big Bang may not have been

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.060
a unique event, there may
have been many Big Bangs,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.660
giving arise to many universes.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.575
- We are one of those--
- And we're just one of those.

00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:23.570
Sort of like a cosmic
bubble bath of universes,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.190
and we're just one bubble expanding

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.970
in that larger landscape of reality.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.320
If that's the case, then our Big Bang

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.260
was not the beginning of everything,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.380
it was just an interesting
event that we hold dear

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.020
because it gave rise to us,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.153
but there would've been a time before it

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.610
that wouldn't have been any more exotic

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.010
than the time now.
- A time measured by

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.760
some methods we have yet to divine

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.790
because every method of
measuring time exists

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.270
within this universe.
- That's right.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.440
The notion of a time goin'
across all of the universes,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.990
a very difficult idea to
make mathematical sense of.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.480
- Like a meta time.
- A meta time of some sort,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.530
but people don't fully appreciate--

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.463
- But that wouldn't be time.
- It wouldn't be time as you

00:19:06.463 --> 00:19:07.570
- That would not be time.
- as you experience,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.416
you're absolutely right.

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:11.270
So in this universe,
the fact that we can say

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.800
that the universe has an age of whatever,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.020
13.8 billion years, is
only because our universe

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.820
is highly symmetric.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.760
You look at one chunk of
the universe over here

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.490
and another chunk over
here and on average,

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.750
their properties are the same.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.290
If that weren't the case there
would be no notion of time

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.090
across even our universe.
- Because of this symmetry

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.190
of appearance, you're saying,
we can justifiably say

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.960
we are all experiencing the
same age of this universe.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.930
- That's right.
- But if we had looked

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.250
over there and stuff was being born

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.200
and over here stuff was
dyin', out of proportion,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.790
we would be forced to say
there's not one coherent time

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.450
across this space time continuum.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.370
- Right, because Einstein,
as we're all familiar with,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.680
taught us that if you're moving,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.410
time ticks off at a different rate,

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.610
if you're near a black hole,

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.130
time ticks off at a different rate,

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.610
so you should ask yourself,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.943
when people say the universe
is 13 billion years old,

00:20:00.943 --> 00:20:03.250
according to which clock?

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.910
If those clocks are moving or
if they're near a black hole,

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.800
or a strong gravitational field,

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.940
they'll tick off time at different rates

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.740
and the way we get outta that conundrum

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.190
is what you're saying.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.060
The overall uniformity
means that on those clocks,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.810
that are experiencing basically

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.560
the same physical conditions,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.672
they're gonna
(laughing)

00:20:23.672 --> 00:20:25.130
experience time the same way.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.515
- I love your clock pantomime.

00:20:26.515 --> 00:20:28.243
It's beautiful.
- I love it too.

00:20:28.243 --> 00:20:30.070
Man, I have never in my life
wished that I smoked weed

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:35.070
more than I do right now.
(laughing)

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.349
Now I know why they do it, man.

00:20:37.349 --> 00:20:39.599
(laughing)

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.493
- We gotta land this plane.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.893
Two final questions.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.750
If we're asking what was
around before the Big Bang,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.660
you're saying maybe there was
this bubble bath Big Bangs,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.790
then that just pushes that
question a little further,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.420
what was around before the bubble bath?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.650
- Or it may push it infinitely far back.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.020
That's a possibility too.
- Turtles all the way down.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.290
- It could be turtles all the way down.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.180
- See, the turtle thing.
- The other idea that does

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.680
come outta String Theory initially is that

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.380
maybe our universe is a slice of space,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.910
floating in a larger cosmos.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.930
Higher dimensions of String
Theory allow for that freedom.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.010
So our universe is like a slice of bread

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.560
in a big cosmic loaf that
may have other slices,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.150
which would be other universes.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.590
I bring that up because
- He's high.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.086
- there's a theoretical description--

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:30.180
(laughing)

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.580
I'm gonna ignore these guys.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.257
- We were good, now we're
like slices of bread.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.197
Slice of bread, I got you.

00:21:44.197 --> 00:21:45.799
This is a bread, loaf universe.

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:48.970
- Exactly and there's a way
of describing the Big Bang

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.790
where it's actually
arising from the collision

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.070
of these two universes.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.520
It's knowing what we call the Big Bang

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.180
or it's called the Big Splat,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.710
so it's a little more evocative
way of thinkin' about it.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.950
In which case, before the Big
Bang, before the Big Splat,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.520
would just be the these
two giant sheets of space

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.390
slamming into each other.
- They created yet

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.910
a subsequent Big Bang.
- That's right,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:09.980
it's a cyclic universe.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.010
It happens over and over and over again

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:12.900
through these collisions.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.570
So then what's before our Big Bang?

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.930
It would just be an era of the universe,

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.840
similar to this potentially,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.910
but was just a different
part of the cycle.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.523
- So therefore, and my
last question to you,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.660
the very distant future universe,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.770
where we're accelerating
at whatever rate it is,

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.220
does what you're saying now affect

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.200
that very distant universe?
- It can, absolutely.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.470
Because if for instance,
we're talkin' about

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.210
a cyclic universe--
- But my slice of bread

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.540
is gettin' bigger.
- Your slice of bread

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.930
is getting bigger, but that other slice

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.310
may be coming toward you.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.410
So it truly, in years from
now, we may get hit again,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.970
and be completely obliterated.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.940
- How will we know if
another slice of bread

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.938
is coming towards us?
- That's the thing, we won't.

00:22:51.938 --> 00:22:54.510
(laughing)

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.833
- All I know is I am hungry right now.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.420
- Brian Greene, thank you for totally

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.580
fucking with our heads here.
(laughing)

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.336
Brian Greene.
- That's awesome stuff.

00:23:07.336 --> 00:23:08.703
(applause)
- Thank you.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.553
- It's phenomenal.
- Hang on for a second.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.740
We're gonna wrap up this parta the show.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.570
Before I hand the baton over

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.210
to Neuroscientist Heather Berlin,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.543
one of our StarTalk All Stars.

00:23:24.394 --> 00:23:26.730
And while she comes out.
but before that happens,

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.710
we are going to have a

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.870
special musical interlude.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.810
Musical interlude.
- Oh sweet.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.700
- We are going to have

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.980
a special performance by Baba Brinkman.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.720
Baba Brinkman come on out.
- All right.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.970
(applause)

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.690
- Baba, you're a science rapper.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.290
- I am a science rapper,
such things do exist.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.550
- That's a thing.
- It's a thing now.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.150
- You will demonstrate that now?

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.207
- Let's all hope so.
(laughing)

00:24:03.207 --> 00:24:04.684
- [Neil] Baba Brinkman.

00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:06.934
(applause)

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.850
- They gave me one song to demonstrate

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.330
that science rap exists.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.490
And all this physics stuff

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.260
is gonna mix with neuroscience

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.870
and pretty soon we're gonna
start talkin' about free will

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.450
and as a rap artist, who's
been at this for over a decade,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.360
you gotta get into freestyle.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.790
So I'm about to do a
freestyle interpreting

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.420
a lot of what was discussed
through this last half hour.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.490
And I want you to think about this.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.330
Either every word they said
and every word I'm about to say

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.690
was pre-determined since
our Big Bang, on our slice,

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.563
or there is some kind
of free will possible.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.093
Alright, hit it.

00:24:46.187 --> 00:24:50.820
(electronic music)
Now I'm from Western Canada.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.690
When I was a young rapper,
picturin' myself on MTV,

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.090

00:29:40.803 --> 00:29:42.713

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.045

(laughing)
Could you tell by the way

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.100
I said is the house
somewhere around Brooklyn?

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.810
- That's just a little
creepy, I think, I don't know.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.810
It's good, but I think it's
the universality of the medium

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.360
that I think is speaking to us all,

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.640
where you wanna express
yourself, it comes out.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.450
It comes out just how you
feel it in that moment.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.050
- The question is if you
imagine hip hop culture

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:22.750
spreading to Western Canada
and then getting adapted

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.910
and coming back to Brooklyn,
would you imagine it sounding

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:27.523
any different than what I just did?

00:30:27.523 --> 00:30:29.773
(laughing)

00:30:31.326 --> 00:30:33.555

can't be Black anymore.

00:30:33.555 --> 00:30:38.555
I'm goin'.
(laughing)

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.480
- So you gotta run,
'cause where you gotta be?

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.560
- Okay so that was a piece

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.270
from an Off Broadway production I'm doing,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.370
hip hop theater, very
inspired by Hamilton.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.430
It's called the Rap Guide to Consciousness

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.080
and it's all neuroscience,
cognitive psychology--

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.913
- And you performed that tonight.

00:30:52.913 --> 00:30:54.130
You gotta leave here
tonight to perform that.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.327
- The show starts in 45 minutes.

00:30:55.327 --> 00:30:57.440
- Well, get the hell outta here.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.660

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.923

00:31:17.723 --> 00:31:19.534

00:31:19.534 --> 00:31:21.623

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.780

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.419
about his prefrontal cortex.

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:29.669
(laughing)

00:31:30.721 --> 00:31:33.110
- You have some good
vocabulary runnin' down there.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.130
- That was serious.
- Just to be clear.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:41.130
He did that in rehearsal
and 5% of it was the same.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.750
The rest was completely
invented in that moment.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.270
- Yeah, it was unbelievable.
- What's the dude

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.190
talkin' about my mustache?
(laughing)

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.410
- See, he knew better than
to do that in rehearsal.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.660
(laughing)

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.040

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.303
- Yeah, I don't think so.
(laughing)

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.040
- You don't know me very well, Brian.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.440

- Well thank you.
- Thank you for being here.

00:33:09.243 --> 00:33:10.876
- So wonderful of you to say.

00:33:10.876 --> 00:33:13.400
(Heather laughs)

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.180
- We're gonna talk a little bit about

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:19.260
the intersection between
neuroscience and physics.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.260
Talk a little bit about
consciousness, time and free will.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.034
So we're just gonna keep it light.

00:33:26.034 --> 00:33:27.240
(laughing)
Light and easy.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.073
- Free will.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:33.223
Not Free Willy, right, free will.

00:33:33.223 --> 00:33:35.883
- It's not that kinda show.
(laughing)

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.870
- That was a movie.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.943
- I took that reference differently.

00:33:42.293 --> 00:33:44.508
- You know what's funny,
I was thinkin' that.

00:33:44.508 --> 00:33:46.249
(laughing)
And I was like nah,

00:33:46.249 --> 00:33:48.102
I better not say it.
- I told you,

00:33:48.102 --> 00:33:50.540
we are one, you're like my subconscious,

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.870
but I just kind of try to keep at bay,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.113
but it keeps comin' up.

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:57.830
- That's a very good plan, actually.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.930
- Brian, you once tweeted, you said,

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.930
free will--
- Wait, you're gonna quote

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.150
a tweet of mine
- I am quoting a tweet--

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.970
- in front of this guy over here?

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.840
That's like saying I play
baseball in front of Babe Ruth.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.149
It's like saying I write
music in front of Mozart.

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:14.420
(laughing)
- Your tweets matter.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.790
Your tweets matter.
- Thank you.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.470
- Free will--
- All tweets matter.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.630
- Not all tweets,
(laughing)

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.693
not all tweets.
- Blue tweets matter.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.038
I had to do it, I'm sorry.
- We got some red tweets

00:34:29.038 --> 00:34:31.150
in the house, we got some red tweets.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.980
- So you said, free will

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.190
is the sensation of making a choice.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:39.130
The sensation is real, but
the choice seems elusory.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.383
Laws of physics determine the future.

00:34:42.735 --> 00:34:45.180
- I had to say that.
(Heather laughs)

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.760
- You were compelled.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.920
It was determined from the Big Bang.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.220
What does physics have
to say about free will?

00:34:54.814 --> 00:34:55.647
- It's not definite,

00:34:55.647 --> 00:34:58.140
because we don't fully
know the laws of physics,

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.470
but the laws of physics
that we currently have

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.740
at our disposal have no opportunity

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.760
for intersection by human will.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.610
We are a collection of particles

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.470
governed by laws that you can write down

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:11.770
and fit on a t-shirt

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:13.470
and those laws don't at any point

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.050
in the evolution of the particles say

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.130
hey, can you tell me
now what to do, person?

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.970
They just determine the future

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.970
based upon what things
were like in the past.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:27.270
- But Brian, can't there
be an emergent property

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.130
of that collection of molecules,

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.983
that we can call free will?

00:35:32.177 --> 00:35:35.640
Because the emergent property,
if you know emergence,

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.510
it's a feature of an ensemble
that cannot be deduced

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.340
by the study of the individual.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.500
- Like ants.
- Like ants.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.260
You study one ant, you say hi
ant, they'll shake your hand.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.790
You have no idea that a
thousand ants together

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.170
are gonna make an ant mount,

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:52.360
or a thousand termite
make a termite mound.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.240
Or that birds will flock.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.520
You have no way to predict that.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.730
- It sounds like Woody Allen.
(Heather laughs)

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.586
- If free will doesn't exist
(laughs)

00:36:01.586 --> 00:36:03.410
at that level of physics,

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.140
in other words, if it doesn't
exist at the level of physics

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.610
could it not exist at
the level of biology,

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.733
- It depends.
- or say psychology.

00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:11.210
- It's a really good point
and it really depends

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.070
on what your definition of free will is.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.810
Normally, the intuitive definition is

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.750
things could've been different,

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.530
and I could've made a choice

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.950
for things to turn out differently.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.910
And if that's your
definition of free will,

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.090
does that resonate with your
perspective of free will,

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.050
then I don't see any way to square that

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.330
with the laws of physics
because anything that you do

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:36.410
is your particles executing
some kind of motion

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.980
and the motion of your particles,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.910
in your brain, in your body,

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.270
have no opportunity to allow you

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.390
as a conscious being to direct them.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:49.080
What force could possibly
that direction come from?

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.930
Is it the electromagnetic force?

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:52.860
Well that one we understand from Maxwell.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.410
Is it the gravitational force?

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:55.720
We understand that one from Einstein.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.820
Is it the nuclear forces?

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.690
Those we understand from

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.480
the standard model particle physics.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.590
What force could you possibly
exert on your particles

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.670
that goes against or goes
beyond those that emerge

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.857
from the equations of physics?

00:37:07.857 --> 00:37:11.310
That's the issue.
- Could our free will thrive

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:15.510
in the probabilistic
description of quantum physics?

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.980
- No.
(laughing)

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.740
Not as we currently understand it.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.120
And that's a natural--
- Don't make me fight you

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.690
here on stage.
- We've done this before.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.210
- Yeah, we did actually.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.360
I grabbed his lapel on stage.
- But we both were wrestlers

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.798
in high school, different
weight categories.

00:37:30.798 --> 00:37:31.992
(laughing)
- Yes, very different

00:37:31.992 --> 00:37:33.492
weight categories.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.910
- I should've said it's
possible but I consider it

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.220
highly unlikely.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.070
So there is a puzzle right
now in quantum physics

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.660
that has been on the
table for 50, 75 years

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.380
and we don't know the
answer to this puzzle,

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.660
and that's why I have to couch my remarks

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.550
with a little bit of uncertainty.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.140
And that puzzle is this.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.070
Quantum Theory says they can only predict

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.253
the probability of one outcome or another.

00:38:00.253 --> 00:38:03.130
50% chance electron
here, 50% chance there.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.580
Yet, when we measure the electron,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.360
we always find it either here or there.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.300
One or the other.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.790
So how do you go from the
fuzzy probabilistic haze

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:13.960
of many possibilities to
the single definite reality

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.240
that we all experience in every day life?

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.490
We still don't know
how to bridge that gap.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.040
Within that, if consciousness,
somehow plays a role,

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.650
in picking out one outcome
from the probabilistic haze,

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.447
then sure, then free will might
come for the ride as well.

00:38:29.447 --> 00:38:31.147
- There you go.
- But, but, but--

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.720
- You just said, probabilistically,

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.330
the particle can be here or there.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.430
- Yes.
- But if you measure it,

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.110
it is only in one place.
- Yes.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.480
- So my act

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.400
of thought

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:52.330
is I wanna cheeseburger, that's
the particle in this state.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.570
I want a cheeseburger, bam.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.300
The particle's there.
- That's the part I don't buy.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.183
Right there.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.050
Because it's random.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:07.150
There's nothing that you
did to pick one outcome

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.120
because you wanted it,
because you willed it,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.800
because it was your desire.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.550
And yet, your intuition is
you had the cheeseburger

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.130
because you chose it.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.870
If it comes from a random process

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.290
it's like throwin' the dice.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.080
And throwin' the dice to get an outcome

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.880
is not what we mean by free will.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.940
- Okay wait, you physicists.
(laughing)

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.160
- Sorry.
(applause)

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.843
- I'm gonna give you a
neuroscientific perspective.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.810
From a neuroscientific
perspective, first of all,

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.650
what's happening at the quantum level,

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:41.520
doesn't really scale up to
whether a neuron fires or not,

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.420
I mean that indeterminacy.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.650
From experiments that we've done,

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.820
starting in the '80s,
Benjamin Libet did studies

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.720
where he said to somebody,
whenever you feel like it,

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.763
just press this button and
he measured brain activation.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.960
and he said even before they
actually press the button,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.690
'cause that takes time
to make the movement,

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.610
just let me know where this
little dot is on the clock

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.730
when you feel the first
inkling of the intention

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:03.800
of wanting to move.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.850
And then what he found
is about 350 milliseconds

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:10.060
before a person even had
that conscious intention,

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.640
there was a gearing up
of brain activation.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.530
So then, leap forward to current times,

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.810
we do in our imaging experiments,

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:17.840
where we can say to a person--

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.060
- Just so that people know,

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.410
you measure people's brains for a living.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.310
- That's my job, that's what I do, yes.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.623
- I would be no help to you.
(laughing)

00:40:31.911 --> 00:40:33.010
- It's my unconscious here again.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:34.333
He's always buttin' in.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.803
We need you, we need you.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.280
But you can measure it using FMRI,

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.170
which looks at blood flow

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.100
to different parts of the brain.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.100
- Functional Magnetic
- Functional Magnetic

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.400
Residence Imaging.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.210
Basically looking at blood flow
as a proxy to neurons fired.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.830
The blood is gonna go where
the neurons are firing

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.220
'cause they need energy.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.350
We can say to you okay,
just choose left or right,

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.300
or that hamburger or not.
- Cheeseburger.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.610
- Cheeseburger, sorry, cheeseburger.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.152
- [Chuck] He chose to put
cheese on that burger.

00:41:01.152 --> 00:41:03.402
(laughing)

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.030
- We can say, we can
predict, up to 10 seconds

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.300
before you even have a
conscious inclination

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.210
of your intention, which
you're going to go.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.900
Left or right, or cheese or no cheese.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.250
So at that level, I
like to say yeah, sure,

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.890
we have free will, but we're
just not conscious of it.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:23.990
The brain is making these
decisions all the time

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.350
and we have this allusion of free will.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.420
But the question really is is
why do we have this allusion?

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.810
Why did we evolve this allusion?

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.470
Is it important, if we didn't have it,

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.940
would it change our behavior?
- Yeah, it strikes me that

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.920
it gives us that sense of control

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.298
that presumably, out in the Savannah,

00:41:42.298 --> 00:41:45.520
50,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago,

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.390
made the difference
between surviving and not.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:51.180
If you're invested in how things turn out

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:55.030
and feel that your decisions
can affect how things turn out,

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.550
you're more attentive,
you're more engaged.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.070
It's something that matters to you more

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.680
and presumably, something like that

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.550
or some parallel story like that,

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.370
suggests why we have this allusion.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.900
- 'Cause you're less likely to be eaten.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.315
- Yes, that's the point, that's the point.

00:42:08.315 --> 00:42:12.200
- So you both agree with one
another, with each other,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.720
that from physics point of
view, it's deterministic.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.523
You didn't use that word, but
I'm puttin' it in your mouth.

00:42:23.983 --> 00:42:26.182
- It's okay on the radio and live show--

00:42:26.182 --> 00:42:29.160
(laughing)
- And so Heather,

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.450
your results are consistent
with his, basically.

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:34.030
- Yeah, I think from both
a physics perspective

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.920
and a neuroscience perspective,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.430
we come to the similar
conclusion that it's an allusion,

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.410
that free will is an allusion,

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.880
even though we really feel like it's not.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.420
And actually studies have been done,

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.520
which when you tell people
that free will is an allusion

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.460
and you start giving
them subsequent tests,

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.620
they're more likely to
cheat on a math test,

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.963
they're more likely to act unethically.

00:42:53.915 --> 00:42:55.410
The fact that we had this belief,

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:59.870
those who have had it actually
are better able to survive

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.900
in the system along the line.
- More likely to behave.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.259
- More likely to behave.
- If you said

00:43:04.259 --> 00:43:05.550
we're in control.
- However, we also have

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.520
evolved for there to be
cheaters, and they can win.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.600
If we were all cheaters, no one would win.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.981
But if we all--
- Just ask Tom Brady.

00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:15.231
(laughing)

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.570
- And Chuck, he looked so
deflated at the end of that game.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.820
(laughing)

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.913
He was sad.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:31.583
Heather,

00:43:34.529 --> 00:43:36.820
let me ask you a blunter question.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.080
Does it even matter that you know this

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.040
if we all feel like we have free will?

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.200
I wanna believe that I go to school,

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.270
and get a good job and behave,
I wanna believe all that.

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.326
You told me I shouldn't believe it.

00:43:51.326 --> 00:43:52.159
That if one day I end up in prison,

00:43:52.159 --> 00:43:54.170
that was pre-determined from the Big Bang?

00:43:55.053 --> 00:44:00.053
You're saying yes to that?
- Absolutely, man.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:01.623
If I knew you were gonna do it,

00:44:01.623 --> 00:44:04.423
there's nothing I can do.
(laughing)

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.906
- If I kick your ass right now,

00:44:07.906 --> 00:44:09.191
- That's it.
- that was pre-determined

00:44:09.191 --> 00:44:10.280
- Then it was meant to be.
- from the Big Bang.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.372
- It was meant to be, my friend.

00:44:12.372 --> 00:44:15.420
(laughing)

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.220
- I don't know how this got to sexy.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.870
- Plus Brian, kicking
one's ass is not a literal

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.933
stick your ass and someone's to kick.

00:44:27.701 --> 00:44:30.560
In the hood it means just winning a fight.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.963
- Oh.
(laughing)

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:38.683
- Brian was born and
raised in New York City.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.000
Went to Stuyvesant High School,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.270
so he's home grown.
- Oh, nice.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.942
- Home grown.
(applause)

00:44:44.942 --> 00:44:46.248
- But wait, that pre-determinism

00:44:46.248 --> 00:44:47.780
that you were just talking about.

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.480
Okay, let's say for instance
that you do accept that.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.130
And then that leads to fatalism.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.900
Was that also pre-determined?
(Heather laughs)

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.990
So the fact that you were
given this information

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.130
that well, I'm not really in
charge of my own decisions.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:02.870
My brain is makin' these decisions

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.090
based upon these neurosynaptic transitions

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.660
that happen within my mind
and so I just let that happen

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.830
and then I say oh okay, because of that,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.040
I don't give a damn about anything

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.550
and I just let it all go.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.721
Was that pre-determined?
- Yep.

00:45:14.721 --> 00:45:16.971
(laughing)

00:45:17.908 --> 00:45:19.710
- But also, to put it in perspective--

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:23.670
- [Chuck] Okay, god I'm
gonna shoot myself tonight.

00:45:26.511 --> 00:45:27.980
- I gotta just let the record show.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.740
Chuck put out a really
awesome question right there.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.722
And it just got a one word answer.

00:45:32.722 --> 00:45:34.370
(laughing)
You coulda at least

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.250
stretched out your answer,
give the guy a break.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:38.083
- No, happy to.

00:45:39.397 --> 00:45:41.530
Often people when they
encounter these ideas,

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.650
and you must've heard this too,

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:43.573
people say okay then I'm
not gonna do anything

00:45:43.573 --> 00:45:45.567
but sit on my couch and
what does it matter?

00:45:45.567 --> 00:45:48.220
- Fatalism.
- But you see, that's a mixing

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.720
of two distinct views on one question.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.510
If you think that you're
makin' a free choice

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.140
to sit on your couch, then you feel like

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.130
well now, I am going to give in to this

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.450
and I'm just gonna sit there.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:03.750
But if you do that, it was determined.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.200
So exactly what you're asking.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.970
If you choose to sit on your couch,

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.880
it's not that you made
a volitional choice,

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.420
it was set in place.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.900
And if that's what was gonna happen,

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.450
that's what's gonna happen.
- But then by that

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:20.450
particular measure, all
information that we receive

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.470
then pre-determines everything that we do.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:24.580
That's really what you're saying.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.070
- Yes, absolutely.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:30.360
And moreover, to just give
this a little bit more color,

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.620
I think your view, Heathers'
view and Baba's view--

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.150
- Don't mansplain her view.
- Okay, I won't then.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:37.821
(laughing)

00:46:37.821 --> 00:46:40.625
But what I heard Baba say.
(applause)

00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:42.175
- Let me tell you somethin' Brian.

00:46:42.175 --> 00:46:43.534
Let me tell you somethin'.

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:46.560
I pre-determined to say that.
(laughing)

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.190
- We spoke about this before we came out.

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.410
Baba's description I think,
really at least helps me,

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:54.610
when I think in those terms.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:59.040
Which is, it's not that free
will is the intuitive one

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.350
that we're talkin' about here.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.310
Free will really is the fact
that we're able to carry out

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.000
this amazing spectrum of behaviors.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.120
We can walk, we can talk, we can sing,

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.740
we can come up with ideas.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.170
The fact that they had an earlier cause

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.900
maybe even back at the Big Bang,

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.930
to me, it doesn't take
anything away from creativity.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.140
It doesn't take anything
away from originality.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.160
It doesn't take anything away

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.580
from having a sense of
authorship over your own actions

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:27.050
because you're the most
immediate cause of those actions.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.690
They emerge through you,
through your particles.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.560
Your particles and your
brain are configured

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.480
in such a way that when
certain stimuli hit your body

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.630
you said and do certain things.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.420
The fact that it's determined, who cares?

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.700
- So there's different views of free will.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.327
There's not just determinism
and non determinism.

00:47:44.327 --> 00:47:47.443
There's compatibilism.
- Which is what that is.

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:51.563
- And compatibilism is
saying that the world,

00:47:52.426 --> 00:47:55.360
it is deterministic, but
we also have free will

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.320
within in that because
of these probabilities.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.310
And the other question,

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.010
getting kind of to what you were saying

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.610
is that so then people throw
their hands in the air,

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:03.692
okay, if there's no
such thing as free will,

00:48:03.692 --> 00:48:04.946
then I can do whatever I want.

00:48:04.946 --> 00:48:06.670
I can go murder someone,
it doesn't matter,

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.777
it was pre-determined.
(laughing)

00:48:08.777 --> 00:48:11.830
However, we have also--
- However, Chuck.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.150
- There is a however,
that's really important.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.660
We have evolved the capacity

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.370
to have self control as other animals.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.930
But in particular, we have
the largest percentage

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.110
of prefrontal cortex
than any other species,

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.090
which is the part of the
brain that has that ability

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:27.940
to control our innate impulses.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.670
So we hold people
accountable for their actions

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:33.010
to the degree to which
they have the capacity

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.880
to have self control.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.980
Therefore, children are less
responsible for their crimes

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.970
than adults or people who
have prefrontal lesions

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.683
or sever psychiatric illness.
- 'Cause children don't have

00:48:41.683 --> 00:48:43.501
a fully developed
- Prefrontal cortex.

00:48:43.501 --> 00:48:45.670
- prefrontal cortex yet.
- Until about the age of 25.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.395
- And for guys, it's 35.
- Yeah, it's a little bit--

00:48:48.395 --> 00:48:50.729
(laughing)
Pushed out a little bit more.

00:48:50.729 --> 00:48:55.729
- Or perhaps, 70.
(laughing)

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:03.400
- So our next segment is
gonna be StarTalk All Stars,

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.230
where I take a backseat
and we bring on the host.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.300
One of our many talented
StarTalk All Stars,

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.930
Neuroscientist Heather Berlin.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:14.763
Heather, come on out.
(applause)

00:49:17.215 --> 00:49:18.048
Hey.

00:49:19.862 --> 00:49:21.500
So Brian, you're gonna come here.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.370
- [Heather] I think I'm sitting here.

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:24.320
- [Neil] Why don't you go there.

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.170
And you go there.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.812
Let me ask botha you somethin'.

00:49:28.812 --> 00:49:30.640
'Cause you both have to think about this.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.850
Since we're talkin' about

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.400
the brain predetermining something you do,

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.370
you talkin' 'bout the
Big Bang predetermining

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.133
all future events.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:42.493
Then is the fact that we experience time,

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.273
is that itself an allusion?

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.150
- I'm gonna say yes, time is an allusion,

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:51.580
the way we experience it.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.580
I'm not talking from
the physics perspective,

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.420
but the way humans experience
time is an allusion

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.180
because it's very easily manipulated.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.830
So for example, in experiments,

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.230
we can take something called

00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:03.790
transcranial magnetic stimulation,

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:05.390
which is basically--
- Transcranial.

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:07.020
- Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.610
You put a magnet and you can kinda zap

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:09.620
different parts of the brain

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.400
and temporarily knock them out.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.530
- People let you do this to them?

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.680
- We do all sorts of things, Neil.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.743
Why do you think I
became a neuroscientist?

00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:19.338
- I gotta be honest, I'm kinda up for it.

00:50:19.338 --> 00:50:20.657
(laughing)
- It's a lotta fun.

00:50:20.657 --> 00:50:23.080
It's a lot of fun.
- Heather, you describe it

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.090
with such glee.

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:28.440
Stick a magnet on their
head, okay, and what happens?

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.485
- One day I'll bring you into the lab.

00:50:30.485 --> 00:50:32.749
- Na uh.
(laughing)

00:50:32.749 --> 00:50:36.160
I don't wanna put magnets in my head.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.350
- We can manipulate, for example,
we have you do an action.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.700
You can press the button
whenever you want.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.270
Kinda like that let me know when you had

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:44.200
the intention to do it and
then we see when you do it.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.750
And then we zap you just after you do it.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:49.867
- Zap you.
- Little magnet stimulation.

00:50:49.867 --> 00:50:52.357
(Neil laughs)
And what that does.

00:50:52.357 --> 00:50:54.046
It's harmless.
- Innocent.

00:50:54.046 --> 00:50:55.143
- It's harmless.
- Harmless.

00:50:55.143 --> 00:50:56.879
Magnetic stimulation of the brain.

00:50:56.879 --> 00:50:59.410
- It's absolutely
harmless and what it does

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.810
is we can move back in time,

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:04.220
your perception of when
you had the intention,

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.150
we can move forward in
time your perception

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:08.160
of when you did the action.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.220
So that's one way we can manipulate time.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.160
You can manipulate time when you're in

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.430
various different states of consciousness.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:16.350
When you have particular
types of brain damage,

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:17.960
especially to the prefrontal cortex,

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.410
your perception of time will speed up.

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:20.890
We're starting to understand
which parts of the brain

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:22.290
are related to time perception

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:24.480
and when they're damaged,
your time perception changes.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.650
Or when you have certain
psychiatric illnesses.

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.560
Even during the creative state,

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.040
when you're in that kind of flow state,

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.340
like when Baba gets into
his flow and he's rapping,

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.010
I've looked at his brain in the scanner

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:36.675
and other rappers.
- He let you do this.

00:51:36.675 --> 00:51:38.090
- Why do you think I married him?

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.862
Oh, he's my husband by the way.

00:51:39.862 --> 00:51:44.362
(laughing)
(applause)

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.510
- Did he know before he married you?

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:54.167
- No, she made him marry her.
(laughing)

00:51:55.935 --> 00:51:57.610
They were out at dinner,
she was like, come here.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:58.933
I'ma put a magnet on you.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:08.570
- The real question is.
- Don't tryta dodge this back.

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.610
We know.
- The real question is,

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.900
did he write a rap about neuroscience

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.400
because he married a neuroscientist?

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.020
Or did he marry a neuroscientist

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.970
because he wanted to write
a rap about neuroscience?

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.520
We'll never know, I digress.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.950
- I'ma tell you what I know,
and no disrespect to Baba

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.640
or my wife of 20 years, but he married you

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.133
'cause you're hot.
(laughing)

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.908
Now that's one thing that
every man is predetermined.

00:52:34.908 --> 00:52:38.610
(laughing)
- He tells me he was

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:41.387
more attracted to my brain,
but I'll leave it at that.

00:52:41.387 --> 00:52:43.442
- And I'ma tell you he's lyin'.

00:52:43.442 --> 00:52:45.692
(laughing)

00:52:52.884 --> 00:52:56.230
- As I was saying, I
put it in the scanner.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:58.210
- You put him in the
scanner while he's rapping?

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.560
- While he's rapping and we actually found

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.883
a distinct pattern of brain activation.

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:05.510
During improvised state versus

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:06.710
when he's doing a memorized rap,

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.890
he gets decreased activation
of the part of the brain

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:11.420
called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.700
which has to do with our sense
of self and time and place.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.095
So when you're in these flow states--

00:53:16.095 --> 00:53:17.488
- There's actually a
part of the brain called

00:53:17.488 --> 00:53:18.340
the dorso

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.228
lateral

00:53:19.228 --> 00:53:20.145
prefrontal.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:24.000
Can you make up your mind where
this thing is in the head?

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.707
(laughing)

00:53:25.707 --> 00:53:27.344
- I'm kinda with you 'cause this like

00:53:27.344 --> 00:53:30.060
dorsal, lateral, pre.
- Dorsal, lateral, pre.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.560
Frontal.
- Frontal.

00:53:34.312 --> 00:53:35.375
- Exactly where is it?

00:53:35.375 --> 00:53:37.444
It's all around here.
(laughing)

00:53:37.444 --> 00:53:39.111
It's all up in here.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.730
- In this exact spot.
- It's right there.

00:53:46.465 --> 00:53:47.930
- There are a lot of parts to the brain

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:50.290
that we need to describe
in explicit detail.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:51.620
I won't even ask you
about your physics terms

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:52.513
that you all use.

00:53:54.039 --> 00:53:55.540
It's turned down.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.410
So that's why when people
are in this flow state

00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:00.450
it feels as if it's coming
through them from some place else

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.170
'cause they lose their sense of agency,

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:04.020
but they also lose their sense of time

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.300
and we also know in
people if you knock out

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.900
with the transcranial
magnetic stimulation,

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.650
that part of the brain,

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.500
it'll affect their perception of time.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.300
Time is a creation of the brain.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.510
It's an allusion, just like anything else.

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:17.110
And the other interesting fact is that

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.860
people without any brain
damages, healthy people,

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.120
actually have a slower
subjective sense of time

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.280
than the actual clock time.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.310
So we're not very accurate
at telling clock time.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:29.392
So we have our own kind of internal pace.

00:54:29.392 --> 00:54:30.760
- When I was a kid I did
a really geeky thing,

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.750
just 'cause I could.

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:36.623
I trained myself to
count seconds precisely.

00:54:37.925 --> 00:54:40.175
(laughing)

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.930
- What are you talkin' about Neil?

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:45.233
That's not geeky at all.

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.110
- My personal best was

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.150
I counted 89 seconds

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:57.860
when 90 seconds had passed.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.240
And I used to do it with stop watches.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.770
I almost got an applause
for that, thank you.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.020
(laughing)

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.250
So Brian, I just tried to match real time

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:10.093
but she's sayin'

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.450
the brain can be manipulated

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:15.920
to think about--
- Is there such thing

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.480
as real time?

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.257
I just think it's an
allusion that we experience

00:55:19.257 --> 00:55:22.680
but there is actual real time?
- From the standpoint

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.700
of physics, there is a conception of time

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.960
because that's what
allows change to occur.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.050
So when people say from
a physics standpoint

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:30.940
that time is an allusion,

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.700
I don't really know what they mean,

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.300
but it is the case that
our experience of time,

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.860
which you say that you can manipulate,

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.060
which is quite interesting,
- With magnets.

00:55:40.894 --> 00:55:42.410
- Or electrodes.
- Our experience of time

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:47.410
does not give us isnight into
the way time actually works.

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.660
'Cause once you learn that time for me

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.010
is not the same as time for you,

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:52.841
if we're in motion

00:55:52.841 --> 00:55:54.730
or if we're experiencing
different gravitational fields,

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:56.640
these are measurable differences between

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.790
how your watch and my
watch will tick off time

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.220
based upon what we're
doing and where we are.

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.700
That's counterintuitive.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.730
We never experience that.

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.030
It took a genius of Einstein
to come along and reveal it,

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:12.100
so I would say that our experience of time

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:16.800
gives us a misrepresentation
of how time actually behaves.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.990
But time is real.
- But for every one of us,

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.610
we are prisoners of the present.

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:25.130
Eternally transitioning
from our past to our future.

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:29.583
- Jesus, man.
- That's deep, man.

00:56:30.457 --> 00:56:32.164
We should just end this show right now.

00:56:32.164 --> 00:56:33.720
(laughing)

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.433
- You said that, I was
like, guess we outta time.

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:43.379
- Looking into the future,
there might be ways.

00:56:43.379 --> 00:56:46.330
We can do things now, like
implant electrodes in the brain

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.255
and stimulate certain parts directly.

00:56:48.255 --> 00:56:50.032
- The more you talk about this.

00:56:50.032 --> 00:56:51.490
(laughing)
We can plant electrodes

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.703
in the brain because the
magnet wasn't good enough.

00:56:57.537 --> 00:57:00.700
- And we can control
it with remote control.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:05.093
This is real stuff, I promise.
(laughing.

00:57:10.797 --> 00:57:13.490
- How do we know, you
weren't just off stage

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:15.614
controlling Baba like this,

00:57:15.614 --> 00:57:17.260
with a remote control?
(laughing)

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.784
How do we know?
- Why do you think

00:57:18.784 --> 00:57:23.155
he was so good?
(laughing)

00:57:23.155 --> 00:57:25.405
(applause)

00:57:26.927 --> 00:57:29.077
But if we could, and
theoretically we could do this

00:57:29.077 --> 00:57:30.820
in the not too distant future,

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:32.300
go in and implant electrode

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.700
and affect your perception of time,

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:39.303
such that every moment
appears to last an eternity.

00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:44.063
- Tend to which the moments are.

00:57:44.063 --> 00:57:44.910
(laughing)

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:46.630
- You could fast forward
the ones you don't like.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.507
You can keep the really good ones.

00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:49.674
- Wait, that was in Black Mirror.

00:57:49.674 --> 00:57:52.293
I saw that in Black Mirror.
- Was that?

00:57:52.293 --> 00:57:54.550
- I was gonna say, have you
been talkin' to my wife?

00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:59.130
(laughing)
- But the question would be,

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.660
would you want that implant?

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:05.390
Would you want that because
I happen to think that

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:08.030
having to experience both
the good and the bad,

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:10.780
the fact that it's temporal
and that there's limit

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.090
and that it's our most valuable resource,

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.150
gives life meaning.
- But suppose you could find

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:17.820
the moments in time or
the places in the brain

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.400
where you're most creative

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:24.380
and then make that be your
most sustained experience.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.540
Does creativity map
into this conversation?

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.010
- Yes, when you're creating,
the parts of your brain

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:33.300
that are normally active
when they're click off time,

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.250
are down regulated when you're
in that creative flow state.

00:58:37.711 --> 00:58:39.260
Time doesn't seem to exist,
self doesn't seem to exist.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.430
It's a very pleasurable state.

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:42.230
People strive to get there.
- I think Brian and I

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:44.450
could agree on this,
when you're crankin' out

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:48.759
some equation, you
forego personal hygiene,

00:58:48.759 --> 00:58:53.311
you don't know that you're hungry.

00:58:53.311 --> 00:58:55.540
And you don't know how
much time has elapsed.

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.270
Brian, do you agree?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:01.290
- Yeah, I call that Sunday.
(laughing)

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:03.350
- But you also feel, it feels as if

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.000
you're tapping into something greater.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.700
As if you are outside something
greater than yourself.

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.480
Because your sense of self is turned down.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.050
So in those moments, I would argue that

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:14.520
we feel eternal in a sense
because time is not existing.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.510
And it is very pleasurable,

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:17.667
but do you wanna be in
that state all the time?

00:59:17.667 --> 00:59:19.008
- If I had control over it.

00:59:19.008 --> 00:59:22.613
Do we have control over it?
- Essentially, yeah.

00:59:22.613 --> 00:59:24.337
- If we had control of it.
- Yeah, she wasn't very sure

00:59:24.337 --> 00:59:26.358
about that part.
(Heather laughs)

00:59:26.358 --> 00:59:28.796
You have control, well ya ya ya yeah.

00:59:28.796 --> 00:59:30.190
(laughing)
All I know is this.

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:31.540
I am never comin' to your lab,

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:34.403
'cause you like a real
life version of Get Out.

00:59:34.403 --> 00:59:36.653
(laughing)

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.770
Lay me down on the table.

00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:44.453
Now sink into the floor.
(laughing)

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:51.104
- Well, I welcome any of you into my lab

00:59:51.104 --> 00:59:53.730
at any time.
- Chuck and I are walkin'

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:56.660
right by.
- It's open door policy.

00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:57.623
Come on in.

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.540
I would argue that our sense of time

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.373
is what gives us meaning.

01:00:01.373 --> 01:00:02.960
And there are some
patients who get lesions

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.070
where they are just literally
living in the moment.

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:06.160
They cannot see the future

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.620
and they cannot think of the past.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.090
There's someone who has this
certain type of brain damage--

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:11.530
- So they're prisoners of
the present without vision.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:12.540
- Because you say we're
prisoners of the present.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.160
I say we're not prisoners of the present

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.363
because we can see into
the future and the past.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.680
There's a man, he had a
certain type of brain damage,

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.400
where every minute, he keeps
a diary and just keeps writing

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.470
I am now just conscious
for the very first time.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.080
Right now I'm just conscious
for the first time.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.270
Now I'm just awake, the first time

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:29.600
and it's just each minute
because he has no vision.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.550
He can't look in the future
and he can't see the past.

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:32.530
It's only the now.

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:33.630
He's a prisoner.
- Which magnet

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.064
made that happen?
(laughing)

01:00:36.064 --> 01:00:38.220
- It's a type of brain damage.
- And can I borrow some money

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.880
from him?
(laughing)

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.630
- Chuck.
- One interesting thing

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.110
of that story though,
just to give it meaning.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.820
He had damage to his hippocampus,

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:49.980
which is involved in memory,

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.703
but the one thing he did remember.

01:00:51.703 --> 01:00:53.080
- There was an episode of
Family Guy called Big Man

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.010
on the Hippocampus, by the way.

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.470
- [Heather] Really, I've never seen it.

01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:58.929
The thing that stayed constant.

01:00:58.929 --> 01:01:00.827
- I know it 'cause I was in
that episode, that's why.

01:01:00.827 --> 01:01:01.860
(laughing)

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.170
- You were the big man?
- I was referenced in it

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:04.170
or somethin'.
- You were the big man

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:05.530
on the hippocampus?
- No, no, no, no.

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:07.780
- Oh no, it wasn't you?

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.010
The thing that remains
stable though is every time

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.570
his wife would come to visit him

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.330
and this was over the course of years,

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:15.770
he would recognize her and see
her like it's the first time

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:16.890
he's seeing her in a million years

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:19.024
and say oh, it's so good to see you.

01:01:19.024 --> 01:01:20.212
I'm so happy to see you.

01:01:20.212 --> 01:01:21.045
And that lasted for years and years

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:22.500
and that was the only thing
that remained constant.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.610
And the other thing was that
he was a professional pianist

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:26.190
and whenever he'd get
in front of the piano,

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:27.420
and get into this mode,

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.520
he could actually just play a whole piece.

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:33.895
- Was he aware his wife was
puttin' magnets on his head?

01:01:33.895 --> 01:01:36.145
(laughing)

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:39.300
- The one thing is this.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.760
We control the electrodes right now.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.930
The question is can you
control them yourself?

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:44.470
That's why I hesitate.

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:45.720
We haven't got to that point yet

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.357
because you don't wanna
people goin' home and just

01:01:47.357 --> 01:01:48.576
- Well, call me when you get there.

01:01:48.576 --> 01:01:49.743
- zingin' themsevles.

01:01:49.743 --> 01:01:52.010
When we get to that point,
then I'll give you a call.

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:53.888
- So Heather, we're about to lose Brian

01:01:53.888 --> 01:01:54.721
- Oh no.
- out of this segment

01:01:54.721 --> 01:01:56.744
- Forever?
- before we go to our

01:01:56.744 --> 01:01:58.544
sports segment.
- Forever she says.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.810
- Brian, you have any sort of

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.980
concluding reflective thoughts?

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.313
- No.
(laughing)

01:02:06.966 --> 01:02:09.033
(applause)
- And he freely said that.

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:15.390
- Brian, was it Einstein
or John Wheeler who said

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.003
of time, time is invented
to make motion look simple.

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:25.660
- Wheeler said time was
invented so that everything

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.360
doesn't happen at the same moment.

01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:31.411
- That you can spread it out
- Spread it out.

01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:33.140
- in a coordinate system.
- And Einstein said that

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.470
the distinction between
past, present and future

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:38.023
is only an allusion, however persistent.

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:40.624
And on that I'll leave,
thank you very much.

01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:44.107
(laughing)
(applause)

01:02:44.107 --> 01:02:45.774
- Brian.
- Thank you.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.140
- Brian Greene, everybody.
(applause)

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.120
- Great job, man.

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.310
For those of you who are uninitiated,

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:06.770
Playin' with Science is
a sports science mashup.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:11.230
Where Neil likes to say where
jocks and geeks collide.

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:15.933
And I like to say without
any concussions by the geeks

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.850
because when jocks and geeks collide,

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:22.700
only one person suffers in that collision.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.440
- One person walks away.
- One person walks away,

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.060
the other one does not
and normally do this--

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.250
- By the way.
- Go 'head.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.260
- In high school, I was a geek jock.

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.500
- A geek jock?
- Yeah.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.333
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:03:34.262 --> 01:03:35.123
- [Chuck] You were a wrestler.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.340
- But intellectually, I
associated with the geekaverse.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:44.683
But any time I saw a geek
get beaten up or bullied,

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.873
that was my superhero.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.060
The geeks need me and I would go

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.411
(laughing)

01:03:54.411 --> 01:03:56.828
(feet stomp)

01:03:58.425 --> 01:04:02.410
I felt this urge to protect the
geekasphere as high school--

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.620
- What's the superhero name for that?

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.367
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Chuck?

01:04:05.367 --> 01:04:07.100
- But it needs one.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.384
- I believe it's the Tysonator.

01:04:09.384 --> 01:04:11.750
(laughing)

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:12.690
That's very cool.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.820
- So who do you have?
- But before we get

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:19.230
into our guest, who is
(chuckles) just so so so awesome,

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:20.960
actually I'm gonna use a different word,

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.960
who is such a superb guest.
- He said that because

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.010
any time I hear him say awesome,

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:30.050
he said it would be awesome
if you could pass the salt

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:32.900
and I would say, when I
grew up, the word awesome

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:37.570
would apply to curing
polio, walking on the moon

01:04:38.530 --> 01:04:41.510
and there's a next generation
that has no concept

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.730
of how to use that word.
(laughing)

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.363
- And I blame the Lego Movie.
(laughing)

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:50.467
You didn't see it.
- No, I didn't see

01:04:50.467 --> 01:04:51.564
the Lego Movie.

01:04:51.564 --> 01:04:53.794
♪ Everything is awesome ♪

01:04:53.794 --> 01:04:56.044
(laughing)

01:04:58.008 --> 01:04:59.430
- Let me just say, first of all,

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:01.020
I can't tell you how long I been waitin'

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.630
to do that on stage.
(laughing)

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:09.080
But normally this show is
co-hosted with Gary O'Reilly,

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.480
who is a former professional soccer player

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.200
and the co-host of Playing with Science

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.918
and he is currently a broadcaster.

01:05:18.918 --> 01:05:21.470
He resides in the UK.

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:23.600
Unfortunately his flight was canceled

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.797
and so he could not be here.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:28.792
- It was snowing in the UK.
- It was snowing in the UK.

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:31.387
No, it was snowing here.

01:05:31.387 --> 01:05:33.650
Unfortunately he could not be here.

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:35.590
But he is listening right now.

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:38.990
Not right now, but he will be
listening to this broadcast,

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:41.140
so if we could all give
a round of applause

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.173
to Gary O'Reilly.
(applause)

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:55.283
What we do here is we
explore the science of sport.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.400
To help us do that today,
we have an incredible guest

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.953
who is a former Olympic Silver Medalist.

01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.973
She is also, how many times,
how many times was it?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.580
I gotta look at these notes
'cause I wanna get it right.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:19.160
Five time World Champion Medalist.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.820
Please welcome the incredible

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.507
Sasha Cohen.

01:06:24.507 --> 01:06:27.990
(applause)
(audience cheers)

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:30.050
- Hi.
- Hey, good to see you.

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.743
- I'm so excited to join the fun.

01:06:32.743 --> 01:06:34.076
- It's so great.

01:06:37.184 --> 01:06:38.883
- Hop over here.
- Excellent.

01:06:38.883 --> 01:06:42.280
- Have a seat Sasha.
- Chuck, what did she

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.115
get her medals in?

01:06:44.115 --> 01:06:46.200
(laughing)

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.890
- Thank you Neil.
- It's okay.

01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:50.060
- The truth is that I took it for granted

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.264
that everybody would know
because you're Sasha Cohen

01:06:52.264 --> 01:06:54.580
but she is a--
- Luge.

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.356
- Luge.
(laughing)

01:06:56.356 --> 01:06:58.320
- Luge.
- You said luge.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.143
Sasha of course, is a figure skater.

01:07:01.477 --> 01:07:02.310
(applause)

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.647
A damn good one.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.150
And not just a figure skater.

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:11.960
You're also an incredible ballerina

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:16.500
and gymnast, all of those things rolled in

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.600
and then strap skates on and do it all.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.740
- Exactly, I started in gymnastics.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.900
I wanted to take hip
hop, my mom directed me

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.870
towards ballet, figure skating.

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:27.760
- She wanted you to have a job.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:28.593
- Exactly.
- Hey, what are you

01:07:28.593 --> 01:07:30.310
talkin' about, what's wrong with hip hop?

01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:32.560
(laughing)

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.740
- Don't worry, your husband
is still my favorite

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.340
White rapper.
(laughing)

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.753
- White science rapper.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.860
- But go 'head.
- So that was how

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.850
I got started, I started in gymnastics

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:47.870
because I was basically a bundle of energy

01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:49.150
and I destroyed the house.

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.770
They were like how can we calm you down?

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:53.440
So I got put into gymnastics

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.693
for about three hours a day, every day.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.990
When I was five years old,

01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.470
I was doing hundreds of
jumping jacks, push ups, v ups

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:03.430
and when I got home, I was
a very well behaved child.

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:06.614
- A v up, is that this here?
- Are you gonna show me?

01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:09.618
- Oh, this?
- Am I gonna show you?

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:13.174
You're basically like this
and you're goin' up and up.

01:08:13.174 --> 01:08:14.847
- [Neil] Okay cool, very cool.

01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:16.460
- [Sasha] That's a v up.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.967
- That's very impressive,
I gotta tell you right--

01:08:18.967 --> 01:08:23.266
(laughing)
Nah, I'm not.

01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:25.249
You know what, I'm good.
- You good, you good.

01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:27.717
- You got it, you got it.

01:08:27.717 --> 01:08:30.330
It exists in the space time continuum.

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:31.330
Just leave it there.

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.430
- We of course have Heather Berlin here,

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:35.263
Dr. Heather Berlin,

01:08:35.263 --> 01:08:37.330
who is going to break
down the neuroscience

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:40.610
because there's a lotta
neuroscience that goes into

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.310
pretty much every athlete, correct?

01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.850
- Yeah.
- When you talk about

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:46.533
the brain and the discipline.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.480
They call it muscle memory,

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.400
but it really isn't muscle memory.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.710
- It's actually called procedural memory.

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:56.060
Basically when you're first learning,

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.930
and you probably have had this experience,

01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:59.110
the moves or whatever it may be,

01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:00.160
you have to really focus

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.970
and you're using parts of
your prefrontal cortex.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.260
You need conscious focus,

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.270
even learning to tie a
shoelace for the first time.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.410
And then over time, over repetition,

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:10.120
and discipline to do it
all those many times,

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.700
it starts to become
implicit or unconscious

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.530
and it moves into the basil ganglia,

01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:16.660
which is the subcortical part of the brain

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.369
and it becomes this procedural memory.

01:09:19.369 --> 01:09:20.920
- What we call muscle memory.
- Yeah.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.000
And it's like riding a bike.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.230
And then once you get it
into that implicit state,

01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:27.120
if you become too self
aware of what you're doing,

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.393
oh exactly how should
I hit that tennis ball,

01:09:30.352 --> 01:09:31.770
it will mess up your flow.

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:33.740
I imagine that you practice it so much

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.240
that when you go into a routine,

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.170
you're almost going on autopilot.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:38.800
You wanna get to that point

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.440
at which your body knows what it's doing

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.410
and you don't have to think about it.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:42.580
'Cause the thinking messes it up.

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.560
- 'Cause Yogi Berra said it, baseball,

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.909
90% of the game is half mental.

01:09:46.909 --> 01:09:49.010
(laughing)
- That's a good quote.

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:51.060
- No, it's true and I think that's where

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.010
a lot of elite athletes get in trouble.

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:56.220
It's happened to me on several occasions,

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:58.140
is where you train your
body to do something

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.580
over and over and over, but
then you have this one moment

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:04.140
and you're like I can't
leave it to chance.

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.530
So you get your mind involved
because you also have days

01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:09.780
that you're only practicing an hour a day

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.920
once your at competition,

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.070
and then you're just thinking about it

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:14.100
over and over and this one moment arrives

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.870
and it's very hard to
put away the monkey mind

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:18.710
'cause it really wants
to be there to help you,

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:20.340
but it's like too many
cooks in the kitchen.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.110
- Exactly, and when you
turn down that part of,

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:23.683
it's the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:25.549
that's making you self aware.
- There it is.

01:10:25.549 --> 01:10:26.677
- There it is again.
(laughing)

01:10:26.677 --> 01:10:27.970
- And that's the inner critic

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:28.887
and oh my god, what should I do.

01:10:28.887 --> 01:10:30.930
And if you can manage to turn that down,

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:33.540
and just enter into the flow
state and lose yourself,

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.250
that's when you really
perform at your best.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.050
- Exactly.
- You better watch out,

01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:38.806
she'll tell you to sink into the ice.

01:10:38.806 --> 01:10:41.056
(laughing)

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.450
Neil, you, yesterday, actually,

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:49.810
I heard you talkin' to somebody

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.270
at another thing we were doin',

01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:54.660
where you were sayin' that
you skate or you did somethin'

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:57.580
at the ice rink where
you wore figure skates?

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.413
What didn't you do?

01:10:58.413 --> 01:11:01.460
What haven't you done?
- I spent the time

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.493
in high school as a rink guard.

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:05.980
(laughing)
- But not with hockey skates.

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.260
- Not with hockey, I wore figure skates.

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.038
- [Sasha] Which is very unusual.

01:11:09.038 --> 01:11:09.990
Very unusual.
- The rink guard is

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.710
more aggressive

01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:13.714
with hockey skates, but
I had figure skates on.

01:11:13.714 --> 01:11:16.670
(laughing)
I had on figure skates.

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:17.890
- I'm just tryin' to figure this out

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:21.390
and maybe you can tell me.
- That toe pick can hurt you.

01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:22.270
- That's why you had it.

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:24.800
'Cause you're fierce.
- You ever see figure skates?

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.793
There's teeth in the
front of figure skates.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.986
There were some thugs who came on.

01:11:31.986 --> 01:11:32.900
- You were the real deal
- Hockey thugs.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.921
- Who knew figure skatin' was so tough?

01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:36.849
(laughing)

01:11:36.849 --> 01:11:39.030
- They were beefy, thuggy guys,

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:40.630
and rather than fight them,

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.360
I just challenged them to a race,

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.610
from one end of the ice to the other

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:45.910
and everyone parted ways

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:48.100
and they have on hockey skates,

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.200
so they gotta press
their feet left and right

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.120
to go forward.
- Yeah.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.080
- I had on figure skates,
I just went up on my toes

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.889
and just ran.
(laughing)

01:11:57.889 --> 01:11:59.813
And I got to the end,
waitin' for them to come.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.943
They shut up after that.

01:12:04.248 --> 01:12:06.595
So I deeply appreciate your craft.

01:12:06.595 --> 01:12:10.373
- Thank you.
- As a figure skater myself.

01:12:10.373 --> 01:12:13.030
(laughing)

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:16.170
- As a physicist.
- We'll have to do

01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:17.920
the next episode on the rink.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.693
We'll race, we'll race.
- Ooh, yeah.

01:12:20.693 --> 01:12:22.500
- [Heather] Ooh, those
are some fightin' words.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.740
- [Sasha] Take this to the rink.

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.460
- Meet me outside on the rink.

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.173
With figure skates on in a tutu,

01:12:29.526 --> 01:12:31.620
then we'll fight.
- Exactly.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.770
- Are you aware of the physics

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:37.050
because they call figure
skating physics on ice.

01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:38.280
There's so much to it.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.240
Are you aware of the
physics when you're skating?

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.420
Or are you aware of it at all?
- I think you are aware of it,

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:47.650
but you don't think of
it in terms of physics.

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:49.235
The way that you define,

01:12:49.235 --> 01:12:51.050
it's like this hyper body awareness

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:53.470
and you can feel when
you take off for a jump,

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:55.180
if you don't have enough speed,

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.260
if you slightly throw
your shoulder too much

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.750
and you can feel in the
air that you're off kilter

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:02.530
and that you're gonna go down hard.

01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:04.250
And you also know that if you're doin'

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.460
a single, a double, a triple or a quad,

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:08.940
exactly how much torque you have to put in

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.650
when you leave the ice,
'cause that is what determines

01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:14.383
how fast you will rotate and
if you'll be able to complete

01:13:14.383 --> 01:13:16.670
a certain number of
rotations up in the air.

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:20.790
- Torque is a force that
sets something into rotation.

01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:23.550
And otherwise it's just a force

01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:26.175
giving acceleration to an object.

01:13:26.175 --> 01:13:29.310
You have force that
goes in a straight line

01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:30.380
and then you have torque,

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.430
which is a force turning something.

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.363
So there you are, it's
a force you are putting

01:13:34.363 --> 01:13:36.600
between your body, your skate and the ice,

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.320
so that you can rotate.
- To launch it,

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.550
to begin it and the same with spinning.

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:44.860
And that's something you'll
kinda go into a spin slow

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.840
and then you'll glide in
and you'll ride the edge,

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.590
and then you'll take the
right side of your body

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:53.060
and you'll snap it to begin the spin

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.420
and then you'll use your arms and legs

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.210
to increase your speed or slow it down.

01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:00.733
- Oh my god.
(laughing)

01:14:02.951 --> 01:14:05.274
I'm learnin' how to physics skate.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.150
- Physics skate.
- Physics skate,

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:08.211
I'm learnin' how to physics skate.

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:09.219
- [Neil] Did you just invest that word?

01:14:09.219 --> 01:14:10.600
- I did, physics skate.
- Physics skate.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.400
- So here's what I would love to do.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.610
For those of you who are listening

01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.440
and do not have the benefit of visual,

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.120
because everybody is here,
if you could stand up

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.930
and just show us the actual,

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:21.780
but you have to talk it through,

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.680
because people are listening at home,

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.230
- Sure.
- if you could show us

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:25.780
the physicality of what happens

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.710
when you're doing that motion

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:29.920
and then Neil, if you can break down

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.020
exactly what's happening
from a physics standpoint,

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.230
I think that would be really cool.

01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:34.835
I'm makin' this up as I go along.

01:14:34.835 --> 01:14:39.835
(laughing)
(applause)

01:14:39.986 --> 01:14:43.036
- So we can pretend like
we're the Olympic announcers.

01:14:43.036 --> 01:14:43.870
We've got Sasha Cohen.

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.230
- And this is what she's doing.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.063
- This is what she's doing.

01:14:46.063 --> 01:14:47.250
Sasha Cohen, she's wearing high heels

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:48.773
at this moment.
- I am wearing heels.

01:14:48.773 --> 01:14:50.580
I've not done it this way before.

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.550
- So what happens?
- There's two instances.

01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:54.210
There's a jump and a spin.

01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:57.380
I feel like if anyone's
watched any figure skating,

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.740
somewhat aware of the difference.

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.483
One you leave the ice and one you don't.

01:15:01.483 --> 01:15:05.210
The jump, you leave the ice.
(laughing)

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:07.948
- Chuck, you got that?
- I'm keepin' up.

01:15:07.948 --> 01:15:09.680
- We'll start with a jump.
- Stay with us, Chuck.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:13.610
- For instance, I will start with

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.790
a salchow, and so it's something where

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.360
you're gonna take off backwards

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.300
and you're gonna be gliding

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.910
on the inside edge of your left foot

01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:22.500
and you're gonna determine

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.660
how much speed you wanna get going in.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.400
So I'll be doing crossovers and running

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.957
and running, going fast.
- Building your speed.

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:31.373
- Right, and then people
have different entrances.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.020
Many, many, many years
ago, I did a quad salchow

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.530
and I wanted to get extra torque.

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:41.290
So I would do a turn ahead and
then I would set myself here,

01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:44.233
and then I would use the
edge, gliding backwards,

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.040
the right side of my body

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.040
and I would dig in with
my left foot into the ice

01:15:52.150 --> 01:15:57.060
and whip this up and that's
what would initiate the momentum

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.820
and I would leave the ice,
push off this toe pick

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.430
and then immediately snap the
weight over my right side.

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:06.420
And based on how much

01:16:07.552 --> 01:16:10.950
I followed through with my
right arm, and right leg,

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:12.320
and push down with my left,

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.760
would determine how fast I would spin

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.920
and if it would be a
single jump, a double jump,

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.780
a triple jump, or a quad.
- Can I ask you a question?

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.060
The way you've just broke it down

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:23.090
was a very logical, conscious, whatever.

01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:24.970
When you're actually doing that,

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:26.780
you're not thinking all
those things are you.

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.607
Are you feeling them?
- You feel it.

01:16:28.607 --> 01:16:30.810
- You feel it.
- So I think I'm explaining

01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:35.230
exactly what I feel, but it's
like you're very fine tuned.

01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:37.890
You know exactly how much speed you need

01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:40.150
and you know how much speed is too much

01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:41.300
that you'll lose control.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.120
That it could turn out great,
but you have to get lucky

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.930
because basically speed
magnifies anything.

01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:49.730
It helps you get more
height and more torque,

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:53.660
but if you are one millimeter
off in any direction

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.340
and you have extra speed,
you're gonna go down really hard

01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.790
or your alignment won't be quite right.

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:02.193
So people are a little
tentative with speed.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:04.830
You can go up in flames.

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:06.280
It's like putting leverage on your house.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.853
It can work out really well,
or it just can go bust.

01:17:08.853 --> 01:17:09.686
(laughing)

01:17:09.686 --> 01:17:12.573
- Now, finally, somethin' I can relate to.

01:17:12.573 --> 01:17:17.293
- No leverage.
- So Sasha,

01:17:18.604 --> 01:17:21.800
you gave a brilliant
description of how you

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.333
give yourself rotational inertia.

01:17:26.571 --> 01:17:28.890
- [Sasha] For a jump, we
haven't even gotten to the spin.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.220
- To me, in physics, you
generally break things apart

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.380
into components and you
put 'em all together

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.213
for the one thing.

01:17:38.213 --> 01:17:41.163
I break this apart, you
told me how you gain spin,

01:17:42.433 --> 01:17:47.433
but if gonna do a quad, you
have to be airborne long enough

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.890
to complete the quad
before you hit the ground.

01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.980
- Yes, that's part of it.

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.240
Because you'll notice,

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.650
if you've watched figure
skating this past Olympics,

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:58.400
you will see some people
barely get off the ice

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.930
and they can do three turns

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.680
and some people get this high up

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.857
and they don't complete it.
- Two, three feet off the ice.

01:18:04.857 --> 01:18:06.790
- It really is the rotational spin.

01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:10.040
- It's how fast you launch yourself up.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.110
And then obviously it goes
into what's you're body type,

01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:15.670
do you have wide hips,
how fast are you spinning?

01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:17.880
And that's why men rotate faster

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.300
and generally do a lot
more quads than women do.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.143
They spin faster, they've
got narrower hips.

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:25.750
But women are more flexible,

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.320
so we've got better spiral sequences.

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.970
- How many women have done quads?

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.690
- A couple have done it in practice

01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:34.790
and I feel like maybe
one or two have done it

01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:36.650
in competition.
- And you've done a quad?

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:39.120
- I have, a long time ago.
(applause)

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:39.953
Long time ago.

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.978
Thankfully, YouTube exists,
and it will always live there.

01:18:45.978 --> 01:18:49.200
(laughing)
I'll be like wow,

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.110
I used to do that.

01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:53.003
Now I just sit.
(laughing)

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.090
- People must've freaked out.

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:01.446
Did the announcer lose his shit?

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:04.240
(laughing)
- It was an exciting moment

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.410
because people can see
when you get really close,

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:07.910
or you're double footed or you step out,

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:08.990
but when you actually do it

01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:11.960
and you come down from four turns

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.060
and you have to have tremendous amount

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.370
of strength and balance to catch yourself

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:19.430
when you come down, get out
and so it's this moment.

01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:21.165
Uh, is she gonna do it?

01:19:21.165 --> 01:19:22.070
Is she gonna do it?

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:24.685
And you have it and it's very exciting.

01:19:24.685 --> 01:19:27.172
- It was exciting watching
you just do it in heels.

01:19:27.172 --> 01:19:28.820
(laughing)
- It's an extra layer.

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:29.653
- So there's the launch

01:19:29.653 --> 01:19:30.720
and the landing, that both matter.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.860
- Yes, so when I train,

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:35.980
you'd work on explosive
muscles for bounce.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:40.150
And then also I would jump
down off of boxes this high

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:44.300
in order to learn how to
absorb all that pressure

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.640
and momentum coming down.
- You do that with

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.120
the skates on?
- Off ice training,

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.513
I do it without skates.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.546
And then on the ice, with skates.

01:19:54.546 --> 01:19:56.905
(laughing)

01:19:56.905 --> 01:20:00.917
- Thanks Sasha.
- No problem, no problem.

01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:02.280
Did wanna keep it clear.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.030
No misunderstandings.

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.390
But then let me get to a spin.

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:10.390
'cause a spin's very different,

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:12.280
'cause you're not launching yourself out

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.120
and it's something that
goes for much longer.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.923
It's not fractions of a second.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.273
A spin can be 30 seconds,
it can be a minute.

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.953
You'll see most people wind backwards.

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.350
It's all about torque in the body

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:29.210
and this is why I realize
I'm a terrible skier

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:33.080
because it's the opposite.
- They're winding the spring.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.850
- You're winding.
- To send it out.

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:36.910
- So my hips are going to the left

01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:38.690
and my shoulders are going to the right,

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:41.633
lotta abs, lotta abs.
- Core work.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.500
- So then you step in and
you ride this outside edge

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.500
and then again, you do the
same with momentum for a jump,

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.873
except you don't take
off and then you spin.

01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:55.022
Generally, if I wasn't in heels,

01:20:55.022 --> 01:20:56.553
(applause)
I could do more spins.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.707
Once you're there,
you'll keep this momentum

01:21:00.707 --> 01:21:04.320
and then as I would bring
in my arms and my legs,

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:07.870
I can just insanely increase
the speed of my spin

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:11.430
and likewise, if all the sudden,
I wanted to slow it down,

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:12.570
I would just open up.

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:16.020
And you would see the rotations
just kind of almost stop.

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.350
In that way, I was aware of physics,

01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:20.900
but for figure skaters, we
would think about it more

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:24.640
in terms of body awareness
of where your hips are,

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.710
what torque you need.

01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:27.240
- Plus you have to look good doin' it.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.567
- Yes.
- 'Cause you're bein' judged--

01:21:28.567 --> 01:21:30.194
- And what color you look good in.

01:21:30.194 --> 01:21:31.470
(laughing)
- Right, right.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:35.810
There are other dimensions of
the analysis of the scores.

01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:36.710
- [Sasha] Exactly.

01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:42.696
- Can you tell us what is
happening when she does that?

01:21:42.696 --> 01:21:43.896
- Oh, the physics, yeah.

01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:50.050
Gonna take my shoes off.
- I wanna see your spin.

01:21:52.773 --> 01:21:53.909
- For those of you listening,

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.840
Neil is taking off his shoes.
- She kept her heels on.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.313
- And putting on Sasha' heels.

01:21:59.963 --> 01:22:02.870
- [Sasha] Cinderella,
does it fit, does it fit?

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:04.800
- All I could tell you is this,

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.113
Prince Charmin' is never comin' back.

01:22:07.113 --> 01:22:09.363
(laughing)

01:22:10.704 --> 01:22:12.371
- [Sasha] Thank you.

01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:17.050
- In physics, here's the deal.

01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:21.143
If you set yourself rotating,
so I'll do that right now.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.310
Here I am rotating,

01:22:25.934 --> 01:22:27.540
(applause)
at a speed.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.727
Wait, don't applaud yet.

01:22:28.727 --> 01:22:31.159
You don't know what's about to come.

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:33.407
(laughing)

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:35.920
- So you just spun around.
- You can calculate

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.530
how much angular.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.550
You might remember from
your physics class,

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.610
everything that happens in a straight line

01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:47.653
you can think of in a rotation.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.240
There's a force, the rotational
counterpart is torque.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.550
There is mass, the rotational counterpart

01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:57.573
is moment of inertia.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:05.520
You also have momentum and
the rotational counterpart

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.700
is just angular momentum.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.100
So here's the thing.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.743
Once you start rotating, your
angular momentum is constant.

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.053
It's constant, so if I start spinning,

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.520
you calculate the angular
momentum by, here it is.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.650
It is

01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:22.483
the

01:23:22.483 --> 01:23:25.320
mass

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.561
of whatever your body is.

01:23:27.561 --> 01:23:29.540
(laughing)
- Which in this case

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.893
would be the biggest figure skater ever.

01:23:31.893 --> 01:23:34.143
(laughing)

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:40.090
- Here's the point.

01:23:43.913 --> 01:23:44.746
Your hands have a certain mass

01:23:44.746 --> 01:23:46.470
and they're rotating out at this distance.

01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:48.680
So you have part of your body mass

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.853
away from your axis of rotation.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.330
You can calculate how much
angular momentum that is.

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:59.360
Now watch, if I bring any part of my body

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.823
closer to my axis of rotation,

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.883
then one of the terms in
your angular momentum drops.

01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:15.550
What happens is the distance
to your axis of rotation drops.

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:18.150
But your angular momentum stays the same,

01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:20.394
so somethin' has to increase.

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:23.238
- Ohh.
(applause)

01:24:23.238 --> 01:24:24.322
- Because when you multiply
- Bing.

01:24:24.322 --> 01:24:25.841
- these two numbers, you have to get

01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:27.840
the same answer every time.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.760
If I start changing the
distance of the mass of my body

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.430
to my axis and I make it
smaller, I have to spin up.

01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:35.663
- Nice.
- Nice.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.953
- Allow me?
- Yes.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.853
- I will spin, and then.
(applause)

01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:45.763
Just like she said.

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.010
You're spinning, you speed
up, but then you can stop it.

01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:53.380
By just putting your mass back out.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.630
- Slow it down.
- Here's my proposal to you.

01:24:57.455 --> 01:24:59.950
(laughing)

01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:00.850
Put your arms out.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.600
You're my skating physics
demo in this moment.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.100
You have a certain amount
of mass coming out here.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:09.740
- For those listening, right now,

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.470
Sasha has her arms--
- T shape.

01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:13.370
- Spread apart,
- Spread, apart, yes.

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:16.460
- in a t formation and go 'head.

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.250
- Exactly, so there's a
certain amount of mass

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:20.150
along your arm and in your hands.

01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:22.750
And you also showed earlier
when you started spinning,

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.030
you might start with your leg out.

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:27.030
And then when you bring your leg closer in

01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:29.240
towards your axis of rotation,

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.573
you start spinning faster.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.293
So we got this.

01:25:33.645 --> 01:25:35.055
Oh, this an infinity on your wrist.

01:25:35.055 --> 01:25:36.642
- It is.
- Very cool.

01:25:36.642 --> 01:25:38.511
(laughing)

01:25:38.511 --> 01:25:42.060
It's an infinity tattoo.
- Yes, that is

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:45.850
an infinity tattoo.
(laughing)

01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:46.683
- Sorry.

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:51.600
Here's my suggestion, I
don't know if it's legal.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.490
Next time you do this, I
think you can do a quint.

01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:58.245
Is there such a word?
- There is such a word.

01:25:58.245 --> 01:25:59.660
- A quint, five turns.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:00.620
Now how would you do that?

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:05.564
I'm gonna say, you get some
lead weight to put in your hand.

01:26:05.564 --> 01:26:08.473
(laughing)

01:26:08.473 --> 01:26:10.073
- It's Tom Brady all over again.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:12.750
Tom Brady of ice skating.

01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:18.730
- When you start spinning with
lead weights in your hand,

01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:20.880
even if you're spinning at the same speed

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.070
that you once were, you have more mass

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:26.380
farther away from your rotation axis.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.170
So that as you then
bring the more mass in,

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:30.533
you will spin faster.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.050
People will notice if
you're grabbing somethin'

01:26:34.050 --> 01:26:37.310
to hold on to somethin'.
- Whoa, what's goin on?

01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:39.280
- As you skate around the rink

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.382
with two kettle bells in your hand.

01:26:41.382 --> 01:26:45.185
(laughing)
- It's a little obvious.

01:26:45.185 --> 01:26:47.814
- Just get really heavy rings.

01:26:47.814 --> 01:26:49.890
Really heavy rings.
- Bracelet,

01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:52.100
and lead infuse the wrist bracelet

01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:57.100
and it's just your jewelry.
- Meanwhile, I build up huge--

01:26:57.205 --> 01:26:59.580
(laughing)

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.790
- So what I'm sayin' is, if you did that,

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:06.160
the same gestures, you will spin faster

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.010
and you'll have to land, you
have to figure out the landing.

01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:11.680
(laughing)

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.673
- I'm gonna throw this back to you.

01:27:13.673 --> 01:27:14.506
- What's that?
- For spinning,

01:27:14.506 --> 01:27:16.169
this would absolutely work,

01:27:16.169 --> 01:27:17.960
and it would give me more
torque and momentum when I spin.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.380
But I think the extra weight,

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:23.490
would not allow me to get
up as high in the air,

01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:26.410
and so even if I got extra
torque when I pulled in,

01:27:26.410 --> 01:27:29.231
I would still not be able
to rotate as many times.

01:27:29.231 --> 01:27:30.653
- Need to think about this.
- We need to work on this.

01:27:30.653 --> 01:27:31.493
You need to work on this.
- It's a trade off.

01:27:32.852 --> 01:27:34.638
(applause)
Have to think about that.

01:27:34.638 --> 01:27:37.830
- Good thing to think about.
- Gotta think about that.

01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:41.010
This is one of the
interesting physics problems

01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:44.660
where there are two variables
competing with one another

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.100
and you don't know if one is
more powerful than the other

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:51.160
or where they meet, to get
the best combination of both.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.380
That's where you get more the interesting,

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.820
complex problems in physics and in life.

01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:57.050
- I have a neuroscience problem here.

01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:58.473
That I can address.
- What's that?

01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:01.840
- [Heather] Why don't you get dizzy

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.930
when doing all of this--
- Oh yeah.

01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:06.080
What's up with that?
- I have an explanation

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.880
for that.
- You know Chuck,

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:10.510
if we did that, we'd be like bleh.

01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:11.595
(laughing)

01:28:11.595 --> 01:28:13.067
- Are you kiddin' me?
- 'Cause they're going around

01:28:13.067 --> 01:28:14.283
- and around and around
- I'm dizzy right now.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.716
- There's actually a
neuroscientific explanation

01:28:17.716 --> 01:28:19.620
for that question.
- It's interesting.

01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:23.460
For jumping, it happens
in a fraction of a second

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.840
and you don't get dizzy,
it's just very quick.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.410
But spinning is something where ballet

01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:30.877
and skating really diverge.

01:28:30.877 --> 01:28:33.550
If you're a ballerina, you're spotting

01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:36.570
to the edge of the room and
that's how you're keeping

01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:38.351
your awareness.
- And by spotting, you mean,

01:28:38.351 --> 01:28:39.971
you pick a spot,
- You pick a spot.

01:28:39.971 --> 01:28:41.773
- and you turn your head
- and you turn and you turn.

01:28:41.773 --> 01:28:42.860
- very quickly back to that spot.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.220
- That prevents you from getting dizzy?

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:46.204
- For ballet.
- For ballet.

01:28:46.204 --> 01:28:47.037
- This is what ballerinas do.

01:28:47.037 --> 01:28:49.960
They always spot, but for figure skaters,

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.960
you're spinning so fast and
you're not doing one, one, one.

01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:58.400
You're literally doing,
I don't know, 50 turns

01:28:59.996 --> 01:29:03.010
and the trick is you have
to stay in the same center.

01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:05.523
So about one to two blade length.

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.470
I think it's something to
do with your inner ear,

01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:10.110
that if you're not traveling,

01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:12.040
and you're staying in the same spot,

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.230
even though you're spinning,

01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:16.460
you don't get dizzy, but
from personal experience,

01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:18.710
when you do a spin and you do a bad spin,

01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:20.190
which you would get a deduction for,

01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:22.590
and you're traveling, so
you kind of start here

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.610
and I end up off stage,
- That would be bad.

01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:26.830
- you get out of the spin
and it's like a cartoon,

01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:28.900
where you see the stars
and you're just like

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:31.950
what, where am I, and so
that's why they teach you

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.090
have your center and don't travel.

01:29:34.090 --> 01:29:37.363
So explain that inner ear
to me in neuroscience terms.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:43.870
- Your inner ear consists of
these three fluid filled tubes.

01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:46.790
And each one is at a
different orientation,

01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:49.330
so it's meant to be sensitive
to a different orientation.

01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:51.750
Let's say if your head
goes up, yes, like this,

01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:55.094
or no, or side to side
and within those fluid--

01:29:55.094 --> 01:29:56.599
- These are the three dimensions of space.

01:29:56.599 --> 01:29:57.432
- Yeah, the three dimensions,

01:29:57.432 --> 01:29:59.150
and they're represented
within your inner ear

01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:01.800
in these little tubes.

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.770
Within each of these fluid filled tubes

01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:06.650
are these little hairs that are sensing.

01:30:06.650 --> 01:30:09.020
It's almost like seaweed
at the bottom of the ocean.

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:13.090
So when you move, it senses and
sends signals to your brain.

01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:14.410
If you think about if you're in a chair,

01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:17.020
let's say, spinning, and you're
holding a bottle of water,

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:18.930
and you're spinning in this swivel chair

01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:21.700
and then you stop, the
water is gonna keep going,

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:23.030
'cause it builds up momentum

01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:25.570
and the same thing is
happening in your inner ear.

01:30:25.570 --> 01:30:28.230
It's tellin' your brain
you're still moving.

01:30:28.230 --> 01:30:29.943
That's why people get dizzy.

01:30:31.807 --> 01:30:33.320
- That's why when you stop spinning,

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.530
you fall over 'cause you
can't keep your balance,

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:36.630
'cause your brain didn't figure out

01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:37.810
that you stopped spinning.
- It thinks you're

01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:40.180
still moving, but then,
there's also information.

01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.013
- There's information coming

01:30:41.013 --> 01:30:42.585
to your brain
- The brain's so stupid.

01:30:42.585 --> 01:30:44.835
(laughing)

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.050
- But your muscles are
telling you stuff as well.

01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:49.700
There's proprioceptive input.

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.530
And there's also visual
input giving you information.

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.621
- [Neil] What kind of
input was the muscle input?

01:30:54.621 --> 01:30:56.853
- Proprioceptive.
- Proprio--

01:30:56.853 --> 01:30:58.275
- Proprioceptive.
- Proprioceptive.

01:30:58.275 --> 01:31:01.350
- Like proprioception.
- Oh, that cleared it up.

01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:03.230
(laughing)

01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:05.659
- [Sasha] I've heard of that word before.

01:31:05.659 --> 01:31:07.577
- Yeah, it's proprioceptive,

01:31:07.577 --> 01:31:10.420
you know, like proprioception.

01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:13.612
We good now, alright, we good.
- We gotta move on.

01:31:13.612 --> 01:31:15.710
You're holding us up.

01:31:15.710 --> 01:31:17.310
- It signals that tell your bodies

01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:18.920
its awareness in space.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.230
Your brain is getting that information

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:21.570
from you muscles and your joints,

01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:23.220
the inner ear is telling
you you're still moving

01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:24.840
and your eyes are giving you information.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.030
So that's why they often say,

01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:28.040
and tell me if they say this to you,

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.310
when you come outta the spin,

01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:30.610
different than ballerinas who focus

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:31.560
each time they make a turn,

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.230
but you then are told to
focus at a specific point,

01:31:34.230 --> 01:31:36.580
'cause you wanna have your
eyes telling your brain

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.460
counteracting what your
inner ear is telling it

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.770
that it's still moving, that
you're not moving any longer.

01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:44.770
And also what you do, I'm
sure, is you practice off ice

01:31:44.770 --> 01:31:47.380
just spinning so that
your brain can habituate.

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.680
It's not so much that you're spinning

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.170
in one place versus moving,

01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:51.700
although the movement is gonna cause it

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.533
to be more confusing

01:31:52.533 --> 01:31:53.830
'cause there's moving
in different directions,

01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:56.030
so it'll be less of a movement
if you're in one space,

01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:57.550
but that's not what I think is happening.

01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:59.680
I think you habituate 'cause you practice.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.610
- [Chuck] So your brain just
becomes acclimated to spinning.

01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:03.850
- Only so much though,

01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:05.770
'cause it's still a physiological affect.

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:07.980
- And what you'll see figure skaters do is

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:10.860
they'll spin very fast,
and then they'll slow down

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:14.235
and they slow down, they're
kinda getting their bearings.

01:32:14.235 --> 01:32:16.070
- And they're readjusting.
- So you're easing yourself

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:17.624
out of it.
- Exactly and then there's

01:32:17.624 --> 01:32:19.210
a trick move that you do.

01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:21.140
You spin really, really, really fast

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.023
and you stop.

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:26.099
You do it to the music, like ba bam.

01:32:26.099 --> 01:32:27.888
- And it gives you a moment.
- You give yourself a second

01:32:27.888 --> 01:32:28.947
and then you're like look at my arm now.

01:32:30.171 --> 01:32:32.790
(laughing)
You have the choreography

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:36.460
built in, we have these
breathers after a spin.

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:40.380
- Sasha is it true that your
fastest spin in any performance

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:42.490
is this spin you end on?

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:45.270
So you don't have to be graceful
and balance-y after that.

01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:47.200
- It's true, people generally do

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.200
their more strenuous wham,
bam, hit every position.

01:32:52.526 --> 01:32:54.880
It's very dramatic at the very end,

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.710
also because it takes up a lotta energy

01:32:56.710 --> 01:33:00.120
and you wanna get your
jumping passes in earlier.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.880
Although you're seeing
that change now a lot

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.040
with the new judging system,

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.130
where you're getting rewarded
and getting more points

01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:07.250
if you jump after the halfway mark.

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:09.200
But generally, you wanna end on a big note

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.270
and so people will do combination spins

01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:13.620
where you hit six different positions.

01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:15.200
You're in a camel, you're in a sit spin,

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.360
you're in a lay back, and
then you're on the other foot

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.048
and your leg's up,

01:33:19.048 --> 01:33:20.671
so there's a lot goin on.
- It's like the fireworks.

01:33:20.671 --> 01:33:21.916
Like a fireworks finale.
- It is, exactly,

01:33:21.916 --> 01:33:23.620
it's a finale, it's a fireworks finale.

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.063
- Put 'em all up there.

01:33:25.063 --> 01:33:26.650
Put 'em all.
- This one, that one,

01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:29.428
ooh that one too.
- Smiley face, oh.

01:33:29.428 --> 01:33:31.670
- Everything you got, throw it at the end.

01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:32.890
- So Heather, let me ask you this,

01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:34.440
'cause we're almost outta time.

01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:39.600
Why is it that from a
neurological standpoint

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.130
that that is our first kind
of foray into getting high?

01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:46.668
You see children spin around, spin around,

01:33:46.668 --> 01:33:48.185
(Heather chuckles)
and then they just like

01:33:48.185 --> 01:33:53.185
oh, I am messed up, man.
(laughing)

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.280
What is happening there?
- A lot of what drugs do

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.410
is they kind of play with your senses.

01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:02.310
So normally we have input
coming in from our senses

01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:04.820
and our brain is organizing
it in a certain way.

01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.580
But when you kind of mess with your senses

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:07.930
in the way the brain is interpreting them,

01:34:07.930 --> 01:34:10.410
that's also what drugs tend to do.

01:34:10.410 --> 01:34:13.140
It's interesting, 'cause
it's a different brain state.

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.910
And it's not just your
inner ear, by the way.

01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:17.610
That information goes
through that little brain

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:19.889
in the back of your brain, the cerebellum,

01:34:19.889 --> 01:34:20.722
it's right in the back of your neck,

01:34:20.722 --> 01:34:21.960
and what's interesting is that

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:25.463
that has two times as many
neurons as your entire brain.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.613
Two times as many neurons.
- Twice.

01:34:29.671 --> 01:34:34.185
(laughing)
(hands slap)

01:34:34.185 --> 01:34:36.500
- It's two, two,
- Twice.

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.730
- Two times as many neurons.
- It's unconscious.

01:34:39.730 --> 01:34:43.470
And people who have complete
damage to the cerebellum

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.530
they are still fully conscious and aware.

01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:46.690
They might have less coordination,

01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:48.760
they can't do triple axles and things

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.540
but they're fully conscious and aware,

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:54.470
so we only need basically
1/3 of our neurons

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:55.850
to have conscious awareness,

01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:57.540
but it's interesting how much

01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:00.483
goes into that ability to have balance.

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.030
I think the reason why it feels good

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.760
is that we like different sensations.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.500
We like to be outside of our normal,

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.290
even dream states or creative
states or day dreaming.

01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:12.220
When we're not in that normal state,

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.440
where the prefrontal cortex is on

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.120
and everything's working properly,

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.030
it's fun, it's interesting.

01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:17.560
That's why we like to go on rollercoasters

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.650
or rides that make us feel weird.

01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:20.890
- Sasha, when you're performing,

01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:22.400
you're in an altered mental state,

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.770
according to this.
- Maybe that's why

01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:27.649
I became a figure skater.
(laughing)

01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:29.253
The world is gonna be too much.

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.030
I need to skate for 20 years.
- That's why you drink

01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:34.593
before competitions.
- Shhh.

01:35:36.118 --> 01:35:38.990
(laughing)
That was our secret.

01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:41.093
- That is it for Playing with Science.

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:43.955
Please give it up for Dr. Heather Berlin.

01:35:43.955 --> 01:35:46.190
(applause)

01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:48.103
Olympic Medalist Sasha Cohen.

01:35:49.693 --> 01:35:53.026
The inhibitable Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.123
I've been your host for
Playin' with Science.

01:35:58.026 --> 01:36:00.590
Also please give it up for Gary O'Reilly,

01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:04.430
who is not here and our
catchphrase is this.

01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:07.230
If you play with fire, you get burned.

01:36:07.230 --> 01:36:10.145
You play with science, you get learned.

01:36:10.145 --> 01:36:11.600
(laughing)

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.735
- Suck on that how.

01:36:12.735 --> 01:36:14.930
BAM, get home safely.

01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:16.339
Have a good night.

01:36:16.339 --> 01:36:19.089
(ethereal music)
