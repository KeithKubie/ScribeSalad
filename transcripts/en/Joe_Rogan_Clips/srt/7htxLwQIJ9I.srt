1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,520
Um, do you take anything else that, uh,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,210
is notable? Well, I can run you through
it. Sure. I'm on the lipid note.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,830
A statin for costume. I've been
understanding since I was in my twenties.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,660
Whoa. Yeah. Hmm. Uh, that
stuff's fucking terrible for you.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,800
Right.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,800
So my good friend and colleague George
Church at Harvard told me I'm killing

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,890
myself, but I have really
high cholesterol, my family
genetically. Genetically.

8
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:32,580
Yeah. And um, does your family have a
history of heart disease because of this?

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,250
Yeah. So my grandmother, um,

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,940
at least according to her had a stroke
in her thirties, and then yeah, it's,

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,490
it's bad. So I'm fighting
bad Ashkenazi Jew jeans here.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,800
That's crazy. She'd been on
them since you're in your 20s,

13
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,290
that's in your thin man.
If anybody looked at you,

14
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:53,010
they would never think that you'd have
an issue. Yeah. It's unfortunate. Um,

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,300
but I'm a doctor's worst nightmare.
First of all. I teach them,

16
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,050
so I know what they're like. Uh, but
also when I go into the doctor's office,

17
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:05,730
I say, here's what we should be doing
or you should be doing to me. And I saw,

18
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,830
I went in my twenties and I said,
I want to go on a statin.

19
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:12,060
And this is in the days when statens
weren't well studied. And my doctor said,

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,740
but you're not old.
And I said,

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,270
I don't want to wait until I'm old and
sick to get this medicine. I need it now.

22
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:22,500
And I fought the doctor for the doctor
and eventually he prescribed it and my

23
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,440
cholesterol came down. Uh,
I'm the same with dentists.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,010
I went to the dentist a few months
ago and I said, I want my teeth fixed,

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,270
my two front teeth. And she said, they
find normal wear and tear. And I said,

26
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,340
I don't care what's normal,
fixed my teeth.

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,190
Get them back to how I was when I was 20.
No, we don't do that. We don't do that.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,420
Well, you did my daughter right
last week. Yeah, but she's young.

29
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:45,850
She's got a future like,
oh, little say hell done.

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,780
Don't be ages wrong with your teeth.
Although wearing out.

31
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,460
And I hated feeling that worn out. I'm
wearing now. You don't get that way.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,020
Uh, just getting shorter and flatter.
And what the fuck you eating rocks? Yeah.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,680
I must be the Australian Diet.

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,440
A lot of sand in your food.
Yeah. So I said to her,

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,750
I thought you were one of the world's
best dentists. And she said, okay fine,

36
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,560
I'll do it, but don't play
me if it doesn't work. Um,

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,210
and so she works well. She was worried
that it might snap off for now.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,570
She's putting a cap on you. Yeah,
she's extending my two front teeth,

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,300
which is normal. Like people
get caps all the time. I,

40
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:29,940
well it's not a cap itself actually just
material stuck to the tip right there.

41
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,180
Just on the tip.
It's also like if you had a chip too,

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,060
they would do that instead
of replace the actual team.

43
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:38,400
That's what I did to my daughter. And I
said to that, to me, that looks great.

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,090
And she said, no, no, no. Finally she
said, okay, but it's your problem.

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,520
You got to pay for it. Fine. Uh,

46
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,090
and she did it and she actually said
at the end of it, this is great.

47
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,010
I might offer this as a
procedure to other patients, but,

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,660
but my point is not about teeth.
It's the medical profession is ages.

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,250
They give young people certain treatments
because they're young and they don't

50
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,084
give them to the old,

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,270
but then they don't give the young people
the treatments that they need before

52
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,860
they get old as wacky.

53
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,920
I had a similar thing happened
with a torn meniscus. I have a,

54
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:14,140
a minor meniscus tear and uh,
the guy told me,

55
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:18,550
well if you are young, they would stitch
it up and hope that it would heal.

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm like, what the fuck does that
mean? I go, everything works good.

57
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,860
Like what is different? What is the
difference between me and a younger body?

58
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:31,120
They, and he said something
about blood flow, you have
more blood flow. And I said,

59
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,030
look, I'm not a doctor but that
doesn't make any sense. I go,

60
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,760
I'm working out all the time. There's
a lot of blood going through there.

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,160
Like what the fuck is happening?
And I'm like,

62
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,380
let's just shoot some stem cells
in there and see what's up.

63
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:46,140
Cause they wanted to do
um, meniscus. Uh, you know,

64
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,750
uh, what does admit menace
copy, whatever they call it,

65
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,440
when they cut some of the meniscus
out and I'm like, Eh, let's just,

66
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,940
let's just try, it's totally working.
Like A, I don't have any pain in it now.

67
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,093
So,
um,

68
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,370
I think there's a weird thing that they
do do when you get to a certain age,

69
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,850
you're like, Eh, like I have a friend
who was a torn ACL and they essentially,

70
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:11,350
he's in his fifties, late fifties, and
they essentially told him not to fix it.

71
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,340
I go, Hey fucker, get it fixed. What
are you crazy? And I have a wobbly knee.

72
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,630
And they're like, well, they told me
if I was younger, I fuck that doctor.

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,860
Go get that thing fixed. He's like, well,
how the recovery time, like shut up.

74
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,600
You just recover. You just, you're
alive. A year goes by, it's fixed.

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,910
Just stop. Just go get it fixed. Yeah.

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,590
See that's the problem with today's
society because we think a 50 year old is

77
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,040
Dale that's dead. That's
BS. 50 is still very young.

78
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,350
Actually there are 78 70 year old,
80 year olds.

79
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,470
Even nine year olds still playing
tennis loving life. That's,

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,360
that's just the beginning
of what's coming.

81
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,910
If you maintain activity that
that seems to be the key. The,

82
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,410
the really hard thing is when someone's
in their 50s and they want to get in

83
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,950
shape now and they haven't
been active their whole life,

84
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:01,150
that seems to be a problem. Their DVD
is scratched up. Yes. How'd you go back?

85
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,940
It can be done though.

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,460
I did see a guy who was 58 years old who
started running marathons at 58 in his

87
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,260
seventies he's running sub three
hour marathons and he looks great.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,430
So it just,

89
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,370
he just had to take his time and really
be dedicated and watch his diet and

90
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:23,080
nutrition and next thing you know,
this guy's an elite marathon runner.

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,490
It is doable. What we find in the lab
is if we treat mice early in life,

92
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,130
it gives them the battle much
better life. Spanish. Sure.

93
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,020
So don't ever leave it too late.

94
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,850
Well you see that with
athletes like athletes that
were fit when they were young

95
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,060
and never lost it.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,130
You really maintained and stayed
in the gym and stayed active.

97
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,770
You see them in their 50s and even
in their sixties looking great.

98
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,080
Whereas you know,
it's just once your body deteriorates,

99
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:53,270
it's very difficult to bring it back.
But if you maintain,

100
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,950
it seems like there's people today that
are doing that and it's much more common.

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,860
If you go to a gym, for
instance, go to a nice gym,

102
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,920
you'll see a lot of folks that are in
their sixties and seventies that are

103
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,640
really active and they're there all the
time and the regulars at the gym and

104
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:12,410
they look great. They do so much. My
father is a, is a prime example of that.

105
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,310
So he's in Australia and he's been taking
care of his body since he was in his

106
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,700
early forties. Probably a
little too late, but still, uh,

107
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,950
he's been taking some in a man and his
metformin for awhile, resveratrol. Um,

108
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,030
but he's been active. That's the key I
think. And then, uh, so that combination,

109
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,980
so he's now just turning 80 this year.
You would think that he's 30, if you,

110
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,040
if you didn't know his age and he's
running around and my mother passed away

111
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,710
from cancer, so he's, he's dating
women. He's out every night.

112
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,560
He's traveling the world now.
This is the future for,

113
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,810
for people in their eighties. Um,
he started a new career, uh, at 80.

114
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,380
Uh, it was at uh, 76. What's
he doing? He got bored, um,

115
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,870
till he retired at 67.

116
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,710
Thought he hadn't now the 10 years of
good life and he kept going and going,

117
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,990
going. His friends are getting
frail. He's still active.

118
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,380
So he went back and he's working at
Sydney University on the ethics panel for

119
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,650
clinical trials and other studies and
that's what you want older people with

120
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:17,600
wisdom and knowledge to do, to give
back. That sounds good too. Like for you,

121
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,590
you get your dad hopped up on
all these awesome new drugs.

122
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:26,240
Then you get them working on the ethics
panel for clinical studies and then you

123
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:31,220
get them to give you some death row
patients so you can try it on. Right.

124
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,730
Ethics, you're onto me. Yes, I
know what you're doing now, man.

125
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,640
You're wiggling the system a little
bit with your, keep it in the family.

126
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:40,520
Hyper active, super healthy dad. Right.

127
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,240
Well I don't recommend anything even to
my family, but they end up to manding it.

128
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,260
My brother was pretty upset that
we weren't giving him any. Well,

129
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,170
it seems like it's working out
really well for your father.

130
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,760
I mean seems Metformin,
the Nmm and a,

131
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:59,360
what else is he taking a,
he's also on a Staton uh,

132
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,870
and he exercises that's the main,

133
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:04,100
so he's understanding as well because he
has the same PR predisposed condition,

134
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:07,730
you know? Right. Yeah. That's an awful
condition, man. That that may mean.

135
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:11,000
One of the things that I was talking
to my doctor about was saying that,

136
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,280
that there are people that just have
high blood pressure or higher, you know,

137
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,300
higher blood pressure or higher instances
of heart disease in their family and

138
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:25,160
it's just a really unfortunate
genetic issue. Uh, it is,

139
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,170
it is. But fortunately we were able to
tackle heart disease pretty well. Yeah.

140
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,000
These days with blood pressure,
drugs, cholesterol, drugs.

141
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,740
There were some side
effects in a question,

142
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,700
but what we're talking about with these
longevity drugs that are in development

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,420
is that sure you can be prescribed this
medicine for your Alzheimer's or a few

144
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,460
or liver disease,
but as a side effect,

145
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,770
it'll keep the rest of
your body healthy as well,

146
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,780
protect you against cancer
and all these other things.

147
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,060
That's what's so radical
about what we're doing.
