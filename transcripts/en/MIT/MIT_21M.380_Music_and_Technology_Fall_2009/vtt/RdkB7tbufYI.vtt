00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.631
PROFESSOR: So first
up, we're going

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.130
to go around, do a
couple of things.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.430
We'll just go in pairs.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.910
We'll try these out, so
you two can come up first.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.860
We'll start off with one
of our basic principles

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.010
of electromagnetism, which
is that we can spin metal

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.010
in a magnetic field
and produce current.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.730
So let's hook up our
little motor to an LED

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.910
and see if we can make
our motor into a dynamo.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.418
OK, so it works.

00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:02.679
It's not easy, but it works.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.220
We're using a motor
in reverse, we're

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.920
spinning metal in
a magnetic field

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.130
and producing some current
to light up our LED.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.290
There we go.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.630
Now, let's plug in this
to our amplifiers and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.630
try to re-do our
telharmonium light.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.450
So it's the turn of the century.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.380
It's around 1900.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.615
You're Cahill, and you're like
I need a way to produce sound.

00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:29.240
I need the way to
create an oscillator.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.115
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:32.610
PROFESSOR: Who
would have thought

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.151
that this is the
best way to do this.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.720
STUDENT: That's what
my dad's [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:48.007
PROFESSOR: We need
definitely some way

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.930
to spin this faster
so we can get a tone.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.986
But you can hear that if it were
spinning at some constant rate

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:53.870
you could get--

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.542
STUDENT: This motor
has less resistance

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:57.466
so it continues to get a tone.

00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:59.773
That motor's tighter,
but so you just--

00:01:59.773 --> 00:02:01.314
STUDENT: It's got
a better motor now.

00:02:06.507 --> 00:02:07.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.410
Can it work as a
musical instrument?

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.345
STUDENT: Sure, whatever.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:10.860
PROFESSOR: What
would we need to do?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.740
If you wanted it to make a--

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.531
STUDENT: You need two
interfaces, for sure.

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.790
PROFESSOR: Two parameters.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.590
STUDENT: Maybe if
I twiddle those--

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.860
STUDENT: I got all these
parameters right here.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.837
STUDENT: Add volume
with the turntables.

00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:22.420
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.915
STUDENT: Oh yeah.

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:23.456
Sounds great.

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:32.815
STUDENT: And you could light
it up at the same time.

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:35.106
PROFESSOR: OK, next up.

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:35.880
OK, good.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.870
So next up.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.278
STUDENT: Which one do you want?

00:02:39.278 --> 00:02:41.108
PROFESSOR: OK, so you
guys gotta work as a team.

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:43.316
Do you want to try the motor
while they're connected?

00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:44.970
Actually, just feel
the motor so you

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.913
can get a little sense of how--

00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:49.038
STUDENT: It is really hard.

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:49.758
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:51.966
PROFESSOR: Try the quick
flick you get a little bit--

00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:56.537
STUDENT: OK, I'm done.

00:02:56.537 --> 00:02:57.370
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.840
So here is our humbucker.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.070
Two signal coils
next to each other.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.260
Essentially, just a big wrath
of wire with some little

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.550
poles to focus the
magnetic energy.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.310
Now, this design, this
a nice DeMarzio pickup.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.440
I was talking
earlier, it's in pink.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.270
I got the pink one
because it was cheaper.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.976
Think about the issues
involved in that.

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:21.400
The pink pickup is cheaper than
a black one, same performance.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.790
Anyways, this model
has four conductors

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.720
which allows us to access
each of the coils separately.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.500
We're going to
run them in series

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.670
and treat them
just as one pickup.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.630
So we need our--
this is our ground ,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.092
here and this is our
hot signal, the red.

00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:43.050
STUDENT: Does that mean
that you're essentially

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.170
eliminating any benefits of
the reverse polarity humbucking

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.670
action?

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.961
PROFESSOR: The humbucking
action works into both series

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:53.017
and parallel, according to
the DeMarzio literature.

00:03:53.017 --> 00:03:54.600
STUDENT: It seems
like if you ran them

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.780
in series that
reversing them again,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.925
you would just knock out
the sequel altogether.

00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:00.508
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:01.216
So you got it in?

00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:06.120
Now, the first thing to
try is turning our motor--

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.240
before we get to the phone.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.480
Now, what this
device is going to do

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.860
is pick up moving metal that
perturbs the magnetic field.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.079
So if we spin our motor
in front of the pickup,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.412
let's see if we can get a sound.

00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:29.410
There we go, OK?

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.311
STUDENT: It's the same sound.

00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:34.746
PROFESSOR: It's the same
sound, that's right.

00:04:34.746 --> 00:04:38.630
Which shouldn't be
surprising, but it is still.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.420
OK, good.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.230
Now, what if we put a vibrating
metal string on top of this?

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.650
Maybe we might pick
up a sound, right?

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.150
Let's try it on piano.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.880
OK, so one of you can play
the keys here and hold down

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.308
the damper.

00:04:56.308 --> 00:05:01.475
And the other needs to--

00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:02.282
STUDENT: Feedback?

00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:04.198
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're
going to get feedback.

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:19.610
STUDENT: Try to go
for a lower one.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.568
PROFESSOR: It has a high
directionality action.

00:05:21.568 --> 00:05:23.604
STUDENT: Maybe if we
do a really quiet note.

00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:25.603
PROFESSOR: So it really
matters is the location.

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:33.076
There we go.

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:38.534
Maybe turn off the distortion.

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:39.200
STUDENT: Oh, OK.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.033
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:40.605
Try it again.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.800
Now just move it--
hold on one note.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.720
Press that one note
repeatedly and move the pickup

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.219
to the left and
right so we can hear

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:54.028
how focused the
pickup is on that.

00:05:54.028 --> 00:05:55.153
This is pretty interesting.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.595
Now, if you actually
rest it on the keys.

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:07.565
Now we have to prepare the
electromagnetic feedback.

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:15.950
Now, we could try to do
some sort of ebo thing

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.240
where we direct the
acoustic energy out

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.016
of the pickup on the strings.

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:23.140
STUDENT: Out of the pickup?

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.260
PROFESSOR: Out of the
amp onto the strings.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.150
STUDENT: Oh.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.515
STUDENT: All right.

00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:27.550
PROFESSOR: Now, this
isn't going to work great,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.160
but the idea here is that
we're using the amplification

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.110
to re-resonate the
string and creating

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.335
a feedback loop in the process.

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:37.710
STUDENT: Want me
to start it off?

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.110
STUDENT: Ah, yes.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.420
PROFESSOR: Hold down
the damper, too.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.260
And actually, if you
rest it on the keys,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:53.750
you're probably going--
The damper's way up.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.600
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.178
Nice.

00:06:59.178 --> 00:07:00.636
PROFESSOR: Now,
change the position

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:01.938
of the speaker a little bit.

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:02.936
See if you can--

00:07:09.922 --> 00:07:11.918
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:07:11.918 --> 00:07:15.284
STUDENT: I wish I had
an expensive piano.

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:16.159
PROFESSOR: OK, great.

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.409
Good.

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.910
OK, guys.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.590
Good job.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.804
Who do we want.

00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:20.160
Next up.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.890
Leave the pickup
connected and now we

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.097
need some sort of
devices that give off

00:07:27.097 --> 00:07:28.180
electromagnetic radiation.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.464
Does anybody have a device
that gives off some radiation?

00:07:32.464 --> 00:07:35.170
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.062
PROFESSOR: So let's
try the phone first.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.480
Just hold the phone
over the device.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.970
STUDENT: OK.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.285
PROFESSOR: Well, you can
move it around a little bit.

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:53.160
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:57.357 --> 00:07:59.190
PROFESSOR: So we're
getting some notes here.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.953
Try the iPhone.

00:07:59.953 --> 00:08:01.152
It's full.

00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:02.318
STUDENT: You getting a text?

00:08:02.318 --> 00:08:05.497
PROFESSOR: Just hold it
slowly and now move it.

00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:06.080
STUDENT: Whoa!

00:08:08.227 --> 00:08:08.768
STUDENT: Wow.

00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:10.594
Now I know why they say
it gives you cancer.

00:08:10.594 --> 00:08:12.052
PROFESSOR: Now move
it up and down.

00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:18.538
Can we make this some sort
of musical instrument?

00:08:18.538 --> 00:08:20.946
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:20.946 --> 00:08:23.029
PROFESSOR: If we put
processes through some delays

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:27.460
and filters, we could get
some really nice sound.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.790
There we go.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.989
Now, that's when
it goes to sleep.

00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:32.989
I found that last night.

00:08:32.989 --> 00:08:34.085
STUDENT: Oh, neat!

00:08:34.085 --> 00:08:35.460
PROFESSOR: I don't
know exactly--

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.090
STUDENT: And then chirp
is it's periodically

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.219
reading the accelerometer--

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:39.032
PROFESSOR: Is that what it--

00:08:39.032 --> 00:08:39.347
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:39.505
PROFESSOR: But it's asleep.

00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:41.400
STUDENT: And then when it
sees the new measurement,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.530
it wakes up again and throws
the chip into power mode.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:43.970
PROFESSOR: Oh really?

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.320
STUDENT: Because the chips
can still sample really,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.825
like once every
second or something

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:49.700
they can take a sample
off the accelerometer.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.582
PROFESSOR: So who knew
you had a passive--

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.540
STUDENT: That's amazing
that you can hear that.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.770
STUDENT: That's really cool.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.019
STUDENT: There's some sci
channel attacks just waiting

00:08:58.019 --> 00:08:58.960
to be exploited.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.920
STUDENT: Is that sound
in the background?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.880
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.344
That's like the ground noise.

00:09:02.344 --> 00:09:03.760
STUDENT: No, it
sounds nice there.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.020
PROFESSOR: Now, if you have
some vibrating uses in here.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:14.490
We have some special, using
the vibrations of the phone.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.340
Let's try these out.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.215
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:16.215 --> 00:09:20.749
STUDENT: Control using this--
the purple side on the switch.

00:09:20.749 --> 00:09:22.790
PROFESSOR: I bet since
the speakers are magnetic,

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.818
they would actually
just act as a microphone

00:09:24.818 --> 00:09:27.211
if you just played
sound on them.

00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:27.794
STUDENT: Whoa.

00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:43.170
STUDENT: Wow.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.185
That's nice.

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:45.643
STUDENT: It's
actually [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:51.570
STUDENT: Does it vibrate?

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.131
STUDENT: Yes.

00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:54.464
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's giving
us a good tone right there.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.658
OK, so that works well.

00:10:03.658 --> 00:10:04.404
Oh, nice.

00:10:07.282 --> 00:10:08.740
STUDENT: Are you
squeezing it hard?

00:10:11.552 --> 00:10:12.135
STUDENT: Nice.

00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:13.635
STUDENT: Right in
the middle though.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.347
STUDENT: I got a happy message.

00:10:19.347 --> 00:10:19.930
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.650
Now, you mentioned about
what about a speaker.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.950
So what is a conventional
acoustic speaker?

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.806
How does it work?

00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:31.090
STUDENT: Coil, magnet.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.690
PROFESSOR: Coil and a magnet
moving back and forth.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.060
So these things have
speakers in them, right?

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.490
And if we play some music,
like a little Afrika Bambaataa.

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:01.018
So this is not
acoustic transduction.

00:11:01.018 --> 00:11:02.500
This is electromagnetic.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.461
And notice how tight
the directionality is.

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.710
STUDENT: It's actually a
pretty nice conduction there.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.230
When she holds it just right
it's almost as good as a wire.

00:11:22.405 --> 00:11:26.286
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
is a queue.

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:26.785
OK, great.

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:28.590
Thanks, guys.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:34.926
Now, Greg, did I see a
phonograph project there?

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:35.918
OK.

00:11:35.918 --> 00:11:37.902
Let's see if we can
do some with that.

00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:38.886
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:39.886
PROFESSOR: Does it work?

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:40.802
STUDENT: I don't know.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.630
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.900
So anybody want to guess?

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.533
Red is maybe hot, obviously.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.280
PROFESSOR: Let's try connecting
red to the positive, which

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.310
is yellow for us.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.990
And then let's try
hooking up the black,

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.910
or is that blue, to--
this might be a stereo.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.136
Do you know if it's a stereo?

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:15.540
STUDENT: Yes.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.290
PROFESSOR: Stereo.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.070
So let's see if you move the
needle, do you hear anything?

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:30.480
STUDENT: How does
that come from that?

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:30.974
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:12:30.974 --> 00:12:31.962
STUDENT: It's just noise.

00:12:31.962 --> 00:12:33.003
STUDENT: So where is it--

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:34.992
STUDENT: It's right there, yeah.

00:12:34.992 --> 00:12:36.408
STUDENT: I don't
want to break it.

00:12:39.866 --> 00:12:41.770
STUDENT: Let's try the white.

00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:57.386
STUDENT: The iPhone pickup.

00:12:57.386 --> 00:13:00.219
STUDENT: There we go.

00:13:00.219 --> 00:13:00.802
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:00.802 --> 00:13:01.320
Hey.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:01.970
There we go.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:02.970
There's something there.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.525
So the basic--

00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:07.150
STUDENT: Oh no.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.483
PROFESSOR: Now, see if you can--

00:13:10.251 --> 00:13:10.750
STUDENT: Oh!

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.740
PROFESSOR: Lords of Canada,
you don't like them?

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.802
STUDENT: That's terrible.

00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:17.968
That was a terrible bootleg.

00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:32.750
STUDENT: A little
faster than that.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.748
PROFESSOR: You want to be in the
groove, so try to line it up.

00:13:34.748 --> 00:13:35.736
STUDENT: In the groove.

00:13:42.158 --> 00:13:43.880
STUDENT: In the records.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.130
STUDENT: The initial movement.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.838
STUDENT: Was red.

00:13:57.677 --> 00:13:59.510
PROFESSOR: There's a
little something there.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.114
STUDENT: And don't
forget to push hard.

00:14:13.114 --> 00:14:13.614
OK.

00:14:13.614 --> 00:14:15.487
Well, that's not--

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:17.070
PROFESSOR: We'll try
this again later.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.320
The basic principle of
a phonograph needle,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.219
how does it work?

00:14:22.219 --> 00:14:23.260
STUDENT: Coil and magnet.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.260
PROFESSOR: Coil, magnet.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.390
So the arm, that the
stylus is connected

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.589
to a metal that's moving
in a magnetic field.

00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:32.457
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:32.457 --> 00:14:33.690
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.306
OK, great.

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:35.930
We'll play with that
a little bit more.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.360
I want you guys to get started
on building some modulators.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:46.120
So you guys can go
back to your seats.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.600
So Collins, in the great
tradition of hardware hacking

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.490
has an approach for us
to build oscillators

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.980
using a digital chip
that's not intended

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.756
to be used as an
oscillator at all.

00:15:01.756 --> 00:15:03.588
You guys will work in pairs.

00:15:03.588 --> 00:15:05.670
You can work with your neighbor.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.031
STUDENT: Oh, whoa.

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:07.572
Look at that.

00:15:11.435 --> 00:15:12.018
STUDENT: Nice.

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:16.958
STUDENT: Try not
to lose anything

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.580
in the first couple of seconds.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.710
PROFESSOR: So Collins has us use
the Hex Schmitt Trigger, which

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.610
is a very simple device which
allows us to basically flip

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.290
and flop between
a 0 and 1 output.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:39.470
Namely, which will
be a voltage allowing

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.056
us to alter between
two voltages.

00:15:43.056 --> 00:15:45.590
Now, what we're going to with
this chip is we're simply

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.920
going to use pins one and two.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.740
We're going to use one
of these little triggers,

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.970
and we're going to feed
it back into itself

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.980
and cause it to oscillate.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.808
So now you all
have your chips in,

00:16:01.808 --> 00:16:03.981
except for those of you
that don't have chips,

00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:05.231
so let me give you some chips.

00:16:10.752 --> 00:16:12.960
STUDENT: I can't guarantee
it won't break up, but I--

00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:22.474
PROFESSOR: And you need
some-- good on ground,

00:16:22.474 --> 00:16:23.863
and good on power.

00:16:23.863 --> 00:16:24.790
OK, cool.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.480
STUDENT: We are set up somewhat.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.770
We are ready.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.024
And then we need to do what?

00:16:29.024 --> 00:16:30.024
We need to feed it back.

00:16:30.024 --> 00:16:32.916
STUDENT: We apparently want
to feedback one and two--

00:16:32.916 --> 00:16:35.220
STUDENT: So you want
sound out somehow.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.970
STUDENT: Which component
do you think is--

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:37.553
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:37.553 --> 00:16:42.635
So the first thing we need to
do is provide power to our chip.

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:45.050
That's already done on the
boards that I gave you.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.420
You want to take vector,
these here, and orient

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.007
the ground on the bottom.

00:16:53.007 --> 00:16:54.340
Orient the ground on the bottom.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.800
OK, so you want it
to look like this.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.619
Orient the ground
and the bottom,

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:11.200
and connect power
to the power bus,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.910
and the ground to
the ground bus.

00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:18.603
And you guys need--

00:17:18.603 --> 00:17:20.511
STUDENT: You have to
register to one and two.

00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:26.105
Cap from what, one to ground?

00:17:26.105 --> 00:17:28.380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.750
STUDENT: I think.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.490
And then he's got sound.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.386
STUDENT: This single round
and this one is in two?

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:34.969
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:36.957
Exactly.

00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:37.951
And that's the--

00:17:41.797 --> 00:17:42.672
STUDENT: There we go.

00:17:42.672 --> 00:17:43.412
We made sound.

00:17:43.412 --> 00:17:44.412
STUDENT: Check for heat.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.229
PROFESSOR: OK, wait
for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:50.229 --> 00:17:51.678
OK.

00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:54.010
OK, ground, good, good.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.280
And then you got the
resister feeding back

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.810
into the second pin.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.750
OK.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.250
Good.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.090
You guys need some components.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.120
We should have our
basic oscillator set up.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.100
Excellent.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.430
And let's hear what we get.

00:18:13.907 --> 00:18:15.698
Let's plug it in and
see if we get a sound.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:20.560
There we go.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.754
The beauty of synthesis.

00:18:21.754 --> 00:18:23.920
STUDENT: That sounds good
with everybody's in there.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.277
Is everyone using the
same value and components?

00:18:28.277 --> 00:18:29.027
STUDENT: Oh, nice.

00:18:29.027 --> 00:18:30.360
You're screwing the capacitance.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.749
STUDENT: How'd you do that?

00:18:31.749 --> 00:18:33.082
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] resistance.

00:18:33.082 --> 00:18:34.036
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:34.770
OK.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.020
STUDENT: No, it's capacitance.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.260
It goes between your two fingers
with the parallel capacitor.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.702
STUDENT: No, I am
bypassing the resistor.

00:18:41.702 --> 00:18:43.194
STUDENT: Oh.

00:18:43.194 --> 00:18:43.694
Nice.

00:18:43.694 --> 00:18:44.690
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.686
Good.

00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:46.672
And--

00:18:46.672 --> 00:18:49.172
STUDENT: This sounds awesome
with everybody's going at once.

00:19:04.292 --> 00:19:05.250
STUDENT: I don't think.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.024
I'm just guessing.

00:19:07.024 --> 00:19:10.300
STUDENT: I don't think at all.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.236
Sorry.

00:19:11.236 --> 00:19:12.400
STUDENT: Then cover it up.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:12.746
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:19:12.746 --> 00:19:13.246
Yes.

00:19:13.246 --> 00:19:15.152
Oh, hey, got it.

00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:16.124
STUDENT: In nine holes?

00:19:16.124 --> 00:19:16.707
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.095
STUDENT: Oh yeah,
I don't know how--

00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:26.170
I don't know if we
can get reliable--

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.142
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:19:27.142 --> 00:19:28.106
The bands are really--

00:19:28.106 --> 00:19:30.034
STUDENT: I don't know
what those bands mean,

00:19:30.034 --> 00:19:31.962
or whether they
would even like--

00:19:34.452 --> 00:19:36.410
STUDENT: Oh, you're going
to try the white hat?

00:19:43.346 --> 00:19:44.346
STUDENT: Not bad at all.

00:19:52.282 --> 00:19:54.050
STUDENT: That is awesome.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.258
STUDENT: We did a good thing.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.963
STUDENT: All right.

00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:01.046
STUDENT: I like that tone.

00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:02.129
STUDENT: I love that tone.

00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:03.360
It's really nice.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.310
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.741
STUDENT: Just swap it out,
hot swap it for the speaker.

00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:08.649
Are we going to try this mode?

00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:11.040
STUDENT: OK.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.540
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.953
You got a sound.

00:20:13.953 --> 00:20:15.366
Make sure you got a sound.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.706
STUDENT: Let's maybe slow it
down and try the resistor gain.

00:20:20.706 --> 00:20:22.712
But instead of so
high, use the--

00:20:22.712 --> 00:20:24.378
STUDENT: What if we
tried the other one?

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:27.850
STUDENT: Wait.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:28.950
You guys pause for a sec?

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.491
STUDENT: Yes.

00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:30.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.123
Pause for a sec.

00:20:31.123 --> 00:20:32.747
We're going to make
sure these guys who

00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:34.496
are doing ultimate hacks with--

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.460
PROFESSOR: What is going on?

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.904
STUDENT: Two oscillators.

00:20:41.904 --> 00:20:43.612
STUDENT: Do you want
to jump in on those?

00:20:47.508 --> 00:20:51.008
STUDENT: We can
do one at a time.

00:20:51.008 --> 00:20:52.008
PROFESSOR: There you go.

00:20:52.008 --> 00:20:52.960
OK.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.390
STUDENT: How big is that cap?

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.840
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's pause.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.301
Let's pause for a second, OK?

00:20:57.301 --> 00:20:59.492
Now, the reason Greg
has the lower tone--

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:02.330
hear your nice tone-- is because
of different capacitors being

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.830
used.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.015
So the capacitor going
from pin one to the ground.

00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:08.390
By varying that
path capcitor, we

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.394
can set a different frequency
range for the oscillation.

00:21:11.394 --> 00:21:13.310
The principle we're using
here for oscillation

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.433
is feedback, right?

00:21:14.433 --> 00:21:16.698
We're taking the
output of pin two,

00:21:16.698 --> 00:21:20.760
feeding it back into pin one,
which through the resistor,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.250
that is causing the 1 to flip
to 0, the 0 to flip to 1,

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.938
and continually producing
what kind of sound?

00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:29.500
Is it essentially?

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.250
STUDENT: Sawtooth.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.250
PROFESSOR: Something like
a sawtoothed squarish.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.635
It's going from 1 to 0
but it's going to fall,

00:21:34.635 --> 00:21:36.680
so it's not going to be
a straight square wave,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.605
but it's going to be
something square-like.

00:21:39.605 --> 00:21:43.454
Everybody happy with the
first synthesizer they built?

00:21:43.454 --> 00:21:45.954
STUDENT: It's like a nice It's
looks like a nice helicopter.

00:21:45.954 --> 00:21:49.030
PROFESSOR: OK, now, we
can have immediate fun

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.720
by replacing our resistor
with the photoresistor.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.910
The photoresistor allows
us to bury resistance.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.120
If we bury the resistance
in the feedback from pin one

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.177
to pin two, what will
we be able to do?

00:22:01.177 --> 00:22:02.260
STUDENT: Change the pitch.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.740
PROFESSOR: Change the
frequency of oscillation.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.459
So some of you have
already done it.

00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.583
STUDENT: I'm going to borrow
the amp from you guys.

00:22:11.848 --> 00:22:12.431
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.680
So here we go.

00:22:28.757 --> 00:22:30.715
STUDENT: You could do
this all too high before.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.900
PROFESSOR: It's OK.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.954
You should [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:46.954 --> 00:22:49.210
STUDENT: These things
are not directional?

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.593
STUDENT: The big black one is.

00:22:50.593 --> 00:22:51.718
STUDENT: The big black one.

00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:52.212
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:22:52.212 --> 00:22:53.694
Where the one lead
goes to ground.

00:22:53.694 --> 00:22:55.557
STUDENT: Right.

00:22:55.557 --> 00:22:57.265
PROFESSOR: Yeah, try
the smart capacitor.

00:22:57.265 --> 00:22:58.530
Did it work fine with that?

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.477
Is this a 1 or--

00:22:59.477 --> 00:23:00.060
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:23:03.964 --> 00:23:05.916
PROFESSOR: This should
give you something.

00:23:10.308 --> 00:23:12.992
STUDENT: Try changing the
pins at the photoresistors.

00:23:18.604 --> 00:23:20.617
STUDENT: Oh, this
motor is not going

00:23:20.617 --> 00:23:23.340
to-- We need the little one.

00:23:27.795 --> 00:23:28.771
STUDENT: Oh.

00:23:28.771 --> 00:23:30.270
Chris did bring a
whole [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:33.189 --> 00:23:34.230
STUDENT: Oh, that's nice.

00:23:39.962 --> 00:23:41.920
STUDENT: We're not even
getting the basic tone.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.780
PROFESSOR: OK, so what you got?

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.655
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:57.662 --> 00:23:58.620
PROFESSOR: There we go.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.730
STUDENT: You guys want
to try it out again?

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.200
PROFESSOR: Let's
move this around.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.670
If you haven't
got on the speaker

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.128
yet with your recent
configuration.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.827
STUDENT: I didn't
expand in this motor.

00:24:19.827 --> 00:24:20.410
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.593
Think more about it.

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:23.676
STUDENT: Maybe we go really
slow with a really big

00:24:23.676 --> 00:24:26.431
and getting the pulses.

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:28.264
STUDENT: We're just
going to try to blow up.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.140
PROFESSOR: And the whole
thing collects light

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.490
if you cover it all the way.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.640
STUDENT: This is like a--

00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:45.370
STUDENT: Oh, that's
going to change things.

00:24:50.057 --> 00:24:50.890
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.181
Let me move the speaker around.

00:25:01.718 --> 00:25:03.426
STUDENT: Let's pull
it down a little bit.

00:25:07.758 --> 00:25:09.757
STUDENT: We're trying to
figure out [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:16.575
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:16.575 --> 00:25:24.935
And let's do-- OK, let's pause.

00:25:24.935 --> 00:25:26.060
Let's pause.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.415
Let's pause.

00:25:28.415 --> 00:25:30.206
OK, so we discovered
with the photoresistor

00:25:30.206 --> 00:25:32.180
we can vary the frequency.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.406
By swapping out
different capacitors,

00:25:34.406 --> 00:25:37.635
we can get different
frequency ranges.

00:25:37.635 --> 00:25:39.137
Why don't you swap
out the-- do you

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.512
have that big
electric capacitor?

00:25:40.512 --> 00:25:43.476
Swap that out with
the other capacitor.

00:25:43.476 --> 00:25:44.958
STUDENT: This made
it really high,

00:25:44.958 --> 00:25:47.327
but if we use the big-- yeah.

00:25:47.327 --> 00:25:48.910
STUDENT: It's going
to be a nice flow.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.886
STUDENT: And controllable.

00:25:50.886 --> 00:25:52.862
STUDENT: What we really
want is control board.

00:25:59.402 --> 00:26:00.110
PROFESSOR: Pause.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.620
Pause.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.710
Here we have a larger
capacitor which gives us

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.014
some really nice low
frequency tone, which

00:26:06.014 --> 00:26:08.140
I think are pleasing.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.500
Now, to get even a more pleasing
tone, what we're going to do

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.160
is insert a diode
into the output,

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.330
which is a hack
that Collins uses.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.830
And somebody can explain to
me why this sounds better,

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.540
but it sounds nice when we stick
the signal through a diode.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.594
So we're going to take
the output of pin two,

00:26:26.594 --> 00:26:29.590
put it through
the diode and then

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.910
pick up that output from there.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.111
And the diode is
directional, so you

00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:36.463
want to make sure [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.580
STUDENT: Well, I
guess maybe it just

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.404
depends on the polarity
of the whole thing.

00:26:51.404 --> 00:26:52.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.609
I used the black end
to turn up the output.

00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:57.150
STUDENT: It's just
going to shave off

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.210
even the top of the wave
or the bottom of the wave.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.494
PROFESSOR: And it also
makes it really loud.

00:27:02.494 --> 00:27:03.160
STUDENT: Really.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:03.743
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:27:19.077 --> 00:27:19.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.830
So we're taking the
signal from into-- good.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.765
OK, you're ready.

00:27:23.765 --> 00:27:24.660
STUDENT: Maybe if
it's a lot louder

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.420
now it's enough to
drive our motor.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.740
STUDENT: Oh, yes.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.115
STUDENT: The
ensemble is perfect.

00:27:33.842 --> 00:27:35.008
STUDENT: Very the frequency.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.329
PROFESSOR: You're
not using this cap,

00:27:40.329 --> 00:27:41.620
because you're missing the pin.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.620
Try getting that in there.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.120
STUDENT: Oh.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.455
STUDENT: What happened?

00:27:44.455 --> 00:27:45.345
STUDENT: Nothing.

00:27:45.345 --> 00:27:46.507
PROFESSOR: There we go.

00:27:46.507 --> 00:27:47.340
Now let's hear that.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.320
Now that's a nice tone.

00:27:53.424 --> 00:27:55.050
And if you cover
it all around, it's

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.890
actually sensitive all over.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:56.150
STUDENT: Oh wow.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:56.821
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:57.320
So it's--

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.042
STUDENT: It's probably got a
tiny little sawtooth that's

00:27:59.042 --> 00:28:00.088
just not enough to--

00:28:00.088 --> 00:28:01.796
STUDENT: It sounds
better with the diode.

00:28:12.872 --> 00:28:14.830
STUDENT: You guys are
going to get some crazy--

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.211
STUDENT: I know.

00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:17.877
STUDENT: We have an
ensemble going here.

00:28:17.877 --> 00:28:18.871
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:21.853
You get this diagram?

00:28:21.853 --> 00:28:23.841
STUDENT: Oh, that's great.

00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:25.829
STUDENT: Turn that
overdrive way up.

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:53.164
STUDENT: It's a pyramid.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.930
STUDENT: I'm just just an LFO.

00:29:47.272 --> 00:29:49.313
PROFESSOR: I thought it
was a problem that I only

00:29:49.313 --> 00:29:51.438
had two amplifiers, but
it's actually a good thing.

00:30:49.367 --> 00:30:49.950
STUDENT: Whoa.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:50.846
Look at this.

00:30:50.846 --> 00:30:53.822
We have three sets
all together here.

00:30:58.286 --> 00:31:00.270
I noticed the--

00:31:45.406 --> 00:31:47.310
PROFESSOR: OK, pause.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.810
All right.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.244
Now, the last thing we're going
to do, which I'm amazed we

00:31:50.244 --> 00:31:51.660
have time to try
it, but we'll try

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.550
to do Collins' very
simple low path filter

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.950
circuit, which is a total hack.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:05.280
But all we have to do is insert
another resistor-- actually,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.940
a photoresistor and a
capacitor to the output.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.970
I have the diagram
for this somewhere.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.200
This will give us, with
another photoresistor,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:24.169
our essential two parameters,
which should help us.

00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:25.960
STUDENT: Should we keep
the diode in there?

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.720
I like to keep the
diode in there.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.680
So take the output of the
diode and then-- and now

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.220
take a photoresistor from this
bus, put them in the next one,

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.770
and then capcitor to ground.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.580
Try the filter.

00:32:50.618 --> 00:32:54.830
You need to be-- oh wait.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.304
This should do it.

00:32:56.304 --> 00:32:58.739
Turn it up a little bit.

00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:00.200
STUDENT: Whoa.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.635
PROFESSOR: No, the first one.

00:33:02.635 --> 00:33:04.505
Oh, you're up all the way.

00:33:04.505 --> 00:33:05.630
STUDENT: Well past filters.

00:33:11.904 --> 00:33:12.820
STUDENT: Maybe if we--

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:13.946
STUDENT: When I touch it--

00:33:13.946 --> 00:33:15.486
STUDENT: Yeah, you're
bridging it turning it on?

00:33:15.486 --> 00:33:16.152
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:20.571 --> 00:33:21.070
OK.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.800
It's time to make some music.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.870
We're going to do duets.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:29.630
So and you guys will
be a trio, obviously.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.214
So why don't we
start with you guys.

00:33:32.214 --> 00:33:33.130
You guys and you guys.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.710
We'll go from the sides,
and then we'll-- oh,

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.310
we can do you four
at the same time.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.232
OK.

00:33:38.232 --> 00:33:40.537
That's great.

00:33:40.537 --> 00:33:41.920
STUDENT: What do we try to play?

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.111
PROFESSOR: OK, you're going
to do an improvisation.

00:33:44.111 --> 00:33:45.875
It's going to be a
minute or two minutes.

00:33:45.875 --> 00:33:48.170
And we're going to use a
very simple improvisation

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.130
technique that works
in almost any context.

00:33:56.445 --> 00:33:57.570
STUDENT: Call and response.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:58.153
PROFESSOR: No.

00:33:58.153 --> 00:34:01.340
What we're going to do is
set up a basic ostinati.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.040
So you're going to repeat
some musical motive.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.950
Find some little thing
that you can repeat.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.929
It can be a little [SOUND].

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.723
Some little gesture
that's identifiable

00:34:11.723 --> 00:34:13.389
and repeat it, and
keep on repeating it.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.122
It's like a drum
circle basically.

00:34:15.122 --> 00:34:17.934
But we're using our
photoresistor therabins

00:34:17.934 --> 00:34:19.989
to do a drum circle.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:27.469
So you'll start off, you'll
create a sort of pattern,

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:28.679
and then hold it.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.940
The next person
will come in, try

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.000
to do something that fits
in with that pattern.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.739
After it's going, then you can--

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:35.800
STUDENT: And then we'll
hop flop to Andrew.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.798
PROFESSOR: --change the pattern.

00:34:36.798 --> 00:34:37.297
STUDENT: Oh.

00:34:37.297 --> 00:34:38.380
PROFESSOR: --a little bit.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.792
And then it'll be done.

00:34:39.792 --> 00:34:46.279
[STUDENTS PLAYING PATTERNS]

00:36:47.067 --> 00:36:49.055
Guys, you guys were coming down.

00:36:49.055 --> 00:36:51.043
There was this good
ending opportunity there.

00:36:51.043 --> 00:36:54.140
When you hear it ending, use it.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.675
It's good to get out
while you're ahead.
