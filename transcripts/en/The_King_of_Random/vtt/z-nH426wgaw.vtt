[Captioned via Y Translator]
Halloween's coming up,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.100
and if you're thinking
of being Captain America,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
then we've got something
to show you that will make

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.860
your shield even more useful
than it usually is.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.180
[Music]

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.500
&gt;&gt; Hey guys, I'm here
with my friend Calli.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.600
&gt;&gt;  I've helped Nate before
in the past with building

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.092
some giant Koopa shells
for the Devin Supertramp videos,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.180
if you've seen those.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.600
You guys also saw
a smaller version

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.320
of that on this channel.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.500
&gt;&gt;  Fiberglass is
something that

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.100
I really prefer to have
an extra set of hands for,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.300
and she has hands.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.020
So this is gonna work
out pretty well.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.200
The basic idea is
that carrying a shield

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.100
and a trick-or-treat
bag will use up all

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.900
of your hands,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.520
so we found a way
to combine the two,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.660
letting you open the front
of your shield to collect your goodies.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.300
So, to start off,
we've got a little

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.820
plastic Captain America shield
that we bought from Amazon.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.712
&gt;&gt; It has some elastic straps
here and there.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.900
They're okay.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
&gt;&gt; Well, we've got
some modifications to do,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.200
and the first step is gonna be
a little bit of reinforcement,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.060
and that's what we've got
our fiberglass for.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000
&gt;&gt; And here we've got
our fiberglass resin

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.780
and our fiberglass cloth.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.200
&gt;&gt; So we're going to be using
these two things,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.500
and making a reinforced section
and a circle around here.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.200
&gt;&gt; So the first thing
we're gonna do is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.092
take off these elastic straps,
but we're gonna save them for later.

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:14.400
&gt;&gt; Now, we need to do fiberglass,
and fiberglass is a terrible

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.152
thing to do indoors.

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:17.832
It smells really strong.

00:01:17.832 --> 00:01:20.200
It has powerful fumes,
you really don't want

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.980
to be breathing in.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.800
So we're gonna go
outside for this part.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.400
So now, we've got our shield,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.600
and we're here outside where
there's enough ventilation

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.000
that we're not going
to get overwhelmed

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.800
with fiberglass fumes,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.300
and we've just got it set up
on this plastic container

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.420
to hold it up.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.620
&gt;&gt; To make sure that the fiberglass
bonds really well,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.700
we're gonna go ahead and
sand some parts down here.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.320
So it has something to grips,
and doesn't feel up later.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.920
So while I handle the sanding here,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.100
Nate's gonna cut up that fiberglass mat.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.362
[Music]

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:53.702
&gt;&gt; Okay, here's
our fiberglass resin.

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:55.320
We're gonna be the pouring it
into this bowl.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.900
Here's a tip,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.832
if you ever have a can
or a bottle something

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.832
like this where
the spout is on one side,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.100
don't pour it that direction
because it'll usually

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.000
block off the air,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.842
and it'll do that
like blub-blub thing.

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:08.222
Pour it from the
other direction.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.340
You usually get
a much smoother pour.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.720
Look at that smooth pour.

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:15.440
Beautiful.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:26.420
[Music]

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.300
So we start off
by brushing on a thin layer

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.000
of fiberglass resin, we
then take our fiberglass cloth,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.240
we press it down onto that,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.200
and then we add more
of the resin on top of it.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.600
&gt;&gt; So this ridge that Nate's
pointing to right here,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.200
this is what we want
to go ahead and reinforce

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.800
because we're going
to be cutting into that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.772
in just a little bit.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:51.600
[Music]

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.900
This is gonna take a little bit
of time to cure.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.800
Actual cure time depends
on how much catalyst we added,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.100
and the temperature outside,
so we'll just come check on it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.822
about every 20 minutes,
and see how it's doing.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.600
In the meantime,
we've got stuff

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
to build back inside,
where it's not quite so cold.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.300
Now, while the fiberglass is curing,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.480
as I said, we're gonna start
building the internal

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.700
and moving parts of this.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.300
So, we have here a caulking gun
and a piece of wood.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.000
From this, we need to cut
two pieces that are

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.900
approximately the length
of the second circle

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.000
on the inside of our shield.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.792
So we're gonna have
Calli measure

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.500
and cut those,
while I start

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:27.700
modifying our caulking gun.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.500
&gt;&gt; The last thing you want
is resin in your hair.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.700
Pretty much most
of these supplies,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.300
you don't want in your hair.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.700
Right now, we're just
measuring the piece

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.400
of wood to fit the inside
of this inner second circle.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.500
&gt;&gt; Now, we're gonna have this piece
of aluminum working as a sort

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.432
of hinge that swells
and pushes out the front part

00:03:47.432 --> 00:03:47.992
of our shield.

00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:49.400
So Calli's going to shape this.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.200
We've got a curved end
on one side,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.500
a couple of spots to drill,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.900
and we'll cut it off,
and that will be part

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.462
of our opening mechanism.

00:03:56.462 --> 00:04:12.500
[Music]

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.280
Easy enough,
and then we need our grip.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.080
She'll be a little harder to cut.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:45.200
[Music]

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.160
That should work.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.000
Caulking guns are cheap,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.300
and they have a prebuilt
handle with a hinge,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.500
with a spring in it,
which is just what

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.300
we're looking for right now.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.900
So we're gonna take
this caulking gun,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.000
and we're gonna start kind
of cutting it to pieces.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.780
We just want the handle part.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:09.240
[Music]

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.600
All right, now we've got
several pieces cut out,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.200
so we can begin to show you
how this mechanism is going

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.280
to be working.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.500
Our handle is going
to get mounted,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.040
and we're gonna bend
this metal strap into place.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.200
So that, that will be attached
onto these bars,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.100
then we'll have a piece
of metal that goes

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.720
from the black handle around,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.600
and that will go over
to this piece, which

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.120
will be mounted on a hinge.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.200
So when we pull this handle,
that will push on the back,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.282
causing this to swing out,

00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:39.600
and that's what's going
to push open our shield.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.200
So now, we need
to mount this handle

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.892
onto these two pieces of wood.

00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:46.400
Like I said,
we've got this metal strap,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400
and this is what
we're going to be using.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.200
So, let's start bending this,
and then cutting it

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.700
into the right shape.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.400
We want to lift it up,
so that we have space to fit

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.700
our hand underneath the handle,
so we can close it as we like.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.100
Calli just finished
sanding this off,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.800
so I'm less likely
to tear my hand open

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.200
while handling it.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.500
I took this metal strap,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.900
and I bent it
in a few places that

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.740
should allow us to mount it
both to the wooden sticks

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.100
and to our caulking gun handle.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.380
So this will fit right
here on the bottom.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.600
So I bent it to my hand,
but I was also

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.900
trying to keep in mind
the placement of the holes,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.800
so I can use those
to mount them on

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.012
to both the wooden sticks
and the handle here.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.200
I'm just trying
to line up the holes

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.300
in our metal bracket.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.960
With where we want to make
holes, in our handle.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.660
[Music]

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.300
&gt;&gt; So you can see here
on the handle,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.760
if we had left it open,
when I was drilling,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.352
we would have actually gotten
this black part drilled too.

00:06:46.352 --> 00:06:47.400
And we did not want that.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.440
So we closed it for that part,
goes all the way through,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.200
and then the bottom part
didn't really matter,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.640
so we kept that open.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.900
&gt;&gt; Now we need similarly
drilled holes

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.600
into the two sticks,
and that's how we're going

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.120
to mount the bracket to that.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:23.720
[Music]

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.700
Now, our handle is mounted
to two sticks,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.500
which is everything
I've ever wanted in the world.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.800
I think at this point,
the fiberglass

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.300
on our shield is probably cured,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.120
so we can start
lining things up,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.300
and getting ready
to do more assembly

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.540
on the shield itself.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.300
&gt;&gt; Our fiberglass is
pretty much cured,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.600
so slightly more like vibranium,
just if vibranium was slightly

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.842
harder plastic?

00:07:45.522 --> 00:07:46.022
Yeah.

00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:50.800
&gt;&gt; So now, we've got our whole
handle assembly on our shield,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.300
and we can see even better
how things are gonna work.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.032
This piece of aluminum
will go right here.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.420
We'll have this piece of bolt
acting as a sort of hinge,

00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:03.500
and then when a piece of metal
extending from the handle over

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.200
to this hole pushes on it,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.800
it will spin
and it will push out

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.962
the front portion of our shield.

00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:13.100
However, before we do that,
we need to make it

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.400
so the two pieces are separate.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400
Right now, we have
the whole shield as one piece,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.580
and we need to pull them apart.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.500
So what we're gonna do
is drill a couple

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.000
of holes into the front,
just big enough that we

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.292
can fit a jigsaw blade in,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.360
and we're gonna jigsaw
all the way around,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.940
cutting out this blue circle
with the star in it.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.120
We've now got the two
pieces separated,

00:08:34.282 --> 00:08:36.800
and while Calli sands those down
so they aren't super scratchy

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.660
[inaudible], I'm going to be
doing some measurements,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.960
and attaching some more hardware
onto our hand mechanism.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:09:04.760
[Music]

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.100
Calli has become
the Captain America shield.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.560
[Music]

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.820
Well, at this point, the wrong
thing is moving of course.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.900
But conceptually,
I think we've got something good going on.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.100
Pulling on that handle
is going to push it,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.020
and it's going to force it open.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.300
We've separated the two pieces
of our shield, and now, we

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.500
need to put them back together.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.000
Just not quite the same way.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.602
What we want to do is have
this piece on a hinge,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.300
so it opens up.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:44.940
[Music]

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.200
Earlier, we took off these elastic straps
that were the original handles on this shield,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.900
but they weren't quite the right style
for what we were going for, of course.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.600
So now, we're going
to use those pieces

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.900
of elastic to work
as a closing mechanism

00:09:55.912 --> 00:09:56.722
for our shield.

00:09:56.722 --> 00:10:00.500
[Music]

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.200
We glued those on fairly tight,
not necessarily pulled tight,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.312
but just nice and flat so
that any opening causes

00:10:10.312 --> 00:10:13.032
the elastic to stretch,
so they should spring back nicely.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.380
[Music]

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.980
&gt;&gt; So now that we've got
most everything in place,

00:10:21.132 --> 00:10:23.000
we want to make sure
it's pretty secure

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.100
and pretty permanent.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.882
So we're gonna
be fiberglassing

00:10:24.882 --> 00:10:28.500
our wood pieces,
just making sure

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.822
that nothing goes anywhere.

00:10:31.572 --> 00:10:32.462
Oh no.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.000
I have resin on me.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.140
Your life is over.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.080
I'll be prepared
to have it on me forever.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:51.980
[Music]

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.300
&gt;&gt; Alright, I think we've now had
our fiberglass cure pretty nicely.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.500
So these are gonna hold on,
so I'm no longer worried

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.000
about the shield breaking apart
while it's being carried around.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.440
So just a few last touches.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.300
I've actually gone ahead
while that was curing.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.400
I did a little bit of it.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.300
So this is just a pouch
that I threw together

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.600
with some scrap pieces
of cloth, and some...

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.700
You can see it's got
velcro dots all over it,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.460
and the purpose of this is we
can just attach it like that.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.740
And like that.

00:11:21.562 --> 00:11:24.200
So now, when the front
of the shield is open,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.800
it just leads right
down into that bag.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.620
So the whole point of this is
like a trick-or-treating shield.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.232
You open it up like that,
drop candy down in,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.760
and it will just land right
in your trick-or-treat bag.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.900
And if that gets too full,
you can just peel it off,

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.600
and make your dad carry all
of your candy in a larger bag,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.860
while you just keep carrying
around the shield.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.600
One more thing we want to do,
and that is to add an arm strap.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.000
So we're gonna use
a staple gun to hold this down.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.092
We're gonna use several staples,
just attaching our leather on

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.440
to our piece of wood.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.900
This is a really
simple plastic buckle

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.960
from the craft store.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.400
On one side,
it's permanently attached.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.600
On the other side,
it goes to the loop,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.912
so you can tighten it,
but it doesn't really pull back.

00:12:05.462 --> 00:12:07.600
Are you gonna attack me while
I'm using this as a shield?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.600
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.712
Wait, no no no.

00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:11.100
Yeah, where's the candy?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.782
I'm gonna shot candy at you.

00:12:13.612 --> 00:12:14.000
Okay, wait.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.600
Okay, wait.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.120
Ready?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.900
[Music]

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.220
Did you catch any of those?

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:22.692
&gt;&gt; No!

00:12:22.692 --> 00:12:23.600
It's vibranium.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.800
Things bounce off of it.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.900
Or nothing bounces off of it?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.860
&gt;&gt; Almost.

00:12:27.892 --> 00:12:28.392
Almost.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.220
Keep trying again.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.380
[Music]

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.500
This is really fun.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.020
&gt;&gt; Trick or Treat.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:44.880
[Music]

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.160
&gt;&gt; Wait.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.000
Guys, thanks for watching.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.900
