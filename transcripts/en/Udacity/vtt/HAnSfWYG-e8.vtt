00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:06.410
Ajay, what's wrong?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.700
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm really having
a hard time finding a new home.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.100
You see,
I like to be in a very specific area.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.410
And it would be awesome if I could
tell the site which blocks I want.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.440
And which blocks I do not want.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.660
But I'm left having to go
through them one by one.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.620
&gt;&gt; Ooh, that sounds really frustrating,
why don't try using my listing site?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.790
You see, in my site, you can draw the
exact area that you want to live within,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.750
and only search for
listings within that area.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.900
You can leave out the shady
parts of the neighborhood.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.640
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.409
Wow, thanks,
I'll be sure to check it out.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.255

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:45.487
&gt;&gt; Let's dive back into
the JavaScript API and

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:48.870
learn how to put such a dope
feature into our site.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.397
Remember that library's parameter we
added earlier into our call to load

00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:53.987
the API?

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:57.469
We're going to load the geometry
library when we load the API by using

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.670
the library's parameter.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.196
Yep, that.

00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:03.146
So a lot like a physical library,

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:07.350
the maps JavaScript API libraries
are full of useful things.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.060
But they're only useful
when you use them.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600
And they take up extra
space if you don't.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.610
Like all of your cookbooks.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.560
It would be a lot better not to have
them sitting around if you're just going

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.060
to get takeout.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.879
With the maps API libraries,
you only load what you need.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.010
So we already have the geometry library
loaded, which allowed us to use that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.130
cool spherical calculation to get
the heading for our street view image.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.580
The geometry library is all about making
it easier to do complicated calculations

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.340
in the mapping space.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.990
Essentially it allows you to skip
the math and let Google do the work for

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.870
you when trying to translate our 3D
world into the 2D mapping space.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.210
There's also the visualization library.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.446
Which it allows you to use your
data set to create heat maps or

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:52.123
other representations
of data concentration.

00:01:52.123 --> 00:01:55.050
Read through the next section to
learn more about those two libraries.
