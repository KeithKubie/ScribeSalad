00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.347
- [Voiceover] In the last video we began

00:00:01.347 --> 00:00:02.478
to see some pretty good evidence

00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:06.757
that DNA was the molecular
basis for inheritance

00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:09.039
and we saw that from the work of Avery,

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.302
McCarthy and McLead where
they tried to identify

00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:15.731
whether it was DNA or proteins that acted

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:17.985
as a transformation principle
in Griffith's experiments

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.568
and I encourage you to watch that video

00:00:20.568 --> 00:00:22.981
if all of this sounds unfamiliar.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.622
But even their work in 1944

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:28.384
was not viewed as conclusive evidence.

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:29.984
It was viewed as strong evidence,

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:32.086
but not conclusive evidence because,

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:33.044
remember how they did it,

00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:35.723
they took the heat killed smooth strain,

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:36.767
the smooth strain you might remember

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.173
from Griffith's experiment
was the virulent one.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.205
The heat killed it.

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:41.865
When you heat kill it in injected amounts,

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:43.182
it didn't do anything to the mouse,

00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:47.328
but if you took the heat
killed smooth strain

00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:50.208
and put it with the rough strain,

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:53.091
it somehow transformed the rough strain

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:55.002
in to the smooth strain,

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.519
in to the virulent strain and so

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.208
they took the heat killed smooth strain

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:00.451
and they took out its different components

00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:01.752
and they eventually were able to isolate

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:05.961
one that was able to
transform the rough strain

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.393
in to the smooth strain by itself

00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:10.512
and then they applied all
sorts of chemical tests to it

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:11.960
and said, "Hey, there's
pretty good evidence

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.158
"that this is DNA,"

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:15.931
but it wasn't conclusive because, well,

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:17.118
maybe they didn't purify it properly

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:18.929
or maybe there was still
a little bit of protein.

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:19.962
Maybe it was mostly DNA, but maybe it was

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:22.374
a little bit of protein
that was still left there

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.911
that actually did the transformation.

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:27.064
So the scientific community,

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:28.359
they weren't just saying,
"Hey, that looks pretty good,

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.373
"Let's move on, let's just assume."

00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:30.339
They wanted to continue to test it

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:33.178
and especially test it in different ways.

00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:35.609
And, the conclusive evidence didn't come

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.106
until a few years later, until 1952

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:42.610
when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.921
decided to study T2 bacterio phage.

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:48.944
Let me write this down.

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:51.493
T2 bacterio phage,

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.382
this is phage that infects bacteria.

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:55.824
Bacterio

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.417
phage.

00:01:58.417 --> 00:01:59.885
When you hear the word phage,

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.855
we're referring to viruses.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.370
Now they knew that T2 bacterio phage

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.370
was composed of proteins and DNA

00:02:10.612 --> 00:02:12.736
and they didn't, well, we now know,

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:17.736
that it's a protein shell
and there's DNA inside,

00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:20.676
but they, from their
point of view, they said,

00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:23.520
"Okay, it's made up and if we try to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.096
"look at the stuff that
this virus is made of,

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:28.335
"it's protein and DNA."

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:32.741
So protein plus DNA,

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:36.226
and they knew that this virus,

00:02:36.226 --> 00:02:37.535
when it infects bacteria,

00:02:37.535 --> 00:02:40.198
it injects something into that bacteria.

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:42.814
So it injects something

00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:48.499
and that something is what

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:53.040
hijacks that bacteria's
genetic information

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.040
to start producing more
of the T2 bacterio phage.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.720
So they could identify the
something that gets injected.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.958
If they could figure out
if that something was

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.779
either a protein or a virus,

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.997
then they would have conclusively proven

00:03:08.997 --> 00:03:11.339
so sorry,

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.037
if they could show that something
was not protein or virus,

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:15.936
if it was protein or DNA,

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:18.203
if they could show that it
was either protein or DNA,

00:03:18.203 --> 00:03:20.361
then they could show conclusively

00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:21.570
that it's either the protein or the DNA

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.193
that forms the molecular basis

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:25.155
and so they're actually quite sceptical

00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:27.651
of Avery, McCarthy and
MacLead's experiments.

00:03:27.651 --> 00:03:29.364
They actually, Hershey and Chase,

00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:32.371
actually thought that they were gonna show

00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:33.449
that it was the protein,

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.536
and remember, this whole
time people were like,

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:36.676
"Protein, we know it's
these complex molecules

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:39.372
"that have these different shapes

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:40.663
"and all these different amino acids.

00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:42.195
"It seems like that's
much more likely to encode

00:03:42.195 --> 00:03:45.255
"the complexity of genetic
information than DNA."

00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:47.438
They didn't have an
appreciation for the structure

00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:50.130
of DNA at this time.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.516
So they devised an
experiment to figure out

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:55.644
what is that something

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:56.994
that the T2 bacterio phage is infecting.

00:03:56.994 --> 00:03:59.983
Is that something protein?

00:03:59.983 --> 00:04:02.368
Is it protein

00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:04.835
or

00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:06.659
DNA?

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:07.898
So this is the question.

00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:09.054
So what they do is

00:04:09.054 --> 00:04:11.984
they take two batches or
they developed two batches

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:14.149
of T2 bacterio phage.

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.956
One batch of the T2 bacterio phage

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:21.948
they do it in the presence
of radioactive phosphorus,

00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:24.778
phosphorus 32.

00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:27.875
In the other batch, I should say

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.754
they grow that T2 bacterio phage

00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:32.536
in the process of another
radioactive isotope,

00:04:32.536 --> 00:04:34.560
but this time it is of sulfur.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.908
This is sulfur 35.

00:04:37.908 --> 00:04:39.754
So why are they doing that?

00:04:39.754 --> 00:04:42.759
Well phosphorus is found in DNA.

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.130
So in this first batch,

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.227
the radioactive marker, you could say,

00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:49.862
is going to incorporate
itself into the DNA.

00:04:49.862 --> 00:04:52.024
In the second batch, sulfur is found

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:54.523
in the protein and not in the DNA

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:58.026
and so this would actually
tag the protein parts.

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:01.163
And if you're wondering, well,

00:05:01.163 --> 00:05:04.220
how do you develop these
radioactive batches,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.391
well, you let the viruses hijack cells

00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:06.659
in a medium that has either
the radioactive sulfur

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.271
or the radioactive phosphorus
and as they reproduce,

00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:13.060
they are going to incorporate
that radioactive material

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.910
into either the protein or
the DNA of the new viruses

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.210
that get produced.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.882
So anyway, they were able to produce some

00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:24.361
of the T2 bacterio phage in the presence

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:26.103
of the radioactive phosphorus

00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:28.550
and they knew that way that the DNA

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.872
would get that radioactive material in it

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.576
and then with the radioactive sulfur

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:34.258
they said the protein would
have that radioactive sulfur.

00:05:34.258 --> 00:05:35.905
And then for each of those batches,

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:40.032
they then infected
bacterio phage with them

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:43.337
and they said, okay, they're
going to inject something

00:05:43.337 --> 00:05:44.445
in to the bacterio phage,
and to figure out what

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:46.911
that something is that was
injected in to the bacterio phage

00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:50.285
they take the products in
either of the two scenarios,

00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:52.941
they first blend 'em up so that all

00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.862
of the stuff that's left outside

00:05:55.862 --> 00:06:00.441
gets taken off of the
surface of the bacteria cells

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.828
and then they stick it in to a centrifuge

00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:04.153
and the centrifuge is, you can imagine,

00:06:04.153 --> 00:06:05.743
it's kind of just a big spinning machine.

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:08.228
If you were to take a test
tube and take it sideways,

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:10.518
one way to think about it,
put it sideways like this.

00:06:10.518 --> 00:06:13.056
Put maybe a stopper in it so nothing leaks

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:15.828
and then you spin it
around really, really,

00:06:15.828 --> 00:06:17.131
really, really fast,

00:06:17.131 --> 00:06:18.600
what you're going to find,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.342
you can actually generate
significant g forces

00:06:20.342 --> 00:06:22.881
and so the heavier stuff
is going to gravitate

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:24.724
to the bottom of the
test tube or to the right

00:06:24.724 --> 00:06:26.342
when it is on its side,

00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:27.942
and the lighter stuff
is going to gravitate

00:06:27.942 --> 00:06:30.455
to the left.

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:33.264
And, it turns out that the bacteria,

00:06:33.264 --> 00:06:34.531
the actual bacterial cells,

00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:36.324
those are heavier so the bacterial cells

00:06:36.324 --> 00:06:39.180
are going to go towards
the bottom of the test tube

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.546
and they're gonna form a material

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:43.502
that we call the pellet

00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:45.533
and then all of the other stuff,

00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:49.369
all of the fluid and
the leftover phage parts

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:52.275
those are going to go up to the top

00:06:52.275 --> 00:06:54.412
of the test tube and we
call that the supernatent.

00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:57.405
I always have trouble pronouncing that.

00:06:57.405 --> 00:06:58.304
Supernatent.

00:06:58.304 --> 00:07:00.565
And so they said, "Look,
if we look at the pellet,"

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:04.070
which they knew had the
bacterial cells int here

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.630
or you could even say the
remnants of the bacterial cells,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.665
"if the pellet here

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:13.327
"contains phosphorus,
that means that the DNA,

00:07:13.327 --> 00:07:15.678
"our radioactive DNA or our tagged DNA

00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:17.946
"made it in to the bacteria,

00:07:17.946 --> 00:07:20.722
"but if it contains sulfur,
that means that the protein

00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:23.066
"made it in to the bacteria."

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:25.912
And, what they found is

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:28.987
they found that the radioactive

00:07:28.987 --> 00:07:33.056
phosphorus

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:37.405
was in the pellet which
allowed them to conclude

00:07:37.405 --> 00:07:39.688
that, hey, it's the DNA from the virus

00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:41.693
that made it inside of the bacteria

00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:43.936
and not the protein

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:46.245
and then they said, "Well, it must be!

00:07:46.245 --> 00:07:48.385
"Wow, the Avery, McCarthy
and Maclead were correct.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:52.548
"It's actually the DNA that is
this transformation principle

00:07:52.548 --> 00:07:57.401
"that can go in and hijack the genetic,

00:07:57.401 --> 00:07:58.656
"the machinery of the bacteria

00:07:58.656 --> 00:08:01.770
"to produce more of the actual virus,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.159
"so this is a really,
really, really big deal."

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:05.591
Once again, we started with

00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:09.356
Mendel saying, "Hey, we have
these inheritable factors

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:13.320
"and they seem to segregate
and sort in certain ways.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.272
"They seem to be discrete."

00:08:16.272 --> 00:08:17.636
Bover and Sutton said, "Hey,

00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:19.020
"chromosomes seem to kind of,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.554
"their behavior during meiosis

00:08:20.554 --> 00:08:21.621
"when cells split

00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:23.440
"seem to kind of match up to that."

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.361
Morgan starts to provide some evidence.

00:08:25.361 --> 00:08:28.068
We have Griffith's
experiments with the mice

00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:31.046
and the bacteria and saying, "Hey, look,

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:32.961
"there's some transformation principle."

00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:35.034
Avery, McCarthy and MacLeod say, "Hey,

00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:37.149
"looks like when we try to really purify

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:38.839
"this transformation principle,

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.311
"it seems like DNA is
what really matters."

00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:44.146
And then Hershey and Chase validate that

00:08:44.146 --> 00:08:47.794
even more conclusively.
