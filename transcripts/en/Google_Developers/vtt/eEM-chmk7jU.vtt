KORY JEFFREY: Greetings
everyone and welcome

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.580
to on-site of Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.480
I'm joined in studio by
Shanea King-Roberson,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.720
a fellow Googler,
a program manager

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.050
and the curriculum director
of the Tech Entrepreneur

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.008
Nanodegree.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:15.487
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yes.

00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:16.445
KORY JEFFREY: Yes, welcome.

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:16.924
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Thank you--

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:17.403
KORY JEFFREY: Welcome.

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:18.361
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
--for having me.

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:18.840
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, no problem.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.190
So tell me a little
bit about yourself.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.439
What did you do before Google?

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.693
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Prior to Google,

00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:26.280
I started a digital marketing
agency with a business partner.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.890
We exclusively helped women
authors, entrepreneurs,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.110
and speakers develop
online presence

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.830
and create social
media strategies.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.550
We also executed for them.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.740
It's been really an
amazing experience

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.139
being able to help entrepreneurs
really craft their message

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:44.680
and really get it out there for
the world to be able to hear.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.386
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.053
Did you do it in the
San Francisco area?

00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:48.552
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
No, I actually

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:50.370
did it in the San
Diego area, and then I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.060
moved around a little bit.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.920
However, what makes internet
and tech businesses so great,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.625
you can be remote from anywhere
and still run your business.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.455
KORY JEFFREY: How did you
transition from that to Google?

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:02.875
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
We were growing.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.390
We still have clients.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.295
If a old client calls, I'm
still definitely there for them.

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:12.430
But an opportunity came
up to be a part of Google.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.810
And Google calls,
so you kind of go.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.960
KORY JEFFREY: How did you
end up within Nanodegree?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.730
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Well, I was actually

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.250
part of the developer
relations release team.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.189
When we decided to
do a restructuring,

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.230
they asked me what I was
really passionate about,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.390
and I ended up being on the
Google Developer Training Team.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.040
It just so happens that they
needed a program manager

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.400
for the Tech
Entrepreneurship Nanodegree.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.770
And I told the lead,
Peter, about it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.930
and my experience
with my own company,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.625
and my passion for helping
get businesses started.

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.250
And he goes, I think
you'll be perfect.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.897
And it's gone on from there.

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:54.438
KORY JEFFREY: Tell me about the
Tech Entrepreneur Nanodegree.

00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:55.330
What does that entail?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.455
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:58.700
So a Nanodegree, just to
give everyone context,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.060
is a collection of courses.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.330
And Google has partnered with
the online learning platform

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.760
Udacity to provide a
collection of courses.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.960
And the Nanodegree itself is
all project-based, interactive

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.355
learning experience where you
have two to three minute videos

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:18.301
followed by immediately
an assessment,

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.019
so that you're
constantly engaged

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.260
and constantly learning.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.060
And then at the end of each
course, you do a project,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.510
and then you do a
final capstone project.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.286
However, all of
the courses and all

00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:32.130
of the content that
make up the Nanodegree

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.540
is available for free.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.626
So the additional services
that Udacity provides,

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:40.360
which is one-on-one
coaching, job placement

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.135
services, a community, that
aspect has an additional fee.

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:47.180
But from Google,
we want everyone

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.756
to be able to
experience our content.

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:51.330
KORY JEFFREY: And is this
Google created content?

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.660
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.159
We did it in
partnership with Google

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.800
so you'll be able to see not
only a lot of Google faces,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.060
such as the program manager
of Google's Launchpad program,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.920
you'll also be able to see a
lot of developer advocates,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.740
myself, my face.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.590
But you also get a chance to
meet other amazing minds that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.560
are in the Silicon Valley area.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.580
Like we've partnered with
the startup company Envision

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.460
to produce rapid prototyping.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.690
We've also done a
bunch of interviews,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.440
such as the CEO of Optimizely.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.770
We've worked with Aaron
Harris from Y Combinator.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.570
We've interviewed
venture capitalists.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.210
We've interviewed
Nir Eyal of the book

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.920
"Hooked-- How to Build
Habit-Forming Products."

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.420
Amazing.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.725
Geoffrey Moore from
"Crossing the Chasm,"

00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:42.850
we've interviewed him, and
it's absolutely amazing.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.000
So it's not just Google,
but brilliant minds

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.157
from all over the tech industry
are able to give entrepreneurs

00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:51.740
the knowledge that they need to
really start their businesses.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.950
KORY JEFFREY: So if we
dive into the content,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.650
it sounds like a little
bit of rapid prototyping,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.360
obviously some marketing with
Geoffrey Moore, some finance

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.100
stuff.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.580
Are there other pillars
that this degree covers?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.705
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:05.240
So we actually start
off with product design.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.390
And product designing goes
back even further than that

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.930
by starting off with ideation.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.930
So even if you haven't
solidified your idea yet,

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.860
we actually teach you how
to come up with an idea

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.690
and validate it in the market
before you ever build anything

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.440
so that you're not
wasting your time.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.670
So we start off with that.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.400
How to build products,
accessible products,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.710
for markets, global markets,
how to design your products

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.440
for local markets as
you expand globally.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.400
Then we go into monetization.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.260
So you actually build
a monetization strategy

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.600
before you build a prototype
because your UI is affected

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.010
by how you decide to monetize.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.760
And what happens to a
lot of entrepreneurs

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.755
is they build this
amazing product

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.880
and then have to go back
and change their interface

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.840
to add ads or new payment
buttons or anything like that.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.630
We want entrepreneurs to start
thinking about those things

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.077
before they ever build
anything so that they are not

00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:02.700
wasting valuable time
or valuable dollars.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.700
KORY JEFFREY: All right.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.530
So looking at the roadmap for
the program, it exists today.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.740
Where is it available?

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.628
How do you sign up?

00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:10.753
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:15.256
The current roadmap is
product design, monetization,

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:19.310
rapid prototyping, then
marketing, and then

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.200
how to get your startup started,
which is all the businessy,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.440
finance stuff.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.980
All of those courses
are available

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.689
at Udacity.com/Google.

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.230
You'll see, when
you go to that page,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.180
you just scroll down to the
Tech Entrepreneur section.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.370
You'll be able to see the
additional services, which

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.299
is called the Tech
Entrepreneur Nanodegree,

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:38.215
but right beside it,
you'll be able to sign up

00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:40.050
for all of the courses
that I just mentioned

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.730
and take all of the
content for free.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.730
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.200
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.910
KORY JEFFREY: So you're
here today at Founder World.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.361
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:47.165
KORY JEFFREY: What is it that
you're trying to accomplish?

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:48.706
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Well, we really

00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:52.440
want to empower entrepreneurs
to be able to not only tell them

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.170
about this amazing content, but
then they can ask me questions.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.230
They can ask my partner
Clark about questions,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.930
who's from Udacity as well.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.830
And people are just
here experiencing,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.450
meeting other people,
networking, getting

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.540
encouragement, learning what's
working for other platforms.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.665
And that's really what you
need as an entrepreneur.

00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:14.410
You need a lot of support,
because it definitely

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.710
gets tough along the way.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.829
So just being able to support
people and answer the burning

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:22.078
questions that they may have
has been really valuable.

00:06:22.078 --> 00:06:23.946
Everyone's been really,
really responsive.

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:24.880
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.350
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.390
KORY JEFFREY: Thank you
so much for joining me.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.210
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Of course.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.334
KORY JEFFREY: Thank you
guys for joining me on-site

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:32.010
at Founder World
in San Francisco.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.360
