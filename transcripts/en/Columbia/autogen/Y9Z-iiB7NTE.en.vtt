nuclear power and you can create the
jobs there so this is a choice and we

00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:21.119
jobs there so this is a choice and we
 

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:24.409

think the choice must be obvious but

00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419
think the choice must be obvious but
 

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:27.619

are gas glut and gas prices is very long
 

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.430
are gas glut and gas prices is very long
now but if China starts importing LNG's

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440
now but if China starts importing LNG's
 

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.670
now but if China starts importing LNG's
this glut will disappear quickly so gas

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680
this glut will disappear quickly so gas
 

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.320

either we don't do anything and we know

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:01.750
either we don't do anything and we know
 

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.270

task which is extremely difficult but

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:11.560
task which is extremely difficult but
 

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.079

price is a very important part of the
 

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.280
price is a very important part of the
necessary incentives but as I said when

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:29.290
necessary incentives but as I said when
 

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:32.010

the technology is primitive you know it
 

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.340
the technology is primitive you know it
cannot really make the changes so the

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:35.350
cannot really make the changes so the
 

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:39.150

into the new technologies or you know

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960
into the new technologies or you know
 

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.990
into the new technologies or you know
not the carbon prices but some

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000
not the carbon prices but some
 

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.340
not the carbon prices but some
incentives or for example for the

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:53.350
incentives or for example for the
 

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:56.250
incentives or for example for the
efficiency part the government can set

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:56.260
efficiency part the government can set
 

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.950

the standard of shields economy
 

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.220
the standard of shields economy
standards interesting it's a very

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:02.230
standards interesting it's a very
 

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:04.530
standards interesting it's a very
important one so you can the government

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:04.540
important one so you can the government
 

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:08.640
important one so you can the government
can force the private sector to to take

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:08.650
can force the private sector to to take
 

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:11.010
can force the private sector to to take
these standards in and there is an

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:11.020
these standards in and there is an
 

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:14.040
these standards in and there is an
implicit price of carbon happens by

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.050
implicit price of carbon happens by
 

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:17.090
implicit price of carbon happens by
doing so so the government can do a lot

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:17.100
doing so so the government can do a lot
 

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.560

depending on the sector depending on a
 

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.470
depending on the sector depending on a
technology you can develop many other

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480
technology you can develop many other
 

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.630
technology you can develop many other
things and on top of that carbon price

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640
things and on top of that carbon price
 

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.990
things and on top of that carbon price
especially this carbon price is useful

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000
especially this carbon price is useful
 

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.900
especially this carbon price is useful
to covering the power sector maybe

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:30.910
to covering the power sector maybe
 

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.850
to covering the power sector maybe
industry part of the very carbon

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:32.860
industry part of the very carbon
 

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.890
industry part of the very carbon
intensive industry but for the

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:34.900
intensive industry but for the
 

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.830
intensive industry but for the
renewables yes it is very important

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:38.840
renewables yes it is very important
 

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.240
renewables yes it is very important
but at the beginning we needs some more

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:42.250
but at the beginning we needs some more
 

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:47.790
but at the beginning we needs some more
yes the stimulus packages was a very

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:47.800
yes the stimulus packages was a very
 

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:52.030
yes the stimulus packages was a very
important step to put some money into

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040
important step to put some money into
 

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.500
important step to put some money into
the renewable so we appreciate the green

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:55.510
the renewable so we appreciate the green
 

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:59.470
the renewable so we appreciate the green
New Deal policies in many countries we

00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480
New Deal policies in many countries we
 

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.600
New Deal policies in many countries we
calculated these impacts and but

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:03.610
calculated these impacts and but
 

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:07.300
calculated these impacts and but
stimulus package is only one time so we

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:07.310
stimulus package is only one time so we
 

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.240
stimulus package is only one time so we
have to say that we have to continue

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:10.250
have to say that we have to continue
 

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:14.500
have to say that we have to continue
these investment in renewables by the

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:14.510
these investment in renewables by the
 

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.020
these investment in renewables by the
government are the seed money and also

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:17.030
government are the seed money and also
 

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:20.170
government are the seed money and also
invite try to make certain framework to

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:20.180
invite try to make certain framework to
 

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.540
invite try to make certain framework to
make private money moving into this

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:22.550
make private money moving into this
 

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.620
make private money moving into this
segment and continuous effort is really

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:26.630
segment and continuous effort is really
 

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:29.350
segment and continuous effort is really
necessary otherwise just investment will

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:29.360
necessary otherwise just investment will
 

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.240
necessary otherwise just investment will
not happen then you create a typical

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:31.250
not happen then you create a typical
 

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.630
not happen then you create a typical
case if government changed policy of in

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640
case if government changed policy of in
 

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.020
case if government changed policy of in
favor of nuclei and not favorable on and

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:38.030
favor of nuclei and not favorable on and
 

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:41.080
favor of nuclei and not favorable on and
off on and off policy then no investment

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:41.090
off on and off policy then no investment
 

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.740
off on and off policy then no investment
happens so predictability for the

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:44.750
happens so predictability for the
 

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.750
happens so predictability for the
certain period time transparent

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760

mechanisms gradually phasing out these

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:49.460
mechanisms gradually phasing out these
 

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.090
mechanisms gradually phasing out these
these these measures this is not

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:52.100
these these measures this is not
 

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.480
these these measures this is not
sustainable if it continue forever so

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:54.490
sustainable if it continue forever so
 

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:57.780
sustainable if it continue forever so
government should set these incentives

00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:57.790
government should set these incentives
 

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:01.000
government should set these incentives
in a very transparent and predictable

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:01.010
in a very transparent and predictable
 

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:04.390
in a very transparent and predictable
manner otherwise investment will not

at this point what's your what's your
 

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.500
at this point what's your what's your
commitment toward that promise and how

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:47.510
commitment toward that promise and how
 

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.320
commitment toward that promise and how
is that going to be without the the work

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:50.330
is that going to be without the the work
 

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.940
is that going to be without the the work

my second question is a bit technical

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:53.990
my second question is a bit technical
 

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:59.260
my second question is a bit technical
but he really feel a field curious about

00:53:59.260 --> 00:53:59.270
but he really feel a field curious about
 

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:03.190
but he really feel a field curious about
is the limitation we might have on

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200
is the limitation we might have on
 

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:07.210
is the limitation we might have on
carbon carbon sequestration we know that

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:07.220
carbon carbon sequestration we know that
 

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:11.400
carbon carbon sequestration we know that
carbon sequestration is is meant to

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:11.410
carbon sequestration is is meant to
 

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:15.130
carbon sequestration is is meant to
inject back co2 into the ground and we

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:15.140
inject back co2 into the ground and we
 

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.750
inject back co2 into the ground and we
know that most of the co2 will be

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760
know that most of the co2 will be
 

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.069
know that most of the co2 will be
produced in the consuming countries

00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079
produced in the consuming countries
 

00:54:18.079 --> 00:54:21.339
produced in the consuming countries
while the co2 can be only injected or

00:54:21.339 --> 00:54:21.349
while the co2 can be only injected or
 

00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:25.210
while the co2 can be only injected or
will be limited to mean sequestration

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:25.220
will be limited to mean sequestration
 

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.660
will be limited to mean sequestration
would be will be limited to with your

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:28.670
would be will be limited to with your
 

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:32.560
would be will be limited to with your
physical constraints yeah my question is

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:32.570
physical constraints yeah my question is
 

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.190
physical constraints yeah my question is
how is the technical feasibility of co2

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200
how is the technical feasibility of co2
 

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.589
how is the technical feasibility of co2
transportation and how you evaluate this

00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599
transportation and how you evaluate this
 

00:54:38.599 --> 00:54:41.770
transportation and how you evaluate this
in your neural organization thank you

issue is that already there's a

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:51.230
issue is that already there's a
 

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:55.359
issue is that already there's a
technology of capturing and co2 but how

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:55.369
technology of capturing and co2 but how
 

00:54:55.369 --> 00:54:58.530

I just have a technical question you
showed us a graph that showed the growth

00:58:11.579 --> 00:58:11.589
showed us a graph that showed the growth
 

00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:15.329
showed us a graph that showed the growth
of the wind energy industry and which I

00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:15.339
of the wind energy industry and which I
 

00:58:15.339 --> 00:58:17.099
of the wind energy industry and which I
believe was twelve percent reach about

00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:17.109
believe was twelve percent reach about
 

00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:21.420
believe was twelve percent reach about
twelve percent by 2050 and as you know a

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:21.430
twelve percent by 2050 and as you know a
 

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:23.670
twelve percent by 2050 and as you know a
major obstacle for renewables and wind

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680

particular is the power infrastructure

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680
particular is the power infrastructure
 

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.640
particular is the power infrastructure
in particular the development of

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:28.650
in particular the development of
 

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:34.769
in particular the development of

and infrastructure so I was wondering if

00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119
and infrastructure so I was wondering if
 

00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:40.609
and infrastructure so I was wondering if
you have any examples of where you see

00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619
you have any examples of where you see
 

00:58:40.619 --> 00:58:43.920
you have any examples of where you see
positive signs and and if you see if

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:43.930
positive signs and and if you see if
 

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.109
positive signs and and if you see if
you're hopeful that this energy

00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119
you're hopeful that this energy
 

00:58:46.119 --> 00:58:49.049
you're hopeful that this energy
infrastructure will change at the pace

necessarily peak oil but how soon are we
no longer talking about excess gas and

no longer talking about excess gas and
 

01:01:45.339 --> 01:01:49.039
no longer talking about excess gas and

but if we consider the conventional gas

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:54.069
but if we consider the conventional gas

but if we consider the conventional gas
or a non conventional oil it is we think

or a non conventional oil it is we think
 

01:01:57.339 --> 01:02:00.329
or a non conventional oil it is we think
it don't have to worry about peak oil a

it don't have to worry about peak oil a
 

01:02:00.339 --> 01:02:04.140
it don't have to worry about peak oil a
peak gas because if we have enough money

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:04.150
peak gas because if we have enough money
 

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:07.109

peak oil or peak gas you know we may
 

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.150
peak oil or peak gas you know we may
have the sources but more costly more

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160
have the sources but more costly more

scenario is not the peak oil scenario
 

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:25.910
scenario is not the peak oil scenario
because now it is demand peak scenario

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920
because now it is demand peak scenario
 

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.100
because now it is demand peak scenario
so how can we make demand peak happened

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:31.110
so how can we make demand peak happened
 

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:34.100
so how can we make demand peak happened
earlier than the supply peak that is
