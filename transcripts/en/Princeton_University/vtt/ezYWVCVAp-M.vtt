Hey, how's it going? I'm Casey Ford Alexander.
I'm a member of the Class of 2010 and I'm

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.250
in "THR 317: Theatrical Design" with a focus
on set design.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
Well, we had two projects this year, and it
was clear even from the first class that this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.419
really wasn't a class about set design, quote-unquote.
It was more about production design and imagining

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:28.630
the entire aesthetic; a look and a feel that
was informed by the text. The first project

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.200
we worked on was Oedipus, and I designed for
a specific space: the Delacorte Theater in

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.300
Central Park. And I was thinking a lot about
textures and landscapes that were informed

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:48.610
by the totally lifeless, dead and post-apocalyptic
setting that was Thebes.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.740
I think it's interesting to set this in his
world, because then you get to see Nina break

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.450
out of it. And so she's the kind of rock chick
rebel I saw her as. I think she goes from

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.070
being this really all-out colorful teenage
rebel into -- she grows up -- she becomes

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.460
a woman. And I think the visual process of
that is seeing her become a lot more monochromatic

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.430
and sexual, as opposed to childish ... a real
world that he never envisaged and I think

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.760
that's where ... there are things that happen
with the chalk markings throughout the play.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.040
But I think the most significant moment is
at the end when Nina erases the things of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.110
her speech that he had written for her to
say.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.550
In my production of The Seagull, actors are
immersed in a white world reminiscent of a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:54.280
rehearsal room or a sound stage.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.820
During Acts I and II, Konstantin projects
images onto a white brick wall to create facsimiles

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:18.280
of the locales in the play. The brick wall
is removed for Acts III and IV. Then, the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:28.370
projected surround becomes the world of the
play.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.510
Overall, it was a fantastic class. We talked
so much more about art and what it means to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.780
tell a story on stage and how to put that
in visuals than we did about how to simply

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.670
building sets, building specific pieces for
the stage. It was a class about exploring

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.121
art, what it means to tell a story through
theater, what it means to make use of the

00:02:53.121 --> 00:03:00.349
pinnacle of human creativity that is theater:
the collaborative art form. So, it was a fantastic

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.910
class, and I enjoyed my time with Riccardo
and with all the classmates who just brought

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.450
such cool energy and cool ideas to the class.
It was a really great experience.
