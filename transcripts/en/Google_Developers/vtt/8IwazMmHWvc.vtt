[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.250
PAVNI DIWANJI: Welcome everyone.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.970
My name is Pavni Diwanji,
I'm a VP of Engineering

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.160
here at Google.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.210
And it is in an
incredible honor for me

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.860
to be introducing this
Women Techmakers Panel.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.060
Women Techmakers, as
you probably know,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.150
was formed by Natalie,
here, and Megan Smith, who

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.480
used to be one of our VPs
of [INAUDIBLE] who's now

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.750
CTO of US, to inspire, to
connect, and to celebrate

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.450
all the developers,
women developers, women

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.030
designers, women entrepreneurs,
all women in tech.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.630
And we are-- we've
done a lot of events

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.400
to really shine the spotlight
on some incredible women.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.800
The last one I had
the honor of attending

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.220
was at the International
Women's Day this year.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.630
And I was blown away.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.550
We had 10,000 women participate.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.370
And it was a truly global event.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.870
We had 128 places where
we hosted these events

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.780
across 50 countries.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.350
So we have a huge
amount of momentum.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.070
And it makes me incredibly proud
when I see the number of women

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.950
at I/O. I think we have grown it
four times in the span of three

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.450
years.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.660
So it is truly a
huge achievement.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.660
And last year we were at I/O,
I was right here on stage

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.310
introducing a robotics
panel, which was also equally

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.090
popular and well-attended.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.680
And this year we have even
a more fun topic for you.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.960
We have today a
balloon team, who--

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.830
which is one of our ambitious
Moonshot projects at Google.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.220
And the question they're
attempting to answer

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.600
is, could we get everyone
connected on the net,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.720
across the globe, no exceptions,
no matter how remote you are?

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.610
So with that, please join me.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.260
I wanted to introduce two of
the extraordinary women of Loon.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.060
One is Sam, who is
an aerospace engineer

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.920
and is working on the
simulation of balloons.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.440
And Wanda, who's a senior
software engineer, and who's

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.079
the mastermind behind the
infrastructure of Loon's

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.630
mission control system.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.010
So please join me in
welcoming them on stage.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.510
Thank you.

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:34.980
SAMEERA PONDA: Thank you Pavni.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.560
So, yeah, we're here
from Project Loon.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.600
I'm Sam.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.540
WANDA HUNG: I'm Wanda.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.070
Hi.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.540
SAMEERA PONDA: And we wanted
to tell you a little bit more

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.670
today about how we engineer
for the stratosphere.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.750
This is the older
deck of our slides.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.196
Sorry, one second.

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.070
This is the old deck.

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:05.685
WANDA HUNG: Sorry for
that interruption.

00:05:08.964 --> 00:05:11.816
SAMEERA PONDA: So are you
guys enjoying I/O so far?

00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:15.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:17.294
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.270
SAMEERA PONDA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.270
WANDA HUNG: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.760
Just keep going.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.630
Just keep going.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.880
SAMEERA PONDA: Do you want to?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.116
I'd rather use the
right deck, but anyway.

00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:35.616
OK.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.492
I don't know what
version this is.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:44.900
WANDA HUNG: We can just go.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.376
Yeah.

00:05:45.376 --> 00:05:46.417
SAMEERA PONDA: All right.

00:05:52.516 --> 00:05:53.480
OK.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.684
All right, so who here has
ever had bad reception?

00:05:57.684 --> 00:05:59.030
Good.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.872
So imagine never having
reception at all,

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:03.080
or having to climb a tree
like that boy in the video,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.776
in order to be able
to get reception.

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:06.650
This is the type of
problem that we're trying

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.700
to solve at Project Loon.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.241
We're trying to
bring internet access

00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:10.650
to everyone in the world.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.240
The video that you just
saw was from a demo

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.230
that we did in Brazil
last year in Agua Fria.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.360
And there were these two
schools in the Amazon.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.440
These kids had never
seen the internet before,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.640
and for two weeks our
team went down there.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.760
We flew a few balloons
over that area.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.550
And these kids were
able to connect

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.130
to the internet
for the first time.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.190
We actually did an
interactive geography lesson

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.824
in their class.

00:06:32.824 --> 00:06:34.240
They were learning
about Portugal,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.531
and they were able to pull
out some maps from Wikipedia

00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:39.460
and some other resources online
to supplement their lecture.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.900
And it was really amazing,
just seeing their reaction,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.770
to be able to see what
the internet can really

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.290
provide for them.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.250
And so that's part of
why we do what we do.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.842
On this map here you
can see that these

00:06:51.842 --> 00:06:53.550
are the areas of the
world that currently

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.130
have internet access, where
internet access is prevalent.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.850
But most of the world
is still in the dark.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.100
Two out of every three
people in the world

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.040
don't have access,
especially people living

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.750
in rural and remote areas.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.620
So this is the problem that we
want to solve at Project Loon.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.600
And access is really
important, because access

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.240
can provide so many
things at your fingertips,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.290
like the world's information
at your fingertips.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.560
All of the resources,
like health information,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.980
educational opportunities,
tools for small businesses,

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.170
just things that you need
to be able to provide

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.390
for you and for your family.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.550
And so the biggest problem
with bringing internet access

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.490
to rural and remote
areas is that

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.930
the current infrastructure,
such as cellular towers,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.400
are really just
not cost effective

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.350
in some of these areas, or
just impossible to install.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.940
Like being able to reach
islands and mountains and areas

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.710
that are very remote,
is very difficult

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.220
to do with just current
ground infrastructure.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.470
And a lot of these areas,
the current solution

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.287
involve using satellites,
which are very expensive.

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:55.120
And most of the people
living in these areas

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.180
are just not able to
afford the connection

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.650
options that are there now.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.510
So at Project Loon,
we decided to try

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.510
this radical new
approach, which is

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.990
to be able to fly
balloons that can float

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.139
in the stratosphere over
some of these areas,

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:09.680
and beam internet
down to the ground,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.162
providing internet connection
at a fraction of the cost

00:08:12.162 --> 00:08:13.245
of current infrastructure.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.780
So how does Loon work?

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.120
The idea behind Loon is that
these balloons will float

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.700
over rural and remote areas.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.170
And as they pass
over these areas,

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.050
users will be able
to connect directly

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.570
from their LTE handsets, so no
special antennas or anything

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.152
is needed.

00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:30.610
You just need your
phone and you'll

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.169
be able to hook up
to Loon internet.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.591
And as each balloon
flies over-- the balloons

00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:36.799
actually move with the winds.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.250
They're constantly in motion.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.250
And so the balloons will be
floating over these areas.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.809
But as one balloon
leaves, we have

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.754
to have another one
come and take its place.

00:08:44.754 --> 00:08:46.920
Which means that we need
to adjust this entire fleet

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.240
of balloons as a network.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.450
And in the stratosphere
we actually

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.499
have winds going in
different directions,

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.290
so depending on what
altitude we're flying,

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.248
we're able to catch
different currents of wind,

00:08:57.248 --> 00:08:59.550
to be able to navigate
these balloons to areas

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.570
that we need to go.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.530
So all of this takes a lot
of effort and computational

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.350
challenges.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.650
And we built a mission
control infrastructure

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.040
that allows us to do
planning and simulation

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.327
and control of these balloons.

00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:13.160
So that's the team that
Wanda and I work on,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.220
and we're going to tell
you a little bit more

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.514
about that today.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.680
So Wanda, she's one of the
senior software engineers

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.400
on our project, and
she's really awesome,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.400
and she's going to tell you
a little bit about Mission

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.080
Control.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.810
WANDA HUNG: Thank you, Sam.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.760
So in my opinion, the coolest
thing about our project

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.820
is that we name our
balloons after birds.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.200
Here is ibis, the
bird, and here's

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.400
our balloon that we built.
It's also named Ibis.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.720
And we build it and launch
into the stratosphere.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.020
It can go as high as 25
kilometers up in the sky.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.470
It's about three times the
height of Mount Everest.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.430
It gets pretty cold up there.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.280
It can get below
80 degrees Celsius.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.740
So we want to make sure that
our balloons can stay healthy.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.170
We have also observed the
balloons going as fast

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.440
as 324 kilometers per hour.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.430
It's about the same speed as the
fastest animal on the planet.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.920
Does anybody have a
guess what that is?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.030
Peregrine falcon can dive
down-- it's also another bird,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.290
in case you don't know.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.410
It dives to catch its prey
over 320 kilometers per hour.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.680
So because it goes
so fast, and it

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.145
gets-- the weather condition
is so cold up there,

00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:30.020
we want to make sure
that our balloons can be

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.870
tracked and also stay healthy.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.500
So our team built a
mission control system

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.250
to monitor its every move.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.530
So when I mentioned
mission control,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.210
this is probably the view
that you have in mind, right?

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.720
Like maybe with some cheering
in the background, hey,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.300
we launched the balloons.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.280
But what we actually built is
a mission control system that

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.720
can run on workstations,
handheld devices,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.760
and cellphones, so that
we can track Ibis anywhere

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.200
we go, at any time.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.190
So it sounds simple enough,
but our mission control system

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.850
is actually quite complicated.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.360
This is a flow chart of only the
high components of our system.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.710
It can do communications
with the balloons, processing

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.660
telemetry, and it
can also monitor

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.470
the health of the balloon,
the simulation navigation

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.560
controlling the balloon,
and a simple UI that

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.810
will be able to help us to be
able to read it more carefully.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.830
So here is a glimpse of
our mission control system.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.810
As you can see, Ibis is
traveling across the Atlantic

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.060
Ocean heading towards
South America.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.150
And the red line shows
the-- the red line

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.510
shows the historical path that
it has traveled in the last 24

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.070
hours.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.560
And the pink line is
the predicted trajectory

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.397
of this balloon in
the next several days.

00:11:51.397 --> 00:11:52.980
So we actually make
predictions, which

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.100
I'm going to talk about
later on in this talk.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.690
So we want-- our
primary customer

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.550
for the mission control systems
are flight engineers, who

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.597
work 24/7 to monitor our
fleet of balloons in the air.

00:12:04.597 --> 00:12:06.180
So we want to make
sure they're happy,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.990
and we also want to make
their lives a little easier,

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.260
so they're not staying up all
night monitoring our balloons.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:17.980
So we built several
features to enhance this.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.770
So in this picture,
in this screenshot,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.630
basically the lines here
represent the air traffic

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.530
control center boundary.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.560
So they can monitor
and make sure

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.700
that our balloon,
Ibis, is not entering

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.020
another airspace anytime soon.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.660
And when our mission
control system

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.450
detects that the balloon
is about to enter

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.570
another airspace, it
will automatically

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:43.690
generate a flight control plan
and email it to the next air

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.670
traffic control center.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.770
And our flight
engineer on call will

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.170
be able to get an
automatic alert,

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.990
so they can start calling
the local authority

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.240
and start doing the
coordination to make sure

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.730
that they're aware of our
balloon entering their space.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.670
So now that you have seen how we
track our balloons and monitor

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:09.410
them, we do have some stuff
that we cannot easily monitor

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.110
directly.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.910
So Sam is going to tell you
a little bit about how we

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.500
diagnose these kind of cases.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.000
Go ahead.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.710
SAMEERA PONDA: Yes,
so as Wanda mentioned,

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.430
our balloons are 20 kilometers
up in the stratosphere.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.970
The environment there
is very cold and harsh.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.920
And we only really get
very limited information

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.310
from our sensors.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.397
So we fly different sensors,
like GPS and pressure sensors.

00:13:36.397 --> 00:13:37.980
But there's a whole
lot of other stuff

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.188
that we want to be able to
estimate about our balloon

00:13:40.188 --> 00:13:40.810
state.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.109
So I've been working on
different estimation algorithms

00:13:43.109 --> 00:13:45.650
that we can use to try to figure
out things like temperature,

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.950
and how much gas we have
left in the balloon.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.650
And I'm going to go over a
couple of these examples,

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.262
the more interesting
ones, I think, next.

00:13:53.262 --> 00:13:54.720
So one of the most
important things

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.550
that we need to
figure out is how long

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.674
our balloons are going to
be able to last up there,

00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:00.230
what is our balloon lifetime?

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.600
And since we want our balloons
to be able to last up there

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.490
for hundreds of days, we've
designed super pressure

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:06.990
balloons.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.210
So this means that the
gas inside the balloon

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.090
is at a higher pressure
than the ambient,

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.130
and the gas
particles are pushing

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.300
against the walls of the
balloon, giving it its shape.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.300
Now the pressure
inside the balloon

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.210
depends on both
temperature and the amount

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.127
of gas in the balloon.

00:14:21.127 --> 00:14:23.251
When it's really hot, or
when there's too much gas,

00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:24.810
the balloon could
potentially burst.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.630
So it's really
important to know what

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.046
temperatures we're
going to expect

00:14:28.046 --> 00:14:29.810
to see during the
course of our flight,

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.990
in order to decide how much lift
gas to fill the balloon with.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.460
Conversely, when
it gets too cold,

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.560
or if we've lost too
much gas, the balloon

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.640
could actually lose
pressure, especially

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.040
at night time when it gets cold.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.260
And it could essentially not
provide buoyancy anymore,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.740
by not having its
fully inflated volume.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.214
So this is also undesirable.

00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:51.630
So we need to be able to monitor
these two quantities very

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.470
carefully.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.280
But they're very
difficult to estimate up

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.460
in the stratosphere.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.730
So the traditional methods
of measuring temperature,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.270
like putting a thermostat
on your wall in your house,

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.600
don't really work
in the stratosphere.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.919
We're above 95%
of the atmosphere,

00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:07.710
so the air is really,
really thin up there.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.540
So the thermostat on
your wall works mainly

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.660
through convection, air
rushing past the sensor

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.868
will-- you'll be able to
read the ambient temperature

00:15:13.868 --> 00:15:14.470
of the air.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.830
But for us, we're
measuring mostly radiation.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.230
And so as the sun comes
up and shines directly

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.160
onto the sensor,
you're actually reading

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.140
more of the radiation
of the sun then

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.950
you are the lift gas
temperature inside the balloon.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.750
So the red line
over here shows you

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.150
the readings from our
sensor, and the blue line

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.840
is actually closer to what
our balloon temperature is.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.830
So the sensor's kind of
useless during the day,

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.630
which is a problem.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.470
So in order to fix this,
I built this thermal model

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.540
that essentially takes in
all the sources of heat that

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.610
affect our balloon.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.650
So things like the
radiation from the sun;

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.340
the earth, which is like a giant
space heater heating us up;

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.710
and then also interactions of
the balloon skin with the film.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.530
So the way our balloon
temperature works,

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.490
it's similar to a car in a
parking lot on a hot day.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.416
Like when you go to open
the door of your car,

00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:02.040
it's really, really
hot inside your car

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.730
compared to the outside air.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.500
So our balloons
similarly take in a lot

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.620
of the radiation of
the sun during the day,

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.604
and get really hot.

00:16:08.604 --> 00:16:10.020
And then at night,
especially when

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.900
we're flying over
clouds, which block

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.820
the radiation from the earth,
we can get really, really cold.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.500
So using all these
inputs together we

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.940
can actually model
very well what

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.505
the temperature the balloon is.

00:16:20.505 --> 00:16:22.380
And once we know
temperature, we can actually

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.180
infer how much gas we have left.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.840
And by tracking
this day after day,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.810
we can see what
lift rates we have,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.060
and project forward to see
how long our balloons are

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.220
going to last.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.140
So here's a few
examples of the graph

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.070
that-- of the different
graphs that come out

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.770
of our estimation algorithms.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.870
You can see
temperature on the top;

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.220
and then pressure as it
decreases over the balloon

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.360
lifetime and gas level;
and finally, the estimate

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.300
of how much lifetime
we have left.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.810
Another really
important quantity

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:54.080
that we would like to know is
the state of our batteries.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.397
Our balloons are 20
kilometers up in the air.

00:16:56.397 --> 00:16:57.980
You can't really
plug them into a wall

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.030
and charge them overnight,
and so we actually

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.370
need to be able to provide
all of our own power.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.006
So we fly solar panels that
can capture energy of the sun

00:17:05.006 --> 00:17:06.880
during the day, and
store it in our batteries

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.569
to be able to operate all
of our systems at night.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.730
And also do different maneuvers.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.310
And monitoring our power is
actually really complicated.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.626
Our systems are very complex.

00:17:17.626 --> 00:17:19.000
We have several
different boards,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.050
lots of different sensors, we
have batteries, we have solar.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.490
And we also have
heaters on board

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.000
that turn on when it's cold.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.589
And so predicting how much
all of these components

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.669
are going to consume
is quite difficult.

00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:33.210
And then batteries are actually
very, very difficult to model

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:33.930
as well.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.430
This curve on the
top here shows you

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.290
all of the different
discharge curves,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.860
for the exact same
battery, but just

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.010
under different temperature
and load conditions.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.890
And there's about
a 35% difference

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.664
in-- depending on whether
the battery's cold or hot.

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:47.080
So batteries do
not like the cold,

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.557
and actually perform
quite poorly in the cold.

00:17:49.557 --> 00:17:51.640
And we need to be able to
estimate our temperature

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.931
for our battery, as well as
how much state of charge we

00:17:53.931 --> 00:17:57.930
have left, under all of these
different varying conditions.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.130
So my team and I build a
state of charge estimator

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.880
that actually works a lot
better than our old system.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.470
Before, we used to use a
chip that was designed mainly

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.157
for cellphones.

00:18:06.157 --> 00:18:08.240
It's very similar to the
chip that your cell phone

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.448
would use to tell you how
much battery you have left.

00:18:10.448 --> 00:18:13.660
And the operating
conditions of our balloon

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.810
involve really, really
extreme temperatures.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.936
So the chip was really
not performing very well.

00:18:18.936 --> 00:18:21.060
So we had to build our own
in-house state of charge

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.150
estimator that performs a
lot better than the system

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.185
that we were using before.

00:18:26.185 --> 00:18:27.560
And then the second
piece of this

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.470
is modeling how much
solar power we're

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.860
going to get from our panels.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.370
This is actually
fairly complicated,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.157
because it involves
trying to figure out

00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:37.490
what the solar elevation will
be for different latitudes

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.850
and longitudes; how much the
atmosphere is going to affect

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.740
the solar radiation,
and how much attenuation

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.073
we're going to get from that;
what our balloon shadow is

00:18:45.073 --> 00:18:45.872
going to look like.

00:18:45.872 --> 00:18:47.580
So actually, when you
put it all together

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.430
you end up with this
Batman-looking curve,

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.130
where as the sun comes up, you
get more and more radiation

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.860
and less attenuation from
the atmosphere, which

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.540
causes the initial rise.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.969
And then after a certain
level of elevation,

00:19:00.969 --> 00:19:03.010
the balloon will actually
kind of come in the way

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.830
and cast a shadow on the panels.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.320
So that causes the drop, the
ear of Batman in the curve

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.039
there that you see.

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:11.830
And so putting it all
together, we actually

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.980
have a fairly decent idea of
how much power we're going

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.350
to be generating and consuming.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.933
And we can use this
in our simulations

00:19:16.933 --> 00:19:18.790
to predict our power
budget, and how much we

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.230
have available for maneuvers.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.840
So once we know what the health
and the state is of the system,

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.340
we also need to
be able to predict

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.240
where Ibis is going
to go, and how we're

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.740
going to navigate
to different areas

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.490
to be able to provide
continuous coverage.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.980
So Wanda's going to tell you
a bit about our simulations.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.720
WANDA HUNG: So in
order to navigate Ibis

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.752
to a desired location to
provide continuous coverage,

00:19:41.752 --> 00:19:43.460
we have to first be
able to predict where

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.260
it's going to go in the future.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.770
So by doing that, our balloons
actually fly with the wind.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.240
So to do that, we actually
try to get information

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.080
like the wind data
from NOAA, which

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:58.650
stands for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.330
The data that we get from
NOAA is public information,

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.050
and it is available to pilots.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.270
It tells us about the
speed and the direction

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.700
of the wind in the air
at different levels

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.600
of the stratosphere, actually.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.670
So here's actually a
visualization of a wind map

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.500
that we built for cubic--
a small cubic area

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.250
in the sky, that basically tells
us where the wind is actually

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.130
going.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.220
So we fetch the forecast wind
from NOAA every six hours,

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:34.000
and the data that we get
contains 16 days of data

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.080
in the future.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.150
So basically we have
to build lots and lots

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.950
of these maps that
cover the entire surface

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.560
of the earth for the next
16 days, every six hours.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.530
That's a lot of data
and a lot of processing.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.280
But the good thing is
that we work for Google,

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.190
so we have a lot of
computer resources

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.130
that we can utilize here.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.700
So here is a simulation
trajectory of Ibis.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.310
The black arrows,
basically, point

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.060
is the wind direction and
the speed at that position.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.700
And as you can see, the red
arrow's the movement of Ibis

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.230
as it flies with the wind.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.270
So besides the position,
the altitude information,

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:19.170
and the wind data, we
also consider things

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.090
like the battery power,
the health condition

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.940
of the balloon, to determine
the balloon duration while we're

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.400
making this type of prediction.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.460
With the knowledge
of the wind patterns,

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.350
and ability to navigate the
balloons to get to a desired

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.580
location to provide
coverage, we can basically

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.080
move the balloon up and down,
in this case, to do navigation.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.310
So in this picture we
have a reachability map

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.550
that we built for Ibis,
at different levels

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.940
of the stratosphere.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.064
So each one of these
paths basically--

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.730
each one of these
trajectories basically

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:02.040
represents the Ibis's path
at that altitude level.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.070
And so basically at each
point of the computation,

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.530
we can decide which
level of altitude

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.115
we want to move Ibis to, to
get to a desired location.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.490
So my team have actually
built lots and lots

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.910
of these algorithms,
to try to navigate

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.700
the balloons optimally.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.010
So this one algorithm that
we use in this example,

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.570
is called the crazy
simple planner.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:34.690
And what it does is simply uses
a form of heuristic spanning

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.350
tree search algorithm, to try
to find the most optimal path

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.990
from one location to another.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.800
So in this case, we're
trying to find the cheapest

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.880
cost trajectory.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.980
And it's defined by the user.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.890
The cost can be defined as
either the destination that you

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.870
want to get to, or the
altitude band that you

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.160
want to keep the balloons at.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.210
Or it can also be
the power consumption

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.582
to get to a location.

00:23:01.582 --> 00:23:03.040
In this particular
example, we want

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.060
to try to find the shortest
path from Australia

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.610
to Christ Church in New Zealand.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.730
So the white lines here indicate
all the possible trajectories.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:17.530
And the red line is the one that
our algorithm, our crazy simple

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.810
planner, has selected to
be the most optimal path.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.790
So everything
looks great, right?

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.810
We want to direct the
balloons to New Zealand,

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.110
and it's doing that.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.140
But life is not
that simple, right?

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.540
Because the wind is forecast,
it's never totally accurate.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.120
So we want to plan
for the uncertainty.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.550
One of my colleagues actually
built a wind noise model,

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.680
that will be able to kind
of throw us off a little bit

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.550
when we're doing the
simulations and prediction.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.860
So the red lines here represent
all the possible trajectories

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.100
at that altitude level, if we
are trying to simulate balloons

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.190
at that level.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.580
And the blue line is for a
complete different altitude.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.350
So for our stochastic
planning algorithm,

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.550
we tried to find the best
fit for that altitude

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.150
by throwing in some wind noise.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.170
So now that we can navigate
Ibis to Christ Church,

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.080
what happens if it leaves?

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.480
Are we going to get
interrupted internet coverage?

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.420
We want to make sure that
when a balloon leaves,

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.130
another balloon,
let's say Merlin,

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.910
is going to come in and provide
coverage for the people below.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:33.550
So we have to provide another
mechanism to flock entire fleet

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.060
of balloons from place
to place, in order

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.580
to provide continuous coverage.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.980
So in order to validate our
fleet planning algorithm,

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.340
I built an analysis
planning framework

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.630
that will be able to-- sorry.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.660
That will be able to
run a sizable fleet,

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.140
and simulate it,
and be able to do

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.920
some analysis over our
algorithms to make sure

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.480
that it's doing
what we're thinking

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.140
it's doing, under a
reasonable amount of time.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.430
Because it's easier
to do simulations,

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.100
but it's not easy
to actually run

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.050
thousands and thousands
of these balloons

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.430
under a certain amount of time.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.490
So in this example,
this is generated

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:21.110
by my planning framework, we're
trying to launch Australia.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.250
We're trying to launch
out of Australia,

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.460
and to cover the
coverage in Chile.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.840
And in this picture,
you can see the small--

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.250
like a couple dozen
balloons are coming out

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.210
of Australia, heading over to
Chile at different directions,

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:40.240
because the wind is actually
going different directions.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.140
So this tool will help us to
be able to predict the wind

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.660
patterns at different
times of the year.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.060
And we can also try to do this
in various different ways,

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.720
so that we can launch balloons
out of different cities

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.090
and be able to evaluate
the different launch

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.630
sites for our experiments.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.904
And in this example,
we're flocking

00:26:01.904 --> 00:26:04.070
the entire fleet of balloons
and trying to keep them

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.570
around the equator.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.320
And Ibis is going out
of course a little bit,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.270
so we-- our planning
algorithm actually

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.340
tried to redirect
it back on course.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.480
So in our most recent
long distance LTE test,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.550
we were able to launch one
balloon out of New Zealand.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.730
And it went around the world,
over a 20,000 kilometers,

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.750
and be able to come in within
500 meters of ground distance,

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.554
and provide over two hours
of internet connection.

00:26:33.554 --> 00:26:36.446
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.840
It was a huge
success for our team.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.090
So in the future
we're hoping to fly

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.000
like thousands of
these balloons,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.590
and be able to have
this kind of success.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.850
But that also means we have
to hire more flight engineers.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.240
So to make them happy,
we want to make sure

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.970
that we can actually automate
a process of navigating

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.760
our balloons.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.940
So my colleagues and I
built an automation--

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.530
a flight automation
system, that will

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.800
be able to automatically
control the balloons to go

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.760
up and down, in order to
reach its prospective goals.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.420
So with the system
that we've built,

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.040
we're hoping that it's a
small step toward providing

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.360
continuous coverage for
remote areas like Agua Fria,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.910
that you saw earlier
in the video.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.280
We want to bring
internet to every one

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.770
everywhere, like for
those kids that you saw.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.680
We want them to learn, not
just as students, but also

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.090
as human beings in this world.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.800
Like all of us here.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.869
Thank you very much.

00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:36.910
SAMEERA PONDA: Thank you.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:46.982 --> 00:27:48.690
WANDA HUNG: So now
we're going to welcome

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.740
our moderator, Natalie,
and a few other ladies

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:59.845
from Project Loon to
answer a short Q&amp;A.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:00.970
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Thanks.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:01.470
Good job.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.340
Really good job.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.981
All right, so-- I think you
guys are right over here.

00:28:05.981 --> 00:28:06.480
Go ahead.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.480
We'll do a little dance.

00:28:11.622 --> 00:28:13.350
Hey everyone, I'm Natalie.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.165
Can we have another round of
applause for unexpected slides

00:28:16.165 --> 00:28:17.426
popping up?

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:19.866
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.630
I think you navigated that just
as well as you do the balloons.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.790
Very, very nicely done.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.360
So my name is
Natalie Villalobos.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.420
I run the Women Techmakers
program at Google,

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.930
as Pavni mentioned.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.450
And the whole purpose
of Women Techmakers

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.230
is to increase the visibility,
community, and resources

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.620
for women in technology.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.680
And so I have the
pleasure of sitting down

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.280
with some of the
world's innovators

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.020
and sharing their
knowledge with you.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.820
So we've collected some
questions from friends

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.855
out at I/O and on
the web, and I want

00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:54.770
to get started with
a couple good ones.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.900
So we've heard some of the
computational challenges

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.460
that you went over in the talk.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.230
Can you tell me a bit about
the operational challenges?

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.750
And I'm going to skip back.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.870
Who are you?

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.037
Let's start from the end.

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:08.870
MARIA: Hi, everyone.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.770
My name is Maria.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.340
I have been at Google
for almost four years.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.460
And I joined Project
Loon last July

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.715
as a technical program manager,
working on the avionics team.

00:29:21.715 --> 00:29:23.340
TAMERON STUBER: Hi,
I'm Tameron Stuber.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.930
I'm a program manager focused
on manufacturing operations

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:26.430
of Loon.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.170
I've been on the project
for about three years.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:30.550
OLIVIA: And I'm Olivia.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.520
I work on scaling operations,
mainly at the intersection

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.859
between hardware and operations.

00:29:35.859 --> 00:29:37.650
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Now we can get started.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.149
So.

00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:39.780
Computational challenges.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.670
But can you tell me some of
the operational challenges,

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.200
because this isn't
just a two woman show.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.140
I mean, Loon is a huge team,
but specifically, some of you

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.490
focus on the operational side.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:51.110
So can you speak to that?

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.300
OLIVIA: Sure.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.890
Like I mentioned, I work
on scaling operation.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.920
So one of the bigger challenges
is how do we actually

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.244
launch at scale.

00:30:00.244 --> 00:30:02.410
Not only do we need to
figure out where in the world

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.330
we launch these from, by
studying ground weather

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.732
patterns; where wind
speeds are lowest,

00:30:08.732 --> 00:30:10.940
so that our balloons don't
turn into giant spinnakers

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.430
when we launched them;
where it doesn't rain,

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.510
so our electronics don't
freeze; where there

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.680
isn't a lot of cloud cover.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.000
So that's one big thing.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.920
And then we also just
engineered something

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.730
called the bird house, which
is a 50-foot tall mobile boat

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.190
hoist that we engineered to
actually automatically launch

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.760
our balloons.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.140
So taking our 45 minute,
15 person operations

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.860
crew down to four people,
monitoring our launching.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.481
It's pretty incredible.

00:30:43.481 --> 00:30:44.522
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:30:44.522 --> 00:30:46.220
It's like great sign
of optimization.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.490
So what are the
challenges involved

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.730
in building the balloons,
actually constructing them,

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.390
the components that
have to keep them

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.470
in the air for
the next 100 days?

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.880
TAMERON STUBER: So
there's actually

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.290
a lot of challenges with
manufacturing the balloons.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.090
There's a very small
industry of balloon makers.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.180
There's only a handful
of companies that

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.964
are scattered across the world.

00:31:02.964 --> 00:31:04.880
And the traditional
process for balloon making

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.450
is quite manual and artisan.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.720
And nobody's ever really
had to build at the scale

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.500
that our project's demanding.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.660
So we're quite literally
pushing the envelope

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.596
of current industry standards.

00:31:15.596 --> 00:31:17.797
So once we graduated
out of being

00:31:17.797 --> 00:31:19.380
just this harmless
science experiment,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.930
as we used to call
ourselves, we really

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.740
started looking at how we can
really scale the manufacturing

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.770
process.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.630
So we really started looking at
every industry for inspiration

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.250
of how to automate, how to
scale, how to improve quality.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.220
Because these
balloons are massive.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.590
They're about 45,000 cubic
feet, and they're made up

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.820
of 1.5 mil polyethylene.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.580
So they're actually
a pretty fragile,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.720
and they can be brought down
by just a small pinhole.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.650
So a good comparison
that we like

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.170
to make of how we
manufacture this

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.680
is how you would
manufacture a parachute.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.390
You can't really test it
right before you use it,

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.280
so you have to instill a
lot of quality processes,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.400
all these control checks during
the manufacturing process

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.470
before-- so, to guarantee
that it will work.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.720
So there's a lot of challenges,
and there's not really

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.570
this clear path laid out for us.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.485
But honestly, that's
what makes it fun.

00:32:12.485 --> 00:32:13.860
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So, and these

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.190
are open for anyone
on the panel,

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.898
how do you get them
the last for so long?

00:32:16.898 --> 00:32:20.600
100 days is a pretty long
time, and Mother Nature

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.180
is obviously also an obstacle.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.480
So longevity, how do
we make it happen?

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.640
TAMERON STUBER: So kind of
what I just spoke about.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.180
Honestly it's really having
this strong eye of detail.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.170
We've pulled from a lot of--
just even paying attention

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.840
to-- so these were pretty
manual for the first year.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.620
And we actually had
a team of people

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.080
that were building
these balloons

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.640
and actually having to
crawl on top of them.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.719
So we realized that we were
getting these little pricks,

00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:49.510
they were kind of in
the shape of toenails.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:53.680
So we actually had them wear
these little fluffy fleece

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.550
sock.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.285
So it's like that
little eye of detail,

00:32:56.285 --> 00:33:01.600
of looking at everything
to get them to stay up.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.470
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And so, kind of arising

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.210
from the operational
creation side,

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.250
can you tell me what's your
favorite story about your time

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.965
being on Project Loon?

00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:13.897
It's like nervous laughter.

00:33:13.897 --> 00:33:14.730
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.780
TAMERON STUBER: I
mean, so there's

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.920
a lot that we can't share.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.659
One that I can share
that was pretty hilarious

00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:29.200
was actually-- so we actually
started building these balloons

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.350
in-house, by a team
of scrappy engineers

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.010
of different backgrounds.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.786
And so we were building
the prototypes in-house.

00:33:37.786 --> 00:33:39.160
And we'd get them
off the ground,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.410
they wouldn't make it too far.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.464
But as they started
kind of scouring

00:33:42.464 --> 00:33:43.880
the distance of
the United States,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.340
we were tracking one that had
kind of reached its farthest.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.030
It was actually over Kentucky.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.550
We started getting these
YouTube alerts of UFO sightings.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:57.212
And actually in
their local news,

00:33:57.212 --> 00:33:58.920
they actually were
having a UFO sighting.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.610
And it had this
image of our balloon.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.289
So that was one of
my fonder moments.

00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:05.330
MARIA: There's actually
a whole website, I think,

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.080
dedicated to the--

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.871
TAMERON STUBER: You
guys should look it up.

00:34:07.871 --> 00:34:09.589
MARIA: --the UFO sightings.

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:12.366
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So I was
also told about Batman symbols.

00:34:12.366 --> 00:34:13.199
SAMEERA PONDA: Yeah.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
I mean, you already

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.489
referenced Batman in your slide.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:17.920
But I think that there's some
other story about Batman.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.503
SAMEERA PONDA: Well,
so internally, we

00:34:19.503 --> 00:34:22.630
call Sergey Batman, just because
he's kind of cool and awesome.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.010
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Sergey Brin.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.468
SAMEERA PONDA: I
don't even-- yeah,

00:34:24.468 --> 00:34:27.460
Sergey Brin, the Google founder,
who is in charge of [x].

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:30.080
And so, I'm not even sure
he's aware of the nickname.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.429
But anyway, for April Fools'
Day, one of our UI engineers

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.340
changed all of the
symbols of our balloons

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.750
into Batman symbols.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.529
So on our live
mission control map,

00:34:38.529 --> 00:34:40.320
you could just see a
lot of Batman symbols,

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.589
instead of balloons.

00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:42.630
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Nice.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.059
And cool.

00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:44.850
I really like that.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.800
So what, kind of flipping
back, what do you

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.889
characterize as your
team's biggest challenge?

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:53.239
So clearly, you're
testing, you're iterating,

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:55.179
and you're having
fun along the way.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.280
But what are some of the
challenges that you face,

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.120
and what was a success
that eventually

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.125
overcame that challenge?

00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:03.500
MARIA: Yeah, I
can take that one,

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.499
it speaks a little more
on the engineering side.

00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:09.340
So the diversity
of work, as we have

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.030
heard from this
panel, that's required

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.700
to make Project Loon a
success is really enormous.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.102
Sundar touched on this
yesterday in his keynote.

00:35:19.102 --> 00:35:21.470
The biggest-- some of
the biggest challenges

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.489
are the balloon
duration, the range,

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:27.030
and the bandwidth of the signal
that we're trying we provide.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.210
As well as balloon-to-balloon
communication.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.080
So the last one is
particularly important

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.790
because, in order to meet
our really ambitious goals

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:39.850
of providing
internet for all, we

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:43.750
need to essentially create a
network of balloons in the sky,

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:47.630
just like there is currently
a network on the ground.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.790
And the technical
challenges, to be

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.230
able to send and receive
signals between balloons

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.220
is one certain challenge.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:02.740
But to be able to launch the
hardware, make it operational,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.350
and provide the high
quality and high accuracy

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:11.640
signal 60,000 feet in the air
in environmental conditions

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.630
that are essentially
alien for us,

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:17.590
that's a really,
really different ball

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.080
game, essentially.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.090
But we're making it happen.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.310
We proved that it works.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:28.560
And as some would put it,
it's frickin' awesome.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.330
Pretty good.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:34.230
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So when--
I was talking to Pavni earlier,

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:37.400
and she focuses on our
Google for Kids effort.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.880
And we're doing a lot this year.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.230
We did last year, we
did and I/O Youth,

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.210
where we engage young minds
into what we're all developing.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.460
Because they're going to
grow up, and they're going to

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.440
inherit this world from us.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.190
I

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:52.420
To those young people that
might ask this question,

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.000
did you always want to
be an aerospace engineer?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.240
What did you want to be
when you were younger?

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.960
What did you think you
would grow up to be?

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.420
SAMEERA PONDA: Well I never
really wanted to grow up.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.080
And fortunately, as a Google
engineer, I haven't had to.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.880
But yeah, I know.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.190
I always really liked
math and science.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.370
And I didn't really
know what engineering

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.780
was when I was in school.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.190
I figured I wanted to be a
physicist or a scientist.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:20.670
And after going to college
and just kind of checking out

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.240
some of the
engineering classes, I

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.370
found it a lot more appealing
to have science as applied

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.234
to making something,
something tangible.

00:37:27.234 --> 00:37:29.400
Where it really feels like
you're playing with toys.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.390
You're building and
creating something new.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:35.450
And so yeah, I fell in love
with engineering right there.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.380
WANDA HUNG: So for me, I
was actually pretty mad

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.310
all through half of
my college years.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.510
And then I took computer
science classes, as an elective,

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.657
and I loved it.

00:37:46.657 --> 00:37:47.865
So it was really interesting.

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:50.434
And I just continued
down that path.

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:51.680
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Olivia?

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.680
OLIVIA: So I wanted to
be professional horseback

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.060
rider when I was
a kid, which makes

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.480
sense why I'm at Google now.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.540
But I didn't want to
specialize in anything.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.710
And being on a team that's
doing something that's never

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.400
been done before makes
me come to work and get

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.440
challenged every day,
and learn something new.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.190
And I get to try everything.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.140
And that's really satisfying.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.959
So I haven't had
to grow up, either.

00:38:17.959 --> 00:38:20.250
TAMERON STUBER: Well actually,
I wanted to be a fashion

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.545
designer since I was eight.

00:38:21.545 --> 00:38:23.920
And that's actually what I
went to school for, and worked

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.620
in the fashion industry
for the first couple years.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.645
But it just wasn't quite right,
and wasn't quite feeding me

00:38:29.645 --> 00:38:31.270
in the way that I
wanted it to feed me.

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.885
So I stayed really open,
and was just trusting

00:38:33.885 --> 00:38:36.010
and hoping that the right
thing would come forward.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.670
And actually my apparel
construction skills

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:41.026
were what led me to get
recruited onto this project.

00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:42.400
So I thought it
was a good lesson

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.360
of following your
passions but staying open,

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.326
and not always having
to have it figured out.

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:49.540
So, it's been great.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.790
MARIA: Yeah, I didn't know
what I wanted to be either.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.920
When I was in school,
I was just one

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.520
of those people that try
to do-- try to do my best

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.300
and just work extremely hard.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.869
But one of the qualities,
I guess, that I've had

00:39:02.869 --> 00:39:04.410
and I have kept, is
just really being

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:08.134
open to different opportunities,
different experiences,

00:39:08.134 --> 00:39:09.550
trying to be
flexible in that way.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.700
So I remember a kind
of a turning point

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.780
for me was back in high school.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.680
My junior-- after
my junior year,

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.360
the summer, that
summer there was

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.960
a program that was sponsored
by the New Jersey government

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.640
at Rutgers University
called the Governor's School

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.890
of Engineering and Technology.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.550
So being part of that
one month long program

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.910
was kind of the first
time that I got exposed

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.660
to engineering principles.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.090
I was taught how to--
you know, the concepts

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.220
of abstraction and
logical thinking

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.440
that comes with programming.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.610
And also how to build
something physical.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.600
We were using Lego Mindstorms.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.070
That really attracted
me to the sort of field.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.380
Also doing that
together in a team,

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.790
and I was kind hooked
on tech since then.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.040
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Wonderful.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.297
So I know I speak
on behalf of Pavni,

00:40:05.297 --> 00:40:06.630
and thank everyone in this room.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:11.180
Thank you so much for leading
this new field of innovation.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.170
And we look forward to
seeing more of what you

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.336
create in the years to come.

00:40:14.336 --> 00:40:15.930
Thank you.
