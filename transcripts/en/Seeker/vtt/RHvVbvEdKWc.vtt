00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:08.044
Everyone loves midnight snacks.

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:11.815
But you need to sTOP BECAUSE IT’S MAKING
YOU FAT.

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:17.184
Hey guys, Catie here for DNews.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.365
Are you concerned about your waistline?

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:20.365
Of course you are.

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:21.365
Everyone is.

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:22.365
There is no escape.

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:26.685
Well a new study done by researchers at the
Salk Institute shows that consuming your food

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:31.035
within a limited time frame could not only
help reverse the effects of obesity but the

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.385
effects of diabetes as well.

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:34.485
At least in mice.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:43.025
Satchidananda Panda, the professor who lead
the study, conducted a similar study in 2012

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.965
wherein he fed 100 mice identical high-fat,
high calorie diets.

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:50.575
One group was allowed to consume the food
whenever they wanted, while the other group

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:53.855
could eat as much as they wanted, but only
within an 8 hour time frame.

00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:54.875
One of the groups fattened up.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:57.025
I’ll bet you can guess which one.

00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:59.545
But in this new study things got a little
more complicated.

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:03.985
The study was done on nearly 400 mice of different
sizes, ranging from normal to obese.

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:08.775
He fed the mice different kinds of diets consisting
of high fat, fat and sucrose or just fructose.

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:12.865
And the final difference was there were varying
time restrictions instead of just the one

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.155
8 hour window.

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:18.455
To a certain degree, any of the varying diets
and time restrictions showed benefits.

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:23.205
No matter the diet, the mice who had time
restrictions of 9-12 hours showed similarly

00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:24.205
lean mice.

00:01:24.205 --> 00:01:27.925
The group that was given a 15 hour window,
however, saw less results.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:31.455
There was also a group of mice that were given
cheat days, and were allowed free range eating

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:32.664
only the weekends.

00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:36.234
These mice looked very similar to the mice
who had time restrictions seven days a week,

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:39.624
which suggests that the diet can even withstand
temporary interruptions.

00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:44.765
But most significantly, the mice who became
obese due to the free-range diet were eventually

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:46.995
restricted to 9 hour windows.

00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:51.105
Although they were consuming the same caloric
amount, within a few days their body weight

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:56.594
dropped by five percent and eating this way
prevented the mice from further weight gain.

00:01:56.594 --> 00:02:00.855
While all of this is really interesting, it
isn’t exactly new information.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:05.194
Intermittent fasting has been a method of
weight loss in humans for several years.

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:09.664
Humans naturally fast-- at least for some
amount of time every night when we go to sleep.

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:12.304
When we wake up, our fast is broken at breakfast.

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:15.155
I know, words mean things sometimes.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.805
A super long time ago humans didn’t know
how to control fire.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:23.135
So they hunted and ate in the day, and protected
themselves against predators and slept at

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:24.135
night.

00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:28.965
Then we learned how to control fire, and THEN
created artificial light, creating an artificial

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:31.405
day, and artificial feeding times.

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:35.365
Our bodies have circadian rhythms that tell
us to stop eating after a certain point in

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:38.225
the day which, unfortunately, many of us ignore.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:42.835
The later you stay up to say, watch tv with
a bowl of ice cream or drive to taco bell

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:47.025
for that fourth, fifth and sixth meal, the
more your digestive system, along with all

00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:51.625
the hormones and enzymes that manage it, are
thrown off and unable to process the food

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:52.625
you eat.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:56.965
And those extra calories end up in all the
places you don’t want them in the form of

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:57.965
fat.

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:01.894
So restricting your intake of food to a certain
timeframe is basically just extending the

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:06.855
time between your last meal and the breaking
of your fast, which gives your body the time

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:09.325
to burn away your fat stores for energy.

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:14.235
Panda’s research suggests that the longer
we eat the lazier our metabolisms become.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:19.225
But once you restrict your consumption to
an 8 to 12 hour window, our metabolisms will

00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:21.555
burn more calories day and night.

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:22.865
What do you guys think of this?

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:25.345
Are you going to try to stop eating after
a certain hour?
