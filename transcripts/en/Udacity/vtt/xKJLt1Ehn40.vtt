00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is that the problem is the balanced parentheses.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Regular expressions can handle a set number of nesting parentheses--one or two or three--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but they can't handle an arbitrary number of nestings.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It makes sure that all the left parentheses balance with the right parentheses.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're going to need something else.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The thing we traditionally look at is called context-free languages,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which are more general than the regular languages.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We'll see how to handle that.
