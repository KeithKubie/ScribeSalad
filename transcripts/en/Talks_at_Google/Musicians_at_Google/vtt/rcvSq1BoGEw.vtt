ERIC ROBERSON: I want to
do something special.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.790
I want to do something
special.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.890
We are live on air, and we have
a lot of companies here.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.800
And I want to do something
special.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.820
I want to write a song possible
right this very

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.020
second on this spot.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.360
Me and my good friend, Ian.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.640
But I want to include
you guys as well.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.900
And see, this is how special
it's going to be.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.850
Check this out.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.495
The song is going to be such a
hit that American Express is

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:31.740
going to pay for it.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.230
And they're going to put
it on a commercial.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.960
We're going to make
a ton of money.

AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.860
ERIC ROBERSON: And I'm going
to share the proceeds with

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.918
everyone in the room, 'cause
I'm a fair kind of guy.

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:44.200
All right?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.740
But there's a simple thing,
there's a simple

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.986
rule you need to follow.

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:48.590
I need subjects.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.590
Words, thoughts, whatever's
from the crowd.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.320
I need whatever.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.746
But before you yell something
out, let the word you yell out

00:00:56.746 --> 00:00:58.235
be a fun word.

00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:59.840
Do not give me a boring.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.300
We're trying to impress
American Express.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.050
Do not give me a boring,
whack, simple word.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.180
Don't give me love or peace
or fate or intimacy or

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.110
anything like that.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.480
I need good words like
toenail clippings or

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.390
something like that.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.660
The better the song, the
better our chances that

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.610
American Express will
pay for this!

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.750
If you decide to still give me a
simple word, trust me I have

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.210
a cordless microphone.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.930
I will turn the cameras off
and I will throw this mic.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.670
OK?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.520

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.130

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.340
Is that a flower?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.326

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.210

just so I know?

AUDIENCE: Purple.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.690
Thank you very much.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.622
What'd you say over here?

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:06.386
AUDIENCE: I didn't say it.

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:06.770
He did.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.260
ERIC ROBERSON: What
did he say?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.169
I'm not going to use it.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.020
I just need to know
what he said.

Look at you.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.670
Thank you.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.630
Is that why you're bent over?

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.270
OK, I gotcha.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.600
I gotcha.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.360
It's cool.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.900
He's like, ugh!

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.100
In fact, [INAUDIBLE]!

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.200
You're disqualified.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.820
Anything over here?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.950
I love it.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.640
I love it.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.590
I'll tell you a quick story.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.050
My wife went to Brazil.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.120
My wife went to Wharton and
they did a school trip.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.480
And she came back and
I was at the airport

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.280
to greet her, happy.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.120
And as soon as she got off the
plane, the first thing she

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.151
said to me was, you're
never going there.

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:42.406
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:44.180

a true story.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.410
That's a true story.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.110
So I'm gonna sing this
song in honor of my

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.840
absence from Brazil.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.510
Anything else?

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.330
Anything else?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.910

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.460
Thank you!

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.200
Cha-ching!

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.980
We're going to get that money.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.500
[LAUGHS]

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.300
What's that?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.110
Roller coaster.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.540
OK, I think we're good.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.950
Are we good?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.690
I think we're good.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.320
Listen, I'm gonna
write this down.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.600
And I usually remember this.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.430
But I'm gonna write it down
because I need you guys to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.400
remember it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.430
So we have roller coaster.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.170
Just writing roller 'cause
we don't have time.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.910
What was the other ones?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.350
Look, I forgot that fast.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.600

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.796
Lilac.

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.250
How do you spell lilac?

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.510
What is that?

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.100
I never spelled--

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.200
oh lord.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.370

with the chain.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.620
What's that?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.270
You want your spell to be--

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.785
oh, plural.

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:32.610
You want to do lilacs.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.520
OK, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.450

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.670

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.820
OK, are you ready
for the song?

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.240
OK, OK, so we have--

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.360
what was your word
though, Julie?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.010
I'm gonna take your word.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.880
What was your word?

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.630
It was investment?

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.374
All right, all right.

00:03:50.374 --> 00:03:51.425

We are in a room full of lawyers
and entrepreneurs.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.150
CDs are only $10.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.506
You can make the investment.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.530
OK, OK.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.990
I apologize.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.180
I apologize Ryan, for
my silliness.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.829
Someone slipped something
in my tea, I think.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.839
OK, so we have--

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.470
I could have wrote
roller coaster--

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:32.290
roller coaster, Google, lilacs
plural, Brazil and investment.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.700
I just want make sure
that they see this.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.530
OK, all right.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.020
And Ian's gonna create
the music right now

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.640

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.300
So he's gonna get some
publishing as well.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.120
So you can start it
whenever you feel.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.480
If you want, I'll throw even
a beat to it as well.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.392
But we'll let you start first.

your Ex-Lax in.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.644
I might do it.

00:06:31.644 --> 00:06:32.068

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.135
Let me tell you about a story
when I was laying on my sofa.

00:06:57.436 --> 00:06:59.523
How the girl had my heart
go up and down

00:06:59.523 --> 00:07:03.176
like a roller coaster.

00:07:03.176 --> 00:07:08.840
And I don't mean to say that
like that's a good thing.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.735
But you gave me the word, so
there's a song I need to sing.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.090
I'm from Jersey.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.683
She was from Brazil.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.180
It's hot there.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.320
I live where it's chill.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.316
I tried to say I love you.

00:07:32.316 --> 00:07:35.160
I offered her daffodils.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.735
She said, that's whack.

00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:41.740
So I brought her some lilacs.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.720
And she let me in,
and I entered.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.380
It was lovely, most
of it, I remember.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.860
See, I thought this girl
was heaven sent.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.913
From that point, I was ready
to make an investment.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.890
I went to go buy a ring.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.750
I even knew the size.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.715
She showed me what she liked.

00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:18.690

price on Google.

Wish she was frugal.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.080
So I bought it anyway.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.610
I ignored the danger signs.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.730
Went with my heart
and not my mind.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:48.300
So I got on my knee while she
was laying on my sofa.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.530

for my ride through

And she said yes, softly
laid down tears and

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.810
dropped down on my chest.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.730
we would have wine
that was chilled.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.920
And we would walk and I would
carry her through the house

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.211
holding her up and
we would have a

00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:30.940
honeymoon out in Brazil.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.510
And I mean, she would walk down
and the flower girl would

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.754
be looking beautiful throwing
purple lilacs.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.620
Until I found out that the
price for weddings put my

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.996
American Express to the max.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:54.260
What I thought was heaven sent
has turned into a bad

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.510
investment.

00:09:57.235 --> 00:10:03.715
Now I'm looking at all
my money has went.

00:10:03.715 --> 00:10:08.010
Seems like all of my money's
really spent.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.190
Next time I'll find
someone frugal.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.630
So I won't have to find out
about bankruptcy in Google.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:25.290
Hopefully next time I'll
find someone frugal.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.120
Maybe I'll find a dating site.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.960
Let me type it in on Google.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.210
Singleblackman.com.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.540
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.090
ERIC ROBERSON: [SINGING]

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.380
Singlewoman.com.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.380
That's [INAUDIBLE] that.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.630
Yeah, applause.

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.855
What was that?

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.910
I turn to the wrong
website I think.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.780
Go back!

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.035
Had a bald headed guy
in a Speedo and in

00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:54.494
his mouth was a lilac.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:06.410
So this moral of the story
before I'm done.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.870
You need to really find who you
invest in, it's not all

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.810
about just fun.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.880
Because this young lady
may take your heart

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.638
and not give it back.

00:11:18.638 --> 00:11:23.570
And your heart will feel
like you just took a

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.530
whole bunch of Ex-Lax.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.930
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.430
ERIC ROBERSON: Thank you very
much, ladies and gentlemen.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:34.880
[APPLAUSE]
