00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
How do you rotate an object in three
dimensions? So, you take an object like that,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.179
and rotate it. That would be something that's useful, you can imagine, in computer

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.080
graphics. But how are we gonna do this? Now, one of the neatest ways of doing this

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.200
mathematically uses a new type of number, beyond the regular numbers you know.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.620
So this is beyond the real numbers, as we call them.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.320
They're even beyond the complex numbers—if you've heard of complex numbers before—it is even

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.370
beyond that. They are called quaternions. They are fantastic! So imagine that I want to move

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.090
along in one dimension. So you are living somewhere here and if I said move +5.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.540
+5 means that you move 5 units to the right along this line, so I'd end up over here.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.760
If I said instead move −3, you might understand that means move 3 units, but that time

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.660
move 3 units to the left. So that's how you move in one dimension. That's fairly easy, isn't it?

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.840
Let's talk about moving around in two dimensions and say I want to end up at a point over here.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:16.100
What that might be... 3 units this way—let's call that a 3—and I move 4 units up like that.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.960
One way you could write that as a set of instructions is to write it as 3+4i. Some of you may know what's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.420
coming here, some of you may have seen this 'i' before. But for now, let's just say 'i' means

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.780
turn 90° and go up and down. For now, that's what it means. So that's one way I can travel to that point.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.119
Alternatively I could look at it this way—I could travel 3 across and 4 up,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.700
or I could rotate myself to this angle here and move along this diagonal line here—

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.040
and that would be 3+4i as well. I could use the same

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.860
instructions to make that point. That's how you travel in two dimensions. I mean, if I

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.020
want to then go further, and travel maybe a bit further on... So let's say I wanted to go maybe

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.460
1 more across and then 2 up like that. What I can do then by adding a further

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.920
1+2i, I end up at this point, and I can say that this point is the combined result, which means I have actually

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:23.120
traveled—what?—3 across and then a further 1, that's 4 across and... 6 up. Or, if you like, it's

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.920
the combined result of going from here up to here. So we can add these numbers together, and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.960
we should think of them as numbers, right? You can add them together and you can

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.209
move around in two dimensions. So this time let's rotate this line. Let's take

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.129
my combined result here. What have I got? That's 4+6i. Let's rotate this 90°. If I

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:50.000
rotate it 90°, I think it's gonna end up something like that, and it will end up here.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.340
It will end up on a point here, so this is going to be a 90° rotation. This

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:05.220
point is actually −6+4i, and that's where I end up if I rotate. These look similar to each other.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.680
Why do they look similar? How can I get from this number to this number?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.440
What I've done actually is multiplied. Instead of adding the numbers together, I've actually

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.000
multiplied this time by the number—we call it a number—the number 'i'. So there is a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.320
special rule with this. The special rule is  'i' times itself, i×i, is equal to −1. Just to

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:35.540
show you what I did, I took where I was, 4+6i, I multiplied it by 'i', and what did I get? I got

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:45.700
4i+6... well, let's call it i². Oh, what is that? It's 4i−6, or in other words, where I ended up here,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.120
−6+4i. So multiplying by that number 'i' means you rotate 90°. If you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.840
do it twice, you get −1, which does make sense. So if you rotate 90°, and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.430
then rotate 90° again, you are 180° now—you're

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.459
facing the opposite direction—so you're going in the negative direction, so it does make

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.690
sense. And it turns out that if you multiply these numbers together,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.930
you get rotations. When you multiply the two numbers together, you add their angles

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.900
together. So if I want to rotate 45°, I would get my triangle for 45°.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.020
1/√2 there, 1/√2 here. So that's a nice nice 1 now.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:42.500
That is a 45° angle. Written as a number, that is 
(1/√2)+(1/√2)i. So you are going that

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.540
distance across and then that distance up. If I multiplied by that number, I would rotate

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.420
by 45°. So adding them together makes you travel around in two dimensions,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.240
multiplying them together makes you rotate in two dimensions.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.100
Now if you're ahead of me and have seen this sort of thing before,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.620
you may recognize these as
complex numbers—which, by the way, is a

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.920
terrible name, "complex" numbers, which makes them sound like "difficult" numbers, which I don't think is

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.400
the intention. I think the idea is that they are "compound" numbers. They are actually

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.220
two-dimensional numbers. That's a way of thinking of complex numbers. Real numbers

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.740
are one-dimensional numbers, complex numbers are two-dimensional numbers, and you

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.030
can use them to travel in 2-D and rotate in 2-D. So the question is, how do we

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.700
rotate in 3-D? We must need three-dimensional numbers, right? So we must

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.660
have to introduce an 'i' and a 'j' as well. So we have three dimensional numbers, and

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.800
that's what people thought. It turns out, we don't need three-dimensional numbers,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.400
we need four-dimensional numbers. To rotate in three dimensions, bizarrely, you

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.840
need a four-dimensional number. Let me show you how this works.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.120
(STAMMERS) So there was an Irish mathematician called William Hamilton,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.720
and he was thinking about this problem, and he couldn't solve it.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.880
He said, "it doesn't work in
three dimensions! I can't get it to work!"

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.840
And the story goes that he was having a walk with his wife along the canal in Dublin,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:29.280
and then suddenly inspiration struck. He realized, "I don't need three dimensions,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:37.340
I need four-dimensional numbers! I need 'i', 'j', and 'k'!" So flushed with this,

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.480
he immediately walked over to a nearby bridge over the canal, and he carved in the

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.620
rules that he needed to make this work. These are the rules that he carved into that bridge:

00:06:49.620 --> 00:07:00.080
i² = j² = k² = i⋅j⋅k = −1.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.180
It's very similar to the complex number idea. Complex numbers, i² = −1—that's what

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.560
we needed for that. It's very similar, but no, we need 'i', 'j' and 'k'.

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:21.880
He carved this into the canal bridge,
which unfortunately—graffiti, what a vandal!—unfortunately

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.520
it's not there anymore.
But now there is a plaque celebrating

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:32.460
the rules, his discovery of quaternions. The rules are there, and every year,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.699
mathematicians around Dublin have a
pilgrimage to the spot where he had this idea for

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:44.139
quaternions for the first time. So by multiplying these four-dimensional numbers, you can now

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:50.139
rotate—like the 2-D version—you
can rotate things in three dimensions,

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:55.319
and this is how things are done using computer graphics. Not only that, it's

00:07:55.319 --> 00:08:01.959
how things are worked out for the rotation or the orientation of a space shuttle

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.159
going up, or it's how they work out the orientation or the rotation of

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:15.899
your smartphone. So let's say I want to rotate an object in three dimensions. Well, I pick a line—like

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:22.120
this pen here—I stab the object with
this pen, and then I can rotate around

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:28.960
this pen here. So I might stab it this way, and then I can rotate the object like that. Or I might

00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:37.060
stab this way, so it rotates the object this way, or this way, so we can rotate like that. So, how do

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:44.660
we write this? I take a line like that, and then I wanna rotate around that line. Let's do an angle, 'θ', like that.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.260
Let's call it 'v'—this line, we're calling 'v'. So it's a three-dimensional thing.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.660
It has three coordinates. Let's call them v₁, v₂, and v₃.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:00.700
Let's take a point that's getting rotated around. Let's call that 'P'. That's just x, y, and z,

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.540
for that point, in three dimensions, this is how things work.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:10.480
But now we're gonna rotate it using a quaternion. What does a quaternion look like? It looks like this:

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:21.260
A quaternion, let's call it 'h', would be something like a+bi+cj+dk,

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:32.360
and actually, for this I do need another little thing, something called h*, and h*=a−bi−cj−dk.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:39.560
Right, if I want to rotate by an angle of θ, then a, b, and c are defined as:

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:50.000
a=cos(θ/2), b is going to be written as... v₁—that's come from my vector here, that's my

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:05.880
stabbing pen—times sin(θ/2), c=v₂⋅sin(θ/2), and d=v₃⋅sin(θ/2).

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.680
So it turns out we need four components for our number that we're gonna use. We need four

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.040
components to have the freedom to do the stabbing and then the rotating around that vector.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.600
And how do you work out the rotation then, finally? If P, which is the point I'm rotating,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:34.040
you write P as a quaternion, its coordinates are x, y, and z, so it's actually xi+yj+zk,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:46.140
and finally, the rotation is h⋅p⋅h*. Right, that's the main maths of it, but we need four components

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:53.140
to our number to have the freedom to be able to rotate around a vector and then move the angle around it.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:59.089
So the complex numbers contain the real numbers as well, and it turns out that

00:10:59.089 --> 00:11:03.709
the quaternions contain the complex
numbers, and in turn they contain the

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:09.280
the real numbers. When you don't need the j and the k, now you got a complex number, and if you

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:15.170
don't need the i, you've got a real number. So you might be thinking, "what's next? Is there a

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:24.020
next step up?" And there is, the next step up is octonions—8 dimensional numbers.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:29.840
Octonions, which have their own set of rules as well, are very similar, a very

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.940
similar idea, but every time we go a step further, they get a bit more abstract.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:42.160
They lose a bit of structure, and there's a property that you lose each time you do it.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:49.600
So the more you do this, the less useful they become. Octonions have some uses

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.589
in very abstract maths, but they're not
as useful as quaternions are.

00:11:55.589 --> 00:12:02.270
There is then a step above that, the 16
dimensional numbers—the sedenions—but

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:09.630
again you lose another property when you go further, and each time you do they get perhaps less useful.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.940
So what are these properties that you're losing each time you go further up? Unfortunately, what

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:24.610
you lose is when you go from the complex numbers to the quaternions, the property you lose is this...
