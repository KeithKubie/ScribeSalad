1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,330
This whole cult thing. I don't get
it. So don't is a weird one, right?

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,490
Because it's all like
crystals and healers.

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:09,330
It's all people looking to be spiritual
that they've given up on traditional

4
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:09,841
religion,

5
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:14,841
but they seem to need that sort of vibe
and so they get into like spiritual

6
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:19,110
stuff and channelers and healers.
Have you got in that stuff? My mom,

7
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:24,030
I know it all day long. One
all about channeling, bro.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,090
That's my thing. Channeling.
Yeah. All right. I mean, no,

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,300
no. I think we, I really
do believe, and I've,

10
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,100
I've been believing this
more and more lately though,

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,480
that our understanding of what
our memory is is a very limited,

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,120
and that the reason why
people are scared of things,

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,040
some things is probably because there's
some sort of genetic memory of someone

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:47,874
that they knew.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,940
Like I bet your kid will have somehow
or another that knowledge of that

16
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,530
motorcycle accident and that fee.
There's,

17
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,200
I think shit like that goes
through DNA. Yeah, I do.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,140
I think that's why kids are
scared of monsters. You know,

19
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:05,280
why his kids scared of monsters?

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,480
Why aren't they scared of bullets
or fires or you know, like why,

21
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:09,700
why they're screaming,
they're,

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,260
they're scared of something that
I was scared of growing up. No,

23
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,500
there's animals used to eat
people. Yeah. That's what I think.

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,350
I think monster's represent
like Jaguars and shit.

25
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:22,050
Like you'd go into the jungle and try
to get some water and you get jacked.

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,540
That's our ancestors.
All of our ancestors,

27
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:29,400
every single human being on this
planet came from Africa. All of us.

28
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:33,270
100% of us. Everyone.
Absolutely Shin, black, white.

29
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,200
All of us got eaten.
All of our ancestors in our DNA.

30
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:41,100
It's wired that cats out there,
bro. What are you afraid of?

31
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,590
Monsters in the dark. Those are cats, man.

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,360
We got jacked by cats like
all the time. Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,780
So that's why everybody is
scared of things under the
bed. What's in the closet?

34
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,840
They're hiding their cats.
Big Cats looking to get you.

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,180
I don't know about that.

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,780
This was very scary for a moment,
but I don't believe in that.

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,120
Why do you think that animals
have instincts, right?

38
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,130
Like here's a perfect example,
but we have instincts, right?

39
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,100
But what kind of instincts?
Animals have weird instincts.

40
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,770
Like they all sniff each other's assholes.

41
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,300
They all piss on spots where
other animals did. They don't.

42
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,060
Nobody had to teach my dog how to do that.
My dog,

43
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:24,180
I got him when he was six weeks old and
I've had him for two and a half years.

44
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,330
That mother fucker will sniff something
and he see somebody peed on it.

45
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:31,520
He pees on it. But he learned that from
his, he didn't learn that from nobody. No.

46
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,980
He learned that from his dog people.
What's it like when you came over here?

47
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,750
He didn't know Jack Shit,
so he myself oil.

48
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:41,910
You're saying you learned that from us?
No, I think it's in his DNA. Okay. Yeah,

49
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,550
I get that.
But what is the DNA like?

50
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:48,720
Doesn't your DNA carry some traces of
information onto your own children?

51
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,610
Like what I noticed in my children,

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
they share certain weird traits that
I have that I don't feel like like a

53
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,560
obsessive compulsive traits that I don't
think they see because don't really

54
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:03,370
bring that home. Like, especially
the workout stuff and like some,

55
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:07,150
some things that I really get kind of
psychotic about martial arts stuff. My,

56
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,010
my middle daughter has that in a crazy
way and I'm like, Oh okay, this is me.

57
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,230
If I was a girl, like if I was a little
girl, this is me. Like what is it?

58
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:18,250
So is this my memory
that seen her or is it,

59
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:22,520
do I have like some weird obsessive gene,
which is,

60
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,040
it is the DNA because I see my son,
he's only two, he just turned two.

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,280
But he makes facial expressions and looks
like he does certain looks that I do

62
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,150
and, and my wife goes, he's
acting like you right now.

63
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,260
Do you think he's acting like you?

64
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,550
Cause he sees you act like that or he's
acting like you cause he knows in his

65
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,600
head that that's how he's wired like that.
Because when I watch it,

66
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,920
he doesn't know like a lot of this stuff
he does, I don't eat, I don't even do,

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,510
he just does like my mom all, I'll come
over and she'll watch them. She Go,

68
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,410
you know, he's just like you when you
were this age and it's so weird. Yeah.

69
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,680
It's in the DNA. It's in
something, right. Whatever it is,

70
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,200
whether it's in cellular memory,
DNA,

71
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:08,950
some sort of genetic
information gets passed on,

72
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,860
but the parents of the child,
you can say that about athletics though.

73
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,430
Like if you get too, that's
a little different though,
but it's in the DNA. Yeah.

74
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,600
It isn't the DNA, but it's not an
ethereal thing. Like a thought.
