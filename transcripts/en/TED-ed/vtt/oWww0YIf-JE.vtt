00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.045
Today when people complain about the state

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:10.394
of American politics,

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:12.256
they often mention the dominance of

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:13.961
the Democratic and Republican Parties,

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:18.056
or the sharp split between red and blue states.

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.161
But while it may seem like both of these things

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.807
have been around forever,

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:25.161
the situation looked quite different in 1850,

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.425
with the Republican Party not yet existing,

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:30.335
and support for the dominant Democrats and Whigs

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:33.117
cutting across geographic divides.

00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:35.792
The collapse of this Second Party System

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.522
was at the center of increasing regional tensions

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:40.918
that would lead to the birth of the Republican Party,

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:43.287
the rise of Abraham Lincoln as its leader,

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:47.153
and a civil war that would claim over half a million lives.

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:49.023
And if this collapse could be blamed

00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:49.855
on a single event,

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:54.721
it would be the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.286
The story starts with the Missouri Compromise of 1820.

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:00.221
To balance the number of slave states

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.025
and free states in the Union,

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:04.222
it allowed slavery in the newly admitted

00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:07.117
state of Missouri, while making it off limits

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:10.822
in the remaining federally administered Louisiana Territory.

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:12.761
But compromises tend to last

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:13.783
only as long as they're convenient,

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:16.020
and by the early 1850s,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.566
a tenacious Democratic Senator from Illionis

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.268
named Stephen A. Douglas

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:22.993
found its terms very inconvenient.

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:25.117
As an advocate of western expansion,

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:27.360
he promoted constructing a transcontinental

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.024
railroad across the Northern Plains

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:32.292
with an eastern terminus in Chicago,

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.685
where he happened to own real estate.

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:36.116
For his proposal to succeed,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:37.992
Douglas felt that the territories

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:40.055
through which the railroad passed,

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.086
would have to be formally organized,

00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:45.424
which required the support of Southern politicians.

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:48.256
He was also a believer in popular sovereignty,

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:50.793
arguing that the status of slavery in a territory

00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:54.719
should be decided by its residents rather than Congress.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.423
So Douglas introduced a bill

00:01:56.423 --> 00:01:59.086
designed to kill two birds with one stone.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:02.392
It would divide the large chunk of incorporated land

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:06.990
into two new organized territories: Nebraska and Kansas,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.991
each of which would be open to slavery

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:11.457
if the population voted to allow it.

00:02:11.457 --> 00:02:13.287
While Douglas and his Southern supporters

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:15.022
tried to frame the bill as protecting

00:02:15.022 --> 00:02:16.991
the political rights of settlers,

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.548
horrified Northerners recognized it as

00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:22.559
repealing the 34-year-old Missouri Compromise

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.591
and feared that its supporters' ultimate goal

00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:28.285
was to extend slavery to the entire nation.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:30.994
Congress was able to pass the Kansas-Nebraska Act,

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:34.148
but at the huge cost of bitterly dividing the nation,

00:02:34.148 --> 00:02:37.918
with 91% of the opposition coming from Northerners.

00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:39.054
In the House of Representatives,

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:42.591
politicians traded insults and brandished weapons

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:45.360
until a Sargent at Arms restored order.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.223
President Pierce signed the bill into law

00:02:47.223 --> 00:02:49.222
amidst a storm of protest,

00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:51.593
while Georgia's Alexander Stephens,

00:02:51.593 --> 00:02:53.688
future Confederate Vice President,

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:55.423
hailed the Act's passage as,

00:02:55.423 --> 00:02:57.085
"Glory enough for one day."

00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:58.854
The New York Tribune reported,

00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:02.792
"The unanimous sentiment of the North is indignant resistance."

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:04.623
Douglas even admitted that he could travel

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:06.822
from Washington D.C. to Chicago

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:09.558
by the light of his own burning effigies.

00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:11.000
The political consequences

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.591
of the Kansas-Nebraska Act were stunning.

00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:16.653
Previously, both Whigs and Democrats had included

00:03:16.653 --> 00:03:19.256
Northern and Southern lawmakers united around

00:03:19.256 --> 00:03:22.361
various issues, but now slavery became

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.318
a dividing factor that could not be ignored.

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:26.792
Congressmen from both parties

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:28.261
spoke out against the act,

00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:31.456
including an Illinois Whig named Abraham Lincoln,

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:34.520
denouncing "the monstrous injustice of slavery"

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.759
in an 1854 speech.

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.716
By this time the Whigs had all but ceased to exist,

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:40.918
irreparably split between

00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:43.361
their Northern and Southern factions.

00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.655
In the same year, the new Republican Party

00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:47.991
was founded by the anti-slavery elements

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:50.057
from both existing parties.

00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:53.917
Although Lincoln still ran for Senate as a Whig in 1854,

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.455
he was an early supporter of the new party,

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:59.345
and helped to recruit others to its cause.

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.140
Meanwhile the Democratic Party was shaken

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.668
when events in the newly formed Kansas Territory

00:04:03.668 --> 00:04:07.719
revealed the violent consequences of popular sovereignty.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.749
Advertisements appeared across the North

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.490
imploring people to emigrate to Kansas

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.454
to stem the advance of slavery.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.685
The South answered with Border Ruffians,

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:19.625
pro-slavery Missourians who crossed state lines

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.593
to vote in fraudulent elections

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:23.919
and raid anti-slavery settlements.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.393
One northern abolitionist, John Brown,

00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:27.947
became notorious following the

00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:30.993
Pottawatomie Massacre of 1856

00:04:30.993 --> 00:04:33.224
when he and his sons hacked to death

00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:36.793
five pro-slavery farmers with broad swords.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:38.723
In the end, more than 50 people

00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:40.926
died in Bleeding Kansas.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.317
While nominally still a national party,

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:45.623
Douglas's Democrats were increasingly divided

00:04:45.623 --> 00:04:47.257
along sectional lines,

00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:48.824
and many Northern members left

00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:50.886
to join the Republicans.

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:52.274
Abraham Lincoln finally took up

00:04:52.274 --> 00:04:55.150
the Republican Party banner in 1856

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.718
and never looked back.

00:04:56.718 --> 00:04:58.457
That year, John C. Fremont,

00:04:58.457 --> 00:05:00.719
the first Republican presidential candidate,

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.191
lost to Democrat, James Buchanan,

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.960
but garnered 33% of the popular vote

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.423
all from Northern states.

00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:10.761
Two years later, Lincoln challenged Douglas

00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:12.824
for his Illinois Senate seat,

00:05:12.824 --> 00:05:14.624
and although he lost that contest,

00:05:14.624 --> 00:05:17.287
it elevated his status among Republicans.

00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:20.224
Lincoln would finally be vindicated in 1860,

00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:22.791
when he was elected President of the United States,

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:24.716
defeating in his own home state,

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.591
a certain Northern Democrat,

00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:28.890
who was finally undone by the disastrous

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.916
aftermath of the law he had masterminded.

00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:33.561
Americans today continue to debate

00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:35.623
whether the Civil War was inevitable,

00:05:35.623 --> 00:05:37.057
but there is no doubt that the

00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:39.546
Kansas-Nebraska Act made the ghastly conflict

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:41.224
much more likely.

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:42.226
And for that reason,

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:43.560
it should be remembered as one of the most

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.391
consequential pieces of legislation

00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:46.657
in American history.
