00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.320
Find the greatest common factor
of these monomials.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.680
And when they say monomials,
that's just a fancy word for

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.620
saying a one term expression.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.660
Each of these only, obviously,
have one term in them.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.885
Now to find the greatest common
factor of these, the

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:16.650
way I think about it is, I like
to break up each of these

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.450
terms into their constituent
parts.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.760
Make them a product of the
simplest things possible.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.310
For regular numbers like 10, to
me that means break them up

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.110
into their prime factors, and
for these variable expressions

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.800
like cd squared, break it up
into the product of the most

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.040
simple variable, for example,
c times d times d.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.030
So let's do that for each of
them and see what the greatest

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.690
common factor is.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.280
Where do these overlap in
terms of their factor?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520
And we care about the
greatest overlap.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.550
So let's do this first one.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.620
10 cd squared, what
is that equal to?

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.840
Well 10 is equal to 2 times 5.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.710
You could do a factoring tree
here, but these are pretty

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.910
straightforward numbers
to factor into.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.190
They're prime factors.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.650
So 10 is 2 times 5, c, all you
can do is break that, you

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.780
could just write that as
a c, you can't really

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.060
simplify that anymore.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.820
And d squared can be written
as d times d.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.080
So I have essentially broken
10cd squared into this, into

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.580
the product of kind of the
smallest constituents that I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.060
could think of.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.630
The prime factors of 10,
and then c, and then d.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.530
Now let's do 5cd.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.705
Well 5cd, 5 is prime, so its
prime factorization is

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:33.960
literally just 5.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.190
c you can't break that down
anymore, that's just a c, and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.550
then times a d.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.690
So we really didn't do anything
to this expression

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.560
right there.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.750
And then finally you have 25c
to the third d squared.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.710
Well 25 is 5 times 5, and then
we have times c times c times

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.930
c, that's what c to the third
is, and then we have times d

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.680
squared, times d times d.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.150
Now, what is the greatest common
factor, or what is the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.860
greatest common overlap between
these three things?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.550
Well they all have a 5.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.669
Let me circle them.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.450
You have a 5 there, you have a
5 there, you have a 5 there.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690
They all have at least one c.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.980
You have one c there,
one c there, and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.760
then another c there.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.590
And they all have
at least one d.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.670
You have a d there, you have
a d there, and then

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.330
you have a d there.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.960
Now they don't all have a second
d, only the first one

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.800
and the third one
have a second d.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.210
And they all don't have a second
or third c, only this

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.540
last one has a second
or third c.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.900
So we're essentially done.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.600
The greatest common
factor is 5cd.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.680
In fact you can't have a greater
number than 5cd be a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.150
common factor, because the
largest factor of 5cd is 5cd.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.800
So the greatest common factor
of these three monomials, or

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.130
these three expressions,
is 5cd.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.990
The largest number of factors
that overlaps with all three

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.350
of these expressions is
a 5, one c, and one d.
