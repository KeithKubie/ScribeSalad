[MUSIC]

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.370
MIHAI IONESCU: Hi, everyone.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.020
Welcome to Payments Live.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.770
And Happy New Year 2013.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.580
PENG YING: Happy New Year's.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.630
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes, it is our
first show this year.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.200
And we'll have a lightweight
office hour style session.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.610
We'll answer questions from
Stack Overflow, the groups,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.200
and the moderator.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.810
So first, let's start with
a few announcements.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.200
We just launched a new digital
subscription course on Google

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.320
Developers Academy.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.310
You can find it if you go to
developers.google.com/academy

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.160
or from our main Google Commerce
landing page if you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.650
follow the training link.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.990
You can find that at
developers.google.com/commerce.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.380
PENG YING: And a second
announcement, for those of you

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.790
who follow the Google Commerce
blog you're probably already

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.970
aware of it, but for those
tuning in, we recently

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.220
announced Zavers, which is a
digital coupon solution for

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.010
loyalty cards.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.960
And you can find out more
about it at zavers.com.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.686
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool,
more savings.

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:23.300
PENG YING: Everybody
loves savings.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.080
MIHAI IONESCU: All right, let's
go to the questions.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.670
Let's see what we have here.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.340
PENG YING: I guess I'll start.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.320
MIHAI IONESCU: You want
to take the first one.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.560
PENG YING: Yeah, so the new
version of Google Wallet has

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.815
been looming for months,
where is it?

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:37.550
And what changes
will it bring?

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.710
I know we've been saying
that we can't

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.170
wait for it to launch.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.740
And that it's going
to be awesome.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.190
Unfortunately, it's been delayed
for a little bit.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.670
And then, we can't really tell
you when it will launch.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.180
All we can say is that
it's coming.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.710
So in the future when it
launches, we'll definitely

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.920
give you a heads up.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.540
And we will tell you about the
APIs that it brings and the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.390
benefits it can bring both
merchants and consumers.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.700
But for now, it's just going to
be a little bit of a wait.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.740
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, we have
quite a few exciting APIs, so

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.370
it's worth the wait.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.080
So next question is
about Zavers.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.340
We were just talking about it.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.130
The question is, is Zavers
integrated with Google Wallet

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.310
somehow and it's not exposed
to users yet?

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.180
If not, when will the
users see it?

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.300
Will the integration be
different for retailers versus

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.670
manufacturers?

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.070
So as a consumer, as a user,
you can already use Zavers.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.770
If you go to zavers.com
you can sign up

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.950
on the online site.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.840
And you will see a list of
available retailers where you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.160
can redeem the coupons.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.700
On the mobile side, if you have
a smartphone or a Google

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.190
Wallet app, you can
navigate there.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.420
It's a mobile web app and you
can use it in the store the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.500
same way as you'd use
the online site

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.720
to redeem the coupons.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.880
So the coupon would be
saved to your app.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.990
And then when you swipe your
loyalty card it'll be

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.110
automatically redeemed.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.930
PENG YING: Cool.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.100
I guess I'll take
the next one.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.750
So can I add cards from
authorized users that are not

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.000
main cards on the account?

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.760
So there's a few different
ways to take it.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.250
One of them is as a
consumer and the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.700
other one is as a merchant.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.030
Well, I guess there's two
different ways to take it.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.900
As a merchant, if you want to
charge something on your

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.230
customer's behalf, that
currently isn't allowed by the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.710
checkout terms of service.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.195
So the example here is that if
one of your customers calls in

00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:50.020
and says, I'd like to place an
order, and passes you their

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.110
credit card information, you
can't then enter their credit

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.710
card information into the
account to complete that

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.910
transaction and use
Google Checkout as

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.950
your payment gateway.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.190
From the consumer side, let's
say that you're buying

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.830
something for your mom.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.530
And she hands you her
credit card number.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.620
Because you're buying her
something on her behalf, and

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.020
she has your permission, and
you're a consumer, you can

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.620
enter in her credit card number
into your account and

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.890
then purchase that way.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.790
But that's only if she gives
you permission, of course.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.615
MIHAI IONESCU: Right, and you
would need all the information

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.790
anyway, like billing
address, zip code--

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.230
PENG YING: Exactly, you would
have to have all the

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.390
information--

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.830
MIHAI IONESCU: Only the owner
should have access to all that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.160
information.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.210
PENG YING: Ideally, only the
owner should be the person

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.280
that's entering the credit
card information.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.740
But sometimes it's
understandable that you have

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.640
to make purchases on other
people's behalfs.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.200
And, I think, in those cases as
long as you have permission

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.330
to, as a consumer, that's OK.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.250
MIHAI IONESCU: All right,
I'll take the next one.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.330
This is a Google Checkout
question.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.940
The question is, when I'm trying
to add a Checkout Buy

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.900
Now button to my webpage the
button appears as expected,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.840
but nothing happens
when I press it.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.470
I've seen quite a few
cases like this.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.060
The Google Checkout button
is easily insertable in

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.820
any HTML web page.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.930
It is a form HTML element.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.540
And you just have to copy paste
the snippet we generate

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.010
for your on your page.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.320
The reason that nothing happens,
even though you see

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.620
the button, suggests
that something is

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.550
wrong with the form.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.380
Something is missing in the
form, it's not posting to the

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.300
correct website, or the form
is completely gone.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.970
So the first thing I would do
is to run an HTML validator

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.130
and make sure that the form
looks as expected.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.240
You can also have a look at the
site inside the debugger.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.300
Use one of the Chrome debugging
web tools or Firebug

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.680
in Firefox.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.070
And make sure that the form
appears the same as it was

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.530
when you copy pasted it.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.020
The reason is that if you
inserted it in the wrong place

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.050
in the HTML, you break the--

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.530
let's say you were breaking the
nesting structure of HTML,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.290
then the browsers may get
confused, and they would not

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.640
close the form correctly,
or remove the form tag

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.590
altogether.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.770
And so the form is gone.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.650
One example I've seen is someone
inserting the form

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.930
element inside a span tag.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.440
So that will break it because
span is an inline element,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.410
form is a block element, and you
cannot have block elements

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.020
inside inline elements.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.680
And some different browsers will
react differently to this

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.040
type of situation.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.890
Any other--

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.670
PENG YING: I mean, I've also
seen within certain HTML

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.120
editors-- so some sites, they
have their own HTML editors

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.400
built in as web HTML editors
instead of text made, or text

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.980
pad, or whatever.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.760
And then within those, I've seen
that sometimes when you

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.290
click Save, it actually strips
the elements that it doesn't

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.900
want to allow.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.270
So for example, if you paste a
form into Blogger, I believe

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.920
that Blogger will strip
out the form tags.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:14.380
If you paste a form element into
Google Sites, I believe

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.590
Google Sites also strips
out the form tags.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.070
So sometimes the HTML editors
can do this to you.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.590
And then if you save it, and
then you go back to it and

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.920
you're like, hey, where did
the form tags go, that's a

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.250
good indication that something
is happening there.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.010
The workarounds for those two
specific sites are using

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.549
something called gadgets.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:38.720
So I believe within both Blogger
and on Google Sites,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.150
you can add in gadgets to handle
the form post for you,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.470
to handle the Buy Now button
action for you.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:51.110
And the difference between
gadgets and regular forms is

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.480
that gadgets are always
I-framed, so then the security

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.730
is a little bit different.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.410
MIHAI IONESCU: So, you
want to go on?

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.820
PENG YING: Ah, I take
the next one.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.790
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah,
take the next one.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:07.690
PENG YING: OK, will Google
Wallet be integrated with

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.650
Google Shopper, and Google
Offers, et cetera.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.950
And this one I can take from
a bunch of different ways.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.470
This is pretty open ended.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.290
So let's start with Google
Wallet and Google Offers.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.410
I mean, to buy a Google Offer,
you already have to use Google

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.660
Wallet to purchase.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.450
In terms of the future, I think
the question here is

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.140
talking about, can you
redeem offers with a

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.960
single tap of Wallet.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.700
And then in this case, I
believe, if you look at the

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.190
previous history of what we've
done with loyalty cards about

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.640
passing all the information at
once with a single tap or with

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.670
a single purchase confirmation,
I think that's

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.400
the direction that we're going
to be headed in, of enabling

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.030
and simplifying transactions
where you pass a lot of

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.340
information at once.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.435
And then you don't need to
pass anything additional

00:09:59.435 --> 00:10:00.670
beyond that.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.410
In terms of Google Shopper and
Google Wallet, I think the

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.880
question here is, will you be
able to purchase items from

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.595
Google Shopper using
Google Wallet.

00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:13.270
And for that one, I
don't really know.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.570
I think they're going
to probably do some

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.410
more research on it.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.630
If there's some sort of market
benefit, if there's some sort

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.840
of benefit to merchants and
consumers for enabling

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.970
purchases in Google Shopper,
then we'll do it.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.942
But other than that, I'm
not quite sure there.

00:10:28.942 --> 00:10:30.970
MIHAI IONESCU: Come back and
ask the question in a few

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.613
months, maybe we'll know more.

00:10:33.613 --> 00:10:36.180
All right, let me take
the next one.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.480
The question is, will Google
Wallet be able to

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.320
be used with tablets.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.430
So I assume you are referring
to NFC tablets.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:51.410
And if the tablet has an NFC
chip, then obviously, you can

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.660
use Google Wallet.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:59.520
As an example, the Nexus 7 has
an NFC chip and the Galaxy

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.870
Nexus 10 has two NFC chips.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.640
So definitely you can use Wallet
with those tablets.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.400
And keep in mind to use Google
Wallet tap and pay you do not

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.070
need a carrier or a wireless
connection.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.315
You just turn on Wallet and you
can make the transaction.

00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:23.020
PENG YING: I guess I'll
take the next one.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.790
Will there be a scan slash
picture entering manual system

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.170
for non major credit card
slash reward cards.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.240
That's a good question.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.430
So there's a lot of cards.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.780
And I think OCR of credit cards
and other things to

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.370
enter in those credentials is
something that would be really

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.455
useful for consumers.

00:11:43.455 --> 00:11:45.810
It drastically simplifies that
flow because you take a

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.780
picture of a card and all
your details are in.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.850
For non major credit cards and
rewards cards, I think that's

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.410
going to be a little bit more
of a challenge because it

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.310
won't be as automatic as having
the standard that

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.310
everybody uses.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.600
We would have to create some
sort of OCR templates for each

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.740
specific card type and then be
able to recognize and scan

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.990
through that.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.340
I'm not sure if it'll be done.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.250
I want to say that we would
probably want to work with all

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.990
the partners to do this.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.100
Maybe the partner creates a
template, and then just adds

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.655
it into our system.

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:21.570
And then we can just
automatically scan their cards

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.700
or something like that.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.360
I want to say that, yes, I think
it's useful, but I don't

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.180
know if it'll actually
get built out.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.060
MIHAI IONESCU: Who knows what
the future will be.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.070
Maybe we'll have some QR codes
that encapsulate all this

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.930
information.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.340
And then they will be--

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.250
PENG YING: Yeah, so universal.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.190
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, but I think
for today's world, it is

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.210
probably useful to have a
scanning app that scans your

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.690
driver's license, or your
library card, stuff like that.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.680
Then you have them handy.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.760
I know in California you can
now present your insurance

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.466
information on the phone.

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:59.150
If you have it in
digital format--

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.770
PENG YING: Just imagine
the IDs on the phone.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.810
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah,
IDs on the phone.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:02.630
Everything would be good.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.790
So it's not a Google Wallet
specific question, but it's

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:13.250
useful, in general, to have
this kind of app on a

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.500
smartphone.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.000
I'll take the next question.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.520
This one it's about the
digital goods API.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.240
Question is, I implemented the
InApp payments API in the

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.550
sandbox using the App Engine
on the server side.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.160
I can complete a transaction
without the postbackURL, but

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.120
when I add the postbackURL, I
don't get the call back and

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.190
the transaction fails.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.630
So the great news is that it
works without a postbackURL.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.810
You are 90% done.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.090
You have very little
work left to do.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.840
You created the JWT, the
transaction completes

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.620
correctly, Google does not
reject your payment

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.130
information, and you already
done some server work to

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.790
generate the JWT.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.330
You know how to parse it,
encode it, decode it.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.650
So it looks like, on the
programming side you know what

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:07.790
needs to be done.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.220
Now the problem is, why
aren't you getting

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.450
back the call back?

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.160
So the first thing to check is
on the client side handler

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.020
check the error code return.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.330
And I believe it should
be postback error.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.830
That's what--

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.080
you're getting--

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.380
try--

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.750
the postback, it just did not
receive back the confirmation.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.060
So somewhere along the
way something broke.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.050
Check that you're not
behind a login wall.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.240
In a lot of cases Google App
Engine, when you create an

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.260
account, it has restriction who
can post to your site, so

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.330
sometimes you are behind
a login wall.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.900
And then the call
back gets lost.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.820
So check your logs, see what's
happening there.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.220
PENG YING: One easy way to
test is to actually curl

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.190
content to your postback
handler, or to your web

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.660
service handler.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.530
So that way you can just do
something from terminal.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.185
You type in curl, the data
you want to send

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:13.285
over, and the URL.

00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:14.810
And that'll just post it.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.220
MIHAI IONESCU: Right, so
simulate what Google

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.410
is doing in a way.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.070
And make sure you can
handle that case.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.430
And then, of course, there is
the 10 second delay issue.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.740
Even though that's a pretty long
delay, who knows what may

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.620
happen on your server side.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.600
Make sure, if you get
a call back, you

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.200
respond within 10 seconds.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.800
And then the order
will go through.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.800
Then you'll receive the correct
confirmation on the

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.470
client side and then the
transaction is complete.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.030
So if you still can't figure it
out, then post a question

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.930
on Stack Overflow in the groups
and someone from our

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.495
team or the community will
jump in and help.

00:15:55.495 --> 00:15:57.300
PENG YING: Cool, I'll
take the next one.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.750
Can I charge credit cards via
server side only to Google

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.950
Wallet, e.g.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.910
a HTTP post?

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.530
I don't want to use any client
side code to provide my own

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.640
web page and that does
all the charging.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.740
It seems to me that you're
looking for more of a payment

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.550
gateway functionality, where you
can just pass over credit

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.790
card information and then charge
that amount and capture

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.490
the proceeds of the sale.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.470
Currently, Google Wallet
doesn't offer any

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.780
solutions like this.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.760
In this case, the purchases
always need to complete on

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.000
Google Wallet slash
Google Checkout.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.660
However, we do offer
a new flow.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.500
It's called Google Wallet
for Online Commerce.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.690
The difference is that it's like
a OAuth 2 style access to

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.520
Google Payment Credentials.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.070
So what we'll do is we'll
actually pass you over, you as

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.120
a merchant, a one time use
card that you can charge

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.770
against your payment gateway.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.880
So that's something that's a
little bit different and maybe

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.520
more useful to you.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.660
For just the payment gateway
aspect of it, you may be more

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.849
interested in a solution such
as authorize.net or Chase

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:21.610
Paymentech, that can perform
the API charge requests.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.652
MIHAI IONESCU: Where can people
find out more about the

00:17:23.652 --> 00:17:25.270
Online Commerce API?

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.270
PENG YING: You find out more
about the Online Commerce API

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:36.268
at developers.googl
e.com/commerce/wallet/online.

00:17:36.268 --> 00:17:39.140
MIHAI IONESCU: All right,
do one more question.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.210
I'll take it.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.000
The question is, I have trouble
posting a digital

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.340
subscription order.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.440
I get a purchased cancelled
failure code.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.850
How do I debug this?

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:54.780
So purchase canceled indicates
that either the buyer

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.690
cancelled the transaction,
or something went

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.910
wrong with the order.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:05.040
Either the payment failed or
there was some time out, some

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.510
expiration, and the order
is not valid anymore.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:12.026
So I would, first, have
a look at the JWT.

00:18:12.026 --> 00:18:14.890
You are correctly constructing
the JWT.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.980
Google is not rejecting it,
but check the issued and

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.750
expiration times.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.610
Those may not be
valid anymore.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.890
And then Google thinks that
the order has expired.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.190
And it simply returns
the error code.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.620
Second, check your buyer
account, the sample buyer

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.100
account you're using
for this purchase.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.740
Make sure the credit cards
look correctly.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.350
They are the test cards
that we're offering.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.630
And generally, that there's
nothing wrong

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.640
with the buyer account.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.610
Try different credit cards--

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.290
we have at least four that you
can try with-- and see if that

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.770
fixes the problem.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.950
If none of this works, then I
would go and try one of our

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:06.250
samples on the developer
sample code site

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.750
and then work backwards.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.810
Do changes to that sample one
by one to match your changes

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.060
and see if it breaks.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.070
That should fix it.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.570
If it doesn't, again, the groups
and Stack Overflow are

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:23.210
a great resource.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.482
PENG YING: Yeah, Stack Overflow
is a great resource.

00:19:25.482 --> 00:19:27.620
MIHAI IONESCU: All right,
I think that

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.170
was it for this session.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.340
So Happy New Year again.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.990
And we'll see you soon,
in a couple of weeks.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.240
PENG YING: Yup, see you
in a few weeks.
