00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.420
So, guys, I just learned that drilling into
the earth can tell us about outer space.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.450
What is going on here?!

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.959
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.209
Scientists are drilling into the earth.

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.840
We all know the Earth is made of three major
layers - the core, mantle, and crust, which

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.080
is where we all live.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.180
The crust floats on the mantle, a super-thick
layer of mostly slowly moving rock.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.820
We've been trying to reach the mantle since
the 1960s, but despite numerous expeditions,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.000
have still not dug past the crust.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.110
By all accounts, attempting to reach the mantle
is dangerous and expensive, so why are we

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.790
trying so hard to get down there?

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.360
Because the mantle can tell us a lot about
the history and formation of our planet in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.360
the universe.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.820
The mantle makes up 84% of the Earth's volume
and is incredibly hot with temperatures that

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.860
range from around 1000 degrees celsius close
to the crust and about 4000 degrees celsius

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.030
near the core.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.920
The weight of everything above it creates
pressure that builds up tremendously the closer

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.150
we get to the core.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.430
The crust varies from 5 to 60 km thick, with
the thinnest layers found under the ocean.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.470
The farthest we’ve gotten was in the 1980s
in Russia's Kola peninsula, where they dug

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.650
for 20 years and managed a 12 kilometer-deep
hole, which was probably not even halfway

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.979
to the mantle.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.040
This and many expeditions have failed because
of technical difficulties like improper equipment

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.869
and just plain bad luck in choosing spots
to drill.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.030
But this doesn’t mean scientists have given
up.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.991
More recently, a team of scientists from the
International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.810
drilled into the ocean crust and were able
to retrieve rocks that showed signs of life

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.810
. We're not talking about mole people or green
big eyed kind of life, but microbial life.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.740
The rocks contained methane and hydrogen,
which as one of the researchers stated “microbes

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.620
can ‘eat’ to grow and form new cells”.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.050
This is huge!

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.880
Similar rocks, gases, and conditions are found
in other planets.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.780
So, according to the researchers, these rock
specimens can aid our search and understanding

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.840
of how extraterrestrial life may exist in
similar inhospitable conditions in the depths

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840
of the universe.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.619
But reaching the mantle doesn't just teach
us about space, it also teaches us about earth.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.299
The mantle's activity is largely responsible
for the movement of tectonic plates, which

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.370
scientists theorize influences volcanic activity,
earthquakes, mountain ranges, and movement

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.650
in the oceans.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.510
So understanding the mantle more can help
us better understand the earth’s current

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.590
topography and it’s history - Including
how our continents shifted throughout the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.099
ages and are shifting today.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.770
If we can drill down to the mantle, researchers
could have this type of information straight

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.980
from the source, increasing the accuracy.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.590
Right now we can only make inferences about
the structure of the earth based on how fast

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.431
an earthquake's’ seismic waves, travel through
the planet and the routes they take, what

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:41.010
we can see on the crust, and the composition
of rock samples.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.430
It wasn’t too long ago that by chance a
volcano ejected a diamond from the mantle

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.220
that confirmed that there is an ocean’s
worth of water in the mantle’s transition

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.220
zone!

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.510
Scientists learned this because it contained
ringwoodite, with a certain amount of water

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.510
in it.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.129
This tiny rock made a huge difference.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.550
And look, these rocks are great, but they
are inconsistent - we don’t know when the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.840
next mantle rock will be spewed out of which
volcano or if it will be intact enough for

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.629
scientists to derive meaningful conclusions.

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.010
We got lucky with this diamond, but often
these rocks are too damaged.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.000
Most have been belched out from volcanoes,
ejected by tectonic plate crashes, or carried

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.980
upward to the ocean floor.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.881
These treacherous and often erratic journeys
leave scars on them, and leave scientists

00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:21.990
with messy data.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.409
It’s hard to know what characteristics were
a result of the journey vs reflective of the

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.019
mantle itself.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.850
So drilling down to the mantle could mean
that we would finally be able to get pristine

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.099
samples of the mantle, and even an entryway
for further exploration.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.580
It could give us a clear look at the mantle’s
composition, how it’s moving, and more accurate

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.380
readings of its velocity, pressure, and temperature.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.099
In essence, what the earth and possibly the
universe is made of.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.069
But the drilling we most often hear of is
tied to oil.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:04:15.799
