00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.980
PROFESSOR: Distinguished
members of the city council--

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.010
good morning, and thank
you for meeting with me.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.630
As you know, we will be working
with a municipal planning

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.370
agency in the drafting of the
new master plan for the city.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.990
I address you today because as
a first step in the process,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.710
our team requires the council's
full support in what we believe

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.310
is the best planning framework
to achieve the city's two

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.040
primary objective--
economic development

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.104
in the long term and
short-term pollution reduction.

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:41.690
We are aware that
not just the city,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.405
but a different
set of stakeholders

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:45.980
must work together
in order to counter

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.290
the impacts of the regional
wastewater treatment plant

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.210
and the runoff from
agricultural activities

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.390
upstream that currently
discourage investment

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.560
in the city.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.810
With this in mind, we
propose a combination

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.225
of community planning assisted
by consensus building exercises

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:06.736
as a pivot for design and
implementation of the new plan.

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:08.110
I will spend the
next few minutes

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.300
explaining how
participation will

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.704
enhance the value of the plan,
highlight aspects of community

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:19.820
building for this
space, and conclude

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.690
with a particular focus
we will use for your city.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.120
Having worked over 15
years in planning efforts

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.610
and over 20 different
cities, my experience

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.670
has taught me that meaningful
public participation

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.290
is the seed of successful
implementation.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.250
Many times I have seen
sophisticated master plans

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.900
neglecting this fact
and as a result,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.580
waste of taxpayers' money
because the community perceives

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.840
the method as being unfair.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.990
When plans do not connect
assessment and design

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.810
with public will,
this often ends up

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.570
hindering economic development
by giving way to social unrest

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.620
and expensive delays in plans.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.606
Money spent on a planning
process instead of a planning

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:08.789
report can truly be
called investment

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.826
in the public interest.

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.830
Participation has a
triple bottom line.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.280
It brings additional skills
to the planning table,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.120
it provides alternative
insights to diminish

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.556
risk of economic
failure, and generates

00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:22.930
learning and
cooperation networks

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.904
that transcend the plan itself.

00:02:25.904 --> 00:02:28.320
We will pursue these benefits
through a community planning

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.870
exercise where a neutral body
will map the main stakeholder

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.870
groups surrounding
our polluted river.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.330
Peers within the groups
will choose a representative

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.510
that will participate in
having an informed discussion

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.620
about the alternatives for
environmental improvement

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.180
of the city.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.090
I am aware that public
participation is not

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.000
deeply ingrained in local
institutional culture.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.490
In fact, initial
conversations with the staff

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.490
indicate some reserve.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.515
This is not unusual
because of narrow

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.690
and procedural applications
of public presentation

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.160
elsewhere have definitely
set a poor precedent.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.070
In the absence of
proper management,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.840
public hearings
and consultations

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.310
are often inefficient and only
yield superficial discussions.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.120
Other times the are held hostage
by the best organized groups.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.390
With such references,
I find it to be

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.580
very understandable
for any of you

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.750
to take public participation
with some degree of skepticism.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.790
In order to address
these concerns,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.010
my team and I will
combine community planning

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.560
with consensus
building exercises.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.410
In comparison to
other strategies,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.340
this framework will
use a mutual mediator

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.160
that will add credibility and
efficiency to the process.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.850
Strive for plurality instead of
statistical representativeness,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.770
which is not only
expensive but also

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.600
ensures that there is a level
playing field preventing

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.990
majority rules.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.790
The mediator will curate
participating groups early

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.130
in the process
ensuring a fair voice

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.420
that reflects your
economic concerns

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.010
and also that ensures that
the rich, racial diversity

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.340
of the city is
represented at the table.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.830
Finally, this framework will
guarantee recommendations

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.220
that are feasible because
all will be required

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.230
to be grounded on a
technical expertise provided

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.190
by an advisory committee.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.210
Due to little experience with
participation in the city,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.220
the outline of the
process we proposed

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.870
is similar to the one we
very successfully used

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.790
in Hampton, Virginia, where
there was emphasis in learning.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.610
Participants will be trained
about river pollution,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.560
the implications of
green investment,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.730
and different alternatives to
promote economic development.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.780
This will enable full and
detailed participation

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.190
in the discussion on the
proposed Will alternatives.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.670
We are not asking you to give
up authority in this matter.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.860
You remain the ultimate
decision-makers

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.600
to weigh these proposals
on their merit.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.160
This exercise is
for, and you will

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.170
have an unprecedented insight to
a range of the concerns of all

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.120
of your constituents.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.160
I do request, however,
your endorsement

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.460
to a public commitment
that considers

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.860
the inclusion of the
negotiated recommendations

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.870
in the new plan.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.270
I conclude by pointing
out that this method is

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.980
relatively inexpensive
as compared to others.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.510
An assessment does not
need much time or money.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.910
Furthermore, investment
and consensus

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.540
yields great
legitimacy and trust.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.040
And with this, the
greatest opportunity

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.160
to achieve fair, efficient
wise and stable commitments

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.040
to come and go.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.540
Thank you.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.590
