00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.946
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:07.569
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:08.610
I'm delighted to see you.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.630
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.300
I'm Dean of the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.530
We have a very full
house here today.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.020
Thank you all for joining us.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.740
I'm very much looking forward
to our discussion, "The Museum,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.840
the City, and the University."

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.890
Our program today reflects
Radcliffe's dual mission

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.060
to support scholars, scientists,
and artists as they pursue

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.780
innovative research
and creative work,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.570
and to share the fruits of those
endeavors with the wide public

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.270
through lectures,
conferences, exhibitions.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.870
And discussions like
today's I am excited to dive

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.080
into what I know will be
a fascinating discussion

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.370
about the present and future of
three institutions that matter

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.270
a great deal to me, and I
would guess to many of you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.560
in this room--

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.570
the art museum, the
university, and the city.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.620
To guide us, we are
fortunate to have

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.950
five leaders of Boston's
major art museums,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.680
as well as our distinguished
moderator, Harvard

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.910
and Radcliffe's own
professor Yukio Lippit.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.810
Museums and universities have
distinctive but overlapping

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.360
missions in today's society.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.270
Both are committed to
preserving cultural knowledge

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.240
in abstract and material form.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.870
Both are dedicated to advancing
new knowledge, new research.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.920
And they share a common
mission to communicate

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.270
ideas and aesthetic appreciation
in a variety of ways

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.700
to broad constituencies.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.360
These links between museums
and universities are not new.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.870
They have a long history.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.780
When Western European
nations were first forming

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.230
and monarchs were
consolidating their power,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.630
universities and
lavish collections

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.350
of art and antiquities played
important and complementary

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.420
roles in their societies.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.620
Teaching and
research universities

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.490
helped solidify
national identities,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.400
and royal collections
glorified the crown

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.889
and conferred legitimacy.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.160
Both also preserved the
ideological and material

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.970
culture of their
patrons for the future.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.660
In the 18th and 19th centuries,
when many of the major museums

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.980
we know today emerged as
important cultural institutions

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.440
in cities around
the world, they took

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.670
on important societal objectives
and engaged a much broader

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.900
public.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.000
Not only did their
collecting and research

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.410
commitments expand, but as
democratic government took hold

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.380
in the Western world,
museums aspired

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.070
to use their cultural
treasures to cultivate

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.140
enlightened citizens.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.680
Here in the United States, the
19th and early 20th centuries

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.400
also saw massive immigration
to Boston, New York,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.230
and other major cities.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.200
The Boston Museum of Fine Arts
and the Metropolitan Museum

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.830
of Art in New York,
both founded in 1870,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.040
aimed to serve as
Americanizing institutions

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.950
in urban centers
that were exploding

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.560
in size and population.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.420
Much has changed, of course,
between the 1870s and today.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.260
But deep connections live
on between national identity

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and collections of
visual material culture,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.100
between museums and universities
as preservers and promoters

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.420
of new knowledge, and between
museums and their publics.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.300
To highlight one
very recent example,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.990
earlier this year, our five
panelists wrote an open letter

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.050
eloquently defending the
National Arts and Humanities

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.770
endowments and articulating
their shared belief,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.470
and I quote, that
"access to the arts

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.500
is at the core of a democratic
and equitable society."

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.230
End quote.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.100
These issues have taken on
greater urgency and importance

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.920
in recent years and even months.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.130
We are watching as public
support for the arts

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.880
and humanities is
increasingly contested.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.510
We are experiencing a new
wave of nativism and pressures

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.880
for Americanization
that surely have

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.589
implications for the missions of
universities and museums alike.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.540
And as American cities
struggle for economic survival,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.890
their museums face
pressures to be

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.050
engines of growth
and development,

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.080
in addition to their
traditional roles in education

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.090
and research, potentially
leading to conflicting agendas.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.610
Finally, current
political realities

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.520
make museums' efforts to
engage the public in the arts

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.870
and humanities both more
important and potentially more

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.690
difficult than ever before.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.480
I am grateful that we have
with us this afternoon

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.960
such a distinguished panel
to help us explore and better

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.580
understand some of these issues,
and surely others as well.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.250
Before I hand things
over to Yukio Lippit,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.370
let me invite you all to
continue the conversation

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.400
with our panelists and with
each other at a reception

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.940
immediately following this
program right next door at Fay

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.020
House.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.600
Now, to get our
program started, please

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.600
join me in welcoming Yukio
Lippit to the podium.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.030
Yukio is a professor
of art and architecture

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.880
at Harvard, an expert
in Japanese art

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.860
with extensive
experience creating

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.100
museum exhibitions, and the
Johnson-Kulukundis Family

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.290
Faculty Director
of the arts here

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.090
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.868
Yukio?

00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:36.214
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.000
Hello, everyone, and
let me join Dean Cohen

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.206
and welcome you to what
promises to be a special event.

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:49.580
In the greater
Boston area, we're

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.760
fortunate enough to have art
museums of the highest caliber.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.700
The Museum of Fine Arts is
one of the great encyclopedic

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.040
museums anywhere in the
world, with collections second

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.270
to none.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.490
The Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum close by

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.950
is a real cultural treasure
of the city of Boston,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.650
one of the remarkable
museums that emerged out

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.290
of the Gilded Age, and
its collections housed

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.690
in an unforgettable setting.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.210
Through dynamic programming
and landmark exhibitions,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.460
the Institute of
Contemporary Ar in Boston

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.980
has been a leader
in the art world

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.290
since its opening in the 1930s.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.900
Similarly, the List Center
for the Visual Arts at MIT

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.380
has been a true center for
innovation and experimentation

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.690
in the arts since its founding
as the Heaton Gallery in 1950.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.710
And the Harvard Art
Museums together

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.230
constitute one of the
leading research museums

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.100
worldwide These museums
represent very different kinds

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.530
of institutions, but
each in their own way

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.160
constitutes an important
part of the region's history

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.460
and contributes vitally to
its character in the present.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.960
This evening, we're
fortunate enough

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.030
to be able to engage
in conversation

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.109
with their respective directors.

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:57.650
They come from
different backgrounds,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.540
but all share a broad
set of experiences

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.540
touching upon many different
aspects of the art world.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.960
They have curated exhibitions,
authored scholarly articles,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.090
purchased art,
hired museum staff,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.340
discovered new works,
written opinion pieces,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.250
founded NPOs, conceived
of innovative programs,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.730
crafted partnerships
and strategic plans

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.370
in overseeing complex
building projects.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.820
They have also been
known to raise money.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.610
They are art lovers first
and foremost, but also

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.320
scholars, historians, curators,
planners, educators, designers,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.150
and leaders of the
community, as witnessed

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.950
among other things in
the powerful letter

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.800
cited by Dean Cohen that
they coauthored in February

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.390
of this year to protest proposed
cuts to the National Endowment

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.300
of the Arts and Humanities.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.310
In the summer of
2015, we were faced

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.250
with an unusual circumstance
here in the Boston area.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.340
Three of the region's
museums, the Gardner, the MFA,

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.380
and the Harvard Art
Museum, had vacancies

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.300
in the director's position.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.570
There was a feeling that
once these seats were filled,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.980
there would
inevitably be a shift

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.690
in the cultural landscape.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.180
We hoped to invite whoever
assumed these directorships

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.400
to the Radcliffe Institute
in to participate

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.490
in an event such as this one.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.580
However, time has a way of
passing, and at this point,

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.180
they already seem like veterans
of our local art world.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.060
So we decided to
shoot for the moon

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.890
and not only invite our new
directors, Peggy Fogelman,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.630
Matthew Teitelbaum,
and Martha Tedeschi,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.920
but also ask them to be
joined by our longer-serving

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.770
directors, Jill
Medvedow and Paul Ha,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.750
in a wide-ranging discussion
here at the Radcliffe Institute

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.159
for our Harvard
Radcliffe community,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.070
about the museum, the
city, and the university.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.152
And somehow, we succeeded.

00:08:42.152 --> 00:08:43.610
It goes without
saying that they're

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.193
extraordinarily busy
people, and we're

00:08:45.193 --> 00:08:47.600
extremely grateful for
their time and enthusiasm

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.020
in joining us today.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.660
And before introducing
our participants

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.450
and inviting them
to the stage, let

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.580
me just say a few words about
how this evening will proceed.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.850
After our roughly
hour-long discussion,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.340
there'll be time for a
question and answer period.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.520
And microphones will be placed
in the center of the aisle

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.350
here, and if you
have a question,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.970
we ask that you
come to the aisle

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.850
and state your name
and any affiliation

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.010
before posing your question.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.540
Then afterwards,
as Dean Cohen said,

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.810
we invite you to join us
for a reception in Fay House

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.190
next door.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.730
Now, let me introduce
our participants.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.280
Peggy Fogelman began her career
as a curator of sculpture

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.280
at the J. Paul Getty Museum and
has had a distinguished career

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.220
as a curator, educator,
and in senior management,

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.500
not just at the Getty
but at the Peabody Essex

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.260
museum in Salem, and
serving from 2009

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.830
as the chairman of education at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.110
Subsequently, she served
as director of collections

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.280
at the Morgan Library and Museum
before moving here in 2016

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.500
to become the Norma
Jean Calderwood

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.020
Director of the Gardner Museum.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.660
Paul Ha was formerly the
director of White Columns Art

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.760
Gallery in New York
before becoming

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.430
deputy director of programs
at the Yale University Art

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.840
Gallery.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.300
In 2002, he moved to the
Contemporary Art Museum

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.594
in St. Louis, where
he served as director

00:10:04.594 --> 00:10:06.260
and oversaw the
construction and opening

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.740
of its newly expanded facility.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.210
There, he created the
first major museum exhibit

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.510
for a wide range of now
internationally recognized

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.610
artists, and he has
served as director

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.510
of the List since 2011.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.550
Jill Medvedow served
as the first curator

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.470
for contemporary art
at the Gardner Museum,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.420
as well as the deputy
director of programs

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.770
before assuming the
directorship of the ICA in 1998,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.130
where she now serves as the
Ellen Matilda Poss Director.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.824
She was the founder of 911
Contemporary Arts in Seattle

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:38.990
and has served as deputy
director of the New England

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.850
Foundation for the Arts.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.010
And as many of us
know here, she oversaw

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.670
the building and opening in
2006 of the current ICA building

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.380
in the Seaport District
in South Boston,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.427
which has become a true
cultural landmark of the city.

00:10:52.427 --> 00:10:54.510
Martha Tedeschi began her
career in the Department

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.790
of Prints and Drawings at
the Chicago Art Institute,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.310
specializing in British
and American art.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.460
After a distinguished
and award winning career

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.070
as a curator and author,
she became deputy director

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.110
of art research
in Chicago, where

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.450
she developed innovative
curatorial programming

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.730
in partnerships with
local universities

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.990
before coming to Harvard in 2016
as the Elizabeth ad John Moors

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.390
Cabot Director of the
Harvard Art Museums.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.940
Matthew Teitelbaum
was previously

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.950
a curator at the ICA Boston and
Mendel Art Gallery in Saskatoon

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.110
before joining the
Art Gallery of Ontario

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.170
in 1993 as chief curator.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.920
He was then appointed director
and CEO of the art gallery

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.100
in 1998 and oversaw a wide range
of exhibitions and programming

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.490
as well as the renovation
of its Bozar Building

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.910
by Frank Gehry,
completed in 2008.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.720
He was awarded,
among other prizes,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.700
the Chevalier dans l'Ordre des
Arts et des Lettres in 2006,

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.260
and in 2015, he joined the
MFA as the Ann and Graham Gund

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.490
Director.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.436
Please join me in welcoming
our directors to the stage.

00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:03.324
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:14.988 --> 00:12:16.175
- Oh, sorry.

00:12:16.175 --> 00:12:17.092
- There's a chair.

00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:21.500
- Well, we can read.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.096
- So we'd like to start off
this conversation by giving you

00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:35.470
an opportunity to
speak in a more

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.090
personal vein about your
relationship to museums.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.490
Was there a formative
museum experience

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.340
at some point in your lives,
in your childhood, perhaps,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.280
that led you down this path?

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.780
Martha, maybe we
can begin with you,

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.150
as something of a co-host
of this conversation.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.020
- Yes, there definitely for
me was a cataclysmic moment.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.240
And it was when I
was eight years old,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.030
and my family had just
moved to Florence, Italy,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.910
about six months after
the devastating flooding

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:10.230
of the Arno River, which
destroyed works of art,

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:15.600
flooded the basement of the
Biblioteca Nazionale archives,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.490
where books were destroyed.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:23.310
Palazzi with beautiful frescoed
walls were critically damaged.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.080
And although I
was a little girl,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.140
I was very aware of what was
happening, because there was

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.150
scaffolding all over Florence.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.180
There still is, sort of.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.310
But scaffolding everywhere,
mud lines on all the buildings.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.350
And what was really
remarkable is

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.140
that there was an outpouring
of help from all over Europe,

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.500
and conservators and especially
university students were

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.740
everywhere in Florence, trying
to help with documentation,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.340
preservation, just,
really, triage.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.000
And so it was a tragic but
also heroic environment,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.800
and it was that
year that I began

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.780
to understand the precariousness
and the preciousness

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.120
of our cultural heritage.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.890
And I think ever
since then, I felt

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.935
protective of museum collections
from that experience.

00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:12.060
- That's wonderful.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:12.740
Jill?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.420
- I would say my formative
childhood experience was

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.680
at the Yale
University Art Gallery

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.050
in New Haven, Connecticut,
where I grew up.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.540
And it was a place I
could take the bus too,

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.340
because I lived
right in the city.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.470
And as a young person,
I was completely

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:36.890
taken by the great Duchamp Tu
m' that hangs at the museum.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.810
You know it well.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.150
And I think that--

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.880
I don't know how as a young
person I thought I got it,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.130
but for some reason
I thought I did,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.110
and that made me very excited.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.870
And I think ever since
then, that combination

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:57.140
of verbal and visual thinking
and punning and ideas--

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.430
it caught me then, and that
was a perfect museum for me.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.980
New Haven's a small
city that I love dearly,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.780
but it took my pretty
insular world, of growing up

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.890
Jewish in a Jewish community in
a small city where my dad was

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.030
a politician, and it was the
one place where the world just

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.910
exploded for me,
and it was mine.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.070
And that changed me forever.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.740
- Well, as painful
it is to admit,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.660
the Yale University
Art Gallery is really

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.486
one of the gold standards
of university museums.

00:15:32.486 --> 00:15:35.150
- I ought to be an ad
for them all the time.

00:15:40.276 --> 00:15:45.850
- Well, this leads to
a question that we also

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.620
wanted to start off
the evening with,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:53.860
which has to do with
the city of Boston

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.200
and how the city of Boston
looks through the prism

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.760
of your museums.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.750
You have all directed museums
in other major North American

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:05.830
cities--

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.510
Toronto, St. Louis, Los
Angeles, Chicago, New York.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.370
How does Boston appear to you?

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.410
And maybe that's
a question we can

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.220
direct to our two more
recently appointed directors,

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:21.970
Peggy and Matthew.

00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:27.510
- If I can jump in.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.900
So one of the things that
Dean Cohen said that really

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.070
resonated with me--
you were talking about

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.460
that Boston was
very different when

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.850
our museums were established,
but not so different.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.920
And in fact, that's true.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.000
And the situation in Boston
compared to the situation now--

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.440
at the turn of the century,
Boston was 35% foreign-born.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.050
Now, it's 25% foreign-born.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.710
And so in looking at the
city through the prism

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:03.370
of the Gardner, the Gardner
has very progressive roots

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:09.310
that one might not suspect when
you think of an unconventional

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.290
woman in the Gilded
Age, who, granted,

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:19.210
was quite wealthy and quite
privileged-- nonetheless she

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.450
specifically established
a museum for the public.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.390
Unlike other Gilded
Age museums, it

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.680
was not a private collection
that became public after death.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.100
It was amassed and
intended for the public.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.690
And she herself had very
progressive political leanings,

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.900
and so I think that
that's embedded

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.360
in the DNA of the institution.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.120
And that's our imperative.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.540
I think that's an imperative for
all of us in our institutions,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.490
to reflect the city
and our audiences.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.770
However, in
considering the city,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.290
I think we have a
lot of challenges.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.180
And we certainly are
not, in this room,

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.480
or in many of the things we
do, reflective of the city

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.260
in which we live.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.970
And I think that
is something that

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:16.470
remains a challenge in Boston.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.080
Perhaps more so than
in some other places,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.830
although I think
overall, it's a challenge

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:26.070
for our cultural institutions
in terms of that imperative

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:32.280
to really engage broadly
and to be truly welcoming.

00:18:36.152 --> 00:18:38.261
- So let me just
start by saying--

00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:39.760
answering your first
question, which

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.135
maybe has something to do with
the second question, which

00:18:42.135 --> 00:18:45.220
is when I was about 10,
I went to an exhibition

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.970
with my father,
who was an artist.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.370
And his favorite artist in
the world was Rembrandt,

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.610
and it was a Rembrandt show.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.910
And I remember at the
end of the exhibition,

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.560
he said that I have to
go home and have a nap.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.350
And I looked at him and I said,
but we just looked at art.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.400
He said, well, looking
at art is work, right?

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.860
And I clearly never
forgot that, that notion

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.760
that the experience of
looking at a work of art

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.650
is commensurate with
what you put into it

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.610
and what you get back, and
that it is actually a project.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.410
It is a commitment.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.900
And I think about that
in relation to the MFA.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.050
So I am the only
person on the stage

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.670
who not only has
come to a new city

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.920
but has come to a new country.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.200
And I suppose what I would
say is, in Toronto, I

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.700
thought a lot about how
the museum that I led

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.800
was helping create the city.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.110
I'm not saying that
we didn't reflect it.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.400
I didn't say that we
didn't reach out and pull

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.920
in that energy.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.100
But I was also very conscious
of how a museum can create

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.260
a dialogue within a city.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.300
And if I were thinking
about the role

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.520
that I think the MFA
and all of us can play,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.595
it's how we do create
the citizen in our midst.

00:19:59.595 --> 00:20:01.470
And I think we have an
obligation to do that.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:06.520
And I think that Boston is more
diverse than it first seems,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.670
but I have to say, as a
Canadian, a Torontonian,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.640
it doesn't seem that diverse.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.790
And I think that
one of my challenges

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.860
is to figure out how to tap into
the diversity that does exist

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:22.410
here and how to give back
a sense of citizenship

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.750
and community, which I
think museums must do.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.310
- Paul?

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.190
- What I'm observing
is that there

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.100
is an incredible moment of
growth in the visual arts

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.860
here in Boston.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.180
I think Boston is facing sort
of a renaissance in the arts,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.830
especially in the visual arts.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:43.720
And when you think about
what institution has grown,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.980
you look at Gardner, you look
at MFA, you look at Harvard.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.310
They've all done
incredible capital projects

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.790
and have made new
beginnings for themselves

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.240
and inserted themselves
into our culture.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.920
And art does create economies.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.500
So when you think about all
the money that's been put in,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.770
all the jobs, that's been given
to create these institutions.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.120
And this is the moment where
when I make Jill embarrassed,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.500
and I always say this.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.470
I really feel that
we're in this position

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.400
now because 11 years
ago, the ICA was created.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.460
And this city hasn't created
a new museum in 100 years,

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.500
and Jill went ahead
and put that museum

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.150
on the beautiful waterfront.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.950
And I think that
got people thinking

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.490
that the city can change.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.990
We've been the same
for a long time.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.310
It's been fantastic.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.530
But maybe there's growth.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.160
Maybe there's other
ways to do it.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.810
And I do think there's
incredible organizations

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:38.880
all throughout Boston.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.870
But I think especially
in the visual arts,

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.670
there's an enormous growth.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.120
- Well, thank you.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.050
This really mean segues into
a question about architecture.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.120
And all of you are a part of--

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.240
you lead museums that are
housed in very different kinds

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.230
of buildings.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.630
This is immediately, of course,
apparent to a first-time museum

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.180
visitor, and the
experience of the museum

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.570
is one and the same as the
experience of the architecture

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:10.980
and the space.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.280
And now is a really
wonderful opportunity,

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.510
while we have you here on
stage, to ask you to give us

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.720
a sense, an insider's
sense of your buildings,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.440
of your architecture,
as directors.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.310
Are there any ways in which
the buildings surprise you?

00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:33.670
- That's very funny.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:35.575 --> 00:22:37.325
I wasn't exactly
intending it to be funny,

00:22:37.325 --> 00:22:39.455
but please go with that.

00:22:39.455 --> 00:22:41.680
- I was just going
to say, absolutely.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.970
Yes, what I've found getting
to know the relatively new

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.130
building of the Harvard
Art Museums-- which,

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.310
for those of you who don't know,
opened in November of 2014,

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.130
so we're getting close
to celebrating our third

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.200
anniversary in the building--

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.240
I think a huge
amount of work was

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.780
done to try to have the
mission of the museum

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.310
inform the building.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.920
What's interesting now that
it's open is the spaces.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.620
And we created a lot of
differentiated spaces

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.690
for different kinds of learning.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:15.070
The spaces are actually, in
some cases, driving the program

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.920
and actually giving
people more of an appetite

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.470
than we thought for access
to original works of art.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.940
So the suite of study centers on
the fourth floor, for example.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.830
That was a lot of
real estate to give up

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.500
in a museum building project.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.260
But because we have
that there, and we

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.580
are making it
staffed all the time,

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.380
last year, 41,000 objects came
through those study centers.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.060
That is an appetite
I don't think

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.770
anybody could have predicted.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.520
And similarly, we have
an experimental space

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.160
called the Lightbox
space that has

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.590
started to be a
site for research

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.660
with collaborators
across Harvard.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.480
We didn't really know whether it
would be a place to show film,

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.360
or whether we would
commission artists

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.040
working in digital media.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.790
But this space itself is
suggesting possibilities

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.130
to our collaborators.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.865
So I could give many
more examples of that.

00:24:11.865 --> 00:24:13.240
But I think what
we're finding is

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.444
that very differentiated spaces
in a new architectural building

00:24:17.444 --> 00:24:18.485
sometimes have surprises.

00:24:18.485 --> 00:24:20.980
- So your recommendation
is to build a building

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.675
and do the programming later?

00:24:22.675 --> 00:24:23.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:23.665 --> 00:24:26.560
- Well, I guess my
recommendation would

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.560
be, listen to the
building, and push it

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.040
to see what it can do for you.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.022
And I think what it's doing for
us is growing organically now.

00:24:36.022 --> 00:24:38.235
- Thank you.

00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:40.090
- Jill?

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.170
- I must say, I'm
more interested

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.520
in the buildings around us than
in our individual buildings,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.660
all of which do very
different things.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.600
But I think that in
thinking about the city,

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.950
part of what the questions that
at least I'm grappling with

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.980
are-- it's fantastic
to be the first new art

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.540
museum in a century.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.290
Nothing for a city
to be proud of,

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.360
so to go to your first question
about what's happening here

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.080
in Boston, I think we're still
kind of trying to catch up,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.950
in many ways, from a fairly
conservative attitude

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.220
towards architecture, towards
building, towards museums,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.140
certainly towards
contemporary art.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.160
And we've seen an accelerated
pace in the last decade.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.520
But I think that it's important
to look at the issues of zoning

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.670
and planning, of the relative
power and roles of developers

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.420
versus civic institutions
in actually shaping

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.800
the face of the city, of
where power gets centered.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.340
And in many ways, my
beautiful beloved ICA,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.570
which works incredibly well
when you get in the door

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.500
and is making many, many, many
people happy all the time--

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:06.060
but it is completely consumed
by privatized large buildings.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.240
And so as a city, I think
it's necessary to take

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.450
a look at what we value.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.390
Many other cities have
made different choices

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.480
in terms of their
waterfront, and might

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.900
have left some space open around
their iconic architecture.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.690
Our city did not
choose to do that.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.690
We can handle that.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.610
We never thought
we would be alone.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:32.210
And just as I'm happy to
have all my colleagues,

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.650
I am actually happy to
have people in buildings

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:36.160
than on the waterfront.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.640
But I think that it's
a much bigger question

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.450
than our architecture.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:45.930
We are punctuation marks in a
city that is, in its center,

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:46.680
exploding.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.720
But it's a city
that extends well

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.860
beyond the Fenway, Harvard
Square, and the seaport

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.120
in Kendall Square.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.910
And so I think we have some
really difficult questions

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.166
to grapple with,
architecturally.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.640
- In that context,
one of the qualities

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.580
of the architecture
that expresses itself

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.830
in different ways in
our different spaces,

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.810
because each is unique,
is this idea of sanctuary,

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.420
of putting yourself in a
different kind of space,

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.950
a different kind
of mental space,

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.550
a different kind
of physical space.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:27.470
And I think that in some ways,
the growth of Boston and that

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.110
the pace of development
and the pace of work

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.810
and the pace of life in Boston,
which is ever-increasing,

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:39.570
in fact creates both a
hunger and an opportunity

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.860
for our cultural organizations,
our cultural spaces,

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.760
our performative spaces,
to serve a role in terms

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.120
of civic life and in
terms of all of life

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.000
that perhaps they
didn't so much before,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.500
when things weren't necessarily
booming in every corner

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.300
all around us.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.540
So that's physically
manifested around the ICA,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.500
but I think it's emotionally
and psychologically manifested

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.390
throughout the
city, even when it's

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.670
not actually right next door.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.510
- So I might say that I'm
not particularly interested

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.730
in the idea of sanctuary.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.840
I'm not sure whether
you said you were.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.150
But the challenge with
the MFA is, in fact,

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.910
to move away from that.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.670
And if the future of the
museum, which I believe it is,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.020
is about invitation,
welcome engagement,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.860
how do you invite people
into your institution

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.950
and say we want you here, how
do you welcome them and say you

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.560
belong here, and how
do you engage them

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.310
and say you can learn here
and share experiences here--

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:46.950
then when I think of the MFA,
and you asked about surprises,

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.660
I am constantly
surprised-- and maybe I

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.300
shouldn't be-- at how forbidding
the exterior of the building,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.430
is how uninviting it is.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.580
I do have folks around the
MFA who don't understand me

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.280
when I say that and say,
but I feel comfortable here.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.820
And I think that's my point.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.620
My response is,
if you like going

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.346
to the Supreme Court or the
central bank, then you're good.

00:29:11.346 --> 00:29:13.470
So what do you do with the
outside of the building?

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.100
And I had a great privilege.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.380
In fact, one of the great
privileges of my life

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.440
was to work with Frank Gehry
on the Toronto building.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.090
And he taught me a lot
about architecture.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.550
In fact, I had a rule that
whenever he said something

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.470
that I didn't agree with
or didn't understand,

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.360
I'd ask him to say
why because I thought,

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.610
when am I going to have an
experience like this again?

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.280
And it was really
life-affirming.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.600
But one of the things I realized
was that a building is not

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.084
a building.

00:29:45.084 --> 00:29:46.500
I never actually
said that to him,

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.989
but a building isn't a building.

00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:49.280
We weren't building a building.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.300
We were building an experience.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.480
And if you think about a
building as an experience,

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.970
then you end up thinking
about it as a journey.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:01.040
And one of the big surprises for
me about the MFA as a building

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.259
is how unrewarding
it is as a journey.

00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:07.050
I'm not saying you
don't have great things.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.050
I'm not saying that we
don't have great moments.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.280
Of course we do.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.140
But the notion of
how you feel when you

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.510
move through that building--

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:20.670
not so rewarding, not so
exciting, not so affirming.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.540
The art is, the building
needs greater coherence.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.585
- Thank you.

00:30:25.585 --> 00:30:27.600
- That's the beginning
of a capital campaign.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.412
- Thank you.

00:30:32.412 --> 00:30:34.120
Would you like to
follow up a little bit?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.660
- I just want to address
the concept of sanctuary.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:44.140
And I think this also
goes to the issue

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.730
of welcoming audiences.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:51.460
I think we have to become, as
organizations, as institutions,

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:57.070
much less judgmental about
what is a valid experience

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.280
in our spaces.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.890
And we know from a lot
of evaluation and visit

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.460
or research that people,
particularly millennials who

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.270
seem to be leading very
overstressed lives,

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:18.240
actually come to museums
seeking a sort of sanctuary,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.960
a sort of ability to
take themselves out

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.480
of their everyday heads and
inhabit a different kind

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.370
of mental space.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.140
And of course, the
Gardner broadcasts an idea

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:41.200
of reflection and sanctuary in
terms of its courtyard, which

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.500
is the heart of the place.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.140
Which does not mean
that we're not also

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.510
engaging people very
actively in terms

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.390
of participatory experiences
and performative experience.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:58.660
But I do think if we talk
about being truly welcoming

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.870
and wanting very broad,
diverse audiences

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.500
to find meaning in
our institutions, that

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.160
means every mode
of engagement that

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.480
doesn't endanger the collection
needs to be validated.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.400
Because for so long--

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.310
for centuries, in fact--

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.420
we have conditioned
our audiences

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.530
to conduct themselves certain
ways in relation to art.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:31.990
And much of that has been
very intellectually driven

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.280
by a certain kind of pedagogy.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.210
And I think to be truly
meaningful, we have to let go.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.760
- I know that our architects,
Diller Scofidio and Renfro,

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.550
were fond of saying
that the ICA was built

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.310
to be civic from the
ground up and contemplative

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.300
from the sky down.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.390
And I think it's worked in
many ways, in that sense.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.840
But of course, the
word "sanctuary" today

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.540
has such a particular meaning.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.680
And so I think that
we are so many things.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.230
I mean, museums-- and we're
among the smaller ones,

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:16.340
relative certainly to the MFA--
but we're complex institutions.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.980
Museums are complex
institutions and beings,

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.010
and they have all
these different ways,

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.580
all these different centers
of business and operation

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.990
and different collections,
different approaches

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:33.790
to collections, diverse
constituencies, donors,

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:37.510
that I do think we
are used to being

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.740
many things for many people.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.980
And regardless of how we say it,
we are all trying to, I think

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.980
be, as open and
inviting as we can,

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.820
to offer this wealth of
learning, teaching, reflection,

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.900
engagement.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.200
Some of it's individual
and private, and some of it

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.940
is in fantastic groups of young
kids, teenagers, millennials,

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.780
and seniors.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.580
It's like the gamut.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.620
It's our great
strength, I think.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.300
- I think for museums, it's not
really about the architecture.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.900
And having overseen
three capital projects,

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.920
working with a young Stan Allen
and overseeing the Louis Kahn

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.960
building--

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.130
what I know is, just
like your houses,

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.320
all the museums will
leak one of these days.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.320
And that's what we live with.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.060
But I think once the
building gets built,

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.770
we don't really think
about the structure,

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.395
but what we think
about is the program.

00:34:28.395 --> 00:34:30.460
And ultimately, I think
my job is to put someone

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.810
in front of an object.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.540
And it's about, how do
we get someone in here?

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.750
And it's great to have an iconic
building that the mayor can

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:41.469
show off and tell, as they say,
what progress we're making.

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:44.530
But in the end, it's about
creating programs and ideas

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.380
and getting people in so they
feel invited and welcomed,

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.630
and it becomes their space.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.830
- We're starting a new
building program which I think

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:55.330
we'll learn quite a bit from.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.560
But we're taking a
condemned building--

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.690
so in a neighborhood in East
Boston, in the East Boston

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.590
shipyard and marina, and taking
it out of total disrepair

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:14.770
to be a free, open, free all
the time, open seasonally space,

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.770
and trying to keep it
as raw and industrial

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.460
and pointing to its history
as possible, which is actually

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.050
a very difficult thing to do.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.980
Simple seems to be both more
expensive and more complex

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.210
than one might think.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.710
- It's very expensive
to look cheap.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.230
- It's very expensive
to look cheap.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.390
I know.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.000
Getting good at that.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.770
But it will be, I think,
really interesting to see how

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:44.210
these two spaces that
bookend the harbor--

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.720
and where when we first
opened on Fan Pier,

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.810
we thought one of our
great civic initiatives

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.270
was access to the harbor.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.650
And now we see that
part of how we address

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.960
the civic role of the
museum and the city

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.390
is actually thinking about
public transportation

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.740
across the harbor.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.380
So I think a lot,
over the past decade,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:09.200
it's a different shift of our
relationship to architecture

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:09.750
and the city.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:10.500
- Well, thank you.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.927
And I'd like to get back
to that point in a moment,

00:36:12.927 --> 00:36:14.510
but one of the
interesting things that

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.870
has emerged from what I'm
hearing of this conversation

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.700
is that there isn't
necessarily a tension

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:25.130
between this immersive, tranquil
encounter with the object

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.080
that, Jill, you
beautifully described

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.410
from your experiences at the
Yale University Art Gallery,

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:34.190
and the more bustling zeitgeist
blockbuster exhibition,

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.490
where there is more of
a density of visitors.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.690
But let me rephrase the
question a little bit

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.694
in terms of modes of attention.

00:36:43.694 --> 00:36:45.110
This is something
that we struggle

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:48.380
with a lot at the university--

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.200
how to capture student attention
at its most basic level,

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.570
but also how to understand
the way attention is changing,

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:01.730
and to not try to
reverse trends,

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.980
but to try to understand
and accommodate

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:09.170
and take advantage of
the state of things.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.820
And we're doing it.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.970
Yes, we are banning laptops
and wireless devices

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.450
from classrooms on occasion, but
we're also flipping classrooms

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.150
and trying to get students
to talk to each other

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:24.560
more and take a more
participatory role, of course,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.340
in class.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:32.750
And how does this question get
addressed today at the museum?

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.606
The question about attention.

00:37:35.606 --> 00:37:39.380
- I'm happy to jump in
there, specifically thinking

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.810
about engaging
students, which is

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.250
such a big part of our mission.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.820
And we really find that
the students want to use us

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.926
in many different ways.

00:37:47.926 --> 00:37:50.300
And one of the things we have
to keep reiterating to them

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.490
is that there's no
right way or wrong way

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.550
to use the museum
and its collections.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:59.600
And we tried to make sure,
when we had our kickoff student

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.390
late night, we thought
about the modes of attention

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:07.280
very clearly, and we created all
different levels of intimacy,

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:15.290
all the way over to a public
meeting with a big sound DJ who

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:16.370
was filling the building.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.480
So that was the courtyard.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.630
But then, as students moved
throughout the building,

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.300
we were able to get
more and more intimate,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.570
so that they could have
one-on-one experiences

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.720
with an object, they could
follow a small guided tour

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.770
by a peer.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.050
But the idea of
differentiating, so

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:37.040
that you reach people at
their level of attention

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.240
on that particular day.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.400
Because I think
modes of attention

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.650
also reflect the reason
you came to the museum

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.810
in the first place.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:49.130
Museum research often
shows that visitors

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.500
will have a good or bad
experience in the museum based

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.960
on what they wanted the
outcome of their visit to be.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.066
So if you're coming
with a social purpose--

00:38:57.066 --> 00:38:58.940
let's say you have
friends from out of town--

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.040
you're going to want
to make that experience

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.390
work for your friends.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.250
You want to feel
empowered to show them

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:05.910
around without getting lost.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.924
There are certain
things you need.

00:39:07.924 --> 00:39:09.590
On the other hand,
we hear from students

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:15.500
all the time that we're their
favorite place to go to be sad.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.500
Which sounds like not
a compliment, maybe,

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.090
but think about it.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.280
For students who are
sharing dorm rooms,

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.100
don't have much
privacy, may never

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.770
feel comfortable
going to church,

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:31.550
but need something along those
lines to help them calm down,

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:36.230
slow down, think, feel, get in
touch with their own feelings,

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.510
have some privacy--

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.090
we also hear that
students want that.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.310
And then we also heard
that behind our building

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.723
was the best place at
Harvard to smoke pot.

00:39:45.723 --> 00:39:47.695
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:47.695 --> 00:39:49.203
- This is getting
very interesting.

00:39:49.203 --> 00:39:52.820
- Well, let me just say, if
you could tell your students

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.980
that we have 11 Mark
Rothko paintings,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.570
they could come and be sad for
the next 11 months at the MFA.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.340
But, you know, it's interesting.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.790
Everybody has their own way of
understanding their audience.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.920
In studies that
we've done, we found

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.440
the two reasons why people
want to come to a museum

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.050
are number one, to
be with other people,

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:16.114
and secondly, to
confront a point of view.

00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:17.280
To confront a point of view.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.740
So when I think about
that, where I go is--

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.860
and how does their
understanding get expressed?

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.150
So I'm certainly
interested in our position

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:32.990
and what we say, but I think
that public institutions

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.850
like the MFA--

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.920
and I run into trouble when I
say it's a public institution,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.310
and what I mean is,
we serve the public--

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.300
have a responsibility in this
moment to think about voice.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.400
How do we create voice
for our audience?

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.270
How do we create voice for our
community, within our walls?

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.207
And that's maybe why--

00:40:54.207 --> 00:40:55.290
sorry to come back to it--

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:58.470
I have trouble with this
relatively passive notion

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:02.100
of sanctuary, reflection.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:06.330
Because I think museums, more
urgently than in my experience,

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.760
need now to create the
enlightened citizen

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.870
and create activity and
action in our communities.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.510
I don't think we
need to be polemical,

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.030
but I need to think we
have to create action.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:21.300
And the way I think
we have to do it,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.060
and the way that I want
the MFA to be judged,

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.070
is through the
eyes of the artist.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.260
I think that if we
can create the MFA

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.220
as a platform for the
artistic sensibility,

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.770
to artistic thinking, the
sense of new possibility,

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.770
of putting things
together in new ways,

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.560
we will both be doing the
right thing generally, and more

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.350
specifically, giving the voice
to our audience, because they

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.960
will find a way to be with each
other, to learn something new,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.550
to confront a point of view
that will make them more engaged

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.090
citizens.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.290
And I believe that.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:56.460
How we do that is the constant
conversation that we're having.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.580
But I think we need,
at the MFA, to do

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.166
that more than we've done.

00:42:02.166 --> 00:42:05.940
- I've grown up doing both
political organizing and art

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.850
and art history.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:09.840
So I toggle quite a bit.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.540
But when I hear
your question, I'm

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:17.040
going someplace a little
bit different, which

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.680
is the need to ensure that we--

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.590
part of being
somebody growing up,

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.770
and then an adult
and participant,

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:32.670
does require the
ability to read closely,

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.420
whether it's, as you said,
being able to give something

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.270
to a work of art so that
you can take something back,

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.980
or I think about language and
written language or literature

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.860
and poetry.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.110
And I was reading something over
the weekend that made reference

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:53.820
to a really prescient
article by George Orwell

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.750
that he wrote right after World
War ii ended, I think in 1946,

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:04.310
talking about how
sloppy language is

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:09.700
so complicit in sloppy thinking
and in political danger.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.770
So Hannah Arendt does the
same kind of connection.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.610
And I think that we
also have an obligation

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.330
and an incredible opportunity
with our collections

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:25.160
and with the art we present
on stage or on our walls

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.360
to try to--

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:31.250
also, at the same time as we
get people to speak out and feel

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.510
engaged, active
citizens who vote--

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.510
that part of what we want
them to do when they vote

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:42.140
is to have thought
critically and deeply

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.350
and paid attention to the
words and the language.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.270
And that does require attention.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.420
And so I don't know if that's
what you're getting at,

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.820
but that's what it
made me think about.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.710
- Yes, thank you.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.230
Well, I wanted to follow
up on this a little bit.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.870
Citizenship happens to be the
research theme of the Radcliffe

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.410
Institute this year and next.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.140
It is, in part, a lead-up
to the celebration

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.390
of the centennial
of women's suffrage

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.600
and the ratification of the
19th Amendment of the US

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.099
Constitution.

00:44:14.099 --> 00:44:15.890
And we're living in a
time where it's never

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.700
felt more pressing to
raise questions about what

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.140
it means to be a citizen.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.070
It's never felt
more urgent to get

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.960
involved in civic engagement.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.360
So could we elaborate
a little bit on this,

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:35.600
about where museums play a
role in the present discourse

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.983
on civic engagement?

00:44:37.983 --> 00:44:42.350
- May I ask a question in
reference to your question?

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:47.570
And that is, why
do we, or do we,

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.060
make a distinction
between civic engagement

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.290
and cultural engagement?

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:58.250
Can one ask the question, is
cultural engagement actually

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.700
civic engagement, if we
believe in the power of art

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.530
to give voice to
ideas, to politics,

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:09.470
to the human condition, to this.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.940
And I guess I would wonder
what my colleagues might

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.830
think of that particular
spin on the question.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.670
- Thank you.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:25.340
As museums, I feel like
our duty is to present.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.970
We present things.

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:33.830
And so when things occur,
moments happen, and then

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:35.480
the staff has a meeting

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.660
To say, how do we react to
this, or not to react to it?

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:39.630
What can we do?

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.880
Should we do something?

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.770
Many questions.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:46.400
The exhibition we have up now
is called Civil Disobedience,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.870
and it's a survey of how people
have protested from the 1920s

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:53.220
onto currently.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.700
And we're showing all sides
of political statements

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.990
and their dedication, their
belief, why they're doing this,

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.250
and also presenting
how they went

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:09.540
about giving their voice to the
cause, giving their concerns,

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.980
raising their voice.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:15.960
And so for us to be political?

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.770
Perhaps not.

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:22.000
But to present, to reflect the
current, what's happening now,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.760
I think you have to be reactive
to what's happening now.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.530
- I would also add that I
think you have to be reactive,

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.940
but you can be specific
and maybe have more impact.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.480
So thinking in terms of
civic engagement and museums

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.890
and how they might
foster that, I

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:43.850
think they're really looking
at your proximate communities

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:46.580
and looking at their
needs and figuring out

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.890
whether the museum is
actually a good partner

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.440
to help solve a problem.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.610
A very small example from
the work that the Harvard Art

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.430
Museums is doing with
Cambridge French and Latin,

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.170
a high school in
Cambridge, which

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.020
is an incredibly
diverse high school.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:07.250
We were contacted
by teachers there

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.880
to let us know that their AP
World History students had

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.420
identified a real gap
in their textbook, which

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.920
was there was very little
discussion of Islamic lands

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.090
or culture.

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.180
And the students
were asking for this.

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:27.700
It's a very diverse school and
includes many Muslim students.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:33.340
And so we have actually of done
an intervention in this world

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.190
AP class, and we're addressing
that lack in the textbook

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.290
through the collections
in the museums.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:44.810
So I think sometimes those very
specific projects are really

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:50.060
a great way to begin to foster
civic engagement in a very

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:55.130
doable way that impacts
your immediate community.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.830
- I don't know if I can
respond to Peggy or not,

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:02.960
but let me talk about my doubt.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.450
My doubt is around
the question of,

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:09.410
what is the right action
for a public institution

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.330
at this moment in our history?

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.300
What is the right
position to take?

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.500
And what is the
personal point of view,

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.470
what is the institutional
point of view, and what gets

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.750
activated by taking a position?

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:28.250
Which maybe goes to the notion
of being civically engaged.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:32.630
So I think that my
role as a leader

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.100
is to help the
people with whom I

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.960
work to stay in the question
of why, rather than what.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.170
And the what follows,
but the real question

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:43.730
is, why should we do something?

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:47.120
So I'll share a
hot-off-the-press example,

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.261
which I was sharing in
the green room before me.

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:53.760
We were actually talking about
personal things and relatives

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.070
and kids that were
misbehaving, but we actually

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:58.890
talked a little bit about
art when we were waiting.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.620
And I was sharing
that a curator--

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.500
I don't know which one
it was at the MFA--

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.180
suggested that we put
together fairly quickly--

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.565
my kind of word--

00:49:10.565 --> 00:49:15.670
a small exhibit of
figures that are kneeling.

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:21.520
And my first thought was,
if the curator at the MFA

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.580
wants to do something like
that, I'm going to say yes.

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.070
And then I said,
I didn't think so.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.800
Because I think that's a
what question rather than

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.760
a why question.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.760
And I think we would
have really blurred

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.114
the notion of the
artist's intention.

00:49:36.114 --> 00:49:37.780
We would have blurred
the notion of what

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.120
we are saying as an
institution around what issue.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:45.802
But I loved the fact that
there was a curator--

00:49:45.802 --> 00:49:47.260
again, I don't know
who it is-- who

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.952
wanted to find a
way to say something

00:49:49.952 --> 00:49:51.160
that they were feeling about.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.390
But my doubt is
that the answers are

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.580
going to be easy to come to.

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.090
My doubt is that there's
an obvious right or wrong.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:05.080
My doubt is that I'm
going to get it right,

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.870
because I've never worked--

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:09.820
I should say this--
with a staff that I

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.124
feel is more anxious
and concerned

00:50:12.124 --> 00:50:13.540
about the times
in which they live

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.290
and the way in which they
have agency to do things.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:22.150
And I'm trying constantly to
balance that urgency, which

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.720
I am completely sympathetic
to in any situation,

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.830
with the right role
of the institution.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:31.070
And that's my doubt and
it's not a bad place to be.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.470
It actually takes me
straight into the--

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.800
why did museums do what they do?

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:40.684
But I'm in that all the
time, more than I expected.

00:50:40.684 --> 00:50:41.780
- Thank you.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.420
- I'm kind of on the
proactive end of the spectrum,

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.030
I would say.

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:54.350
Because I think that one of
the great ways a museum gets

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.710
to demonstrate its civicness
isn't so much public,

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:01.160
because it actually shows
up in one's budget, which

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.900
is-- where do we
spend our money,

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:08.840
and what priorities does
that actually demonstrate?

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.930
And so the decision to
invest in teenagers,

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:18.860
which almost all of us do
in one way or another--

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.650
that's a priority.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.740
To me, that defines
civic engagement--

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.770
figuring out what groups
of students we work with.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:35.270
Thinking about where
the relationship of--

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:39.140
you had originally asked about
the humanities and museums

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.140
and what's going on there.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.170
And of course, then, you
begin to think, OK, well,

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.820
here in this august beautiful
hall, we're part of the, what,

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:56.180
400 selective liberal arts
institutions in the country,

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.090
of which there are almost 4,000.

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:03.650
So that means the majority
are not, quote unquote,

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.230
"highly" selective,"
which means they

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:11.125
don't accept more than 50%.

00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:13.340
So not even that selective.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.170
No offense.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:19.730
And so I think about,
civic engagement really

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.480
is a set of choices
about who are

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.060
our partners institutionally.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:29.800
Who are the people we
serve, and to what degree?

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.275
Because again, we're all trying
to do pretty much everything.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.770
But I think that there are real
choices and real consequences

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.130
to all of the choices
we make, whether it's

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:46.370
to work together on a
letter about NEA and NEH

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.400
funding-- self-serving on
the one hand, of course,

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.450
but speaking very much
to a national policy

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.700
and an investment in our future.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.550
Or many of us are part
of an amicus brief

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.225
filed for the Supreme Court
challenging the travel ban.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.030
At many different
levels, I'd say,

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:10.850
we are all quite proactive.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:14.105
And that is one way of thinking
about civic engagement.

00:53:14.105 --> 00:53:16.740
- Your point about the
budget is really well taken.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:19.130
I mean, even when we have
to sit down and decide how

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.170
to use our marketing dollars--

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.780
it's a huge engagement question.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.460
- Right.

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:25.370
And to whom?

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:27.260
It sort of goes back
to the city issue,

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.240
which is, where's all
of the new building?

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.240
Where's the new Boston,
the Boston that's on fire?

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.460
Well, it's not in
Dorchester, by and large.

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.900
I can tell you that.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:40.130
I was this morning in
Dudley at a meeting,

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:42.710
and it's mostly
not there either.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:49.430
East Boston is going to
be my neck of the woods

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:50.780
with the strip there.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.840
It's the strip of the
waterfront, which is going

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.620
to be quite expensive condos.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:02.000
Meanwhile, it's a neighborhood
of 58% immigrants, mostly

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.890
Central American.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.970
So there's these
three communities

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.500
in tension-- the long-term
Italian working class

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.330
families, all these
immigrants, and now

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.310
all the new people
buying condos.

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:17.240
So we all make
complicated choices,

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.500
but we do make those choices.

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.780
- Well, because you brought
up the humanities, Jill--

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.190
- I did that for you.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.290
- It's true.

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:30.230
Originally, we
thought very much--

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:36.530
universities are focused on
the humanities and particularly

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:43.490
the need with every generation
to champion the humanities.

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:47.859
And this may fall more into the
what, as opposed to the why,

00:54:47.859 --> 00:54:48.900
in Matthew's formulation.

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.890
But let me ask a slightly
different question that's

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:56.090
more specific to museums and
museum collections, which

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:59.990
has to do with the study
of the art of the past.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:04.520
Two of you are overseeing
museums that are specifically

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.720
contemporary art museums--

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.490
although how we define
"contemporary art"

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:10.160
is, of course, ever-evolving.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.400
And Matthew, you come from a
contemporary art background,

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:17.930
although you oversee
an encyclopedic museum.

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:19.970
There does seem to be,
at least from where

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:23.990
I sit in an academic art
history department, more

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:26.390
and more of a presentist
turn among students.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.510
You see the ascendancy of
contemporary art in the art

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:31.340
world as well.

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:36.140
Within this situation,
what is the value

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.120
of the study of the
art of the past?

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:44.357
How does it relate
to the presentation

00:55:44.357 --> 00:55:45.190
of contemporary art.

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:50.291
Are we too presentist in our
presentation of art right now?

00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:53.582
- They're the ones
with the collections.

00:55:53.582 --> 00:55:55.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:55.742 --> 00:56:03.380
- Well, if I can jump in, being
a collection largely of the art

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.590
of the past-- although we have
a very active contemporary

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:10.166
program and an
artist-in-residence program

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:12.440
that's 25 years old.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.080
Actually, Jill was
involved in its inception

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.030
when she was at
the Gardner Museum,

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:20.150
and now we have a wonderful
curator of contemporary art

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:22.550
who oversees the program.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:26.030
I'm going to go back to your
very first question, in terms

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:32.210
of an experience from our life
that moved us or inspired us

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:33.350
toward museums.

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:40.670
And mine was with a piece of
art of what was then the past.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.350
It was a 20th-century piece.

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:48.260
But now, 20th century blue chip
art is the art of the past.

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.050
I mean, it might as well
be a Renaissance painting

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.210
in many people's minds.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:57.890
And I was in front of
a Franz Kline painting

00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:02.120
and talking to a friend of
mine about the painting,

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:07.560
and talking about just
trying to look at the imagery

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:12.260
and seeing it as barbed
wire, and talking

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:18.330
about the brutality of war
and the invocation of violence

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:24.710
and this black-and-white
dichotomy.

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:26.600
And I passed out.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.830
So I had a Stendhal moment,
or I was extremely moved

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:33.260
by the painting or something.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:36.830
But I literally woke
up in a guard's office

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:39.020
with someone waving
smelling salts over you.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.395
Somehow, I'd gotten from
the gallery down the stairs.

00:57:41.395 --> 00:57:45.350
This was at the
RISD Museum of Art,

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:49.530
where they're used to having
students pass out, I assume--

00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:52.650
for all kinds of reasons
other than the art.

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.410
But anyway, it
does bring me back

00:57:55.410 --> 00:58:02.320
to this idea of both
the potency of art,

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.080
that once it's created--

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:08.350
I think sometimes,
because all of us,

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:16.650
I think, are very supportive,
very jazzed, very energized,

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:20.790
and deeply believe
in the creative act

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:28.380
and the artistic process, that
sometimes we don't equally

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:33.840
broadcast our conviction in
art once it has been created.

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.580
And that's what the
art of the past is.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.260
It's art that's been created.

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.080
It's of its own time.

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.520
And that that
retains its potency,

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:45.060
although we unlock it
in different ways--

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:46.170
that's the challenge.

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.360
How do we unlock the
power of that art,

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:53.190
because it still
has that potential?

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:55.390
And that was one
lesson, one take-away.

00:58:55.390 --> 00:59:00.090
And the other was, how much
conversation-- and this goes

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.910
back a little to different
modes of engagement,

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:08.010
and is it social, is it other?

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:10.530
Any time there's a
conversation, obviously

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:12.660
it has a social
component, but it also

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:17.700
is how we attend to art,
how we engage with art,

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:22.440
and how conversation can
be a facilitator that

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.590
makes the art of the
past relevant, because it

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:30.760
lives in the present through
our engagement with it.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:36.480
And that's part of our job,
is to make art live now,

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.390
regardless of when
it was created.

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:41.100
I mean, that would be--

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.940
obviously, coming
from the Gardner,

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.160
I have a vested
interest in making

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.570
the art of the past live.

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:52.500
But I would imagine that we
all want the art of the past

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.830
to live in the present, because
we have a stake in that,

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:59.536
and as does the public, I think.

00:59:59.536 --> 01:00:01.920
- So I'm in contemporary
art because I wanted

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.260
to support living artists.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.400
I think that's the
contribution that I can make.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.150
And depending on
which scholar you ask,

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.820
contemporary art's been
around for quite a bit.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.100
We're 17,000 to 35,000
years, depending

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.340
on which scholar you ask,
but those cave drawings--

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.110
it goes back that far.

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:21.900
But I find visual arts to
be particularly interesting

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.250
because it's a very different
type of art, in that you

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.070
have to be really original.

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:31.950
So I'm going to be
broadly generalist here,

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:35.190
but in music, if you play
someone else's music really

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:36.840
well, you're a good artist.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.180
If you're a singer, if you-- you
know, a la school of whoever,

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.100
you're very good.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.310
Whereas visual arts,
if you do something

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.920
that's been done before,
people pick up on it,

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.540
and it's not for the
pedestal of our history.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.210
You won't make it up there if
you're recreating something.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:02.180
So we are all here to support
living contemporary artists.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.600
However, all the artists
have to know art history.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.750
If you come to us
with an object saying,

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.730
I discovered this
new way of painting--

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:14.630
I put cameras on the floor
and I dripped paint on it.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.290
It's been done before.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:20.680
So I think for all of us,
it's moving the art forward.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.890
It's taking it to a place
that's nowhere it's been before.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.540
But for the
practitioners, they have

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.270
to have to know the
craft and the history

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.366
before they can move
on to the next step.

01:01:32.366 --> 01:01:35.630
- So behind the
strategic plan at the MFA

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:37.610
are a few sets of beliefs.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:41.680
And one of them is, open
is better than closed.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.870
And what I think about leading
an extraordinary staff who

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.900
take care of one of the great
collections of the world,

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:54.430
historical art, is that
one of my challenges

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:59.060
is to see historical art
as open and not closed.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.590
And when we can achieve
that-- which is to say,

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:06.820
other voices can come in, when
interpretation can be complex

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:11.380
and not linear, when maybe we
believe in many disciplines

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.590
as well as our history--

01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:17.300
we may open it up in a way that
creates life in those objects.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:23.050
I mean one of my very first
experiences at the MFA

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:24.999
before I even knew really
anybody was to walk

01:02:24.999 --> 01:02:26.290
through the Egyptian galleries.

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:27.670
And I just kept looking.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:30.494
And I don't know a lot
about Egyptian art.

01:02:30.494 --> 01:02:31.660
I didn't know anything then.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.400
I know a little bit more now.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.180
But what I know is, there are
a lot of broken noses in there.

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.890
You walk down,
and then I started

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:42.760
looking at the text panels, and
there wasn't one single text

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.980
panel that addressed
what you were

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.830
seeing when you walked through.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:52.590
And so my legacy the MFA?

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:54.242
Very simple.

01:02:54.242 --> 01:02:56.320
A room of broken noses.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.680
It'll happen by
the time I leave.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.820
And then text panels that
explain why the nose is broken.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.610
And that's open, to me.

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:09.650
That's an open way of creating
a way of understanding

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:12.770
an object through the voices of
many, because to really answer

01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:14.300
that question is complex.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:18.090
It talks to religion, it talks
to a whole range of things.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.940
And that notion of
openness is what

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.672
I think we have to achieve
in our historical collection.

01:03:22.672 --> 01:03:24.950
- I think another thing
that can be really powerful

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:28.880
is artists speaking about
earlier art, particularly

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.060
the art that inspired
them themselves.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.190
And I think that can be
wonderful for students.

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:38.000
It's often very
mesmerizing and compelling

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.360
for the general public
to think about the fact

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.970
that an artist, even
a very well-known one,

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:45.150
started somewhere.

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:48.090
And what were they looking
at as they began to make art?

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.390
And what has their
inquiry looked

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:55.190
like, and where has the art of
the past intersected with what

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:57.070
they're trying to do?

01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:58.845
They can be great conversations.

01:03:58.845 --> 01:04:04.190
- Well, I mean, it's no surprise
that we've heard so many,

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:07.520
I think, inspiring
formulations about the value

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.660
of the art of the past
from our participants.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.960
And I wanted to ask--

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.230
one of the jobs of a museum
director is to be inspiring.

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:25.190
But as you pointed out, museums
are such complex institutions

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:26.660
now.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.470
You have to manage so
many different roles.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.850
And one of the
questions I like to ask

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:36.410
is how you have seen the
position of the museum director

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:38.620
change over the years.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.480
What is the museum director now?

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.109
And tell us where it's leading.

01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:45.650
What does the museum director
going to be like in the future,

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:51.078
in the year 2030 or beyond?

01:04:51.078 --> 01:04:53.856
- Who knows?

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:55.890
- Well, the question that
none of us can answer

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:58.170
is what the role of
the museum director

01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:02.700
will be in its formation
as the custodian of objects

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.700
that are increasingly valued,
increasingly rare, more

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.744
contested.

01:05:06.744 --> 01:05:08.160
And we can't answer
that question.

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:14.230
There are some
trustees of the MFA

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:15.950
here, so I really
shouldn't say this,

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.190
but I don't actually
think being a museum

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.700
director is so complicated.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.931
Really.

01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:25.990
I think that you're an
advocate for the meaning of art

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.990
in your community, and you
are looking at different ways

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.330
to activate the people
with whom you work in order

01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:36.150
to have the biggest,
loudest, most effective

01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:37.809
platform you can create.

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.600
And if you have the
passion around what art

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.200
can do in your community,
a lot follows from that.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.420
And we all have
extraordinary teams around us

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.620
of people who are expert in
areas that we're not expert,

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.840
and our job is to make
sure we understand

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.080
how to connect to them
so that we don't assume

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.180
that we know the answers
that other people know

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.440
better than we do.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:05.300
But if the passion
is in the middle,

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:09.101
we can take a lot to the edges.

01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:10.970
- I think it's
getting kind of comp--

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.710
I mean, I do think
it is complicated.

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:20.180
So I'll have to get a private
tutorial or something,

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.090
figure it out better.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.102
But aren't you all struck?

01:06:24.102 --> 01:06:25.310
I mean, we're here in a room.

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:29.525
Almost everyone here, from
where I sit, looks white.

01:06:29.525 --> 01:06:31.040
- Not where I'm sitting.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.960
- Not where you're sitting.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.230
Are you looking out?

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:38.630
At the ICA, we've
just come through--

01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:40.460
I don't even know that
we're through it--

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:44.510
a fairly complicated situation
regarding an exhibition we

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:49.220
have on view right now with
the painter Dana Schutz.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.030
And Dana Schutz,
some of you may know,

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:57.500
made a painting called
Open Casket, which

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.230
depicts in a somewhat
abstracted way

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:03.746
the open coffin of Emmett
Till, and it was included

01:07:03.746 --> 01:07:04.745
in the Whitney biennial.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:11.240
Now, that painting
never was intended

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.880
to be part of the
ICA exhibition,

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.370
and it is not part of
the ICA exhibition,

01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:18.710
but the controversy
of the painting

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:22.920
has come to the exhibition
and to the institution.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.780
And I do think it is, as we
go forward in a city that is--

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.300
in a world that is changing
so much, that is divided,

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:39.320
that has real inequities
and issues, that our job--

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.150
I don't know what
it will be in 2030,

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:47.150
but I do think that we are
all being asked to change,

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:49.910
whether or not the
controversy is on our doorstep

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:54.350
today or last year or whatever.

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:57.650
We need to change our staffs,
need to change our audiences,

01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:58.520
changing--

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:04.910
history needs to be
augmented and retold.

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:06.950
Storytelling is changing.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.990
Digital life is changing.

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:11.300
And juggling all that--

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.150
now, I think I find
that complicated myself.

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.870
Challenging.

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:16.010
I love it.

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.540
But I don't know the answers.

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:21.770
And I know I have changed
myself through the Dana Schutz

01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:23.630
exhibition and
grappling with it.

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:28.799
So I feel my own movement, both
personally and institutionally.

01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:31.779
- So give us a sense
about how you've changed,

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:33.130
or what that movement is.

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:34.609
- Well, I would say--

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:39.979
I'm not so prepared here,
but what I would say

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:43.500
is that I think that what the
question has shifted to me,

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.270
is not one just of
cultural appropriation

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:49.910
or sensitivity to
audience, but actually

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:51.590
a question of authority.

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:55.040
And how is the issue of
cultural authority changing,

01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.170
and how does it need to change,
and without stepping down

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.840
myself and getting
rid of half my staff,

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.149
how am I going to make
some of those changes

01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:11.029
quickly enough to change
who has voices of authority

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:13.880
in making decisions
and understanding

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.929
the implications of decisions
we make, just for example?

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:22.979
So I don't know the future.

01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:25.529
I definitely don't.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:29.910
But I do find it
to be an extremely

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:39.120
challenging, important time
to lead a civic institution.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.200
It's a great privilege.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.949
But I find it a great
responsibility, and not easy.

01:09:43.949 --> 01:09:47.870
- I think directors' role and
responsibilities will change

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.760
as the institutions change.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:55.430
And right now, all of us in
addition to the visual art

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:57.410
world, are in flux.

01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:01.640
So every institution, whether
it's a symphony or the opera

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.420
library--

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.646
we're all in a crisis.

01:10:03.646 --> 01:10:05.270
We're all in crisis
mode, and we're all

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:09.250
looking to see how we can
reach the larger audience,

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:12.950
reach the next generations
of participants and users.

01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:15.920
And so I'm sure all
the institutions will

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.530
adapt or change or disappear.

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:21.130
But whoever takes on
that role in 2030--

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:25.580
and I won't be there
for that, probably--

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.577
I'm sure the board--

01:10:26.577 --> 01:10:28.160
and I know Matthew
says we're leaders.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.451
We're leaders, but we're also
saying, at the same time,

01:10:30.451 --> 01:10:32.680
middle management.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.600
We're sort of stuck in between
our board and the people

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.890
that we serve, and we're
trying to fit where--

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:43.340
the best directors are
good problem solvers.

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.800
And I'm sure the board,
whoever does the hiring,

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.690
will hire the best
problem-solvers, who

01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:50.270
are sensitive and
capable and who

01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:54.710
can see the widest vision to
serve the best that they can

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:58.266
with the institution that
has given the task to.

01:10:58.266 --> 01:11:00.480
- One of the interesting
things we heard--

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.630
some of us were there, I
think, at the last meeting

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:07.110
of the Association of
Art Museum Directors--

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:09.480
was part of a session
on philanthropy

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.990
that was held at the Gates
Foundation in Seattle.

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:16.500
And what we were being
told by several heads

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.710
of major philanthropic
organizations

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:23.340
is that the big funders,
the Gates Foundation,

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.150
funders of that category--

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:28.110
they want to tackle the
world's problems right now.

01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:34.650
And unless museums can
become places for solutions,

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:38.100
we're going to be
out of the loop.

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.280
So if we had to guess, who
knows what 2030 will look

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.740
like, but I'm going to guess
that directors are going

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.250
to need more capacity in
terms of understanding things

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:50.149
that are outside of their
traditional areas of expertise,

01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:51.690
and that they're
going to really have

01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:53.640
to have a much
bigger understanding

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.290
of global problems.

01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:59.310
And we're talking about poverty,
disease, climate change,

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:01.200
migration.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.610
How museums will engage with
these issues will probably

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:09.030
vary from institution
to institution,

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.160
but I think among
other pressures,

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.640
philanthropists are going
to insist that we engage

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.070
with the problems of our world.

01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:20.680
The other thing that the
Gates fellow said, and--

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.060
there was another flap, because
there was not just that,

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.800
but he certainly said
that powerfully--

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.440
but that their support
was going to go

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.340
to those cultural institutions
that cross disciplines and that

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.580
actually found a way to partner
outside of the discipline

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.110
of the cultural institution.

01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:43.410
And I don't know if
that's temporary or not.

01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:46.680
But picking up on what
Jill said-- and I continue

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.470
to think it's not that
complicated, although I do

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:54.224
think that it takes a lot
of attention and openness.

01:12:54.224 --> 01:12:55.640
But I do think
what you're saying,

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.306
which is extraordinary,
powerful, and is

01:12:57.306 --> 01:13:01.192
something that I think about a
lot, is, who speaks for whom?

01:13:01.192 --> 01:13:03.650
And that's part of what you're
saying about the Dana Schutz

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:04.280
situation.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.730
I think that is the question
of authority of institutions.

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:13.310
But what I mean by saying that
it's not that complicated which

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:16.220
I guess maybe it
is-- but what I mean

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:19.160
is, the way to get
to the solution,

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.260
if you accept that
it's a process, that it

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:25.290
is an engagement and
conversation with others,

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:26.290
you can get there.

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:27.510
It's not intractable.

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:28.842
It's not impossible.

01:13:28.842 --> 01:13:30.300
It's the fact that
we can't predict

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.000
where we're going to be in
25 years it doesn't mean

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.550
that the process
of getting there

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.000
doesn't have immediate
and consequential rewards.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.190
That's what I'm saying.

01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:42.540
- This is such a
rich discussion.

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.100
I think this might
be a nice moment

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.800
to open it up to
the audience and ask

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.660
for anybody who would to
ask could pose a question

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.970
to approach the microphone
in the center aisle.

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.160
And when you do
pose your question,

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.972
if you could state your
name and any affiliation,

01:13:58.972 --> 01:13:59.805
that would be great.

01:13:59.805 --> 01:14:00.730
- Hi.

01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:04.500
I'm Vanessa, and I'm a
student at the Graduate

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.220
School of Education right
now in arts and education.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.950
And I wanted to
refer back to what

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:16.100
Paul was saying about
talking about educating art

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:19.710
practitioners
about the art canon

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:22.920
in order to go into
civic engagement.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.760
And I'm thinking about
Boston as a city,

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:33.540
and as we were talking about
bringing the arts into Boston.

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:38.820
And I'm from LA, and
it's a cultural hub,

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.300
and I see programs
like the Getty's PSTLA,

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:49.050
and many museums' programs
where they engage directly

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:50.850
with artists, working artists.

01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:54.610
And that usually comes in
the university setting.

01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:57.630
So what I want to ask is,
how does the institution

01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:01.050
of the museum engage with the
institution of the academy

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:04.380
through the university
and its artists,

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:08.430
and then how does that
funnel into the engagement

01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:11.491
of these institutions
with the city?

01:15:11.491 --> 01:15:14.230
Does that make sense?

01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:15.710
- Is that directed to me or--?

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:16.786
- Go for it.

01:15:16.786 --> 01:15:20.047
- OK.

01:15:20.047 --> 01:15:22.130
I think it's a great title,
"The Museum, the City,

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:24.463
and the University," but I
think that's one thing that's

01:15:24.463 --> 01:15:26.951
glaringly missing for
me, which is The Artist.

01:15:26.951 --> 01:15:29.450
I think "the artist" should
have been included in the title,

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:32.060
because without
artists, there's no art.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.460
There is an ecosystem
to the art world,

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:36.500
and the two institutions
that you mentioned,

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.630
the teaching institutions
and the museums.

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:41.190
But in addition to that,
there's also alternative spaces.

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:42.150
There's artists.

01:15:42.150 --> 01:15:43.490
There's collectors.

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:45.650
And all those things help--

01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:46.970
and galleries.

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:51.200
And we're losing
more-- we lost Camilo,

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.770
who ran a very excellent
gallery in Boston Samson.

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:58.310
And so I think
when I said Boston

01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:01.580
has this within a
renaissance of visual arts,

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.540
We are missing a
couple of things here.

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:06.740
And one thing that we need
to shore up or support

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:12.560
or to be aware of, and perhaps
point towards helping it grow,

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.980
is the artist community, and
an alternative space community

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.390
and gallery community.

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:19.140
That's three out of
five that I mentioned,

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.840
which is not a good percentage.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:27.380
However, since the museums and
the public scholarly teaching

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:30.920
institutions are so strong,
it sort of can make up for it.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.680
But we do need, I
think, those three areas

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.760
to somehow get there.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.655
Boston being rich
with universities--

01:16:38.655 --> 01:16:40.280
one thing that I'm
noticing, because we

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.750
are so close to other
metropolitan cities

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:45.050
is that a lot of
artists are basically

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:47.460
commuters out of
the nine months,

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.960
and then they go back to
whatever city they're from.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.780
And some live in LA, which
I think is ridiculous.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.970
So somehow, collectively,
we can think

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.220
about supporting those
three additional groups

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.250
or growing them,
I think we would

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:05.044
have a multiplicative
effect on the city.

01:17:05.044 --> 01:17:10.830
- The triangle between the
museum, the university,

01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:15.000
and the artist that was
conjured up in the question,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.810
misses one thing for me, which
is the notion of the audience.

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:25.260
And I had an unfortunate
dinner party--

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:28.000
well, the dinner party
wasn't unfortunate,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.850
but the conversation
for me was unfortunate,

01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:33.000
because I made the point,
which I feel strongly

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.110
that the most important thing
a museum creates is audience.

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:38.640
And there were some--

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.020
I might say it with emphasis--
some Harvard academics

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.180
at the dinner, and they
were making the point

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:48.480
that the most important thing
museums great is knowledge.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.896
So a good robust conversation.

01:17:50.896 --> 01:17:52.770
It wasn't actually
unfortunate, except to say

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:55.620
that I think that when you
think of the relationship

01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:00.245
of the museum, the
university, and the artist,

01:18:00.245 --> 01:18:01.620
I think you have
to ask yourself,

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.390
in the service of what?

01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:05.640
And I think that a robust
conversation around this

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.830
would be, what is the
audience you produce,

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:10.050
the enlightened citizen,
the engaged citizen?

01:18:10.050 --> 01:18:13.770
And that's where I think that
the link between universities

01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:15.240
and art museums can be stronger.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.190
- My name's Laura Roberts.

01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:21.990
I'm an independent
museum professional,

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:24.570
and I teach here in the
museum studies program.

01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:26.700
I've been teaching
museum graduate

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.650
students for about 30 years.

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:32.460
To say there's nothing quite
like that to keep you honest,

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:37.200
because I'm otherwise an
age peer of most of you.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.680
And one of the things that
those students are telling me

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.450
is that--

01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:45.810
it's a conversation that
has erupted most recently

01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:47.190
in the production of a T-shirt.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:51.540
I have one on order that
says museums are not neutral.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:55.620
What they should say on the back
is that they never have been.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.740
And I'm wondering what
your response is to that.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.200
If your staff came in
wearing a Museums Are

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.650
Not Neutral T-shirt,
what would you say,

01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:09.364
and would you own a Museums
Are Not Neutral T-shirt?

01:19:09.364 --> 01:19:10.920
- I'll answer that.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.400
I think at a certain age,
T-shirts don't look that well.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:21.870
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:25.350
I wouldn't wear one.

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:26.970
I don't know that--

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:31.020
I'm not sure that is the goal,
that museums should be neutral.

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:36.450
I agree that they are not
and that they have not been.

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:38.970
And they are not places where
everyone is comfortable.

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:46.050
I'm not sure comfort is
the goal of art or museums.

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:48.900
I think that what
is necessary is

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:55.170
being able to own, talk about,
be honest about one's past,

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:59.500
whether that's personal bias
or the history of museums

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.510
of places--

01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:05.750
most museums-- of white
power and privilege.

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.390
So most definitely not neutral.

01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:16.420
But I guess I would push back
at neutral as the highest goal.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:17.030
I don't know.

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.250
I'd have to go to the why,
Matthew, but I'm not sure.

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:23.740
But if my staff wore
one, I'd be fine.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:27.220
- A question would be,
what would neutral look

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.670
like in terms of a museum?

01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:31.599
- Or period.

01:20:31.599 --> 01:20:32.140
What does l--

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:32.980
- Or what does neutral--

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:33.688
- Like anywhere--

01:20:33.688 --> 01:20:34.220
- look like?

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.220
- Is a sidewalk neutral?

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:41.680
- And I think we can all
readily investigate and discuss

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.400
how we are not
neutral spaces, both

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.940
from the history of how
collections were formed

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:52.390
and how the canon of art
history was developed--

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:58.360
frankly, to the color of the
walls and the way that art is

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.020
contextualized, all
of which influences

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:05.650
not just the art you see but
the way you perceive that art.

01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:07.960
And all the
different-- before you

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.420
even get into the
museum, what you're

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:14.950
seeing, how you're greeted, what
the transactional relationship

01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:17.080
is at that entry desk.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.980
Those are all things
that influence and shape

01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:22.450
our experience or art.

01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:27.160
And so in so many ways,
we are not neutral spaces.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.130
And we think we need
to acknowledge that.

01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:34.120
But one also needs to ask the
question, what is neutral?

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.550
And what is that experience?

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:40.900
Because I don't know that
I've ever experienced

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:42.810
something at all neutral.

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:45.790
- I don't know where this
particular T-shirt came from,

01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:48.640
but I know that the Museum
of Contemporary Art,

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.170
their director has proposed that
they think about it this way--

01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:56.980
that we are not partisan,
but we are not neutral.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.760
So in other words, "neutrality"
taking on a slightly different

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.060
connotation than "partisan."

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.530
And I think we're not neutral.

01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:08.170
I mean, we all have
hopes of the kinds

01:22:08.170 --> 01:22:13.420
of conversations that are going
to happen in our institutions.

01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:16.630
We don't want to direct what
the conclusions and the answers

01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:20.320
are, but I think we're
very interested in being

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.120
a platform for
those conversations

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.830
and using our collections
in quite pointed ways.

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:27.290
But I think maybe
it helps in terms

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:31.330
of in the kind of dichotomy
that was set up by the MCA.

01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:32.330
Think about it that way.

01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:33.330
- You mean in Chicago?

01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:34.720
MCA in Chicago, Martha?

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.105
- MCA in Chicago, yeah.

01:22:36.105 --> 01:22:39.130
- I think the idea of staff
coming into the MFA wearing

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:42.010
that T-shirt would be
fabulous, because it would be

01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:44.020
the beginning of
the conversation.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.260
If not neutral, then
what is our position,

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.850
and how do we discuss
that position?

01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:51.850
And how do we arrive at either
an institutional position

01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:54.934
or a series of project positions
that amount to something?

01:22:54.934 --> 01:22:56.350
That would be a
great conversation

01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:57.916
to be more self-aware about.

01:23:01.087 --> 01:23:02.050
- Hi.

01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:03.030
I am Renana Kehoe.

01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:05.550
I work at the
Harvard Art Museums.

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:09.720
My question was, who
are your museums for?

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.590
And if the answer is something
like everyone or a big group,

01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:17.910
how do you appeal to
or attract or engage

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:21.080
such a wide-ranging
audience or group?

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.416
- Next question?

01:23:26.416 --> 01:23:30.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.710
I think that in some
sense at the MFA,

01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:34.379
we think we are for everybody.

01:23:34.379 --> 01:23:35.920
But if you look at
our strategic plan

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.560
and thought about where we
saw our areas of growth,

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.330
we're really quite specific.

01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:42.490
And that comes back to the
question of the utility

01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:44.830
we feel we can have
in our communities.

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:48.160
So to be very
precise, we believe

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.080
that we are for those people
who self-select as our members.

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.420
But beyond that, if
we think about growth,

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.580
we think of students.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.460
We think of
multigenerational families.

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:02.620
And we think of
creative industries,

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.780
24- to 35-year-olds.

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:07.630
Because we think if we
can create conversations

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:11.470
for those communities in Boston
and create a sense of belonging

01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:12.116
at the MFA--

01:24:12.116 --> 01:24:13.990
that in other words, we
can give back to them

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.180
a purpose and a
kind of conversation

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.840
in their communities--

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.660
we can be of greater use in
the civic sense in Boston.

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:28.270
- I think maybe it's useful to
distinguish between who are we

01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:36.460
for, and where are our
greatest opportunities in terms

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:41.770
of connection and in terms
of community relevance?

01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:43.880
And those may be two
different things,

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.090
in the sense that
I think we want

01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:50.200
to be for everyone in the sense
that we want we want to welcome

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.060
everyone who wants to come.

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:55.450
Of course we don't force
people to come to the museum--

01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:57.490
except in school groups,
where we actually

01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:00.940
to force people to
come to the museum.

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:03.370
And we could have a whole
conversation about that.

01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:07.630
But we all, I think,
based on our institutions,

01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:10.240
on our collections
for the Gardner,

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.740
definitely in terms of
our geographic location,

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:18.820
look at what our
opportunities are.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.470
For instance, in
terms of the Gardner,

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:25.360
we're very focused on our
hyper-local communities

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:32.410
of Roxbury and Mission Hill,
who may not traditionally

01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:35.080
have felt that the Gardner
was a place for them,

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.490
and for good reason, and
which are communities

01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:46.640
of tremendous creativity that we
would like to collaborate with.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.170
And so we've begun
to co-create programs

01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:54.190
with artists and artistic
leaders in Roxbury and Mission

01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:58.970
Hill that can be
both for tradition,

01:25:58.970 --> 01:26:00.400
the people who
come to the Gardner

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.270
anyway, but also to
give voice to members

01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:10.690
of our hyper-local communities
and to have them feel that they

01:26:10.690 --> 01:26:12.560
do have a voice in the museum.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.970
So I think all of us
try to figure out,

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:20.780
where are our opportunities
for each of our institutions?

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.005
And the answer may be
different for each of us.

01:26:23.005 --> 01:26:25.370
- Because we are
not for everyone.

01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:28.510
But if you are
curious about where

01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:32.410
art is going in terms of future,
then we are the place for you.

01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:35.680
And I will readily admit
that not everything we show

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.480
will end up at the
MFA in the collection.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.820
A lot of our stuff
that we show may just

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.340
disappear into the
ether of art history.

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:45.490
But I feel like our job is
to present to what people

01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.020
are talking about right now.

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.360
The people that I surround
myself, the people that we

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.480
have conversation with--

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.640
it's a modest proposal,
presenting something

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.647
to you and to say, what
do you think about this?

01:26:56.647 --> 01:26:57.980
Is this something insignificant?

01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.760
Or is it something that we
should absolutely throw away

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.210
and not think about ever again?

01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.800
So if you want to see
something that there's

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.312
a small group of people
that's talking about,

01:27:08.312 --> 01:27:09.520
then we're the place for you.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.380
But if you want
generality, we're

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.915
really not the place for you.

01:27:13.915 --> 01:27:15.760
- I don't think I
have that much to add.

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.770
The only group that
hasn't been mentioned

01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:21.410
that is very important
to the ICA is teenagers.

01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:24.100
We have about 7,000
teenagers a year

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:29.740
in the ICA in our teen programs,
and putting them together

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:34.030
with our artists is one of
the important constituents

01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:36.850
that we serve.

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:38.344
And artists.

01:27:38.344 --> 01:27:39.580
- Hi.

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:40.270
My name is Jen.

01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:43.192
I work in the Education
Department at the MFA.

01:27:43.192 --> 01:27:45.280
Sorry, Matthew.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.472
- I'm glad you do.

01:27:47.472 --> 01:27:49.602
- You'll see what
my question is.

01:27:49.602 --> 01:27:51.310
And I just first wanted
to thank you all,

01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:53.230
because I think this
conversation has been

01:27:53.230 --> 01:27:57.430
super-interesting
and very energizing

01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:59.410
for me as a museum educator.

01:27:59.410 --> 01:28:02.770
My question is about the
very controversial topic

01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:04.880
of unpaid internships.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.690
And I ask because I think
it really encapsulates

01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:10.840
museum, city, and university,
because it involves university

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.180
students.

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:15.580
Unpaid internships--
I think, Jill, you

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.469
might have kind of
hinted at this the most

01:28:17.469 --> 01:28:19.510
when you were talking
about the lack of diversity

01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:21.362
in museum staffs.

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:23.860
I think that's something all
museums are struggling with,

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:25.450
and we're really
feeling the effects

01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:27.610
when it comes to
interpretation and exhibitions

01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.650
and programming.

01:28:29.650 --> 01:28:32.470
And unpaid internships are
often the most direct filter

01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:35.380
into staff positions at museums.

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:39.310
I know that I was an MFA
intern, and now I work there.

01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:42.370
And now, as someone that has
interns and supervises them

01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:43.960
over the summer,
I've really been

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.170
struck by this huge lack
of diversity in applicants,

01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:51.250
and our intern pool, both
racially but socioeconomically

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:52.480
as well.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.810
I'm wondering,
because you guys are

01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:57.520
in such influential
positions, if you

01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:59.280
have thoughts about that.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:28:59.905
I know it's a very
complex topic.

01:28:59.905 --> 01:29:00.130
- I do.

01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:01.713
I have really strong
thoughts on that.

01:29:01.713 --> 01:29:03.978
- I thought Jill might.

01:29:03.978 --> 01:29:05.290
- Go ahead.

01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:08.200
- Thank you.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:12.550
I have the mixed
pleasure of chairing

01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:15.520
the professional Issues
committee at AAMD,

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.130
which is the Association of Art
Museum Directors, to which we

01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:24.970
all participate, more or less.

01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:28.750
And at our last meeting in--

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:32.080
wherever we were, Seattle--

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:36.310
I put on the agenda the
issue of paid internships

01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:39.700
to try to see whether that is
something that we as a field

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.580
could actually adopt as
a policy in the same way

01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.460
we have other
field-wide policies

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:49.830
that govern our behavior and
our practice, our accreditation,

01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:50.590
et cetera.

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:53.110
And actually, this past
summer, for the first time,

01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:56.410
the ICA only had paid
interns, and we're trying

01:29:56.410 --> 01:29:58.990
to embody that going further.

01:29:58.990 --> 01:30:02.050
There was a mixed
response, I would say--

01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:06.400
not against it in
principle, but in practice,

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.510
for a variety of reasons.

01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:12.050
And so I think it
won't be a slam dunk,

01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:16.150
but there are national
foundations who

01:30:16.150 --> 01:30:18.760
are trying to push this agenda.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:23.920
I think we as a group of peers
and as a field are grappling

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.930
with it, though it may take us a
little time to have one policy.

01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:34.705
And I think as we all begin to
work in our own institutions,

01:30:34.705 --> 01:30:35.695
we see it.

01:30:35.695 --> 01:30:38.230
We understand it and see it.

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:41.140
Because, welcome to our field.

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.420
We need more people like
you, and we need more people

01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.920
not like you.

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.060
- Thank you.

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:52.150
- So I believe in paying
interns and fellows.

01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:53.610
I think it's really important.

01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:54.820
But I'll go even further.

01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:58.840
In one of my older institutions,
we created a teen program.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.030
It was a weekend
program, where we

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:03.880
thought we created
this fantastic program

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.800
for underprivileged youth.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.880
And it was free.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.420
Absolutely free.

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.380
And when we started getting
people to participate,

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:14.440
it all turned out that the
only people who signed up

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.930
were from the suburbs, who
went to private school.

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.870
And we just couldn't figure out
why people weren't signing up,

01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:23.380
because obviously, this is
an incredible program free

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.590
of charge.

01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:28.900
And then we had a meeting
with a bunch of people,

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.630
and they said, well, those
people you're trying to reach--

01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:33.260
they work on the weekends.

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.650
They need to make
money to support

01:31:35.650 --> 01:31:37.750
and help support their family.

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:42.910
And additional to that, they
don't have the transportation

01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:44.340
money to come to your museum.

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:49.660
So we ended up finding a sponsor
to pay for the bus passes.

01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.052
And we paid them--

01:31:52.052 --> 01:31:54.260
we started with minimum
wage, but that's what we did.

01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:58.600
But that's when I realized there
was a disconnect between what

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.710
we thought was great and
what was the reality of life.

01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:06.490
And even though we mean
well, we really sometimes

01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:09.385
have it all wrong.

01:32:09.385 --> 01:32:10.810
- We pay our teams.

01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:11.372
- Yeah.

01:32:11.372 --> 01:32:12.080
Of course you do.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:12.790
- Thank you.

01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:14.155
I really appreciate the honesty.

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:19.280
- Hi, there.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:20.600
I'm Elizabeth Solomon.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.400
I'm an alum of Radcliffe.

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.830
I currently work at the
School of Public Health,

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:29.220
and I'm a degree candidate in
the museum studies program.

01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:33.510
As one of the few brown
people in the audience,

01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:36.110
I was gratified to
hear a lot of talk

01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:41.960
about civic engagement,
inclusion, issues of power

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.580
and voice and authority.

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:49.880
But also, as a museum consumer
who's spent significant time

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.790
in every single one of the
museums except the MIT Museum--

01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:54.230
I'm sorry, I will visit.

01:32:54.230 --> 01:32:55.960
- Nobody visits us.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.195
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:58.195 --> 01:33:02.300
- But I'm really interested,
and having spent a lot of time

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:09.290
and found that a lot of times my
perspectives are not recognized

01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:14.270
and/or presented within museums,
and sometimes, in some cases,

01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:15.200
are really kind of--

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:22.990
in some cases actually in
ways that are disrespectful.

01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:28.030
And I'm wondering what
your plans and goals are

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:30.730
for operationalizing
some of these things

01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:32.200
that you've been talking about.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.690
Because I think they're
very lofty goals,

01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:36.970
but how are you
going to move forward

01:33:36.970 --> 01:33:40.505
in terms of realizing them?

01:33:40.505 --> 01:33:43.130
- So we began a
program at the MFA

01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:46.640
to give free memberships
to naturalized Americans

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.720
in the state of Massachusetts.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.130
And we've set as a goal
that we will judge ourselves

01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:54.500
in five to seven years
on how many of those

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.320
new members become either
gallery guides or staff

01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:58.610
members.

01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:00.770
And the question for
us will be, how do we

01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:06.230
create that virtuous connection,
so that we can invite people

01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:10.700
in, welcome them as belonging,
and engage them in creating

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:12.390
meaning in the institution?

01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:14.840
And I think that
until you accept

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.470
that you have to invite people
in to help create meaning,

01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:20.930
which is my point about
voice, in the end,

01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:25.580
you won't get that
true connection.

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:31.598
It's a big challenge,
and it's an exciting one.

01:34:31.598 --> 01:34:33.770
- I think you ask a
very good question.

01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:37.430
I know one of the
things we've done

01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:42.020
is work with some outside
help, bring in outside help

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.710
to train our staff.

01:34:43.710 --> 01:34:45.800
We've actually invited
our colleagues,

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:50.140
staff from our
sister institutions

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:54.470
for training on how to
engage with visitors

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:57.290
around complex works
of art where there

01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:02.660
might be difference of opinion
or difficult subject matter,

01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.010
doing--

01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.670
I'm not sure.

01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:06.860
I understood your
question to be,

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:12.200
how are we
operationalizing this, yes?

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.470
And so I think it's lots
of training and lots

01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.740
of repetition,
actually, especially

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:24.110
because typically, a lot of our
front-of-house staff is young,

01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:28.070
and there's a fairly
high turnover rate.

01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:34.040
So it is constant, but it
is a combination, I'd say,

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.900
of top-down and bottom-up.

01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:42.402
It's both/and.

01:35:42.402 --> 01:35:44.690
- I would also say--

01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:48.620
and I'm very fortunate that
one of our curatorial staff

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:51.050
is here--

01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:54.650
in terms of operationalize,
how do you integrate this

01:35:54.650 --> 01:36:00.200
into the conceptualisation
from the beginning of programs,

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:01.850
exhibitions, et cetera?

01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:07.820
And so one of our upcoming
shows opening in October

01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:10.200
is on Henry James and
American painting.

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:15.050
Not a subject you would
necessarily think.

01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:17.800
It's going to be a very
momentous exhibition,

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.390
as you can tell.

01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:22.610
The heavens will move.

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:28.820
Anyway, not an exhibition that
you would on face value think

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:36.020
might lend itself to a lot
of exploration of connections

01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:39.640
with things happening
now or everyday life,

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.300
the other kinds of things.

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:49.820
But in fact, networks, artistic
networks, creative networks,

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:54.740
are intrinsic to the
whole idea of Henry James

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:57.950
and his connections
with Isabella Stewart

01:36:57.950 --> 01:37:01.700
Gardner and John Singer
Sargent, et cetera, et cetera.

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:05.660
And so the curator
actually decided

01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:11.720
to work with someone
who is in one

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.940
of the groups of
artistic advisers

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:21.950
from our local community to
think about how we would embed

01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:26.840
that idea of current
network, artistic networks

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.900
and creative networks within
our communities today.

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:32.990
How do we embed that in
the exhibition itself,

01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:35.030
not only in the programs
for the exhibition

01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:38.670
but in the interpretive strategy
for the exhibition, et cetera?

01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:48.140
And I'm so moved and proud
of this collaboration,

01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:53.540
because it was actually
operationalizing

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:59.480
and a way of giving--

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:02.780
opening up the
types of voices that

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:09.530
can enter the museum in a
major, major project that

01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:12.410
requires very heavy investment.

01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:15.650
Exhibitions are one
of our most cost-

01:38:15.650 --> 01:38:18.170
and labor-intensive
endeavors, as I

01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:23.570
think anyone in our
institutions would confirm.

01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:29.940
And so that's one example of
how we can begin to do that.

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:33.140
But I think one is
also talking about,

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.500
how do you institutionalize
experimentation?

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.330
Because none of us have
the right answer to this.

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:41.260
It's going to take a
lot of experimentation,

01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:42.344
a lot of trying things.

01:38:42.344 --> 01:38:44.260
And I would say that
that's one of the biggest

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:50.710
challenges to museums, is
how do you keep something--

01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:58.360
how do you remain an
adaptive institution

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.205
once you start operationalizing
and institutionalizing things?

01:39:02.205 --> 01:39:05.620
- And part of that may
be institutionalizing

01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:07.270
institutional critique.

01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:12.730
So museums have been addicted
to big data and metrics

01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:16.420
and visitor research,
but we've maybe not

01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:18.670
invited the same
kind of scrutiny

01:39:18.670 --> 01:39:21.370
in terms of institutional
critique of what we're

01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:25.960
acquiring, of what we're
showing, how we're showing it.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.180
I had a very interesting
experience this year

01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:32.200
walking through the galleries
with a faculty member

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.860
and her class who were taking
a very specific journey

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:39.970
through the museum because of
the subject of their class.

01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:43.570
And they were able
to find some real--

01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:46.737
some not-so-good things
that were happening,

01:39:46.737 --> 01:39:49.070
because our curators were all
installing their galleries

01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:51.100
separately and weren't
thinking about what

01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:53.800
the whole journey might look
like through the galleries.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.240
So now, with some help
from this faculty member

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.340
and her students,
we're actually trained

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:02.410
to think in a more holistic way.

01:40:02.410 --> 01:40:07.240
So I think outside partners can
sometimes critique us in a way

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:10.465
that we would never
do for ourselves.

01:40:10.465 --> 01:40:13.600
- One group that hasn't been
mentioned, except in passing,

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.270
that makes so much
of this possible,

01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:19.330
supporting all of our
welcome and openness,

01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:22.750
is that we are all incredibly
lucky to have these amazing

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:28.480
boards of trustees and
advisers who in Boston--

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.450
and this is a different
kind of architecture.

01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:34.720
And Boston is not a city
with a lot of foundations.

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:37.630
It doesn't have a lot
of corporate support.

01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:43.690
It has an unbelievably engaged
group of philanthropists.

01:40:43.690 --> 01:40:49.120
And so it is a partnership
that coexists along

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.700
with the partnership we
have with our scholars

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:54.970
and our artists and our teachers
and our audiences and our teams

01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:55.780
and families.

01:40:55.780 --> 01:41:00.850
But it is part of the ecosystem
that Paul was talking about,

01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:03.270
and a really critical piece.

01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:07.615
- Thank you for what was
really a terrific, honest,

01:41:07.615 --> 01:41:08.740
and searching conversation.

01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:09.740
So please join me.

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.240
Thank you.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:10.740
[APPLAUSE]

01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.890
