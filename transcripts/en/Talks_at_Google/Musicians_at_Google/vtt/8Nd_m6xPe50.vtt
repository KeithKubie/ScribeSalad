LUCIA NOWIK: Well,
we're going to introduce

00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:47.530
ourselves real quick.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.270
So we all are from Juilliard.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.059
And my name's Lucia.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:53.100

LUCIA NOWIK: And we are all
in our undergraduate there.

00:09:58.756 --> 00:10:01.251
And now we're going to
play some Haydn, yes?

00:15:39.047 --> 00:15:41.380
KEITH WILLIAMS: So we're going
to play the last movement

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.989
of a Finnish composer's
string quartet Edvard Grieg.

00:15:43.989 --> 00:15:45.280

Oh, man.

[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:48.205
Thank you.

00:15:48.205 --> 00:15:50.880
No, you're just keeping
me on task here.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.640
And wow, that was really wrong.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.379
And he wrote this towards
the end of his life.

00:15:57.379 --> 00:15:58.920
And it's just a
really dramatic piece

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.760
with lots of emotion and
also really kind of fun.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.430
But I don't know
if anybody knows

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.740
what a tarantella dance is.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.910
It's a dance that's
kind of fast and crazy.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.890
And this is basically
one of those.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.660
And it's a dance
that-- when you get bit

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.630
by a really poisonous
spider, you dance yourself

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.140
to death in kind of a
joyous rapture a little bit

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.340
in this particular case.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.330
So you'll hear a
lot of happiness

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.960
with this kind of
crazy twist behind it.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.180
And that's on purpose.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.220
So let's hit it.
