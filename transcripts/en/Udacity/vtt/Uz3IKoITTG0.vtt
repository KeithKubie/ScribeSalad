00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And yes the answer is 22, which is the mean of the remaining numbers.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And what's really helping is--is that the real age of each club member.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There is a relationship to the age in the database, but sometimes

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the age in the database gets corrupted.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Something as simple as a typo and perhaps there's a certain chance of a typo, may be 10%

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but then any number in the database can be explained either by the real age or by the typo.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If you have a sequence that reads 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 211, I would submit

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
given what we know about the real ages the score over here is a result of a typo.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And therefore we should not consider it in the calculation of the mean.
