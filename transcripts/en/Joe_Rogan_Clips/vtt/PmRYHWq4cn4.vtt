00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.490
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.010
you are sometimes say artificial life instead of artificial intelligence.
Yeah,

3
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:11.590
because I think that it's a life form.
It's a stupid way to look at it.

4
00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:14.760
As curious to think about like how do you think about artificial and like what

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.594
do you picture?

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
I picture human beings being like electronic caterpillars that are building a

7
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:25.080
cocoon that they have no real knowledge of our understanding and through this

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.440
and new life forms can emerge a life form that doesn't need cells and meeting

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.360
with x and y chromosomes doesn't need any of that shit exists purely in software

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.630
and in hardware and in ones and Zeros and that this is a new form of life.

11
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.340
This is when the inevitable rise of essentially being the inevitable.

12
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:55.500
I mean,
I think if we don't get hit when the asteroid within a thousand years or

13
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:57.600
whatever the number,
the time frame is,

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.500
someone is going to figure out how to make a thing,

15
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.360
who had just walks around and does whatever it wants and lives like a person

16
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.520
that's not outside the realm of possibility.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.980
And I think that if that does happen,

18
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.570
that's artificial life and this is the new life and it's probably going to be

19
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.000
better than what we are.
I mean we are as basically,

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.930
if you go back and look about,
you know,

21
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.620
three hundred thousand four hundred thousand years ago when we were some

22
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.450
Australia [inaudible] type creature,

23
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.230
how many of them would ever look at the future and go,

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.860
I hope I never get a Tesla.
The last thing I want is a fucking phone.

25
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.380
Last thing I want,
it's air conditioning and television.

26
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.880
The last thing I want is to be able to talk in a language that other people can

27
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.820
understand and to be able to call people on the phone.
Fuck all that man.

28
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.570
I like living out here running from Jaguars and shit and constantly getting

29
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.690
jacked by bears,
you know?
No,
they wouldn't think that way.

30
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:56.430
And I think if something comes out of us and makes us obsolete,

31
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.560
but it's,
it's missing all the things that suck about people.

32
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.360
I mean,
it won't be good.

33
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.460
It won't be good on our are hard things suck of a people can wait.
War,

34
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.440
violence,
thievery,
people stealing things from people,

35
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:18.441
people robbing people thing that those dark parts of human nature.

36
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.710
I think,
uh,
the suffering and justice,

37
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.000
I think all of that is necessary for us to discover the better angels.

38
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.780
I don't think you can,
as surgery we can talk,

39
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.440
let's talk about saint she Hanson and creating artificial life,

40
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.050
but I think even those life forms,

41
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:42.000
even those systems need to have the darker parts.
But why is that?

42
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:46.140
Is that because of our own biological limitations in the fact that we exist in

43
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:50.850
this world of animals where animals are eating other animals and running,

44
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.580
there's always do you always have to prepare for evil?

45
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:56.670
You have to prepare for intruders.
You have to prepare for,
you know,

46
00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:01.210
predators and this is essentially like this mechanism is there to ensure that

47
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.150
things don't get sloppy.
Things continued to about,
look,

48
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.360
if the Jaguars keeping and the people and the people don't figure out how to

49
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.400
make a fucking house,
they get eaten and that's it.

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.400
Or you figure out the house and then you make weapons,

51
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.910
you find off the fucking Jaguar.
Okay,
great,
you made it.
You're in a city now.

52
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.740
See you had to have that Jaguar there in order to inspire you to make enough

53
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.650
safety so that your kids can grow old enough.

54
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.590
They can get information from all the people that did survive as well,

55
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.710
and they can accumulate all that information and create air conditioning and

56
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:34.670
automobiles and guns and keep those fucking jaguars from eating your kids.
Right?

57
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.080
This is,
this is what had to take place as a biological entity,

58
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:42.460
but once you surpass that and once you become this thing that doesn't need

59
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:47.080
emotion,
doesn't need it,
doesn't need conflict,
it doesn't need to be inspired.

60
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.310
It never gets lazy.

61
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.390
It doesn't have these things that we have built into us as a biological system.

62
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.920
Like if you looked at us as wet,
where operating software,

63
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.550
it's not good software,
right?

64
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.970
It's software design for cave people and we're,
you know,

65
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:08.770
we're just trying to force it in the cars and force it into cubicles.

66
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.690
But part of the problem with people in their unhappiness is that all of these

67
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:17.410
human reward systems that have been set up through evolution and natural

68
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:20.410
selection to,
to have these instincts to stay alive,

69
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.130
they're no longer relevant in today's society.
So they become,

70
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.990
they become road rage.
They become,
you know,
extracurricular violence.
They became,

71
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.730
they become depression.

72
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:32.860
They become all these different things that people suffer from.

73
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:34.900
So that's one perspective.
Yes.

74
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.220
That basically our software through this evolutionary process was necessary to

75
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:41.690
arrive where we are.
But it's outdated at this point.
Well,

76
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.770
it's necessary for us to succeed,
succeed in a purely,

77
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.430
almost a Darwinist way in a sense that survived through Ellucian,

78
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.440
especially since we're so weak.
I mean,
it's really,

79
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.570
we became this week because we got so good at protecting ourselves from all the

80
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.670
bad things.
Yeah.
Okay.

81
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:01.720
The other perspective is that we're actually incredibly strong and this is the

82
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:06.010
best that the universe can create actually were at the height.

83
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.810
This is where at the height of creation,
there's,

84
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.970
there's a beauty in this tension,
in this dance between good and evil,

85
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.560
between,
uh,
like happiness and depression,
life and death,

86
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.000
and that through that struggle,

87
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:23.230
that's not just a useful tool to get us from Jaguars to cities,

88
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.830
but that is the beautiful thing that,
that,
that,

89
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:30.940
that is like what the universe was built for her.
That that is the height.

90
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:33.010
Like our current,
the,

91
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.080
the evolution and the creation that results from it is the height of creation.
