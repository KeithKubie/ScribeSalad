This happened on BBC.com.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:06.039
Google is trying
to make our emoji more diverse.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.807
No, they aren't adding
a diarrhea emoji.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.942
Although, they should.
Although, what would it be?

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:11.778
Would it be just, like,
one splat with eyes?

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.146
Would it be
with the eyes'd be like, "Mah?"

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.549
Would it, like, stretch across
an entire line of text?

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.051
Would there be
an explosion point?

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.853
Would there be a splatter point?
What would it be?!

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.589
Anyway, they want to make new
emoji for professional women,

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.691
and it's about goddamn time
because...

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.860
(applause and cheering)

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.962
-Take it easy.
-The only ones

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.397
currently available
feature women

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.232
in stereotypical roles,
like wife

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.102
and salsa dancer stomping a bug.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.539
-(laughter) -So Google engineers
designed 13 emoji

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.240
of professional women and
presented them for approval

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:44.077
to the governing body of emoji,
the Unicode Consortium,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.646
which sounds a lot like the name
of a store set

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.014
in the world of Harry Potter.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.682
-(laughter)
-Here's some they're proposing.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.118
Uh, sweet, awesome.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.820
Health care professionals.
That's a no-brainer.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.388
What else we got?

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.256
Yes, absolutely.
Scientist. Duh.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.891
-Of course, absolutely.
-Mm-hmm.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.060
Women have made tons of amazing
contributions to science.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.795
This is absolutely deserved.
What else?

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.897
-Oh, a welder. All right.
-(laughter)

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.365
Sure. Why not?

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:09.602
-Listen, hey, come on.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.671
Yup.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.108
But, uh, while I do believe

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.577
that there are absolutely
women welders,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.113
I don't know when you would ever
use this emoji.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.547
-(laughter)
-I can't...

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.382
quite come up with a
circumstance

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.251
where a lady welder emoji
would be necessary.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:27.253
-We might be able to help you
with that. -(laughter)

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.155
HARDWICK:
I wonder if there were only

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:32.325
some comedians here
who might be able to send a text

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.627
that would require
a female welding emoji.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.262
Uh, Randy Sklar.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.631
Hey, guys. Just putting
the finishing touches

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.766
on that glass ceiling
those guys had me build.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.503
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Hey! Nice. Very good.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.971
-(applause and cheering)
-Yup. Yup. Yup.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.672
Jason Sklar.

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:49.041
Uh, Mom and Dad, I'm a lesbian,
a flaming lesbian.

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:52.411
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Jesus Christ.

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:54.280
(applause and cheering)

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.849
Jon Dore.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.352
Um, it's, uh,
Happy Father's Day.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.821
I, uh, ran out of money,

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:04.056
but I thought
you could jerk off to this.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:05.658
(laughter and groaning)

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:09.695
-Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, my God.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:11.731
No reason why we can't jerk off
to women in the workplace.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:12.965
Yeah.

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:15.131
It's my fault!
It's all my fault!
