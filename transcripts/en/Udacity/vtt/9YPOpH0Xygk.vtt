00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.808
Like I said in the question video, there
are many, many different values for a and

00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:12.078
b that you could enter here. But perhaps,
the simplest way is to let a= -17, and to

00:00:12.093 --> 00:00:16.702
let b=1.
This is an easy way to express any

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:29.146
integer. We can write 3 as 3/1 and 29 as
29/1 and -300 as -300/1. But we could also

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:33.774
come up with many other fractions that
reduce to these integers if we multiply

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:40.020
the numerator and the denominator, or a
and b, each by the same number. In the

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:46.677
case of -17, for example, if we multiply
the top and bottom by 2, then we get

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:56.174
-34/2, which is another acceptable answer
to this quiz. Or you could have put 51/-3

00:00:56.174 --> 00:01:03.615
or 17/-1. If you're feeling at all shaky
on fractions right now, please take some

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:08.158
time to do some of the practice problems
we've provided on fractions or watch some

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:11.055
of the supplemental material we've linked
to.
