[ Applause ]

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.208
&gt;&gt; Alan Alda: All around the
country today, distinguished men

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.978
and women are looking
at graduates like you

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:15.648
from the heights
of our achievements

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:20.619 line:92%
and spraying advice at you.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:28.961
It's an indignity you have to
suffer before they lift the lash

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:33.165 line:92%
and release you into the wild.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.101
In settings like this today,
you're going to hear all

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:39.105
over the country many
of the same themes:

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:45.311
be true to yourself, follow your
passion, you are the future,

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.080
don't make a mess of the
world the way we did.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.687
I know these words because I've
said many of them myself often

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.955 line:92%
and they're good ideas.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.757
The only thing is today
they're a little vague, I think,

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:02.962
and every time I'm tempted
to make a speech like that.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.198
I wish instead I could just
give you a few good tips

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:08.334 line:92%
on how just to get through life.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:14.106
Like the admiral last year who
gave one of these speeches,

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:19.645
his advice was so
concrete, so simple.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:23.382
He said, "If you want
to change to world,

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:24.850 line:92%
make your bed every day."

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.720 line:92%
Isn't that wonderful?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.787 line:92%
I love that.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:36.562
It's so-- I mean,
it's utter simplicity.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:39.532
I mean, if you could start off
a day with a little discipline

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.700
like that, there's no telling
what you can accomplish

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.036
when the hard stuff
comes your way.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:47.006
The problem is I can't really
give you that advice myself

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.741
because I don't make
my bed every day.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:55.381
I do, I unscramble the covers
and I pull them up to the pillow

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:59.118
so it looks sort of neat, but
I don't make it, you know,

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.487
all so tight that you
can bounce a quarter

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:04.823 line:92%
on it the way the admiral does.

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:09.228 line:92%
I'm looking at your faces.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.763
You're thinking why are
they having this guy

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.131
up here talk about
making his bed.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:18.470
There's actually a reason
for why I'm saying this.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.941
I think it's important
as you leave here today,

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:26.445
if you haven't already done
it, to start paying attention

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:29.748
to how your own particular
brain works.

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:35.521
You know, the admiral likes
a hard-discipline approach,

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.022 line:92%
the experience of being tough.

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:41.493
He likes that and I'm sure a lot
of you benefit from that, too.

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:44.063 line:92%
But I'm a little more flexible.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:49.368
I pull the covers up just
enough so the next time I look

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:52.438
at them it'll be a
little gift myself

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.474
and I'll get a little jolt
of some happiness hormones

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.943
when I look at it and
that's good for me.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:59.078 line:92%
That's the way I like it.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.146
The point is that
there's no good or bad way

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:03.515 line:92%
to start the day, I don't think.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:08.420
But I think you can learn to get
the most out of your particular,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.458
your own brain, if you pay
attention to how it works.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.261
I used to push my
brain, you know,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.764
sort of like the way a jockey
would whip a horse trying

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:21.600
to make it run faster
than it can run,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.071
but now I'm more tolerant
of the way my brain works.

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:28.073 line:92%
I'm easier on it.

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:31.777
I get it pointed in a
certain direction and it works

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.747
in the background in its own
time and when it's ready to come

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.782
up with the goods,
it lets me know.

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:40.786 line:92%
But the thing is, it takes time.

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:42.755
You know, I bring this
up because if I'm going

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:46.725
to pass anything on to you
today it has to be real to me.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:50.596
For instance, my grandson
Scott is graduating today

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:52.531 line:92%
and that's very real.

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:58.203 line:92%
[ Applause ]

00:03:58.203 --> 00:04:02.174
That's real to me
and so is the fact

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:04.843 line:92%
that he'll be entering my field.

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:07.713
He's going to be facing
a lot of uncertainty.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:11.450
But, you know, uncertainty
is not always a bad thing.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.453
In fact, I kind of
welcome uncertainty.

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:19.792
I think instead of resisting
it, you can surf uncertainty.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:23.362
You'll keep your
balance, stay agile,

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:26.965 line:92%
expect the unexpected bumps.

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:29.635
That's harder to do when
uncertainty comes at you

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:33.238
like a tsunami, but it's a
good principle to live by.

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:36.775
The thing is, it's not just
Scott who's going to be going

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:40.646
out facing uncertainty
in his chosen field,

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:45.217
every one of you here today
is going to face uncertainty.

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:47.753 line:92%
It's going to hit you.

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.221
You'll face it no
matter what you do

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:53.859
and sometimes it'll make you
rethink what you're doing.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:58.630
And here's an interesting
thing, uncertainty usually comes

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.168
from the outside, but sometimes
it can come from your own heart.

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.337
If you suddenly are
up against a situation

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:07.573
where you remember what
your own principles are,

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:12.478
what your values are, sometimes
the choice can be difficult.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.880 line:92%
I'll give you an example.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.516
My wife just wrote a book
about people who were brought

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:21.587
up in the Bronx and
I'm-- At the Bronx.

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:24.823 line:92%
All right.

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:25.791 line:92%
Good. Very good.

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:26.358 line:92%
Excellent.

00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:26.925 line:92%
Read the book.

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:30.062 line:92%
You'll love it.

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:35.868
So I met one of the people in
the book that she interviewed

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:38.771
and he told me such an
interesting powerful story

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.406
about this thing I was
just talking about,

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:43.208
about knowing your values
and coming up against them,

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:45.577
coming up against
something in your own heart.

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:49.481
He came from a working class
family and his father had lived

00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:54.953
through the depression and his
father told him constantly,

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:58.524
be a plumber, people will
always need plumbing.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:03.395
But this was a very smart kid
and he went to medical school

00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:07.900
and he was so smart that as a
young man he invented a device

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.639
that would save lives and a
medical company offered hundreds

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.410
of millions of dollars for
the patent to the device.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.146
The only thing was
they were going--

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:24.183
For some reason they were going
to hold it back from putting it

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:30.189
on the market for a whole year
before they started selling it.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.893
Now that meant that he
could either release it

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:38.630
to the public right away
and start saving lives

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.967
or he could take the hundreds
of millions and wait a year.

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:44.903
And his father, who had
lived through the depression

00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:49.174
and kept telling
him be a plumber,

00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:54.246
his father said don't do
it, don't take the money.

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:57.182
He said think of all the
people, the mothers and children

00:06:57.182 --> 00:07:00.619
who will die during that year
while this company is waiting

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.988
to put it on the market,
put it out there now.

00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:07.693
And then every night
when he went to bed,

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:10.362
the father would say to him,
when you wake up tomorrow

00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:13.131
and you look in the mirror to
shave, don't look at yourself,

00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:15.567
don't think about your own
image, think about those mothers

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:20.105
and children who are going to
die if you wait for a year.

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:22.407 line:92%
So what do think?

00:07:22.407 --> 00:07:26.144
Did he take the money or did
he put it out on the market?

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:27.846 line:92%
He had to make a decision.

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:30.015 line:92%
It was a very tough decision.

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:33.719
And sometimes you have to make
really tough ones and they come

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:37.623 line:92%
at you unexpectedly like that,

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:40.459
but you can certainly
surf uncertainty better,

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:43.295
you can find your balance better
if you know how to respond

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:44.429 line:92%
to your own principles.

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:49.034
So I'll tell you, I'll
tell you what he did.

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:53.472
He didn't take the
money and decades later

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:56.275
when he told me the story,
he was really happy about it

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.744
because he did what
he thought was right

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:04.116
and it makes him feel
good to know that.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:07.185
But here's the thing,
that was many years ago.

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:11.323
In those days we had time
to think things through.

00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:15.093
We had time to consider
these things.

00:08:15.093 --> 00:08:18.664
You don't have that
luxury so much anymore.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:22.234
All of the sudden now,
things are going really fast.

00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:27.773
Let me give you an example
of how fast things are going.

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.775 line:92%
I love this example.

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:35.247
A few years ago the Internet
was flooded with copies

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:41.219
of a graduation speech that
Kurt Vonnegut had given at MIT.

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:42.621 line:92%
It spread across the country.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.991
It spread all over the
Internet, all over the world,

00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:48.160
and it did that in
just a few hours.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.361 line:92%
That's how fast it was.

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:51.263 line:92%
It was quoted everywhere.

00:08:51.263 --> 00:08:54.666
And I'd like to read
some of it to you.

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:58.003
I love it because it gives
very simple advice, clear-cut,

00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:01.239
everyday, how to live
your life advice.

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:06.445
He said, "Here's a few words
for the graduating class.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:07.646 line:92%
Wear sunscreen.

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:12.084
If I could offer you only
one tip for the future,

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:14.553 line:92%
sunscreen would be it.

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:17.022
The long-term of benefits,
the long-term benefits

00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:20.926
of sunscreen have been proven
by scientist, whereas the rest

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:24.262
of my advice has no
basis more reliable

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:26.198 line:92%
than my own meandering thoughts.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:31.136 line:92%
I will dispense this advice now.

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:34.806
Enjoy the power and
beauty of your youth.

00:09:34.806 --> 00:09:35.907 line:92%
Oh, never mind.

00:09:35.907 --> 00:09:37.643
You will not understand
the power and beauty

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:39.911
of your youth until
they've faded.

00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:43.715
But trust me, in 20 years,
you'll look back at photos

00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:48.086
of yourself and recall in a way
you can't grasp now how much

00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:52.357
possibility lay before you and
how fabulous you really looked.

00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:58.330
You are not as fat
as you imagine.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.668
Sing. Don't be reckless
with other people's hearts.

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:06.171
Don't put up with people
who are reckless with yours.

00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:11.743
Floss. Remember compliments
you receive.

00:10:11.743 --> 00:10:14.046 line:92%
Forget the insults.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:17.683
If you succeed in doing
this, show me how.

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:22.254 line:92%
Stretch. Get plenty of calcium.

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.423 line:92%
Be kind to your knees.

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:26.091
You'll miss them
when they're gone.

00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:28.960 line:92%
Get to know your parents.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.431
You never know when
they'll be gone for good.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.733 line:92%
Be nice to your siblings.

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:38.236
They're your best link to your
past and the people most likely

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:40.338 line:92%
to stick with you in the future.

00:10:40.338 --> 00:10:45.043
Don't expect anyone
else to support you.

00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:47.579 line:92%
Maybe you have a trust fund,

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:51.550
maybe you'll have a wealthy
spouse, but you never know

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:57.656 line:92%
when either one might run out.

00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:00.726 line:92%
Be careful whose advice you buy.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:03.729 line:92%
Advice is a form of nostalgia.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:06.098
Dispensing it is a way
of fishing the past

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.166
from the disposal,
wiping it off,

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.736
painting over the ugly
parts, and recycling it

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.837 line:92%
for more than it's worth.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:15.941 line:92%
But trust me on the sunscreen."

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:19.478
Now the thing about
this charming piece

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:24.750
by Kurt Vonnegut is that it
wasn't written by Kurt Vonnegut.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.853
It was written by a
newspaper columnist

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:31.189 line:92%
in Chicago called Mary Schmich.

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.558
Some unknown person
had posted it

00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:37.162
on the Internet saying it
was written by Kurt Vonnegut

00:11:37.162 --> 00:11:40.866
and it spread all
around the world in hours

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:47.372 line:92%
with his name attached to it.

00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:51.143
Schmich said it went to
Italy and France, to Israel

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.946
and Brazil, to places I
didn't know had electricity.

00:11:54.946 --> 00:11:57.315
And she said even
Mr. Vonnegut's wife,

00:11:57.315 --> 00:12:00.285
the photographer Jill Krementz,
received and emailed it

00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:03.288
to several friends and then
asked her husband why didn't you

00:12:03.288 --> 00:12:04.556 line:92%
tell me you spoke at MIT.

00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:07.759 line:92%
And he said, "Because I didn't."

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:12.731
Somebody said it was the
most widely distributed piece

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.468
of email in the history
of the Internet.

00:12:16.468 --> 00:12:19.304
But after only a few hours
of bouncing around the world,

00:12:19.304 --> 00:12:23.141
it was identified as a
hoax and, in a flash,

00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:27.145
the Internet was
flooded with retractions.

00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:31.917
At the end of one
extraordinary day, vast numbers

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:36.054
of people had accepted and
then rejected a worldwide hoax.

00:12:36.054 --> 00:12:41.293
And that's what makes this
Internet event a great image

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:44.362 line:92%
for the age we live in now.

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:47.666
There were probably just as
many lies going around now

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:50.869
as there ever were, but
these days they're traveling

00:12:50.869 --> 00:12:54.806
at the speed of light and
with the help of an engine

00:12:54.806 --> 00:12:56.141 line:92%
for repetition that works

00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:59.177
on a scale unheard
of in human history.

00:12:59.177 --> 00:13:03.949 line:92%
The lies stick.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.317 line:92%
People are still sending

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:08.420
around that talk saying it
was written by Kurt Vonnegut.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.621 line:92%
All right.

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:11.623
So big deal, you
may be thinking.

00:13:11.623 --> 00:13:15.293
You may be thinking it's just a
few jokes about youth and beauty

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:19.831
and trivial things,
but think about it.

00:13:19.831 --> 00:13:22.200
It could be selling
you anything.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.303
It could be a cult religion that
could separate you from friends

00:13:25.303 --> 00:13:29.474
and family or a quack medicine
that could leave you paralyzed

00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:33.311
or bogus political information
that could decide an election.

00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:39.384
Being able to know what's true
and what's a lie is a lot harder

00:13:39.384 --> 00:13:44.256
to do now, harder
than ever before.

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:46.992
And so now, more than
ever, you need the wisdom

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:50.896
of a trusted partner or
a friend or a mentor,

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:54.099
somebody who can remind
you of what counts.

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:58.436
Now, more than ever, I think,
you need to know who you are

00:13:58.436 --> 00:13:59.938 line:92%
and what you believe in.

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:03.608
And who you are is a
tough one because most

00:14:03.608 --> 00:14:08.413
of us have many people inside
us, but in your finer moments,

00:14:08.413 --> 00:14:14.019
you aspire to things
that make sense.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:16.655
Even while you're enjoying
a momentary distraction,

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.523
you know that down the
road something's going

00:14:18.523 --> 00:14:22.394
to come along that's going
to require skill, ability

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:25.130
and you're going to
know you can't wing it.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.300
So you're going to
be prepared for it.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.969
You're going to know that one
of the deepest pleasures comes

00:14:30.969 --> 00:14:34.639
from knowing how to do
something that's hard well

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:38.143 line:92%
and you'll be prepared.

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:42.147
You'll take the time that
it takes to learn it.

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:45.583
We have a challenge
about time now.

00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:48.353
So let yourself be all
the you's that you are,

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:51.790
but don't let them
crowd out the smart one.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:59.297
And as for what you believe
in, values are really not

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:03.168
so much what you
say as what you do.

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:05.403
The more you bring those
two things into line,

00:15:05.403 --> 00:15:07.305
the easier it'll be to
get where you're going.

00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:10.442
You know, you may say you want
to go to Chicago, but it's going

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:11.509 line:92%
to be hard to get there

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:13.878
if you keep buying
tickets to Las Vegas.

00:15:13.878 --> 00:15:20.885
I think we don't realize
how important time is.

00:15:20.885 --> 00:15:23.021
When we couldn't communicate
at the speed of light,

00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:26.992
we didn't think about it that
much, but things do take time,

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:30.929
like the time it takes for
your brain to work on a problem

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:34.632
and chemical reactions
take time.

00:15:34.632 --> 00:15:37.569 line:92%
Mourning a loss takes time.

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:42.374
In fact, all the transitions
of our life take time.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:45.543
Getting your brain or your
body in shape takes more

00:15:45.543 --> 00:15:49.247
than a weekend, no matter what
they tell you in the brochure.

00:15:49.247 --> 00:15:53.218
It takes time for a
species to adapt to changes

00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:56.021
in the environment that we
cause, which makes us one

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:58.923
of the most dangerous
species that's ever lived.

00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:04.195
We can make changes in
the environment so rapid

00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:08.533
that nature doesn't have time to
replenish species that can live

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:11.569 line:92%
in that changed environment.

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:13.838 line:92%
And I don't want to kid you

00:16:13.838 --> 00:16:15.540
into thinking I've got
this all worked out,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.941 line:92%
that I know how to do it.

00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:20.278
I'm still working on it myself,
but this is what I aspire to.

00:16:20.278 --> 00:16:24.282
So this is real to me and
I'm passing it on to you.

00:16:24.282 --> 00:16:29.020
So as you make the transition
from this page in your life

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:36.327
to the next chapter, I wish all
of you what I wish for Scott.

00:16:36.327 --> 00:16:45.003
I wish you health, happiness,
resilience, love, laughter,

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:53.945
patience, cash, strength,
plenty of time,

00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:57.849
and a friendly relationship
with your own brain.

00:16:57.849 --> 00:17:02.387
And if all else fails, floss
and wear your sunscreen.

00:17:02.387 --> 00:17:03.755 line:92%
Thank you and good luck.
