Welcome to
"Your Fantastic Mind".

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:18.551 line:85%
I'm Jaye Watson.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.052 line:83%
This is a show
where we explore

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:24.224 line:83%
the mysteries and the science
of the amazing human brain.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.225 align:start size:78% position:22%
The epidemic of
obesity in America

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.094
is worse than ever.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.529 align:start position:0%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reports

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.000 align:start size:75% position:25%
almost 40% of
adults are obese.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.770 align:start size:97% position:3%
The highest rates ever
recorded in the United States.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.406 align:start size:84% position:16%
No surprise,
diet products and plans

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.975 align:start size:75% position:25%
are a $70 billion
industry,

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:46.846
with 45 million Americans
going on diets every year.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:51.417
Some experts say fewer than
5% keep that weight off.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
But what if you could
quell that hunger signal?

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.788
Not be hungry anymore.

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:58.958
Long enough to lose
the weight for good.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.627
Here is what happened
when a group of people

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:04.497 align:start size:75% position:25%
had their hunger
nerve frozen.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.100 align:start position:0%
Hi, Jaden.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.936 align:start size:91% position:9% line:88%

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.705 line:91%
<i> in a job that
 never stops.</i>

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:14.940 align:start position:0% line:92%
Oh, you're sweet, baby.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.275 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> (Jaye)
 A single mother.</i>

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.210
<i> Donovan has been
 dieting on and off</i>

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.212
<i> since the third grade.</i>

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.415 align:start position:0% line:83%
I definitely
would turn to food.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.349 align:start position:0% line:83%
Like, I like
celebrating with food,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.985 align:start position:0% line:83%
and when I'm bored,
I eat food.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.419 align:start position:0% line:83%
And at the
nurse's station,

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:29.188 align:start position:0% line:83%
people bring us food
to show us love,

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.790 align:start position:0% line:85%
and we eat their food.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 If there's a diet,
 odds are, she's done it.</i>

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.429 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Melissa)
 Usually my problem was,
 I could lose it by doing,</i>

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.330
<i> like, a cleanse,
 or a Whole30,</i>

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.066 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> or a, you know,
 sugar detox.</i>

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.767 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> And then I would
 gain it right back.</i>

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:47.106 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> I can gain 10, lose 20,
 gain 25, easily.</i>

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.975
<i> I was kind of giving
 into the circumstance</i>

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.177
<i> that I was just gonna
 be that plus-size girl.</i>

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.446 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I didn't wanna be, but
I was like, all of the sudden,

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:54.847 align:start size:78% position:22%
I'm just, you know,
Trey's mommy,

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.049
who's just overweight.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.683 align:start size:78% position:22%
And I didn't wanna
be that person.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.986 align:start size:94% position:6%
But I was like, well,
I guess it's just inevitable.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.790 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> (Jaye)
 What Donovan didn't
 know was that</i>

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.026 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> on the other side of the
 Emory Johns Creek Hospital,</i>

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.962 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> was a doctor who would
 change her life.</i>

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.965 line:83%
My day job, I was using
interventional radiology

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:16.135 line:83%
to freeze nerves for
the treatment of pain.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.838 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (Jaye)
 Interventional radiologist,
 Dr. David Prologo,</i>

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.373
<i> was helping patients end
 debilitating nerve pain</i>

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:23.276
<i> with cryoablation.</i>

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.378 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> A several decades
 old process</i>

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.981
<i> in which hollow needles cooled
 by thermally conductive fluids</i>

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.250 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> are placed
 close to a nerve.</i>

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.052 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (Dr. Prologo)
 It's freezing of the nerve.</i>

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:36.422 align:start size:91% position:9% line:0%
We know from treating pain
that if we get a probe

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.257 line:0%
close to the nerve and
we drop the temperature,

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:39.925 line:0%
the nerve stops sending

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.694 line:0%
whatever signals
it was sending.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.296 line:0%
In most cases, pain.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.798 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> (Jaye)
 So, Prologo, who is
 also board-certified</i>

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.768 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> in obesity medicine,
 had an idea.</i>

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.537
One of the things that causes
people to quit their diets

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:52.805
is hunger.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.473
And we know that
that hunger signal

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:56.342
is transmitted
through a nerve.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.310 align:start size:91% position:9%
And so, the interventional
radiology skill set

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.612
allows me to get to
that nerve safely,

00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:03.082 align:start size:81% position:19%
through the skin,
with image guidance.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.118 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> (Jaye)
 Dr. Prologo is talking
 about the vagus nerve,</i>

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.621
<i> which runs from the
 brain to the belly.</i>

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.524 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> And among its many duties,
 is alerting the brain</i>

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.660
<i> to when the stomach
 is full and empty.</i>

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Dr. Prologo)
 The vagus nerve projects
 these hunger signals</i>

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.063
<i> to the brain stem.</i>

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.465 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> The brain stem then
 processes them</i>

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:22.234 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> and sends them to the higher
 centers in your brain</i>

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:24.203
<i> that process pleasure.</i>

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:26.839 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> For survival purposes,
 when our stomach is empty,</i>

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.942 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> our vagus nerve sends a signal
 to our brain to seek food,</i>

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.677
<i> so that we don't die.</i>

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:35.114 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 Prologo says those hunger
 signals can be relentless</i>

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:37.483 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> on calorie
 restricting diets.</i>

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:40.520 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> Especially for
 overweight people.</i>

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.724
A restricted calorie diet
for a person who is lean

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:48.694
is easier to tolerate than
a restricted calorie diet

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:50.630 align:start size:75% position:25%
for a person
who's overweight.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.066
<i> Making the change is hard.</i>

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.401
<i> Maintenance is not.</i>

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.870 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> If we can get the people
 past the point</i>

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.439
<i> where it's hard to
 restrict calories,</i>

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.843
<i> then the hunger signal is
 much easier to deal with.</i>

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.811
<i> There's paper after
 paper after paper,</i>

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.212
<i> very famous papers</i>

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:10.115 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> written in the
 "Journal of American
 Medical Association",</i>

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:13.786
showing how, no matter
what diet a person is on,

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.689 align:start size:88% position:13%
their success or failure
depends on attrition.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.059
Meaning that we can compare
the Atkins Diet, to Ornish,

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.495 align:start size:88% position:13%
to the South Beach Diet,
to a Keto Diet.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.129
And the people who
are gonna succeed

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.864
aren't in one of
those buckets.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.166
The people who
are gonna succeed

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.302
are the people who
stay on the diet.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.136 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 - In Dr. Prologo's case,</i>

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.506 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> his motivation to help
 people lose weight</i>

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.376 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> comes from a deeply
 personal place.</i>

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.509
- I'll be honest.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.844
I'll tell the story that
I don't think I've told

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:41.180 align:start size:84% position:16%
to anyone else,
and it's a true story.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.916
I watched my mom,

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.719
who was overweight for
the majority of my life.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.488 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm sure she wouldn't,
uh, be embarrassed

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.322
that I'm sharing that.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:54.059
<i> And I knew her to be
 an extremely strong</i>

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.765
<i> and persistent person with
 a will of steel, right?</i>

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.867
<i> But she could not
 stay on a diet.</i>

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:04.070
<i> I got to see it
 from the inside.</i>

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.205
<i> From a person that
 I knew was strong.</i>

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:09.074
And so, this message
that people cannot

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:11.277
make the transformation
from overweight to lean

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:14.246 align:start size:91% position:9%
because they're weak
could not possibly be right

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:16.782 align:start size:75% position:25%
if we're talking
about my mom.

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:20.553 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> I see people like
 my mom every day now.</i>

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.256
<i>And when they tell the story of
how difficult it is for them,</i>

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:28.061
how impossible it is for
them to stay on a diet,

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.763 align:start size:81% position:19%
I want them to know,
I believe you.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.965
I believe you.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:34.466 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 Dr. Prologo took evidence</i>

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:36.736 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> from previous studies
 of cryoablation</i>

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.838 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> and presented them to the FDA
 for a new application.</i>

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:42.008
<i> A new use for
 the procedure.</i>

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.543
<i> To freeze part of
 the vagus nerve.</i>

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:47.379
<i> Prologo calls it the
 C.A.T.C.H. Procedure,</i>

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.282 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> Cryoablation To
 Curb Hunger.</i>

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:53.052
<i> The FDA approved
 a pilot study.</i>

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:57.323
<i> The first participant to
 sign up, Melissa Donovan.</i>

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.624 align:start size:91% position:9%
I thought I was there for,
like, three minutes.

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:00.159 align:start size:75% position:25%
I was there for,
like, 30.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.695 align:start size:78% position:22%
We bring them
into the CT suite,

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:05.097 align:start position:0%
and we give them some sedation,
lay them on their belly.

00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:06.699
We take a small probe,

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.034
which is about the
size of a pen tip,

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.737
<i> and we advance that
 through their back</i>

00:06:11.837 --> 00:06:14.873 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> to this region where the
 esophagus meets the stomach.</i>

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:16.675
<i> That's where the
 vagus nerve lives.</i>

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.844
<i> We freeze for
 two minutes.</i>

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.013 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> And, um, we let it thaw
 for a little bit,</i>

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:22.214
<i> and then we
 take that out.</i>

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.682
We put a band-aid
over the site,

00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:25.551 line:91%
<i> and we recover them
 from the sedation</i>

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.019 line:91%
<i> and send them
 on their way.</i>

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.222 align:start size:91% position:9% line:88%
<i> (Jaye)
 Dr. Prologo says the small
 section of the vagus nerve</i>

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:33.259 align:start size:84% position:16% line:91%
<i> that is frozen
 eventually regenerates.</i>

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:36.162 align:start size:97% position:3%
It regenerates at about a rate
of one millimeter per day,

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:37.663
which is really slow.

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:39.565 align:start size:78% position:22%
So the distance of
the vagus nerve

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.035 align:start size:81% position:19%
would take about
a year to regenerate.

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:46.005 align:start size:88% position:13%
Woke up, went home,
and didn't feel anything.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:47.240
I never had pain.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.074 align:start size:78% position:22%
Never had any
kind of discomfort.

00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:50.742
<i> I called Dr. Prologo the
 next day and I was like,</i>

00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:52.378 align:start size:72% position:28%

<i> Creating the drawings

00:13:48.593 --> 00:13:52.498
<i> Body mass index, or BMI,
 is an estimate of body fat</i>

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.599 align:start size:78% position:22%

 height and weight.</i>

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:57.803

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:11.516
<i> well, their body mass index

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:14.419 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> And their good
 sleep habits continued.</i>

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:16.222 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> A study from
 Penn State last year</i>

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:19.091
<i> showed that giving kids
 screen time before bed</i>

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
<i>led to about an hour less sleep
and a higher BMI.</i>

00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:25.464 align:start size:84% position:16%
The study shows
it's time to slow down

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.333
and prioritize sleep.

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.202
The habits we put in place

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.274 align:start size:72% position:28%
Most of us lead
busy lives.

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:38.109 align:start size:94% position:6%
So busy, we can't recall
everything we do at our jobs

00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:39.811
in a single day.

00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:41.547
But one thing
we don't forget

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:44.016
is when someone
is rude to us.

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:47.052 align:start size:91% position:9%
Or snarky,
which is sharply critical,

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:49.688
cutting, snide.

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:52.290
Research is showing that
rudeness in the workplace

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.460

00:16:01.459 --> 00:16:05.364 align:start position:0%
I was absolutely appalled
that somebody would be so rude,

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.432 align:start position:0%

00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:12.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)

00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:19.311 align:start size:63% position:38%
So Karin came in

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:21.980 align:start size:75% position:25%

<i> (Jaye)
 How workplace rudeness
 impacts us.</i>

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:46.672
<i> Workplace incivility or
 rudeness is defined as...</i>

00:16:54.612 --> 00:16:58.083
<i> It is not hostility,
 abuse or violence.</i>

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.284
<i> It's subtle.</i>

00:16:59.384 --> 00:17:00.685 align:start size:66% position:34%
I'm not sure what you
were trying to do

00:17:00.785 --> 00:17:03.288 align:start size:59% position:41%
in that report,
but it didn't work.

00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:05.657 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> (Jaye)
 And most of us
 have experienced it</i>

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:08.193
<i> at one time or another.</i>

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.995 align:start size:94% position:6%
So you thought it was a
good idea to do it that way.

00:17:11.095 --> 00:17:11.997 align:start size:78% position:22% line:85%
So we found that rudeness

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:14.532 align:start size:66% position:34% line:83%
causes people to be
less productive.

00:17:14.632 --> 00:17:17.402 align:start size:69% position:31% line:83%
They're less effective
at problem solving.

00:17:17.502 --> 00:17:18.537 align:start size:75% position:25% line:83%
People who are exposed
to rudeness

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:20.104 align:start size:69% position:31% line:85%
are less creative.

 Kuerston and his

 more impulsively</i>

<i> Zarin admits she was.</i>

00:20:29.327 --> 00:20:30.128 align:start size:97% position:3% line:83%
And you're ruminating
about it

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:31.796 align:start position:0% line:83%
and thinking about it,
and wondering,

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.031 align:start position:0% line:83%
could I have done it
differently?

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.399 align:start position:0% line:83%
And why was that person
so rude to me?

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:36.568 align:start position:0% line:83%
Did I set them off?
Was it me?

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:37.636 align:start size:75% position:25% line:85%
In the back of our mind,

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.872 align:start size:69% position:31% line:83%
in the RAM of our

00:20:40.972 --> 00:20:42.808 align:start size:66% position:34%

00:20:51.983 --> 00:20:52.884 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> (Jaye)
 In Zarin's case,</i>

00:20:52.984 --> 00:20:55.086 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> she was doing assessments
 for the study.</i>

00:20:55.186 --> 00:20:59.758

<i> (Kuerston)
 Dispensing a prescription
 is not a complex activity.</i>

00:21:03.394 --> 00:21:05.764 align:start size:78% position:22%
But if incivility impacts
our ability to attend

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start size:78% position:22%
to the task of dispensing
prescription,

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.136 align:start size:69% position:31%
then maybe we dispense
25 milligrams

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:14.506 align:start size:59% position:41%
<i> instead of
 .25 milligrams.</i>

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.742 align:start size:59% position:41%
<i> If incivility
 impacts attention,</i>

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:20.145 size:84% position:58%
<i> then there's potential for
 an air traffic controller</i>

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:23.148 size:88% position:56%
<i> to not be able to attend to

00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:28.954 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> (Jaye)
 Rudeness can have
 devastating impacts,</i>

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:31.723
<i> as evidenced by a study in
 the journal, "Pediatrics",</i>

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.692 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> where medical teams
 participated</i>

<i> in a training simulation

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:40.631 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you have an observer

00:21:40.731 --> 00:21:42.834 align:start size:72% position:28%
that are this
low intensity behavior,

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.437 align:start size:56% position:44%

 disproportionate

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:48.573 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> the NICU teams failed
 to work together as a team.</i>

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:51.475 align:start size:69% position:31%
They found that the
NICU teams broke down,

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:53.411 align:start size:63% position:38%
uh, in terms of
their teamwork.

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:55.046 align:start size:63% position:38%
They stopped sharing
information.

00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:58.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> And, ultimately, in
 these diagnostic exercises,</i>

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.821 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> they often failed to
 identify a very serious
 medical condition</i>

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:04.689 align:start size:69% position:31%
that would lead to
the death of an infant

00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:07.459 align:start size:78% position:22%
in a real world scenario.

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:09.327 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> (Jaye)
 Studies on rudeness
 in the workplace</i>

00:22:09.427 --> 00:22:11.996 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> are particularly common
 in business schools</i>

00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> because rudeness
 is a big cause
 of employee turnover</i>

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.202 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> and reduced effort
 at work.</i>

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:18.770
<i> And it's costly.</i>

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.973
<i> One study found that a
 single rude incident</i>

00:22:22.073 --> 00:22:26.844 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> cost a system $25,832

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:29.680 align:start size:81% position:19%

<i> avoidance of
 a rude coworker,</i>

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.151
<i> HR interactions,</i>

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:36.454
<i> and, eventually,
 employee turnover.</i>

00:22:36.554 --> 00:22:37.722 align:start size:53% position:47%
<i> (Kuerston)
 So, for example,</i>

00:22:37.822 --> 00:22:39.591 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> if you're walking
 into your office</i>

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.192 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> and the person
 at the front desk</i>

00:22:41.292 --> 00:22:42.860 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> is really rude to you,</i>

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.796 align:start size:66% position:34%
and then you go
interact with clients

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.230 align:start size:66% position:34%
on a different floor,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start size:88% position:13%
we know that the impact

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.069 align:start size:56% position:44%

<i> (Jaye)
 People who witness rudeness

00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:59.544
<i> Rude emails do the same.</i>

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.613 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> And, yes,
 all the incivility</i>

00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:03.748 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> we see on social media
 these days</i>

00:23:03.848 --> 00:23:05.851 align:start size:88% position:13%

 as well.</i>

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:12.690 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> Dr. Kuerston and Karin Zarin

00:23:14.992 --> 00:23:17.662 align:start position:0%
I was just-
I was shocked.

00:23:17.762 --> 00:23:21.333 align:start position:0%
Plus, I was feeling like
you were maybe gonna be
disappointed in,

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
I was wasting
your time too.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.237 align:start position:0%
And I-I was feeling bad
about that.

00:23:26.337 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start size:78% position:22%
Sure. Sure.
Were you confused at all?

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.609 align:start position:0%
No, I just thought you

<i> rudeness is a reality

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:43.254 align:start size:66% position:34%
So, one of our bigger
concerns is that, uh,

00:23:43.354 --> 00:23:44.689 align:start size:72% position:28%
rudeness is increasing.

00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:46.358 align:start size:75% position:25%
Okay.

<i> It may be an unavoidable part

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:01.806 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'll call you
in a couple of hours

00:24:01.906 --> 00:24:03.241
when we're both done.

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:05.911 align:start size:84% position:16%
See if you can salvage
this session, okay?

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:10.982 align:start size:88% position:13%
So the next time
you're tempted to respond

00:24:11.082 --> 00:24:14.018
to that rude email in kind,

00:24:14.118 --> 00:24:15.854
maybe think again.

00:24:17.188 --> 00:24:18.990
That's gonna do it
