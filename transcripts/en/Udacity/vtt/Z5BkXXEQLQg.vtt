00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.420
Just to refresh your memory about micro

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.330
kernel based operating system structure, the idea is

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.730
micro kernel the micro kernel is providing a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.900
small number of simple abstractions. Such as address

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
based and inter process communication and all

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.020
the system services that you normally expect from

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.440
an operating system. Such as the file system

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.870
Memory manager, CPU scheduling, and so on are

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.130
implemented as processes above microkernal. In

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.140
other words, these operating system services

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.690
run at the same privilege level as user-level applications. All of them

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.680
in their own individual address spaces. And only the microkernel runs at

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.020
a different level of privilege provided by the processor architecture. Since all

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.670
the operating system services are implemented as server's

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.960
processes on top of the microkernel, they may

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.970
have to cooperate with one another in order

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.440
to satisfy a particular user's request. And in

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.150
that case, they may have to talk to one another, and in order to do that,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.985
they need IPC that is provided by the

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:16.270
microkernel in order to accomplish what is needed by

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.480
a particular system call emanating from an application.
