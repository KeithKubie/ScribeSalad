00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:01.423
- Hello grammarians!

00:00:01.423 --> 00:00:03.942
Let's talk about singular
and plural nouns.

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:06.527
Nouns, as we discussed previously,

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:08.969
are a type of word.

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.579
They are a part of speech.

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.157
A noun is any word that is a person,

00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:17.246
a place,

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:19.893
a thing,

00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:22.424
or an idea.

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:25.453
In English, we can figure
out just by looking at a noun

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:27.379
whether or not there is one of something,

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:28.575
whether it's a singular,

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:31.523
or whether or not there is
more than one of something.

00:00:31.523 --> 00:00:33.311
There's an easy way to
tell the difference between

00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:34.634
singular and plural.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.419
If you write the words down,

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:41.409
singular contains the word single.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.511
Single, means there's only one of it.

00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:45.243
Plural is maybe a little bit less obvious,

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:46.854
but it comes to us from Latin.

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:49.198
It comes to us from this word plus,

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:52.580
which means more,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.633
which you might recognize

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:56.759
plus, as we call it in
English, from mathematics,

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.083
from arithmetic.

00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.633
We usually says it looks
like this little plus symbol.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:02.982
So, whenever you think,
whenever you see plural,

00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:05.532
just think more; just think plus.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.463
There is more than one.

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.298
Singular is one thing.

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:13.395
Plural, more than one
thing; there is more.

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:14.208
Let's go through it.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.960
Let's do some examples.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.852
I'll show you how you make
the plural in English,

00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:20.952
how you indicate using your language

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:22.822
that there is more than one thing.

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:26.247
So let's just throw out a couple of words.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.364
Dog,

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:32.769
cat,

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:36.318
dinosaur,

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:38.837
and whale.

00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:40.927
All you need to do to make
it plural is very simply

00:01:40.927 --> 00:01:44.673
just take an s and you add
it onto the end like so.

00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:46.298
Dogs, cats,

00:01:46.298 --> 00:01:49.402
dinosaurs, whales.

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.364
If you want to make something plural,

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:53.454
think about plus, more.

00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:56.530
All you have to do is add an s

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.048
like that: add an s.

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:02.573
This is what we call the regular plural.

00:02:02.573 --> 00:02:04.295
This is the regular plural.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:06.988
What that means is it obeys this one rule.

00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:08.890
All you have to do to say
that there's more than one dog

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.980
is throw on an s,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.278
and we're lucky because most English nouns

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:14.760
behave that way.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.280
Most nouns are regular.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.164
However, here's the bad news.

00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:22.580
There are some irregular plurals.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.223
They are not regular,

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:29.856
thus irregular, not.

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.968
Now we have words like leaf,

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:36.299
child, and fungus,

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.584
which is like a mushroom,

00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:42.441
mouse,

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:45.389
and sheep.

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.036
How would you, you know you
can't just add an s to these?

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.020
That's unfortunately not how
these nouns work in English.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.713
You can't say leafs, childs, and funguses,

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.569
and mouses, and sheeps.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.481
This is how you do it.

00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:01.525
Each one of these words
corresponds to a class of words

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.591
that has its own unique
pluralization standards.

00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:07.748
So, leaf becomes leaves.

00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:11.320
Child becomes children.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.365
Fungus becomes fungi.

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:16.664
Mouse becomes mice.

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:20.205
And sheep stays sheep,

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:21.656
believe it or not.

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:23.061
These are the irregular plurals,

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:26.346
and we'll be covering each of
these in turn in later videos,

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:29.805
but for now I just want you to
focus on the regular plural,

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:31.593
which again we can sum up in this way.

00:03:31.593 --> 00:03:33.729
All you have to do is add an s.

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.517
Here's a good example, right?

00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:38.466
We have one elephant here.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:40.939
Down here we have two elephants.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.638
The only difference between
this word and this word

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:46.952
is that this one has
an s on the end of it.

00:03:46.952 --> 00:03:49.216
So if we wanted to say that
this elephant here was not,

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:52.291
in fact, one elephant,
and was two elephants,

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:55.991
all we have to do is add an s,

00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:58.351
changing it from singular to plural.

00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:00.778
Remember, plural comes from plus.

00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:02.796
Add an s.

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:05.944
So one elephant becomes

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:08.285
two elephants.

00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:11.749
(humming)

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.043
World's fastest elephant drawing, go!

00:04:14.043 --> 00:04:17.967
(humming)

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:19.341
It's kind of an elephant monkey,

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:23.223
but you get the vague idea.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.418
If you're ever in need
of more than one thing,

00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:31.633
for the regular plural, just add an s.

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.212
You can learn anything.

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:34.622
David, out!
