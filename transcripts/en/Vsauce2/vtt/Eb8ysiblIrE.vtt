Dust your floors the cutest way possible with
a fuzzy robot cleaning ball.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.860
And protect your banana from bruising thanks
to the banana bunker.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.099

miles before needing a recharge.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.210
Use the app to set your speed and adjust the
rate of acceleration so once you hop on the

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.899
board there won’t be any surprises.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.149

Navy, or Tuxedo, and is accompanied by a waterproof

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.260

Hold the drumsticks and start drumming and
Mr. Knocky will mimic your movements.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.340
Don’t knock fishing until you’ve tried
it with the Fish Catching RC Boat.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.759

and parts to create incredible tables.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.210
Like Star Wars pinball becoming The Droid
coffee table or the 1987 game Arena transforming

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.250
into The Beast.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.979
One of the beast ways to impress your friends
is turning objects invisible.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.630
Glide into the future with these sidewinding
circular skates - that give you the ability

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.530
to make sharp turns and perform tricks all
while sidewinding like a snake.

If butterflies are more your spirit animal
these butterfly keychains will speak your

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.330
language.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.640
But if butterfly is the only language you
know the 15 language talking translator can

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.000
help you communicate.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.490
And even includes a calculator for converting
Euros.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.250
You're oh so going to love Movies R Fun, a
picture book that draws scenes from R rated

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.220
movies in a cartoony pixar style, including
classic moments from Pulp Fiction, The Godfather,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.970
and my personal favorite - The Big Lewbowski.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.410

opinion, man.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.600
BAR-O-SAURUS the fruit bar with a dinosaur
quiz.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.790
Borrowing the amazing brick aesthetic of Lego
is the Lego Computer.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.879
The specs are listed on the website, it’s
customizable and designed for future expansion.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.319
And you can purchase one of three designs
industrial, brick, or tiled.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.959

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.470
Design and program your own Hexapod Six.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.879
You can 3D print a number of open source parts
for the robot, and even connect it to your

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.879
personal smartphone.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:50.000
I’m afraid our time is coming to a close
so fill a personalized mason jar from personalcreations.com

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.820
with some Kimchi flavored soda.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.540
And if you don’t like the taste don't worry
I won’t be offended.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540
In fact.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.610
Zero fox given.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.830
And as always - thanks for watching!
