00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090
in an earlier video I've written down a

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100
in an earlier video I've written down a
 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.889
in an earlier video I've written down a
form for the cost function for logistic

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
form for the cost function for logistic
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.190
form for the cost function for logistic
regression in this optional video I want

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
regression in this optional video I want
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.230
regression in this optional video I want
to give you a quick justification for

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
to give you a quick justification for
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.450
to give you a quick justification for
why we'd like to use that cost function

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
why we'd like to use that cost function
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.270
why we'd like to use that cost function
for logistic regression so quickly recap

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
for logistic regression so quickly recap
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.700
for logistic regression so quickly recap
in logistic regression we have that the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
in logistic regression we have that the
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.000
in logistic regression we have that the
prediction y hat is sigmoid of W

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
prediction y hat is sigmoid of W
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.220
prediction y hat is sigmoid of W
transpose X plus B where a sigmoid is

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230
transpose X plus B where a sigmoid is
 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.460
transpose X plus B where a sigmoid is
this familiar function and we expect

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
this familiar function and we expect
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.549
this familiar function and we expect
that we want to interpret Y hat as the

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559
that we want to interpret Y hat as the
 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.920
that we want to interpret Y hat as the
probability that y is equal to 1 given X

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
probability that y is equal to 1 given X
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200
probability that y is equal to 1 given X
so we want their algorithms output Y hat

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
so we want their algorithms output Y hat
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.350
so we want their algorithms output Y hat
as the chance that Y is equal to 1 for a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
as the chance that Y is equal to 1 for a
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440
as the chance that Y is equal to 1 for a
given set of input features X so another

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
given set of input features X so another
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.100
given set of input features X so another
way to say this is that if Y is equal to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
way to say this is that if Y is equal to
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.650
way to say this is that if Y is equal to
1 then the chance of Y given X is equal

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
1 then the chance of Y given X is equal
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.459
1 then the chance of Y given X is equal
to Y hat and conversely if Y is equal to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
to Y hat and conversely if Y is equal to
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.709
to Y hat and conversely if Y is equal to
0 then the chance that Y was 0 was 1

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
0 then the chance that Y was 0 was 1
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.740
0 then the chance that Y was 0 was 1
minus y hat right so Y high was the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
minus y hat right so Y high was the
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.130
minus y hat right so Y high was the
chance that Y is equal to 1 then 1 minus

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
chance that Y is equal to 1 then 1 minus
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.039
chance that Y is equal to 1 then 1 minus
y hat is the chance then Y is equal to 0

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
y hat is the chance then Y is equal to 0
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.499
y hat is the chance then Y is equal to 0
so let me take these last two equations

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
so let me take these last two equations
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.260
so let me take these last two equations
and just copy them to the next slide so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
and just copy them to the next slide so
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.929
and just copy them to the next slide so
what I'm going to do is take these two

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
what I'm going to do is take these two
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.870
what I'm going to do is take these two
equations which basically define P of Y

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
equations which basically define P of Y
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390
equations which basically define P of Y
given X you know for the two faces of y

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
given X you know for the two faces of y
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.789
given X you know for the two faces of y
equals 0 or y equals 1 now let's take

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
equals 0 or y equals 1 now let's take
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.950
equals 0 or y equals 1 now let's take
these two equations and summarize them

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
these two equations and summarize them
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.649
these two equations and summarize them
into a single equation when just a point

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
into a single equation when just a point
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.289
into a single equation when just a point
out Y has to be either 0 or 1 because

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
out Y has to be either 0 or 1 because
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.179
out Y has to be either 0 or 1 because
we're in binary classification so y

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
we're in binary classification so y
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219
we're in binary classification so y
equals 0 1 are the only two possible

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
equals 0 1 are the only two possible
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350
equals 0 1 are the only two possible
cases right but someone think these

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
cases right but someone think these
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420
cases right but someone think these
equations and summarize them as follows

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
equations and summarize them as follows
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.100
equations and summarize them as follows
let me just write out what it looks like

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
let me just write out what it looks like
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.230
let me just write out what it looks like
then we'll explain why it looks like

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
then we'll explain why it looks like
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.030
then we'll explain why it looks like
that 1 minus y hat to the power of 1

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040
that 1 minus y hat to the power of 1
 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.219
that 1 minus y hat to the power of 1
minus y so it turns out this one line

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
minus y so it turns out this one line
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.359
minus y so it turns out this one line
summarizes the two equations on top let

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
summarizes the two equations on top let
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.600
summarizes the two equations on top let
me explain why so in the first case

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610
me explain why so in the first case
 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.520
me explain why so in the first case
suppose Y is equal to 1 all right so Y

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
suppose Y is equal to 1 all right so Y
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.050
suppose Y is equal to 1 all right so Y
is equal to 1 then this term ends up

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
is equal to 1 then this term ends up
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.960
is equal to 1 then this term ends up
being Y hat

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
being Y hat
 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.880
being Y hat
because that's why I had to the power of

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890
because that's why I had to the power of
 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.540
because that's why I had to the power of
one this term ends up being one minus y

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550
one this term ends up being one minus y
 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.540
one this term ends up being one minus y
hat to power of one minus one so that's

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550
hat to power of one minus one so that's
 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.210
hat to power of one minus one so that's
the power of zero but anything depart

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220
the power of zero but anything depart
 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.600
the power of zero but anything depart
zero as you go to one so that goes away

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610
zero as you go to one so that goes away
 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.900
zero as you go to one so that goes away
and so this equation just says P of Y

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910
and so this equation just says P of Y
 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.140
and so this equation just says P of Y
given X equals y hat when when y is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150
given X equals y hat when when y is
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.080
given X equals y hat when when y is
equal to one so you know that's exactly

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090
equal to one so you know that's exactly
 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.320
equal to one so you know that's exactly
what we wanted now how about the second

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330
what we wanted now how about the second
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.830
what we wanted now how about the second
case what if y equals zero if Y is equal

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
case what if y equals zero if Y is equal
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.130
case what if y equals zero if Y is equal
to zero then this equation above this P

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140
to zero then this equation above this P
 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.430
to zero then this equation above this P
of Y given x equals y hat to the zero

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440
of Y given x equals y hat to the zero
 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.620
of Y given x equals y hat to the zero
but anything to the power zero is equal

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630
but anything to the power zero is equal
 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.270
but anything to the power zero is equal
to one so you know that's just equal to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280
to one so you know that's just equal to
 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.440
to one so you know that's just equal to
one times one minus y hat to the power

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
one times one minus y hat to the power
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.920
one times one minus y hat to the power
of one minus y so one minus y is one

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930
of one minus y so one minus y is one
 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.190
of one minus y so one minus y is one
minus zero so this is just 1 and so this

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200
minus zero so this is just 1 and so this
 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.850
minus zero so this is just 1 and so this
is equal to one times 1 minus y hat is

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860
is equal to one times 1 minus y hat is
 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.870
is equal to one times 1 minus y hat is
just equal to one minus y hat and so

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880
just equal to one minus y hat and so
 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.930
just equal to one minus y hat and so
here we have to the y equals zero P of Y

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940
here we have to the y equals zero P of Y
 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.220
here we have to the y equals zero P of Y
given X is 0 1 minus y hat which is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230
given X is 0 1 minus y hat which is
 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.850
given X is 0 1 minus y hat which is
exactly what we wanted above so what

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860
exactly what we wanted above so what
 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.290
exactly what we wanted above so what
we've just shown is that this equation

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300
we've just shown is that this equation
 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.910
we've just shown is that this equation
is a you know correct definition for P

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920
is a you know correct definition for P
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.370
is a you know correct definition for P
of Y given X now finally um because the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380
of Y given X now finally um because the
 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.620
of Y given X now finally um because the
log function is a circular monotonically

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630
log function is a circular monotonically
 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.900
log function is a circular monotonically
increasing function you're maximizing

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910
increasing function you're maximizing
 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.100
increasing function you're maximizing
log of P of Y given X should give you a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110
log of P of Y given X should give you a
 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.080
log of P of Y given X should give you a
similar result as optimizing P of Y

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090
similar result as optimizing P of Y
 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.690
similar result as optimizing P of Y
given X and if you compute log of P of Y

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700
given X and if you compute log of P of Y
 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.750
given X and if you compute log of P of Y
given X that's equal to log of Y hat so

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760
given X that's equal to log of Y hat so
 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.990
given X that's equal to log of Y hat so
power of Y 1 minus y hat is a part of 1

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
power of Y 1 minus y hat is a part of 1
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.080
power of Y 1 minus y hat is a part of 1
minus y and so that simplifies to Y log

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090
minus y and so that simplifies to Y log
 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.220
minus y and so that simplifies to Y log
Y hat plus 1 minus y times 1 1 minus y

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230
Y hat plus 1 minus y times 1 1 minus y
 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.320
Y hat plus 1 minus y times 1 1 minus y
hat right and so there's actually

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330
hat right and so there's actually
 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.190
hat right and so there's actually
negative of the loss function that we

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200
negative of the loss function that we
 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.650
negative of the loss function that we
had to find previously and there's a

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660
had to find previously and there's a
 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.539
had to find previously and there's a
negative sign there because usually if

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549
negative sign there because usually if
 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.830
negative sign there because usually if
you're training learning algorithms you

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840
you're training learning algorithms you
 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.800
you're training learning algorithms you
want to make probabilities large whereas

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810
want to make probabilities large whereas
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.290
want to make probabilities large whereas
in such as regression we're expressing

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300
in such as regression we're expressing
 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.620
in such as regression we're expressing
the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630
the
 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.450
the
if we want to minimize the loss function

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460
if we want to minimize the loss function
 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.850
if we want to minimize the loss function
so minimizing the loss corresponds to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860
