00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.900
We're asked: Do the points
on the graph

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.390
below represent a function?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.140
So in order for the points to
represent a function, for

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.610
every input into our function,
we can only get one value.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.990
So if we look here, they've
graphed the point--it looks

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.340
like negative 1, 3, so that's
the point negative 1, 3.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.740
So if we assume that this is our
x-axis and that is our f

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.540
of x axis, and I'm just assuming
it's a function, I

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.320
don't know whether it really
is just now, this point is

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.820
telling us that if you put
negative 1 into our function,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760
or that thing that might be
a function, or maybe our

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.520
relation, you'll get a 3 So
it's telling us that f of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.580
negative 1 is equal to 3.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.220
So far it could be a reasonable
function.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.960
You give me negative 1 and
I will map it to 3.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.720
Then they have if x is 2, then
our value is negative 2.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.500
This is the point 2, negative
2, so that still seems

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.510
consistent with being
a function.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.170
If you pass me 2, I will map
you or I will point you to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.560
negative 2.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.930
Seems fair enough.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.230
Let's see this next
value here.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.250
This is the point 3 comma
2 right there.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.190
So once again, that says that,
look, if you give me 3 into my

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.800
function, into my black box,
I will output a 2.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.780
Pretty reasonable.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200
No reason why these points
can't represent

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.970
a function so far.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.480
Now, what about when we input
4 into the function?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.720
Let me do this in magenta.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.440
So what happens if I input
4 into my function?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.390
So this is 4 right here.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.120
Well, according to these points,
there's two points

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.440
that relate to 4 that
4 can be mapped to.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.900
I could map it to the
point 4 comma 5.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.720
So that says if you give me
a 4, I'll give you a 5.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.130
But it also says if you give me
a 4, I could also give you

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.330
a negative 1 because that's
the point 4, negative 1 So

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.030
this is not a function.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.250
It cannot be a function if for
some input into the function

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.460
you could give me two
different values.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.560
And you can see that
right here.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.800
And an easy test is to just
see, look, for one value I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.900
have two points for
this relationship.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.940
So this cannot be a function.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.060
So this is not a function!

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.320
I'll put an exclamation mark.
