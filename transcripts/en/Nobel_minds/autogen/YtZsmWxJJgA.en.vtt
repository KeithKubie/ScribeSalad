say but has lost the faith in science

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880
say but has lost the faith in science
 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.540

that we once had after World War Two and

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550
that we once had after World War Two and
 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.730

Sputnik of course that created a stage

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740
Sputnik of course that created a stage

Sputnik of course that created a stage
for science and people look to science

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960
for science and people look to science
 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.790
for science and people look to science
to solve many problems and now they've

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800
to solve many problems and now they've
 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.150
to solve many problems and now they've
become maybe a little jaded as we would

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160
become maybe a little jaded as we would
 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.610
become maybe a little jaded as we would
say a little too accustomed to what

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620
say a little too accustomed to what
 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.020
say a little too accustomed to what
progress we've made and they no longer

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030
progress we've made and they no longer
 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.810
progress we've made and they no longer
have maybe the confidence in science I

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820
have maybe the confidence in science I
 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.870
have maybe the confidence in science I
think that we had at that time for sure

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880
think that we had at that time for sure
 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.389
think that we had at that time for sure
yeah yeah I mean I mean Sputnik was the

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399
yeah yeah I mean I mean Sputnik was the
 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.420
yeah yeah I mean I mean Sputnik was the
one that sort of that was that that was

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430
one that sort of that was that that was
 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.190
one that sort of that was that that was
what changed change to the life in the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200
what changed change to the life in the
 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.470
what changed change to the life in the
u.s. and in terms of science and at

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480
u.s. and in terms of science and at
 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.700
u.s. and in terms of science and at
least in my generation I was in high

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710
least in my generation I was in high
 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.229
least in my generation I was in high
school when Sputnik went up and I

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239
school when Sputnik went up and I
 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.450
school when Sputnik went up and I
remember precisely that and it really

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460
remember precisely that and it really
 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.180
remember precisely that and it really
paved the way for me to go into science

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190
paved the way for me to go into science
 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860
paved the way for me to go into science
and go through science so that was

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870
and go through science so that was
 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.660
and go through science so that was
important but that's getting harder and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670
important but that's getting harder and
 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.099
important but that's getting harder and
harder I think yeah it says dick Sanders

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:08.109
harder I think yeah it says dick Sanders
 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.239
harder I think yeah it says dick Sanders
there's a lot of faith being lost

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249
there's a lot of faith being lost
 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.569
there's a lot of faith being lost
there's now at least in the US and

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579
there's now at least in the US and
 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.929
there's now at least in the US and
attitudes that are very non-scientific

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
attitudes that are very non-scientific
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.370
attitudes that are very non-scientific
that are becoming prevalent that are

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380
that are becoming prevalent that are
 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.889
that are becoming prevalent that are
being supported at levels which which

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899
being supported at levels which which
 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.529
being supported at levels which which
which make it difficult for for science

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539
which make it difficult for for science
 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.760
which make it difficult for for science
in many ways whose the blame for that if

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770
in many ways whose the blame for that if
 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.109
in many ways whose the blame for that if
you blame anything system

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119
you blame anything system
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.239
you blame anything system
I don't know I don't know you know

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249
I don't know I don't know you know
 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.099
I don't know I don't know you know
that's why I don't know it's it's really

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109
that's why I don't know it's it's really
 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.449
that's why I don't know it's it's really
it's really been frightening the last

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459
it's really been frightening the last
 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.239
it's really been frightening the last
few years to watch watch the watch the

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249
few years to watch watch the watch the
 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:44.489
few years to watch watch the watch the
change happen and can you see with your

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499
change happen and can you see with your
 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.229
change happen and can you see with your
students people who come to these our

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.239
students people who come to these our
 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.330
students people who come to these our
students I mean we're we're both at

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340
students I mean we're we're both at
 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.949
students I mean we're we're both at
Institutes of Technology which has

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959
Institutes of Technology which has
 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.159
Institutes of Technology which has
probably the two highest and standards

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:56.169
probably the two highest and standards
 

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:57.720
probably the two highest and standards
for admission

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730
for admission
 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.290
for admission
in the US and so our students come in

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300
in the US and so our students come in
 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.570
in the US and so our students come in
emphasis you know interested in science

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580
emphasis you know interested in science
 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.280
emphasis you know interested in science
wanting to do science and so for our

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290
wanting to do science and so for our
 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.690
wanting to do science and so for our
students that we work with every day

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
students that we work with every day
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.960
students that we work with every day
it's not an issue it's it's outside of

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970
it's not an issue it's it's outside of
 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.360
it's not an issue it's it's outside of
that group would you see it how you see

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370
that group would you see it how you see
 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.970
that group would you see it how you see
it through the funding agencies and the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
it through the funding agencies and the
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.840
it through the funding agencies and the
money they get which has well

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850
money they get which has well
 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.180
money they get which has well
fortunately this year I think increased

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190
fortunately this year I think increased
 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.610
fortunately this year I think increased
but there have been some difficult years

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620
but there have been some difficult years
 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.130
but there have been some difficult years
and although the government statements I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
and although the government statements I
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.980
and although the government statements I
mean our government in any government

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990
mean our government in any government
 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.160
mean our government in any government
has positions and sometimes they are not

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170
has positions and sometimes they are not

shall we say scientifically what we

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310
shall we say scientifically what we
 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.080
shall we say scientifically what we
would like them to be and that's that's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090
would like them to be and that's that's
 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.420
would like them to be and that's that's
that's something that is very visible

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
that's something that is very visible
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.950
that's something that is very visible
and it's very distressing to see things

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960
and it's very distressing to see things
 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.580
and it's very distressing to see things
said that are just not true or certainly

said that are just not true or certainly
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.730
said that are just not true or certainly
debatable at best
