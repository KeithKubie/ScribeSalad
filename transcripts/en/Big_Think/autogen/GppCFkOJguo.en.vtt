but what we do is pretty amazing the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
but what we do is pretty amazing the
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.950
but what we do is pretty amazing the
general context is of course we develop

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
general context is of course we develop
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.079
general context is of course we develop
medicines that hopefully can alleviate

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
medicines that hopefully can alleviate
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.689
medicines that hopefully can alleviate
pain and suffering from different

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
pain and suffering from different
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.140
pain and suffering from different
diseases what I do specifically here is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
diseases what I do specifically here is
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.380
diseases what I do specifically here is
I work as part of a project team we're

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
I work as part of a project team we're
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.000
I work as part of a project team we're
very fortunate we get to work with all

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
very fortunate we get to work with all
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.950
very fortunate we get to work with all
the different disease areas so whether

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
the different disease areas so whether
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.019
the different disease areas so whether
it's the cardiovascular area or

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
it's the cardiovascular area or
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.620
it's the cardiovascular area or
infectious disease or diabetes cancer

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
infectious disease or diabetes cancer
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.680
infectious disease or diabetes cancer
group each of those disease areas has

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
group each of those disease areas has
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.100
group each of those disease areas has
target proteins and so then our job is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
target proteins and so then our job is
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.889
target proteins and so then our job is
to work with the gene expression people

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
to work with the gene expression people
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.440
to work with the gene expression people
who actually do the DNA cloning and will

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
who actually do the DNA cloning and will
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.580
who actually do the DNA cloning and will
clone the DNA that expresses that target

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
clone the DNA that expresses that target
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340
clone the DNA that expresses that target
protein into different kind of hosts so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
protein into different kind of hosts so
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.010
protein into different kind of hosts so
some maybe e coli like recombinant e

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
some maybe e coli like recombinant e
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560
some maybe e coli like recombinant e
coli some maybe mammalian cells like

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
coli some maybe mammalian cells like
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.420
coli some maybe mammalian cells like
chinese hamster ovary cells human

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
chinese hamster ovary cells human
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029
chinese hamster ovary cells human
embryonic kidney cells and some maybe

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
embryonic kidney cells and some maybe
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.060
embryonic kidney cells and some maybe
this is the really amazing part like an

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
this is the really amazing part like an
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.280
this is the really amazing part like an
insect cell virus and so our job is to

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290
insect cell virus and so our job is to
 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.020
insect cell virus and so our job is to
express these target proteins in these

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
express these target proteins in these
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.730
express these target proteins in these
different hosts and once we're able to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
different hosts and once we're able to
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710
different hosts and once we're able to
do that we find the best host that makes

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
do that we find the best host that makes
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.380
do that we find the best host that makes
the most protein our job then is to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
the most protein our job then is to
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.460
the most protein our job then is to
scale up these cell lines and express

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
scale up these cell lines and express
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260
scale up these cell lines and express
these proteins where they will then get

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
these proteins where they will then get
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.310
these proteins where they will then get
purified by another group and then used

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
purified by another group and then used
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.100
purified by another group and then used
for the therapeutic area target of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
for the therapeutic area target of
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380
for the therapeutic area target of
interest so it would be used for

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
interest so it would be used for
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270
interest so it would be used for
high-throughput screening it could be

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
high-throughput screening it could be
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910
high-throughput screening it could be
used to identify the structure of the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
used to identify the structure of the
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010
used to identify the structure of the
protein can be used an assay development

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
protein can be used an assay development
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830
protein can be used an assay development
and the therapeutic area so when you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
and the therapeutic area so when you
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.010
and the therapeutic area so when you
think about the drug discovery train the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
think about the drug discovery train the
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109
think about the drug discovery train the
pipeline we're kind of in the front

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
pipeline we're kind of in the front
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.080
pipeline we're kind of in the front
because without these target proteins

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090
because without these target proteins
 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.060
because without these target proteins
there's not a lot of screening and that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
there's not a lot of screening and that
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.300
there's not a lot of screening and that
these target proteins there's no biology

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
these target proteins there's no biology
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.100
these target proteins there's no biology
then that can be done to identify these

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
then that can be done to identify these
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.920
then that can be done to identify these
new medicines

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930
 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.749
so we will work with each of the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
so we will work with each of the
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.580
so we will work with each of the
different therapeutic areas so each

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
different therapeutic areas so each
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.009
different therapeutic areas so each
therapeutic area of course we're all

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019
therapeutic area of course we're all
 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.740
therapeutic area of course we're all
experts in our field so if the area is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
experts in our field so if the area is
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.920
experts in our field so if the area is
let's say diabetes they will be

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
let's say diabetes they will be
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.470
let's say diabetes they will be
targeting a protein or a specific

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480
targeting a protein or a specific
 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.640
targeting a protein or a specific
biochemical pathway let's say in the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
biochemical pathway let's say in the
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.190
biochemical pathway let's say in the
Cascade of diabetes in the body and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
Cascade of diabetes in the body and
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.400
Cascade of diabetes in the body and
they're hoping to identify a novel

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
they're hoping to identify a novel
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.290
they're hoping to identify a novel
medicine or a new Pfizer medicine and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
medicine or a new Pfizer medicine and
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.979
medicine or a new Pfizer medicine and
will somehow stimulate or block or

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
will somehow stimulate or block or
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.780
will somehow stimulate or block or
somehow modulate that protein to move

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790
somehow modulate that protein to move
 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.160
somehow modulate that protein to move
that disease in a positive direction so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
that disease in a positive direction so
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.500
that disease in a positive direction so
the first step then is for the project

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
the first step then is for the project
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.070
the first step then is for the project
team to identify these targets the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
team to identify these targets the
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.740
team to identify these targets the
second step then would be for the for

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
second step then would be for the for
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.680
second step then would be for the for
the gene cloning people and myself to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
the gene cloning people and myself to
 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.930
the gene cloning people and myself to
work with these project teams and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
work with these project teams and
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.440
work with these project teams and
identify the DNA sections that they want

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450
identify the DNA sections that they want
 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.130
identify the DNA sections that they want
to clone into these let's say hosts

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
to clone into these let's say hosts
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.220
to clone into these let's say hosts
let's call them hoes and so once they do

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
let's call them hoes and so once they do
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.740
let's call them hoes and so once they do
that they determine whether or not

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
that they determine whether or not
 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.390
that they determine whether or not
they're making the right protein and

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400
they're making the right protein and
 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.210
they're making the right protein and
then those hosts come into our lab where

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
then those hosts come into our lab where
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.039
then those hosts come into our lab where
we will scale them up to sometimes as

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049
we will scale them up to sometimes as
 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.500
we will scale them up to sometimes as
high as 100 leaders and it's pretty

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510
high as 100 leaders and it's pretty
 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.050
high as 100 leaders and it's pretty
amazing this recombinant DNA technology

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
amazing this recombinant DNA technology
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.569
amazing this recombinant DNA technology
because these hosts not only make their

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579
because these hosts not only make their
 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.930
because these hosts not only make their
own cell proteins they make the protein

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
own cell proteins they make the protein
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.110
own cell proteins they make the protein
from the DNA that was cloned into it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120
 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.340
well of course when I started there

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350
well of course when I started there
 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.110
well of course when I started there
weren't computer process controlled

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120
weren't computer process controlled
 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.980
weren't computer process controlled
sterilized one place for manners and so

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990
sterilized one place for manners and so
 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.990
sterilized one place for manners and so
it's been really great to see just the

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000
it's been really great to see just the
 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.330
it's been really great to see just the
cell culture technology take off in the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340
cell culture technology take off in the
 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.570
cell culture technology take off in the
25 years now we have automated cell

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580
25 years now we have automated cell
 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.690
25 years now we have automated cell
counters and automative analyzers that

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700
counters and automative analyzers that
 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.480
counters and automative analyzers that
can test the chemistry's of these cell

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490
can test the chemistry's of these cell
 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.240
can test the chemistry's of these cell
lines in just minutes whereas years ago

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250
lines in just minutes whereas years ago
 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.920
lines in just minutes whereas years ago
we used to have to count the cells on

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930
we used to have to count the cells on
 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.920
we used to have to count the cells on
you know microscope using a microscope a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930
you know microscope using a microscope a
 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.890
you know microscope using a microscope a
hemocytometer now we can get cell counts

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900
hemocytometer now we can get cell counts
 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.290
hemocytometer now we can get cell counts
in just a matter of minutes and so the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300
in just a matter of minutes and so the
 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.630
in just a matter of minutes and so the
technology has allowed us to do much

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640
technology has allowed us to do much
 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.420
technology has allowed us to do much
more in a much shorter period of time

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
more in a much shorter period of time
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.310
more in a much shorter period of time
today we have all kinds of tagged

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320
today we have all kinds of tagged
 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.280
today we have all kinds of tagged
proteins so we can put on histidine tags

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290
proteins so we can put on histidine tags
 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.730
proteins so we can put on histidine tags
and GST tags and flag tags on to these

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740
and GST tags and flag tags on to these
 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.310
and GST tags and flag tags on to these
proteins and so that really makes the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320
proteins and so that really makes the
 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.980
proteins and so that really makes the
purification so much quicker because we

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990
purification so much quicker because we
 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.560
purification so much quicker because we
can use affinity chromatography so maybe

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570
can use affinity chromatography so maybe
 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.140
can use affinity chromatography so maybe
when I started might take a whole month

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150
when I started might take a whole month
 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.409
when I started might take a whole month
or three months to purify one protein

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419
or three months to purify one protein
 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.420
or three months to purify one protein
now we can do almost the whole thing in

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430
now we can do almost the whole thing in
 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.190
now we can do almost the whole thing in
just a week or sometimes just a few days

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200
just a week or sometimes just a few days
 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.800
just a week or sometimes just a few days
the technology has really allowed us to

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810
the technology has really allowed us to
 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.360
the technology has really allowed us to
do much more in a shorter period of time

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370
 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.730
so it's these protein targets that we're

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740
so it's these protein targets that we're
 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.240
so it's these protein targets that we're
trying to identify novel medications to

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250
trying to identify novel medications to
 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.420
trying to identify novel medications to
either block or inhibit or stimulate

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430
either block or inhibit or stimulate
 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.330
either block or inhibit or stimulate
these target proteins so our job is to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340
these target proteins so our job is to
 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.850
these target proteins so our job is to
scale up these cell lines that make

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860
scale up these cell lines that make
 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.520
scale up these cell lines that make
these target proteins now what's amazing

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530
these target proteins now what's amazing
 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.219
these target proteins now what's amazing
is niche of these cell lines they may

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229
is niche of these cell lines they may
 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.740
is niche of these cell lines they may
only express maybe one milligram per

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750
only express maybe one milligram per
 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.680
only express maybe one milligram per
liter which is a very very small amount

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690
liter which is a very very small amount
 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.230
liter which is a very very small amount
and so one of the important things of

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240
and so one of the important things of
 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.659
and so one of the important things of
our job then is to either use our novel

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669
our job then is to either use our novel
 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.790
our job then is to either use our novel

kinds of bioreactors another point would
 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.210
kinds of bioreactors another point would
be to somehow optimize the expression of

be to somehow optimize the expression of
 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.820
be to somehow optimize the expression of
the protein using again different

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500
protein we have are able to express the
 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.700

is try and crystallize the protein and
 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.820
is try and crystallize the protein and
then get the crystalline structure now

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830
then get the crystalline structure now
 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.320
then get the crystalline structure now
once you have the crystalline structure

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330
once you have the crystalline structure
 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.810

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.600
the protein then you can use what's
called computer-aided drug discovery so

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610
called computer-aided drug discovery so
 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.030
called computer-aided drug discovery so
you can maybe model the structure of the

you can maybe model the structure of the
 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.040
you can maybe model the structure of the
protein and try and find the binding

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050
protein and try and find the binding
 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.460
protein and try and find the binding
site and actually synthetically design a

we're trying to modify that protein to

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210
we're trying to modify that protein to
 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.770
we're trying to modify that protein to
affect the target disease area

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780
 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.160
I think the exciting part is when you're

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170
I think the exciting part is when you're
 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.379
I think the exciting part is when you're
able to get a crystal structure of a

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389
able to get a crystal structure of a
 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.840
able to get a crystal structure of a
protein and then you're able to design a

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850
protein and then you're able to design a
 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.820
protein and then you're able to design a
drug and you can actually see how that

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830
drug and you can actually see how that
 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.150
drug and you can actually see how that

and one of us is successful really all
 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:47.290
and one of us is successful really all
successful is the way it is I wish you

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300
successful is the way it is I wish you
 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.300

could see it because it's actually kind

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.310
could see it because it's actually kind
 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.180
could see it because it's actually kind
of simple if you think of like a ziploc

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.190
of simple if you think of like a ziploc
 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.430
of simple if you think of like a ziploc
bag starla ziploc bag on a rocker and

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440
bag starla ziploc bag on a rocker and
 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.020
bag starla ziploc bag on a rocker and
the technology was actually discovered

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.030
the technology was actually discovered
 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.090
the technology was actually discovered
in the mid-1990s and at that time they

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:04.100
in the mid-1990s and at that time they
 

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.110
in the mid-1990s and at that time they
said this will never work and so we are

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120
said this will never work and so we are
 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.909
said this will never work and so we are
very fortunate to get one of the first

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919
very fortunate to get one of the first
 

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.260
very fortunate to get one of the first
of these wave rocking platforms and what

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:14.270
of these wave rocking platforms and what
 

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.870
of these wave rocking platforms and what
we actually do is we take this imagine

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:16.880
we actually do is we take this imagine
 

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.670
we actually do is we take this imagine
it looks like a ziploc bag we fill it

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680
it looks like a ziploc bag we fill it
 

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.159
it looks like a ziploc bag we fill it
with median cells and then it rocks on a

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:21.169
with median cells and then it rocks on a
 

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:25.180
with median cells and then it rocks on a
platform back and forth and the cells

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.190
platform back and forth and the cells
 

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.340
platform back and forth and the cells
really like this motion and so our cells

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:30.350
really like this motion and so our cells
 

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.140
really like this motion and so our cells
if they're mammalian cells or even

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.150
if they're mammalian cells or even
 

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.390
if they're mammalian cells or even
insect cells because these types of

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:34.400
insect cells because these types of
 

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.450
insect cells because these types of
cells can grow in suspension we can grow

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:37.460
cells can grow in suspension we can grow
 

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.050
cells can grow in suspension we can grow
them to very high cell densities and

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.060
them to very high cell densities and
 

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.659
them to very high cell densities and
with very high cell viability and so the

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:43.669
with very high cell viability and so the
 

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.360
with very high cell viability and so the
more cells we have the more protein we

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:46.370
more cells we have the more protein we
 

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.579
more cells we have the more protein we
can make because happy cells are

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:48.589
can make because happy cells are
 

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:51.790
can make because happy cells are
productive cells and so it's it's an

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800
productive cells and so it's it's an
 

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.190
productive cells and so it's it's an
exciting technology because previous to

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.200
exciting technology because previous to
 

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.620
exciting technology because previous to
the wave bioreactor all the work was

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:56.630
the wave bioreactor all the work was
 

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.290
the wave bioreactor all the work was
done in stirred tank fermenters and so a

00:08:59.290 --> 00:08:59.300
done in stirred tank fermenters and so a
 

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.940
done in stirred tank fermenters and so a
stirred tank for a mentor had to be

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:00.950
stirred tank for a mentor had to be
 

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.670
stirred tank for a mentor had to be
assembled the probes all had to be

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680
assembled the probes all had to be
 

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.640
assembled the probes all had to be
calibrated it had to be sterilized in an

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:06.650
calibrated it had to be sterilized in an
 

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.130
calibrated it had to be sterilized in an
autoclave it had to be brought back at

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.140
autoclave it had to be brought back at
 

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.320
autoclave it had to be brought back at
some times washed through with

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.330
some times washed through with
 

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.600
some times washed through with
conditioned media then we would actually

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:13.610
conditioned media then we would actually
 

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.060
conditioned media then we would actually
add cells to it run it and of course in

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.070
add cells to it run it and of course in
 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.910
add cells to it run it and of course in
a stirred tank you have a an impeller

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920
a stirred tank you have a an impeller
 

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.710
a stirred tank you have a an impeller
that spin

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720
that spin
 

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.400
that spin
around you have air that's being sparged

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:23.410
around you have air that's being sparged
 

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.400
around you have air that's being sparged
through it and so every time those cells

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:26.410
through it and so every time those cells
 

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.259
through it and so every time those cells
mammalian cells and insect cells

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:28.269
mammalian cells and insect cells
 

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:30.480
mammalian cells and insect cells
remember they're very fragile they don't

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.490
remember they're very fragile they don't
 

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.379
remember they're very fragile they don't
have a cell cell wall like bacteria they

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:34.389
have a cell cell wall like bacteria they
 

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:36.480
have a cell cell wall like bacteria they
just have a cell membrane so they're

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:36.490
just have a cell membrane so they're
 

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.550
just have a cell membrane so they're
very fragile every time the cells would

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560
very fragile every time the cells would
 

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.410
very fragile every time the cells would
hit the impeller are the sides of the

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:40.420
hit the impeller are the sides of the
 

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.019
hit the impeller are the sides of the
stirred tank or one of these bubbles

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:43.029
stirred tank or one of these bubbles
 

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:46.499
stirred tank or one of these bubbles
would pop the cells would die so the

00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:46.509
would pop the cells would die so the
 

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:48.629
would pop the cells would die so the
design of this gentle rocking motion

00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:48.639
design of this gentle rocking motion
 

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:52.470
design of this gentle rocking motion
wave bioreactor allows the cells to be

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480
wave bioreactor allows the cells to be
 

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.319
wave bioreactor allows the cells to be
in a happy environment where they are

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:55.329
in a happy environment where they are
 

00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:57.809
in a happy environment where they are
much more viable and they can grow too

00:09:57.809 --> 00:09:57.819
much more viable and they can grow too
 

00:09:57.819 --> 00:10:01.199
much more viable and they can grow too
much higher cell densities and so that's

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:01.209
much higher cell densities and so that's
 

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:04.710
much higher cell densities and so that's
the technology the bags come sterile and

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720
the technology the bags come sterile and
 

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.069
the technology the bags come sterile and
so we just hook the bag up fill it with

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079
so we just hook the bag up fill it with
 

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:09.689
so we just hook the bag up fill it with
our cells and media and they make them

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:09.699
our cells and media and they make them
 

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:12.749
our cells and media and they make them
now up to 500 liters maybe larger which

00:10:12.749 --> 00:10:12.759
now up to 500 liters maybe larger which
 

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.939
now up to 500 liters maybe larger which
is really awesome but in our lab we just

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:14.949
is really awesome but in our lab we just
 

00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:17.309
is really awesome but in our lab we just
go up to we have run multiple batches of

00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:17.319
go up to we have run multiple batches of
 

00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:20.639
go up to we have run multiple batches of
25 liters so again as I said at first

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:20.649
25 liters so again as I said at first
 

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:22.410
25 liters so again as I said at first
nobody thought this would work I mean

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:22.420
nobody thought this would work I mean
 

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.929
nobody thought this would work I mean
it's kind of such a novel idea everybody

00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:24.939
it's kind of such a novel idea everybody
 

00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:26.639
it's kind of such a novel idea everybody
said well geez that's kind of silly

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:26.649
said well geez that's kind of silly
 

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:29.879
said well geez that's kind of silly
it'll never work but here at Pfizer we

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:29.889
it'll never work but here at Pfizer we
 

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:31.139
it'll never work but here at Pfizer we
were able to show that the technology

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:31.149
were able to show that the technology
 

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:33.869
were able to show that the technology
did work it saved tremendous amounts of

00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:33.879
did work it saved tremendous amounts of
 

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:37.019
did work it saved tremendous amounts of
time and money and because the bags came

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:37.029
time and money and because the bags came
 

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:40.319

areas you know diabetes over time is a

00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.470
areas you know diabetes over time is a
 

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.180
areas you know diabetes over time is a
very debilitating disease and so

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.190
very debilitating disease and so
 

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.970
very debilitating disease and so
wouldn't it be great to have a medicine

wouldn't it be a wouldn't it be great to
 

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.620
wouldn't it be a wouldn't it be great to
develop some kind of gene technology so

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:16.630
develop some kind of gene technology so
 

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.870
develop some kind of gene technology so
that we could cure diabetes again

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880
that we could cure diabetes again
 

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.360
that we could cure diabetes again
there's so many opportunities in these

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:24.370
there's so many opportunities in these

wouldn't it be great to develop a drug

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.290
wouldn't it be great to develop a drug
 

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.730
wouldn't it be great to develop a drug
to help control people that can't help

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:32.740
to help control people that can't help
 

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.940
to help control people that can't help
but be overweight wouldn't it be great

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:35.950
but be overweight wouldn't it be great
 

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.270
but be overweight wouldn't it be great
to develop in any cancer therapy that

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:39.280
to develop in any cancer therapy that
 

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.390
to develop in any cancer therapy that
would cure any kind of cancer that would

provides tremendous hope because even
 

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.960
provides tremendous hope because even
five years ago some of these

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:51.970
five years ago some of these
 

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.710
five years ago some of these
technologies weren't known some of these

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720
