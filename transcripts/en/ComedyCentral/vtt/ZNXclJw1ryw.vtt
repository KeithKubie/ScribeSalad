00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.482
"A real dipshit."

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.318
Thanks, Kurt.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:13.319
- Fuck yeah!

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.856
Are you guys read to be
a part of Roustabout?

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.759
(crowd cheering)

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:22.762
(upbeat jazz music)

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.566 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let's go up to
Second Line, come on!

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.434
(cheering)

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:31.437
(upbeat jazz music)

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:40.513
So here's the deal.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.481 align:start size:84% position:16%
This show is all about
inserting absurdity

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.818 align:start size:88% position:13%
in the world and make
strangers' lives better.

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:48.654
And we did it, we
actually did it.

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:53.459
(slow, dramatic music)

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:58.898
Made it all the way from
Chicago to New Orleans.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.866
Had some adventures.

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.002
Made some friends.

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:04.503
Lost some friends.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:10.776 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I still haven't
raised $50,000.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:13.045
And I can't rest until I do.

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:13.879
Yeah!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.115
Woo!

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:22.855 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well, I guess the
adventure continues.

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:24.557
Roustabout.

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:27.727
(slow dramatic music)

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.500
(intense electronic music)

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.616 align:start size:84% position:16%
Goddammit guys, I made
it to New Orleans,

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.418
but I didn't make it to my goal.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.320
That's okay, because
you can still help.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.655
