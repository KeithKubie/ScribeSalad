00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.020
Sunshine was a relatively complex app
in terms of integration points because

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.340
a successful outcome relied on
both user and server input.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.720
We did a great job dealing with
certain aspects of that wide range.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.780
The first thing we did was using a
SyncAdapter to load data from the server

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.120
in the background,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.570
we never see partially loaded
data because of this choice.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.020
It keeps our data relatively efficient,
and it makes efficient use of battery.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.490
Even if we have not opened
the app in a while,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.070
the data is being updated
behind the scenes.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.050
The second thing we did well
was caching our data locally.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.160
This is why being offline is only
critical when first starting

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.430
the application or
changing the location.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.780
Caching keeps our data still accessible
when the user's not connected

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.230
to the Internet.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.060
Without this, our weather app
would display a blank screen

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.010
any time your device went
through a patch without service.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.950
And that, would be terrible.
