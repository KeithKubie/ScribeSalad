00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.930
Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.930
I'm Corey D'Augustine.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.269
I want to welcome you to the third live Q&amp;A
session.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.260
I'll be here for the next 30 minutes, something
like that, taking questions about art history,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.680
about perhaps some of your works in the studio,
or whatever else is on your mind.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.290
We will be taking live questions but we've
also compiled a list of questions from previous

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.580
episodes, so let's dive right in.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.330
First question comes from alexmeinhof.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.500
Alex writes, "How do you respond to people
who say that abstract art requires no skill?"

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.149
Okay, so this is kind of a classic question
for modernism, and especially for abstract

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.760
painting, the Jackson Pollocks of the world.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.790
Actually, a quick story.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.120
I remember once when I was working the National
Gallery I was dusting frames early in the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.170
morning and a dad came in with his daughter
on his shoulders, and they're looking at a

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.170
Joan Michell painting.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.300
You could imagine what that might look like.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.770
And the daughter said, "Oh, Daddy it's dirty.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.780
I want to clean it."

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.110
He was like, "Okay, well, dirty is one word
for it," but language I think is key here.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.390
Pablo Picasso, who, by the way, never painted
an abstract painting himself, was asked about

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.720
cubism and how he responded to the fact that
many people didn't understand cubism, and

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.790
kind of ridiculed it as crazy, avant-garde.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.610
And Picasso said, "Well, you know modern art
movements are very much like foreign languages.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.931
And if someone French came in the room right
now and started speaking French and you didn't

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:28.100
know the language you wouldn't blink.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.939
You wouldn't understand anything."

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.620
And for Picasso it was really the same thing,
so his opinion was that if someone had never

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.530
spent time with cubism, never studied that
abstract language, semi-abstract language,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.060
that it would come as no surprise that they
didn't really understand what it was about.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.299
Now could anyone paint a cubist painting?

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.860
Could anyone paint an abstract painting?

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.570
Well, in a way, of course.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.390
But if we can run with this analogy a little
bit longer, you know, if you start to study

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.390
Chinese.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.729
Your first class in Chinese language class
you're actually just making noises.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.250
You're making not words but just sounds that
are vaguely Chinese.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.860
But they don't mean anything, right?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.369
So you can imitate that, but if a Chinese
person walks in the room and starts to try

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.080
to understand what you're saying, of course
you're not getting anywhere, right?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.370
So without a background in some of these movements
it's really difficult to understand what the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.709
intentions are, what the painting is trying
to do or say, and this is potentially a problem.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.249
And, you know, for Alex and perhaps many viewers
out there, there is something difficult about

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.790
a lot of modern art.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.400
Perhaps elitist, unfortunately, about some
modern art that if you come into it cold you're

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.590
having a difficult time to get a foothold
and really understand what the movement is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.590
about.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.930
Whereas, you know, old master paintings, like
it or not, if you go look at a Titian or a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.349
Vermeer, now you might like it.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.409
You might love it.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.590
You might not, but you understand what the
criteria is of a good painting.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.290
Is it realistic?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.519
Is it not?

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.801
Whereas in modernism they threw that out the
window, as they did so many things.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.150
So this is a huge topic, and we could talk
about this for the next half an hour.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.319
But I hope anyway that's an introduction to
this idea that, yeah, it's fair to say that

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.949
some of these movements are really difficult.

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.459
They do require a little bit of homework.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.349
And if you don't want to, no problem.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.999
In my opinion, if you do follow through with
some of that homework you're opening some

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:19.749
really interesting doors to an appreciation
of a lot of art that, by the way, try it yourself.

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.840
You can't do if you speak the language and
you're sensitive to it.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.909
Or you can maybe after a lot of practice.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.260
All right, first live question here comes
from Rachel Birkner.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.159
"Corey, you have a remarkable ability to recreate
the style of the abstract expressionist.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.209
What drew you to these artists and this time
period specifically?

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.359
And PS, does Drake mind that you stole his
DNA?"

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.569
I didn't do that, I promise.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.089
But the real question here, what drew me personally
to the New York school, living in New York

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:50.089
is a big one.

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:54.561
Being an American, by the way, since the so-called
Abstract Expressionists were probably, fair

00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:59.060
to say, the most critically important historical
avant-garde in this country now.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.400
And you could go back to Alfred Stieglitz
and there's many other interesting modern

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.169
artists before them, but that's really the
one that got the ball rolling here in New

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.999
York City.

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:12.859
You know, I have a background studying jazz
and a lot of the same ideas meshed with improvisation

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:18.500
with a lot of, you know, the bebop players
and the Jackson Pollocks of the world.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.640
So when I was in grad school that was really
where I focused.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.919
And, you know, in my own studio work certainly
wasn't an abstract expressionist style painter

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.150
but I spent a lot of time thinking about them.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.520
So yeah, thank you for the compliment and
keep going.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.710
Next question.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.789
This comes from the September live Q&amp;A.

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.289
That was our last one.

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.729
"At the risk of sounding like a kiss-ass,
this is definitely one light bulb you've turned

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.130
on in terms of learning to appreciate the
Abstract Expressionist movement, and I've

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.130
been to art school.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.020
Having said that, what are some avenues one
could explore in furthering a beginner's education

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.919
the art form, books, films, podcast, etc?"

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.729
Okay, great question.

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.189
First of all, podcasts, I'm not aware of any
but there probably are some good ones out

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:06.780
there, so please post down below and share
this with me and everyone else watching.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.969
Films, one really good one, a documentary
film made by Emile de Antonio.

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.900
And maybe we'll post this down in the comments
later, "Painters Painting" is the name of

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.460
that documentary from 1971 or '72, something
like that.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.750
De Antonio was a New York school artist himself
and he interviewed a whole lot of great artists,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.550
ranging from Barnett Newman, and Willem de
Kooning, to Andy Warhol.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.440
And if you want to hear it, you know, from
the source, an artist documenting the work

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.290
of other artists in their studios, etc, in
my opinion that's really as good as it gets.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.949
And books, wow, there's about a million of
them out there.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.880
I think my favorite entry-level-ish book on
the New York School is written by Irving Sandler.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.581
Sandler was a really young aspiring art historian,
probably not even an art historian yet, at

00:05:55.581 --> 00:05:56.581
the
Artists Club.

00:05:56.581 --> 00:06:00.719
He knew de Kooning, and Pollock, and all those
guys and gals.

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:06.350
And his memoirs, or actually one chapter of
his memoirs is called, "A Sweeper-Up After

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.350
Artists."

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.319
Kind of a strange title, but those are his
personal recollections, and he's kind of weaving

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.460
great stories back and forth with the history
of the movement.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.590
It's really entertaining.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.330
It's also quite interesting and elucidating.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.419
Katharina Huemer, also from the September
live Q&amp;A.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.419
"Thanks so much.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.560
As we all know, practice is the key.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.110
Can you recommend something to practice on,
as buying canvas all the time is quite expensive?

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.610
But the specific surface is still quite important,
at least to me.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.330
Again, thank you very much."

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.870
Thank you.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:44.780
Okay, so to practice on, first of all, paper
is really cheap, brown paper, etc.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.580
And certainly you can practice brushwork,
etc, but Katharina is right here, the texture

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.400
is different, the
absorbance is different, etc.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.620
One thing you can do to make it act a little
bit more like canvas is to prime paper.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.469
That seals the paper and reduces its absorption,
so the paint starts to feel a little bit more

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:05.800
like applying to canvas.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.169
Also you can do what Picasso did and many
other artists, paint on the back of a canvas.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.280
When you're done with one, unstretch it, flip
it over, prime the other side, and paint it

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280
again.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.129
Or what Picasso also did it early on the Blue
Period when he wasn't really selling works

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:23.319
is to paint directly on top of another painting.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:27.819
Now for all of us Picasso lovers it's kind
of a bummer that there are all of these so-called

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:32.930
lost or hidden Picasso's, which by the way,
conservators like myself are using imaging

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.169
techniques of increased specificity to really
pick out some of those under paintings, if

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:39.229
you will.

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:42.139
So maybe if you make a masterpiece don't paint
it out, please.

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.960
But as you're just growing as a painter, I
think it's completely fine to realize that

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.259
your painting is kind of exercise.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.880
They're kind of platforms, or kind of steps
forward.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.710
And when you've finished one, by all means
take a picture of it, remember it.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.449
But if money's tight I think it's completely
fine to paint over that.

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:01.569
And really, again, as I mentioned in the previous
one, I think one of the most important things

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:06.499
for a young painter is not to fall in love
with anything you've done.

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:09.360
Always risk what you've done to try to make
it better.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.469
Don't rest on your laurels in other words.

00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:16.240
And I think making yourself paint over works
is a really, really good way to ensure that

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.629
that's the case.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:23.220
And by the way, it's the cheap way, too.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.219
Emily Tarleton writes, "I feel like I learned
more in the first 10 minutes of this video

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:30.259
than I did in 3 years' worth of art classes
in high school."

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.110
Well, that's kind of a good news, bad news
one.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.219
I'm glad to hear that, in a way.

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:39.669
Not so glad to hear that about your high school
art class, but thanks for those kind words.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:45.340
Iveta Wiedermann writes, "Is it necessary
to be capable of realistic drawing or painting

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.889
for abstract for an abstract painter?

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:51.630
Were mentioned artists like Newman, de Kooning,
and others also great in realistic drawings

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.370
and paintings?"

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.680
Interesting.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680
Is it necessary?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.010
This is a case-by-case situation.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.060
It really depends on what kind of abstract
painting you're making.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.570
Willem de Kooning, as you probably know since
you're here, really exerts a kind of battle

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.751
between painting and drawing in his painted
canvases, drawing with a loaded brush, drawing

00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:17.420
back on top of a painting, painting back on
top of a drawing, etc.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.769
And by the way, de Kooning was one of the
greatest draftsman, in terms of drawing, of

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:23.769
the 20th century.

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:27.120
So if you're going to draw like...sorry, if
you're going to paint like de Kooning I think

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120
the answer this question is yes.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.650
You really gotta hone your draftsmanship skills.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.580
Newman is a great counter example, though.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.040
If you look at early representational work
by Newman.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.500
Ugh, good luck.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.180
He destroyed it all because he didn't want
you to see it.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.089
Something tells me there was a reason for
that.

00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:51.980
Ego's certainly a part of it, but in Newman's
graphic work later on, his zips, his prints,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.610
etc, the artist hand, in terms of realistic
drawing, is completely irrelevant.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.529
And whereas some kind of Philistine argument
will say, "Well, you can't be an abstract

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:05.250
painter unless you pay your dues first," I
really don't think that's the case.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.360
It really depends on what kind of an abstract
artist that you want to be.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.459
Same thing with jazz, by the way.

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:16.459
Ornette Coleman, great avant-garde innovator
on the alto saxophone and other instruments,

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:17.920
was not a great bebop player.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.740
But he just improvised a completely new relationship
to the music without paying his dues, and

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.399
that was very difficult for many people.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:29.959
In fact, when he first came to New York City
in 1959 he was labeled anti-jazz.

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:33.490
Well, now when you listen to Ornette you're
going to be tapping your foot.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.570
I'm pretty sure you're going to think it's
jazz.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:40.339
So sometimes as movements make their way into
history we really start to understand that

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:49.290
it's more about the idea rather than the checklist
of things that gets you to that idea.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.920
Cecelia Beck asks, "How did de Kooning's paintings
fare over time with the mixture?"

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.420
Cecelia referring to some really interesting
materials that de Kooning added to his paint,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:05.120
including some non-drying oils, like safflower,
cooking oil, in other words.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.360
How did they fare?

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.440
Kind of a mixed bag.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.920
I think it's fair to say that de Kooning's
paintings have a lot more cracks than certain

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.820
other artists who are more academic or conventional
in their approach to the canvas.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.510
de Kooning knew how to paint according to
the academic standards for sure, but he just

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.880
willingly deviated from those recipes in the
interest of creative ideas.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.360
In other words, fat over lean, that rule of
thumb of oil painting or really any kind of

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.360
painting.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360
How to make a painting that lasts.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.520
He didn't do that.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.500
So in many cases actually we see drying cracks
in his painting.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.510
Now what a drying crack is is not a crack
that happened because, you know, someone crashed

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.170
into it or kicked a soccer ball against it,
or that the temperature of the humidity varied

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.580
wildly in your living room.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.089
Instead it's those cracks forming as the paint
dries.

00:11:58.089 --> 00:11:59.740
So those cracks, they're actually not a damage.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.040
It's not a condition problem for the painting.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.060
It's something that the material did naturally
as it dried in the studio.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.630
At the very least de Kooning accepted these
kind of drying cracks.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:14.930
And having looked at a lot de Kooning paintings,
I'm pretty confident that actually he invited

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.200
these drying cracks at times.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.009
de Kooning getting really wrinkly textures
sometimes, adding way too much medium, and

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:26.790
other times working super dry and underbound,
and having cracking, kind of dry paint surfaces.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.880
de Kooning really made paint do everything
that it

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.500
possibly could do, including not dry, as we
talked about in a previous video, where some

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.010
of his paintings still have drips that are
literally still wet today, 50 years down the

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.010
road.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:45.990
And they're probably not drying anytime soon.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.930
Pamela writes, "Question for you, Corey.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.870
When you painted during Parts I &amp; II in de
Kooning style can you please talk about the

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.269
fat over lean principle and whether de Kooning
adhered to this principle?"

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:56.820
Actually we just kind of addressed this.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.079
The answer really here is rarely.

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:03.740
In these kind of paintings when de Kooning
did follow fat over lean, I think it was almost

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.740
just by chance.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.310
It's really not something that he was worried
about, and it is why some of these really

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.490
interesting paint textures happened on his
paintings.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.170
And, you know, let's be frank.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.130
Some of his paintings do have condition problems.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.940
Some of them do have flaking paint when the
paint is cracking, and lifting off the surface,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.690
and falling on the floor, etc.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.380
And painters of this generation, Franz Kline
also, you know, there's a certain risk, a

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.199
certain cost littered to the condition, the
aging properties of your painting when you

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:33.009
do deviate from those academic techniques.

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:35.950
But I don't think de Kooning is really an
extreme example of that.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:41.449
We can find other painters who were making
much more unorthodox and much more fragile

00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:47.649
paint films, like Yves Klein from France,
or Ad Reinhardt here from New York City.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:54.230
ArnoM73 writes, "A big thanks from Germany
for everything.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.230
Big fan of your videos.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.790
Which binder is best to use with acrylics
to get more fluidity?

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.180
Any thoughts about mixing oils and acrylics?

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.379
I would love to hear more about Pierre Soulages."

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:07.000
Actually I just finished working on a Pierre
Soulages painting, a great abstract painter

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.560
who's still kicking, by the way, still working
in Paris.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.390
Okay, so the question here about getting more
fluidity with acrylics.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.560
Okay, one way to do that is to add solvent,
which in this case is water, which cuts the

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.980
fluidity of your paint.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.230
But if you're trying to increase also the
translucence of your paint there's a really

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.260
wide range of additives for acrylics.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.560
Now the truth here is that, you know, within
all of these different lines, and I'm talking

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.589
about commercial brands of acrylic paints,
a lot of these additives, they're really,

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:41.740
really similar to each other.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.370
They have the same binder or really closely
related binders.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.630
They might have rheological modifiers.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.550
That sounds complicated, but just something
to change the flow ability, the brush ability

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.589
of your paint.

00:14:53.589 --> 00:15:01.290
And each one of these companies has their
own names and their own brands of different

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.399
approaches to cutting the viscosity of your
paint.

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:09.389
Another way to do it is actually just to add
a surfactant, like a little bit of alcohol,

00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:11.940
ethanol, which you can buy at the drug store.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.889
Just a little bit is going to cut the surface
tension of your paint, and really that's a

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:19.029
whole lot of what I think this question is
about.

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:23.850
So sorry there's not a super specific answer,
but, you know, if you're working with Golden

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.339
paints, or Liquitex, or what have you, explore
some of these different additives.

00:15:27.339 --> 00:15:30.330
And I really encourage you to, you know, get
a piece of masonite or a

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.920
canvas and do some paint outs, do some tests.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.100
So take a little bit of cadmium red and add
equal part of one additive, and then do the

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.010
same thing in another one, and another one,
another one, and then make the same brush

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.709
stroke down and start to get a feel for, ah,
the fluidity is much higher in this one but

00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:45.939
is much more translucent.

00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:46.939
Or this one is more opaque.

00:15:46.939 --> 00:15:52.680
Or this one has a body to it, is more kind
of a waxy kind of thickness to it.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.430
These days it's a nice time to be a painter
in the acrylic realm since there is a really

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:02.300
wide range of materials available to us.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.079
Live question from Cheryl Herndon here on
YouTube.

00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:10.430
"Can you get similar effects of matte and
glossy surfaces with H2 oils?"

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.269
Okay, yeah.

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:17.920
So H2 oils, this is just a brand name, but
these are the so-called water soluble, or

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.470
water miscible oil paints.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.579
First thing, it's a bit of a misnomer.

00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:24.300
Oils are not soluble in water.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.600
They're not really miscible either.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.540
These are emulsion paints, and before you
start getting freaked out, don't worry.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.170
Most acrylic paints are also emulsion paints.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.819
The so called water-soluble oils, it's just
a different binder in there.

00:16:36.819 --> 00:16:40.470
For me they still really feel plasticky.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.230
They are plastics, by the way.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.280
They have plastic components in them.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.740
So yeah, they look more like oil than acrylic,
emulsion paints do.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.420
But for me, the handling properties, I'm not
really convinced.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.160
Moreover they're relatively young.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.470
Someone can tell me exactly how long they've
been around but I want to guess, I don't know,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.540
15 years, something like that.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:08.420
And conservators studied these a bit, but
really the best way to understand the material

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.660
and its aging process is to, well, stick around
for 100 years.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.060
By the way, a lot of the early acrylic paintings
from the 60s, conservators like myself are

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.270
encountering some very strange problems that
some of them are having over time that we're

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.780
just learning about these days because they're
a ticking clock in a way.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.220
And certain things happen at certain times,
and we're learning that on-the-fly.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.600
So matte and glossy surfaces with water-soluble
oils.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.950
The medium there is quite glossy, so if you
want to reduce the gloss you want to reduce

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.620
the binder content, or increase the pigment-to-binder
ratio.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.640
One way to do that is that you can do what
the Impressionists did and squeeze out your

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.070
oil paint on to newspaper or onto cardboard.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.480
It'll soak up some of the medium, and what
you're left with is a thicker, drier paint,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.520
which will also dry with a much more matte
appearance.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.021
Also if you add more water to it you will
increase the viscosity, and as your paint

00:18:00.021 --> 00:18:04.720
is applied to an absorbent support like canvas,
more of that medium is going to follow the

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.630
water and get soaked into your priming, or
your canvas, or what have you.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:13.870
And again, the same kind of thing, pigment-to-binder
ratio goes up and you have a more matte appearance.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.770

Justin Worrell writes, "Have conservators
studied or reached any conclusions regarding

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.120
the integrity of water-soluble oil paints?"

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.100
I'm going to pass on this one since actually
we just took a live question about this.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.710
"Assuming I follow all the traditional rules,
fat over lean, proper ground, how many generations

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.830
of my family will get to enjoy my awesomely
mediocre paintings?"

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.830
We don't know is really the answer to that
one.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.850
If you're really concerned about the longevity
of your works, your awesomely mediocre paintings,

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.090
stick with oils, or stick with egg, or stick
with distemper.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.760
Stick with something that's been around for
hundreds of years, and we know the answer

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.250
to these questions.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.960
Acrylics might be fine.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.540
Water miscible oils might be fine, but I wouldn't
bet the farm on it.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.740
More likely when paintings of historic, and
frankly monetary value, get made in these

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.800
new media, conservators will get good and
the market will drive this pressure and make

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.880
sure that we keep them around in a way.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.410
But specifically what are the problems and
how bad are they going to be?

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:42.660
I think we're going to have to wait around
a little bit to really be sure.

You're very welcome.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.370
Really nothing makes me happier in this series
than I get comments like this that people

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:23.520
are either beginning to explore painting for
the first time or kind of reinvigorating their

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.520
painting process.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.950
Actually I got a note recently, a kind of
thank you note that someone said I was like

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.700
gasoline on a smoldering fire.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.620
I think that was meant as a compliment but
it took me a little while to figure it out.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.890
Jack Ready writes in the live Q&amp;A trailer
for this session, "Hi, Corey.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.260
Many of the artists I've been interested in
recently, including Basquiat and de Kooning,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.780
seem to take direct inspiration from their
peers and predecessors' work and make it their

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.780
own.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.410
Is there a fine line between imitation and
originality?"

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:57.210
Wow, a lot of artists have been pondering
these same ideas, perhaps none more so than

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:03.990
Marcel Duchamp, who basically made an entire
career out of this idea of questioning authenticity,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.630
originality concepts therein.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.900
But back to painting, yeah, many artists paint
their way through the master to the extent

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.420
available options to them.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.420
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.200
In fact, I think it's a really productive
way to work.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.460
As an artist if you're trying you know to
do something historically important to be

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:30.450
a serious artist, etc, if you're copying you
better understand the ramifications of that.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.810
The so-called Pictures Generation, largely
focus here in New York City in the 1980s and

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.470
'90s, Louise Lawler, Richard Prince, Jeff
Koons, and other artists really went back

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.460
to Duchamp and started thinking about, well,
what happens when you take a photograph of

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.620
a photograph?

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.450
Or if you make a painting that looks just
like another painting, except this one's done

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.330
by a woman and it's done in the 1990s.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.700
What's the meaning of this contextual shift
here?

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:00.670
And the answer is actually there's a lot of
interesting things that happen here, you know?

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:06.450
The old fable about, you know, someone who
likes Don Quixote so much that they wrote

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:11.920
it themselves to experience what Cervantes
would have experienced in writing the original

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.270
Quixote, Pedro Menard.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.121
But, you know, these kind of ideas have been
around for quite some time now in the 20th

00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:20.340
century now into the 21st.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.670
So all I'm recommending here is that if, you
know, you're painting through other artists'

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.990
work as a way to find your own voice, excellent,
a really productive way to do that.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:35.710
If you're copying other artists' work as your
own art, hit the books and understand some

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.690
of the rationale of other artists who have
done this kind of a thing, and figure out

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.140
where your ideas lie in there.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:47.420
And by the way, I'm sure this is not the the
last that we've heard of these kind of approaches.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.210
SpecialDoc: TryYourMedincine writes, "Why
not paint like yourself?"

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.090
Okay, related question here.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.390
There's no reason not to paint like yourself.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.790
In fact, even if you do try to rewrite Don
Quixote yourself you're not going to do it.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.910
It's going to be your own in certain ways.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.370
The experience of it will be quite subjective
and quite personal.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.460
I think that the flip side to this question
is, "Why paint like other artists?"

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:16.170
And we've touched on this as a way to understand
really the experience of a work, to understand

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:21.130
the process, to understand why things look
the way they do in, say, a Picasso painting.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.870
I hope some of you have tried your hand at
working in a Cubist style, and suddenly you'll

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:31.650
realize really, really quickly how cubism
progressed very methodically and very rationally

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.380
from one step to another.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.610
Because it's all about how the image relates
between what you're looking at in still life

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.750
and on a canvas, or then perhaps you skip
the still life altogether and further flattened

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.080
the pictorial space of that painting.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.820
One answer here is to learn art history, to
learn the history of painting by using your

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.380
hands and really sharpening the relationships
between what your eye tells you where you're

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.650
comfortable perhaps looking at paintings and
thinking about paintings with what your hand

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.000
tells you, which maybe you haven't done so
much of.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.240
And suddenly you'll have an understanding
why certain de Kooning's brush strokes look

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.590
the way they do, or start the way they do,
or stop with a crackle in the way they do.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:15.510
Because the quality of paint, because of the
kind of physical gesture that was responsible

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.740
for getting that paint there.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.560
So, you know, multiple answers here.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.030
One is to learn art history, two, to learn
how to paint, and I think many of us here

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.250
in this series of In the Studio works, I hope
you're doing both of those hand-in-hand.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:34.190
At least that's certainly my intentions.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:43.480
Alberto Arredondo on Twitter writes, "I'm
working in tempera grassa.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.030
First of all, tempera grassa is egg plus oil.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:52.590
This was a technique invented really in Italy
where there's a history of egg tempera painting.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:57.180
And then as oil painting moved in from the
north in the hands of Albrecht Durer and other

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.960
artists like that, artists like Raphael started
to mix the two as a kind of crutch to get

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.540
them towards true oil painting technique.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:11.070
So Alberto is working this technique on canvas
primed with gesso, lean to fat, reducing the

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:17.290
amount of water and increasing the oil each
layer until I have half oil, two volumes water.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.820
Thoughts on stability?"

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.300
Okay, so first thought on stability.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.290
Seems like an okay approach.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:31.070
I worry a little bit working with this medium,
tempera grassa, on a flexible support like

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.580
canvas.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.690
Oil is quite flexible, although it does get
more brittle with age.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.220
Acrylics are quite flexible and they also
get brittle with age.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.070
Egg tempera is quite brittle from the get-go,
and this is why when you go the Uffizi and

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:50.400
the great museums of the Italian old masters
you see them working on wood principally as

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.620
they're painting in egg, because that medium
is brittle.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.400
And on a flexible support like canvas, which
waves around as you're carrying it across

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:04.550
the room, or shrinking and expanding with
variations in relative humidity, etc, you're

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.710
going to run into some cracks and some flaking.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.410
Now tempera grassa, because there's some oil
mixed into the egg it does make it stronger.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.850
It does make it more flexible.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.110
If you're really concerned about the longevity
of these paints, I might consider working

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.160
on wood on panel rather than on canvas.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.360
That being said, I think your approach here,
working fat over lean, layer by layer by layer,

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:36.870
is a very thoughtful and very strong way to
encourage the stability of those works.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.130
From Instagram, fabulouschels writes, "Hi.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:44.250
I truly enjoyed the Coursera course and look
forward to more in-studio videos.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.160
Question is this, I've seen videos of a few
young professional artists mixing a large

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.780
amount of water with their acrylic paints.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.090
They pour water onto a stretched canvas laying
on the floor and mix a small amount of acrylic

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.810
paint into it, making a wash or watercolor-like
effect.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:02.410
Would a product like Golden's Absorbent Ground
prevent under binding when using this technique?

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.430
Or are their paintings doomed to flake off
in the future?"

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.750
So another question here about unorthodox
painting techniques and the physical ramifications

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.110
of them.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:15.151
Okay, so what happens here is that when you're
working in a stain with a lot of solvent,

00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:21.150
and this is true of oil paints, Magna paints,
the first acrylics, or Liquitex acrylic emulsion

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.350
type paints.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.320
When you're working in a stain you have that
fixed pigment-to-binder ratio.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.980
Comes out of the tube, what have you.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.340
But when you work with a lot of extra solvent
you're encouraging some of that medium to

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:38.030
migrate out of your paint as it dries and
into the ground, and or into the support.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:43.280
So the more absorbent the material that you're
painting on, the more of that binder is actually

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.520
going to make its way out of your paint.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.520
Now what this is going to do is it's going
to make a very matte surface.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.260
It's going to increase the opacity of your
paint.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.380
Maybe these are good things for you.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.510
Helen Frankenthaler, by the way, really explored
these ideas.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.960
I think we might do that in a future video.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.350
That being said, if too much of that happens
you may have drying cracks, the kind of thing

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.470
that we were talking about a little bit ago
in some of the works of Willem de Kooning

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.740
and many other artists.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.300
So if that is the case then yes, I'm afraid
if you're working with a truly under bound

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.660
paint surface it's going to be really fragile.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.020
It may flake off, etc.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:27.310
Working with a ground or a size adhesive to
seal that canvas is going to prevent a lot

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:31.460
of that soaking, or that seeping into the
canvas the same kind of way when you knock

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.930
over a glass of wine on a tablecloth.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:37.900
If you have kind of a plasticy tablecloth,
it's a shiny one that has adhesive into it,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.310
you know that wine is just going to kind of
bubble up and sit there until you clean it

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.310
up.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.840
If you have an old cotton tablecloth, or something
like silk, something like that wicking in,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840
right?

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.260
Same kind of idea is true of canvas.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.400
So again, the rule of thumb here, or really
your focus in answering these kind of questions

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.330
is the pigment-to-binder ratio.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.370
If it's really high, if it's excessive, your
paint is going to be quite weak, especially

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:04.480
if you're not locking it in with a fatter
layer on top, fat over lean approach to an

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.240
academic painting.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.650
Igor Sado, cool name, writes from the September
live Q&amp;A.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.410
"Currently following your course on Coursera."

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.410
Excellent.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.340
"That's how I found out about you and your
videos.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.340
I love them so much.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.850
I love Abstract Expressionism and I love MoMA,
which we currently have here in Paris near

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:22.850
my house.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.850
I'm not a painter per se.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.430
I'm a fashion designer and illustrator and
yet I find your tips very useful to my work."

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:34.390
Super glad to hear it, and I really like this
idea that some of the ideas that we explore

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:39.120
together in the Coursera course and some of
the In the Studio videos go in other directions,

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120
they inspire.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.080
One of my students mentioned that he's a composer
and some of the electronic music that he's

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.700
making really came out of a thing about Barnett
Newman and others, which I really loved.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.960
I just went to an event the other day and
a chef stopped me and said, "Oh, I know you."

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:58.100
And, you know, "Some of these these ideas,
I wonder if some of the painterly effects

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.650
could be explored in food, etc."

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.970
Sign me up.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:08.260
From today's live chat, Golnaz Farazi, another
cool name, writes, "Thanks for the awesome

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.260
online classes.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.760
Any suggestion on how to find a qualified
person to critique my artworks?"

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.760
Interesting.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.690
I don't know where you live, Golnaz, but artists
are everywhere.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.760
And doing studio visits, excuse me, studio
visits with other artists is a really good

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.950
way to get a critique of your own work, and
also for you to present your own work.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.390
It's one thing to make a painting and to look
at it.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.770
It's another thing to make a painting and
present it to your girlfriend, or wife, or

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.600
husband, or what have you.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.710
It's another thing to introduce it to another
artist, or to a stranger, or to an art critic,

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.010
or something like that.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.040
And suddenly you're making a sales pitch.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.810
And if this sounds kind of slimy, well, potentially
it is.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.600
But really the good side of this is that you're
focusing on your work.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.410
You're thinking about explaining what you're
trying to do, how to talk about it, how to

00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.150
frame your work for someone who's coming in
cold so that they can really understand what

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.150
you're doing.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.730
How to find these people?

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.630
Well, probably I think the Coursera course
is a great way to start.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.320
We have students from all over the world so
I'd encourage you to post there about where

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.550
you live and see if there's someone else in
the course who is local or semi-local.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:20.730
And certainly in the Coursera course there
is a lot of kind of inter-student critique

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:21.730
going on.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.370
Of course, this is dealing with JPEGs and
TIFFs, which as we found out in the course

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:30.380
are quite useful but not as good as the real
thing, paint in the flesh.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.120
But I think it's a really good way to get
started in this kind of process.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.620
Wish you all the best.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.940
Starsandink on Instagram writes, "Will oil,
protein, and water-based paints," protein-based

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.570
paint we're talking about egg, by the way,
egg tempera.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.930
"Will oil, protein, and water-based paints
apply to an acrylic-based ground, stand up

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.660
to time, or will they eventually delaminate?

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.250
Is it true that early oil painters used calcium
carbonate in their paints to make them more

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.250
paste-like?"

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.320
Okay, two kind of unrelated questions here.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.630
First one, can you work on an acrylic-based
ground for all these different kind of paints?

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.191
And thankfully, for us sometimes it's easy.

00:32:04.191 --> 00:32:06.360
The answer is yes.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.000
You can paint acrylic over an acrylic ground.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.490
You can paint oil over an acrylic ground.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.190
You can paint egg over an acrylic ground.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.440
They're all going to work.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.740
In fact, these days I really strongly recommend
working with an acrylic ground, regardless

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.980
of what kind of paint you're going to work
with over it.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.870
Because not only does it provide a nice seal
to the canvas, it also provides a flexible

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:30.650
kind of ground so that, again, if that canvas
waves around over time it's not prone to cracking

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:34.530
like a glue ground would be that's a hide
glue, an animal glue ground.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.630
Or an oil-based ground also could be over
time.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:42.320
So all of these things work but I think the
idea of working with an acrylic ground is

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320
a really good one.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.370
Again, it's nice to be a painter these days.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:50.550
"Is it true that early oil painters used calcium
carbonate in their paints," a kind of chalk,

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.610
"To make them more paste-like?"

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.670
Indeed, sometimes.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.110
Indeed, that's a white pigment.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:58.910
So some white oil paints principally use that
paint, and it also does make it more pastose,

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.380
or thick, more toothpaste-like.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.290
And certainly some artists deliberately did
that.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.730
By the way, you can do the same thing with
lead white, as Rembrandt and others did.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.530
So it's not that that's the only white pigment
out there that could do it, but it's a cheap

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:12.530
one, and another.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.010
There's really no reason not to.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.570
"No rubber gloves."

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:19.830
Frowning face.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.170
Okay, so let's talk about safety here.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:27.060
Oh, by the way, this comes from the video
on turpentine burns that Mark Rothko and others

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:31.780
did, taking a rag wet with solvent and scrubbing
back into the canvas.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:37.830
And this webberon, Ron maybe, is suggesting
between the lines here that you should wear

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.830
rubber gloves.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.750
Now if you're doing this every day I strongly
agree with you.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.670
If you're working with turpentine, turpentine
is a relatively strong solvent and it will

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.450
really, you know, dry out your hands, and
you'll crack your hands.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.540
And if you're working with toxic pigments,
not a great idea anyway, you run the risk

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.140
of quite serious things.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.870
First of all, I was working with just mineral
spirit, super low toxicity.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.010
And I don't do that every day.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.120
So is it a good idea to wear rubber gloves?

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.299
Yes, certainly.

00:34:03.299 --> 00:34:07.450
For many of you out there I think you'll find
though that working with rubber gloves feels

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.429
a little weird and uncreative, etc.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:11.429
I've gotten used to it as a conservator.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:12.820
We wear gloves all the time.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.179
But the first time you have a small brush
in your hand with a rubber glove it's going

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:17.960
to feel a little bizarre.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.010
So safety is really important, of course.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.419
Wearing rubber gloves if you're painting every
day.

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:28.450
If you're smearing paint all over your hands
every day, definitely a really good idea.

00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:32.490
If you're working with just a little mineral
spirits on a rag, you know, every once in

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:35.530
a while, I think I'm doing okay.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.530
But to each his own.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.750
Always safety is a good idea.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.179
PedestrianRage, whoa.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:43.450
It sounds like someone who doesn't like bikers
here in New York City.

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:45.559
Writes, "Absolutely love this new series.

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:47.259
It has turned me into a fan of abstract art.

00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:48.720
I used to lambaste it.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.349
Can you explore watercolor as a medium in
modern abstract art?"

00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:53.169
Yeah, that is a good idea.

00:34:53.169 --> 00:34:57.670
There's a lot of really interesting modern
watercolor artists.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.240
Cezanne made some wonderful watercolors.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.839
Marin here in New York City made some great
ones in the beginning of the 20th century.

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:08.579
My own background, I work with watercolors
a lot as a conservator for in-painting techniques.

00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:12.269
It's very reversible on a lot of kind of paintings.

00:35:12.269 --> 00:35:16.190
In my own work I haven't really worked with
watercolor that much but I'd be happy to explore

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.490
it and demonstrate a couple of the key ideas.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:22.570
Maybe we can find someone better than I am
in watercolor to do that kind of thing.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:27.780
I think it's a good idea.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.220
From the YouTube video on how to paint like
Picasso and Georges Braque, that's the cubist

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.859
video, Pam writes, "This is such an interesting
video.

00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:36.589
Would the style work with watercolor?"

00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:39.190
A similar kind of question.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.190
Absolutely.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:45.930
Picasso and Braque, to my understanding anyway,
they did work in in water-based paints but

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.119
more in studies, more in sketches, more in
preparatory kind of works.

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:56.220
By the way, for 1907's Demoiselles d'Avignon,
the great early cubist Picasso masterwork

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.930
which is in the collection here at the Modern,
there are some really interesting preparatory

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.880
sketches, Google them, you'll find them, for
that great painting.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.250
And we can see how Picasso was thinking about
that composition and how he changed it quite

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:13.869
radically, in fact, as he approached that
really watershed moment in the early 20th

00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:14.869
century.

00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:15.869
Absolutely.

00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:19.250
There's no reason why you couldn't paint a
Cubist work in watercolor.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:23.759
The big difference here is that your paints
are going to be quite translucent.

00:36:23.759 --> 00:36:28.220
And as I hope I convinced you in the video,
a whole lot of cubism is about compressing

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:35.230
pictorial space, or flattening that illusionistic
volume of old master painting.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.079
And a lot of that is done in very opaque paints.

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:42.130
In fact, almost all the paints I applied to
that that Picasso type painting were quite

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.130
opaque.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:44.690
So if you work in watercolor everything is
going to be translucent.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:48.319
It's going to be more challenging for you
to really get the same kind of density and

00:36:48.319 --> 00:36:53.279
opacity in your composition, but maybe you'll
find some really interesting avenues forward.

00:36:53.279 --> 00:36:57.890
Personally I wonder if that's one of the reasons
that Picasso and Braque didn't work so much

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:05.029
in watercolor for finished works, but I'm
just speculating here.

00:37:05.029 --> 00:37:09.410
Also from the Picasso video, "Cool, though
the blue dots seem a bit sloppy."

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:10.840
You know, it's funny.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.319
This is modestroker1, nice name.

00:37:13.319 --> 00:37:17.630
Personally I live with this painting now,
it's on the wall in my house.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.710
And I go back and forth on this.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:24.089
Sometimes I really like that and other times
I kind of agree with the writer here that

00:37:24.089 --> 00:37:26.119
they do seem a little sloppy.

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:29.869
Sometimes the sloppiness of a cubist painting
is really interesting, though.

00:37:29.869 --> 00:37:35.150
In tension with all those lines and all the
grammar of geometry, etc, to have the kind

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.170
of manual imprecision in there is quite nice.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:41.440
I think, you know, this is something that
Picasso would agree with.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.299
If you look at Picasso's neoclassical works
or his Blue Period works, or his academic

00:37:45.299 --> 00:37:47.839
works early on in this life, man, that guy
could paint.

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:52.900
But then you look at some of his paintings
in the teens and the 20s and they're aggressively

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.950
clumsy, and aggressively ugly.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:59.370
And even some of the really gorgeous, to my
eye, Cubist paintings, he's working with this

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:06.410
really lumpy, stiff, staccato kind of brushstroke,
which is a little bit, you know, lumpy, and

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.930
bumpy, and gross looking.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:12.190
It's deliberate, in other words, and it's
further announcing the kind of lumpiness,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.750
the flatness, the two dimensionality of the
painting.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.849
Okay, it's three-dimensional, they're lumps.

00:38:17.849 --> 00:38:21.569
But really reducing that illusionism behind
the picture plane.

00:38:21.569 --> 00:38:26.089
Long way to say it's crossed my mind to clean
them up a couple times but I'm not quite sure.

00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:32.350
Again, oil painting is quite forgiving, so
if I did decide sometime that I agree with

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:37.200
the writer here, simply working with a small
brush, a little bit of, I believe, white background

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.279
there, an opaque white, like a titanium-white,
or something like that, can just kind of clean

00:38:41.279 --> 00:38:47.140
up the edges of them to refine them into more
clean polka dots, that's certainly something

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.589
that could be done anytime.

00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:54.230
Question from Madeline today here on the live
chat.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.640
"Do you have any information on the preservation
and maintenance of wax and caustic paintings?

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.440
Are encaustic paintings able to be preserved
for many years, or will they crack and melt

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.440
over time?"

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.770
Okay, so encaustic.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.630
I don't think we talked about this much in
the course.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:11.350
The most famous 20th century artist who is
sometimes said to work in encaustic is Jasper

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.400
Johns, working here in New York City.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.520
Johns actually did not work in encaustic.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.069
He mixed oil into wax, which is really not
encaustic, excuse me, painting.

00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:22.830
Encaustic is just pigment in wax.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:28.559
The Egyptians painted in encaustic an incredibly
long time ago.

00:39:28.559 --> 00:39:32.210
Encaustic is a stable medium if handled correctly.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:37.800
It does require a non-flexible support, like
a wall, or a piece of wood, a panel, something

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.900
like that.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.680
And in that kind of situation they shouldn't
crack overtime.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.859
However, will they melt over time?

00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:45.859
You better believe it.

00:39:45.859 --> 00:39:51.520
If it gets really warm they certainly will
liquify a little bit on the surface and get

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.520
shiny.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.030
Or if it got really hot it could be dripping
down as well.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.110
It is wax.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:01.240
There are different kinds of wax, beeswax
microcrystalline wax, which tends to be a

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.309
little softer, lower melting point, and more
prone to melting.

00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:08.570
But yes, certainly if you're working on a
Jasper Johns, or if you have a Jasper Johns,

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.349
or a Brice Marden with wax in your apartment,
first of all, lucky you.

00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:15.730
But yeah, be careful about the temperature
in the summer time, please.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:21.410
Robert Baker, III writes, "Why do artists
stretch their own canvas?

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.299
Is there something less valuable about a painting
on a factory-stretched canvas?

00:40:25.299 --> 00:40:27.859
When purchasing a pre-stretched canvas, what
should you look for?

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:29.160
Sorry about the three-part question."

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160
Not at all.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.829
Why do artists stretch their own canvas?

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:35.599
A few different reasons.

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:40.030
One possible reason, my own reason is that
I don't like to buy something ready-made at

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.529
the store and then put something on it.

00:40:41.529 --> 00:40:44.730
It feels rather decorative and feels rather
impersonal to me.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.680
Totally subjective personal answer here.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.460
I like building something myself and starting
to get a relationship with that object from

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.460
the get-go.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.109
Now you can say, "Oh, but, you know, if you
really feel that way you should cut the tree

00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:56.869
down and saw the stretcher bars, etc."

00:40:56.869 --> 00:40:58.640
By the way, some artists do that.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.180
I don't go that far.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.339
So that's one possible reason.

00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:06.799
Another one is that, for me personally, I
want to know what is on there.

00:41:06.799 --> 00:41:09.350
I want to trust those materials.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.109
And whereas you might think, "Well, what's
the big deal?"

00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:14.210
Sometimes it is a big deal.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:18.180
I'm not going to mention specific names, but
there's a certain line of canvases, which

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:23.180
were used by some important artists by the
way, that paint just didn't stick to after

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.180
10 years.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.859
And the reason why is that this commercial
canvas maker applied some kind of a sealant

00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:32.640
on top of the primer so it looks shiny, and
glossy, and clean, and made you want to buy

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.650
it off the shelf, except paint started to
delaminate on it over time.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:41.940
You can imagine if you're an artist who made
a entire body of work on that canvas that

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:46.059
you bought from the store you're pretty upset
about that, and certainly there are artists

00:41:46.059 --> 00:41:47.480
out there who are.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:53.569
If you do work on a commercially-primed canvas,
my own suggestion here, just to make sure

00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:58.630
that is not going to happen to you, take some
sandpaper and sand through whatever the surface

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:02.619
coating that may be on there and make sure
that it's really truly absorbent and your

00:42:02.619 --> 00:42:05.720
paint is going to get some tooth into the
ground there.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.760
"When purchasing a pre-stretched canvas, what
should you look for?"

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.589
Now it's really up to you.

00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:15.130
If it's a reputable vendor, and certainly
there are plenty out there, you want to think

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:17.660
about the thread count of the canvas.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.140
Should it be rough?

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.010
Should it be smooth?

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.850
Single prime, double prime, triple primed.

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:23.850
How thick?

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:28.251
And, you know, if you're sanding a triple-primed
canvas you can make it super smooth, whereas

00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:34.740
a single prime canvas you're going to be still
picking up some of the warps and the wefts,

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.440
the textile surface of the threads there.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.549
So this is really now about the appearance
of your work over time.

00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:46.480
Happy painting, Robert.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.730
Argendiego writes, "Hi, Corey.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.250
I stretched my canvas and primed it.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.380
The tension was excellent, but after painting
on it with oils and using a spatula, or pallette

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.690
knife, the canvas lost its tension.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.150
The surface moves like jelly, yikes.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.150
Could you give me some tips?

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.150
Thanks."

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.609
Okay, so this often happens if you're putting
a lot of pressure on the canvas during your

00:43:03.609 --> 00:43:04.980
painting process.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.410
Pallet knives will often do this, or if you're
really violent with your work and, you know,

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:13.700
hacking and slashing de Kooning style perhaps
you might do this as well.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.339
A couple answers here.

00:43:16.339 --> 00:43:20.589
If you've already done that, hopefully you're
working on a stretcher and not a strainer.

00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:24.299
Watch the videos in the Coursera course for
the difference there.

00:43:24.299 --> 00:43:28.680
But a stretcher you can key out the corners,
and the cross bar, etc, to

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.900
supply an increased tension in certain regions
of the canvas where you might have a little

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:39.799
beer belly, or what Argendiego writes as a
jelly kind of loss of tautness, or loss of

00:43:39.799 --> 00:43:41.790
tension in the canvas.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:47.210
So that's the entire idea behind those keyable,
expandable stretchers is that you can get

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:49.480
some of that tension back if that happens.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.740
Or, by the way, if you have a fireplace, and
you're in a cold day like today, New York.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.900
You burned a couple logs.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.749
The humidity went way down, and then your
canvas had a little bit of a lack of tension

00:43:58.749 --> 00:43:59.980
again.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.559
So that's one idea.

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:06.011
Another idea if you're going to be working
with pallet knives, etc, is that maybe you

00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:07.180
don't want to stretch it first.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.859
Maybe, in fact, you want to take that canvas
and staple it directly onto a wall that you're

00:44:11.859 --> 00:44:12.859
going to paint on.

00:44:12.859 --> 00:44:16.369
And this way, here's the wall, when you're
scraping on it you're not actually flexing

00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:20.450
the canvas because there's a wall behind it,
and you're getting a nice firm resistance.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:25.440
When the painting is done and when it's dry
then you can stretch that canvas over stretcher

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440
bars.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.921
In the late
work by Philip Guston, he worked that way.

00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:31.559
By the way, de Kooning worked that way a lot
of times, too.

00:44:31.559 --> 00:44:37.200
And that approach has another potential benefit
that you can kind of decide the dimensions

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.780
of the canvas after you paint it.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.499
You can crop out an area.

00:44:40.499 --> 00:44:44.420
Gustin, if you look at his work from the '70s,
often had a pencil line of a big rectangle

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.579
where he thought the canvas would be, but
then sometimes actually it grew as he worked

00:44:48.579 --> 00:44:49.579
with a composition.

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:52.990
Or sometimes it actually shrunk and he, you
know, ended up folding over part of the canvas,

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.220
the pencil line is actually on the back of
the painting now.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.980
At any rate, a lot of really good artists
have used that approach.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.990
You might give it a shot.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:07.170
Nina Shukaylo writes, "I really love fantastic
International Klein Blue, IKB."

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:11.579
This is kind of blue paint that the French
painter Yves Klein developed and actually

00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:12.640
patented in France.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.420
"Do you know if it's possible to purchase
the pigment or how to substitute it if not?"

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.990
Actually you're asking the right person because
when I used to work here in the conservation

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:24.539
department at MoMA I did a lot of research
on Yves Klein and a really important painting

00:45:24.539 --> 00:45:27.829
of his and the collection here.

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:31.470
The pigment that he worked with is synthetic,
or French ultramarine.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.809
That's widely available all over the world.

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:38.730
And, in fact, for a long time it was thought
that there was just one blue and only one

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:44.789
store in Montparnasse in Paris that sold just
the right pigment.

00:45:44.789 --> 00:45:47.690
But actually I found out that the pigment
that is sold there today isn't exactly the

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:50.210
same one as what he was working with anyway.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:54.090
So it's less about the pigments than it is
about the paint.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.490
IKB, International Klein Blue, is a combination
of a polyvinyl acetate.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.990
That's a kind of synthetic resin, a little
bit like acrylic.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:06.210
And the solvents are really important, working
with ethanol, that's alcohol, and ethyl acetate,

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.740
some acetone.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:14.800
And depending on the formulation of the paint,
something that's either brushable, or rollerable,

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.670
rollable or sprayable, etc.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:23.039
By the way Klein died in his 30s and he wasn't
particularly worried about some of the health

00:46:23.039 --> 00:46:24.220
risks of these materials.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.260
I hope you are, please.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:32.809
At any rate, the short answer here is IKB,
it's less about the pigment, get some synthetic

00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:36.540
ultramarine and you'll be happy, than it is
about the paint itself.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.630
And maybe we can tackle this in an In the
Studio sometime.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.630
Get some Europeans in the mix.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:45.859
That could be quite interesting.

00:46:45.859 --> 00:46:51.700
Miss Telly today on YouTube writes, "Please
be this generation's Bob Ross."

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.799
I'd be happy to.

00:46:52.799 --> 00:46:56.480
I think a lot of you know Bob Ross and his
happy little clouds.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.769
You can find them on YouTube also.

00:46:57.769 --> 00:47:03.150
Bob Ross is just a hero of mine, and many,
many painters out there.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:06.750
His paintings, maybe they're not the most
sophisticated and beautiful works, but, man,

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.960
it's just nice to listen to that guy talk.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.760
So if you have the same relationship to some
of my videos, I'm flattered.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:17.869
Believe it or not, years ago, 20 years ago
for Halloween I went to a party as Bob Ross

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:20.690
once, so maybe it's fate.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:26.690
From the Agnes Martin video, Bruno Galvan
writes, "You're the cool sequel of Bob Ross."

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:30.559
Hey, Bob Ross was pretty cool, so I take offense.

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:33.720
Soul Izanami writes, "Dude looks like Drake's
uncle."

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.630
Dude, I'm not old enough to be his uncle.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:38.630
Please.

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:39.630
C.S.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.730
Imming - "Hey, Corey.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.019
Still use your info from the abstract expressionism
class.

00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:45.989
Think of you often tell others about the classes.

00:47:45.989 --> 00:47:48.440
Still have my painting of you when I gave
you de Kooning teeth."

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.690
I remember that one, too.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.369
"Watching the videos again and hope you do
more."

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.470
I'm not going to post that.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.599
I can only imagine what kind of comment it
would get.

00:47:56.599 --> 00:48:01.170
Jen Egelnick writes, "I have the nerdiest
fangirl crush on this guy."

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.450
Jen, first drink's on me.

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:10.349
Okay, and let's move onto some requests.

00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:13.290
A lot of requests for artists to cover in
the course.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:18.109
Sorry, not the course but in the In the Studio
series on which we're continuing this spring,

00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:19.280
most likely with two episodes.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.960
Do stay tuned for those.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.520
Jay Colvin a couple weeks ago writes, "How
to paint like Basquiat?"

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.911
In fact, if you spend a little bit of time
in the comments sections of many of these

00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:32.299
videos I think Basquiat is winning this competition
for most requested.

00:48:32.299 --> 00:48:33.299
I would love to.

00:48:33.299 --> 00:48:37.609
I think Basquiat is a really interesting artist,
has a really interesting set of materials

00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:41.329
that he kinda went back to, although he was
quite diverse.

00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:42.609
My opinion is not the only one.

00:48:42.609 --> 00:48:46.220
It's quite complicated to make these videos,
and there's more than a couple other voices

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.010
that need to weigh in here.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:53.900
But trust me, Basquiat remains on the table
and I hope we can do that sometime.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.150
Helen Frankenthaler, another one I think we
might tackle.

00:48:56.150 --> 00:49:01.190
Frankenthaler, a New York School painter inspired
by Jackson Pollock, and so many of those artists

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.940
were, who stained the canvas on the floor
rather than dripping on it.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.279
We might check out some of her work soon.

00:49:07.279 --> 00:49:15.549
Mary Thompson writes, "I'd love to see episodes
on Frida Kahlo, Mary Cassatt, Georgia O'Keeffe."

00:49:15.549 --> 00:49:18.730
Yeah, Impressionism, post-Impressionism we
could definitely do a video on.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:20.259
Frida Kahlo, interesting.

00:49:20.259 --> 00:49:25.749
Frida was very interested in and influenced
by le tableau painting.

00:49:25.749 --> 00:49:30.630
That's indigenous Mexican kind of folk painting
techniques, often in, but not exclusively,

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.220
in the Catholic tradition in recent centuries.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:39.340
But Kahlo really used that vernacular in a
modern sensibility, and I think that could

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.340
be quite interesting.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.660
Georgia O'Keeffe had a really delicate hand.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.880
She was a really subtle and really beautiful
painter.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:50.940
She didn't use materials or techniques that
were all that idiosyncratic but she just refined

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.869
them to an extreme degree.

00:49:52.869 --> 00:49:54.039
Would be definitely worth our time.

00:49:54.039 --> 00:49:57.279
"You should do a video exploring Gerhard Richter's
abstract painting style."

00:49:57.279 --> 00:49:58.750
I'd be happy to.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.890
By the way, there's a great documentary recently
on Gerhard Richter where you can watch Richter

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.739
doing Richter paintings, which obviously would
be much better than mine.

00:50:05.739 --> 00:50:10.789
But he doesn't really talk you through them
as I might, so another good idea.

00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:16.930
Philip Guston, Richard Diebenkorn, Joan Mitchell,
Italian Futurism, a whole lot of great ideas

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.130
here.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.410
We definitely do pay attention to these, so
please keep them coming.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:25.040
In a way we're, you know, keeping score a
little bit about interests.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.619
But it's also great to say, "Oh yeah, Italian
Futurism video.

00:50:27.619 --> 00:50:30.690
That could be really interesting building
on the cubism video."

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:32.569
So some some great ideas here.

00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:34.880
Thanks for those.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:39.780
A couple more live requests, Jasper Johns,
van Gogh, Richter, Richard Pousette-Dart who

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.249
was a French painter living here in New York
City in the 1950s.

00:50:43.249 --> 00:50:46.130
These are all good ideas from the today's
live stream.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:51.049
And by the way, super cool, among other places,
people in the audience today from here in

00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:54.280
New York City, but from Germany, Algeria,
India, Bahrain, Columbia, Bulgaria, Brazil.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.869
I think that's pretty cool.

00:50:55.869 --> 00:50:59.049
I don't think you need me to tell you that.

00:50:59.049 --> 00:51:03.789
At any rate I want to thank everyone for great
questions and comments today.

00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:07.890
Do want to let you know that we'll have a
couple of these episodes coming up, another

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:12.329
Q&amp;A probably coming up this spring or early
summer.

00:51:12.329 --> 00:51:16.319
Also for those of you who are New York-based,
or Jersey-based, or what have you, I want

00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:22.080
to let you know that I'm teaching a painting
studio class here at the Museum, which starts

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.080
in just a few weeks.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.480
There are a couple slots open for that.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.339
We're going to be tackling pop art, Andy Warhol,
Lichtenstein, artists like that.

00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:30.970
The class is pretty cool, you know?

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:34.790
We spend a lot of time up in the galleries
here at MoMA when the museum is closed, so

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:38.259
I hope you learn a lot from me but you'll
definitely get your money's worth just seeing

00:51:38.259 --> 00:51:42.940
paintings in the flesh with me without any
other distractions around you, etc.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.609
So you can find out more about that on moma.org.

00:51:44.609 --> 00:51:46.640
Please check it out.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.660
If we didn't get your questions in the video
today we'll try to answer them in text in

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.920
the comments section afterwards, and of course
in our next Q&amp;A.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.749
Stay tuned for that.

00:51:56.749 --> 00:52:03.480
So yeah, keep sending questions, subscribe
down below so you don't miss our next release.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.400
And thanks again for watching In the Studio.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.470
Look forward to seeing you next time.
