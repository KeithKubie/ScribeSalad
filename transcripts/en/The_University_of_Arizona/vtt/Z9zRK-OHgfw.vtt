00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.500
Good evening, Tucson.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.515
My name is Joaquin Ruiz.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.720
I'm the Dean of the
College of Science.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.434
And I thank you so much, all of
you, for coming here tonight.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.470
Many of you have been with
us for many of these lecture

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.980
series.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.759
But I have to remind you that
today is the 10th anniversary

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.310
of these lecture series.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.890
And importantly, what everybody
should recognize in this room

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.820
is that although I
think we've helped

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.730
create some kind of
community through the lecture

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.270
series, which we're very
proud of, all of you

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.510
have also helped
create a community

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.700
within the University of
Arizona, just by the way

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.870
that we create these lectures.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.960
Just to give you a sense
of how it all works out,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.349
there's a little group
that sits down one day.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.160
And they say OK, what's
the next lecture series?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.700
My god, I don't know, we're
running out of themes.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.850
And somebody will come
up with a theme that

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.650
sounds like it's reasonable.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.310
And then we pick up our
Rolodex, and we call faculty

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.750
from the university to say
will you give a lecture.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.290
And then they'll get
together, and they themselves

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.150
create the lecture
series as you know it.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.590
And if I could do anything that
would be truly extraordinary

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.330
is to be able to film the deep
conversations of the speakers

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.350
as they're creating the
lecture series for you.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.920
So they are the
ones that deserve

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.700
a great round of applause.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.690
Because all we do is come up
with a theme and sort of duck

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.610
after that.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.160
Because this is the
10th anniversary,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.770
we felt that it had to be
something that was truly unique

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.410
and that would be memorable.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.009
And of course, we've had many
memorable and unique lecture

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.570
series.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.990
We've had evolution
of the brain.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.200
We've had cosmology.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.070
We've had genomics.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.860
Each one of those full of
mystery and full of things

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.040
we don't know.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.930
And the hope of all of
us in the lectures and me

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.560
is that by the time you
hear all these lectures,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.180
you know about as
much as everybody

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.690
that's giving the lectures.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.190
Perhaps without the
mathematics and all

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.770
these other little things.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.590
But that you understand
all the grand challenges

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.400
and that you really sort of
get a sense of what we know.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.870
I hope we're good at that.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.370
I hope that we give you
lectures that stretch you,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.950
that don't bore you.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.810
And that in the end,
spark your imagination

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.500
about what amazing things are
being discovered by all of us.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.210
This lecture series is
on life in the universe.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.630
What could be more
stretching than that?

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.380
Are we alone?

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.080
Are we not?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.880
What does that mean
in a cosmological way?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.380
What does that mean
in a biological way?

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.960
And we have for you what I think
is an extraordinary lecture

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.920
series.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.810
It has a couple of biologists.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.800
I will tell you because,
in fact, what we

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.600
are is planet-centric.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.480
And what is it
that we're actually

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.320
looking for in other planets?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.880
What do we understand about
life in our own planet?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.140
And then the rest
of the speakers

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.450
will spend their time
trying to convince you

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.070
that the science that they're
doing is worth something.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.240
And that they know what
they're looking for.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.510
And that maybe they
will find something.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.320
Today's lecture is
perhaps the key lecture

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.180
in the whole lecture series.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.040
Because Guy Consolmagno, brother
Guy, is going to try to define

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.790
what life is.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.514
And if you're trying to find
something somewhere else,

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:01.930
you might as well
know what you're

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.950
trying to find if
you're going to find it.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.480
So that's what this
lecture is about.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.790
But before I
introduce brother Guy,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.170
I would like to thank the
sponsors of this lecture series

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.649
that really have made it
possible for all of us

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.650
to be in this room
for 10 years in a row.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.150
And the two main
folks that have been

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.190
giving a substantial
amount of cash to make us

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.350
make this all free
for the rest of us

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.420
is Tucson Electric Power
and Ventana Medical Systems.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.050
And I thank them for being the
lead sponsors of the lecture

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.550
series.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.092
And the other amazing
partner in all of this--

00:04:50.092 --> 00:04:51.550
if it wasn't for
them, you probably

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.383
wouldn't even know what
we're trying to do--

00:04:53.383 --> 00:04:55.340
and that is the
Arizona Daily Star.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.880
They have been just absolutely
incredible in trying

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.030
to work with us to
make sure you all

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.142
know that this is happening.

00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:09.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.760
Blue Cross Blue Shield.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.710
The Galileo Circle,
which are friends

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.330
of the College of Science,
Godat Design-- all these designs

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.390
that you see here
are from Godat.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.500
Holualoa Companies, Hugh and
Allyn Thompson, the Marshall

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.530
Foundation, Miraval
Resort and Spa, Raytheon,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.210
Research Corporation
for Science Advancement,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.050
and Vantage West Credit
Union are the other folks

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.380
that have been supporting us
handsomely for all these years.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.630
And I thank you.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.640
And I ask you all to
help me thank them.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.930
Now let me tell a
little bit about Guy.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:58.880
I urge you all to
Google Guy and Colbert.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.220
I think that's
all I have to say.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.340
And I don't think
I've ever seen anybody

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.080
in The Colbert Report that
actually made Colbert crack up

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.720
and be speechless.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.900
So we're in for a
treat with brother Guy.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.230
Brother guy got his
Ph.D. At the University

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.540
of Arizona in the Department
of Planetary Sciences.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.160
His main interest is in
small celestial objects

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.060
and how they work
within the solar system.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.120
So he looks at
asteroids and so on.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.490
He is the president of the
Vatican Observatory Foundation.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.340
The Vatican Observatory
has an observatory

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.960
in Mount Graham next to the
large binocular telescope.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.860
I'm sure if you ask brother
Guy, he'll take you up there

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.890
and show you the
beautiful telescope.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.220
He's written more than 200
articles, scientific articles.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.840
He has a bunch of
books on Outreach.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.350
This year, he was
awarded the Carl Sagan

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.410
Award in Outreach and Science.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.260
Quite an honor for astronomy.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.010
He's just sort of amazing.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.140
After Guy got his
Ph.D. here, he went

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.400
to sort of more mediocre places
to continue his research.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.480
He went to Harvard,
and he went to MIT.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.540
And after that-- he felt that
since they didn't have anything

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.160
to offer-- he went to Kenya
to join the Peace Corps.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.030
And after Kenya, he went
to the American Siberia.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.950
And he went to
Pennsylvania to teach.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.910
That made him a Jesuit.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.250
And he joined the
order after that.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.640
So I give you father
Guy Consolmagno.

00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:51.192
Thank you.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.440
Once again, it's a
delight to be back

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.020
in an auditorium
which I only remember

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.310
as a student for
having jazz bands.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.095
I'm hoping that I'll be
almost as entertaining.

00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:08.220
And it's an interesting
topic they've put up there.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.580
What is life?

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.620
Now, life is nice.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.570
Life is good.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.890
But it's not really
down to earth, you know?

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:18.920
And I'm a geologist.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.100
I like to be down to earth.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.140
This is the kind of
stuff I'm interested in.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.570
It's plagioclase.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.060
Now, plagioclase is one
of these minerals that

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.940
appears in almost
all of the meteorites

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.840
that I study in my geology lab.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.240
It's an essential part of
a lot of the rocks that we

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.140
have I mean, granted, we take
it for granted sometimes.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.108
But in fact that's basalt.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.030
But the great thing
about plagioclase

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.355
is not only can it be beautiful
with these lovely colors

00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:54.230
and these lovely different
shapes and forms--

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.521
and now the geologists are
going to say, wait a minute,

00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:58.660
some of those are
orthoclase, not plagioclase.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.130
So we should really define
what is plagioclase.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.270
That's as essential
thing to know.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:09.280
Plagioclase actually has an
important role in human life.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.680
It's the active
ingredient in the cleanser

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.350
that we use to
clean your things.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.933
How could we live
without plagioclase?

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.640
So I suggest that
I would really like

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.890
to explore the chemistry
of plagioclase,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.510
the incredibly complicated
chains and cages

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.910
of the plagioclase
which is formed

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.790
by these little
tetrahedral of silicone.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.630
They've got four
oxygens on the outside.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.395
And then they
surround the cations.

00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:39.770
And depending on
the cations, you

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.936
can get the different kinds.

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:43.500
And the crystal can grow
bigger and bigger and bigger

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.550
as the larva gets
more and more--

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.400
It's fascinating.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.910
It's so fascinating
that in fact, I

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.350
think I'm going to
change the theme of this

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:56.080
to plagioclase in the universe.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.630
Today, we'll talk about
what is plagioclase.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.920
And after we've determined
that, planet formation

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.110
and the origin of plagioclase.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.250
Very important stuff.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.320
It's such a beautiful mineral.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.640
Did it just happen by chance?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480
Complexity.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.650
And evolv-- what makes
plagioclase so interesting?

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.650
Hunting for plagioclase
in the sola--

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.790
there was a space probe
that went to asteroid Vesta.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.540
I could tell you all
about asteroid Vesta.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.040
Half of the rocks on the
surface of asteroid Vesta

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.710
are made of plagioclase.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.980
Amazing discoveries!

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.090
We're now thinking that there's
a billion planets that may have

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.445
plagioclase on their surface.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:51.050
This would be a-- I
get the impression

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.780
that if we had a seven
part series on plagioclase

00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:00.390
in the universe, we might
not draw the same crowd that

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.000
came tonight.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.510
I gotta admit, I gotta admit.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.580
This is an important
thing to remember.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.260
If you're going to define life
in terms of its chemistry,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.250
if it's long chain molecules,
of its beautiful structures

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.950
and forms, you're going to
have to keep asking yourself,

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.280
is this really what makes
life interesting enough

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.190
to have a seven part series.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.330
And if we come up
with a definition that

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.910
is no better than
plagioclase, then we've

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.730
missed something
essential about what

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:42.120
makes life fascinating
and important to us.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.850
So let's drink to life.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:53.650
I was once a rabbi-- in the
MIT production of Fiddler

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.340
on the Roof.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.300
When you ask what
is life, you can

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.100
ask the philosophical
question, what

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.970
gives me the fullness of life.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.190
In other words, what
is at the center

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:18.650
of what life is that makes
life interesting to me.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.560
The philosophy
question is concerned

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.230
not so much with distinguishing
life from non-life,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.130
but from actually figuring
out what life itself is.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.460
The scientific question,
on the other hand,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.690
might be more what are the
criteria I can use to determine

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.316
life from non-life.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.870
I went to a book,
Biogenesis by Norm Lahav.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.860
Theories of life's origin.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.470
And in the center, he has
48 different definitions

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.877
of life dating to the
middle of the 19th century.

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:58.710
We're going to take a
look at some of those.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.460
But before I do, I
want to remind you

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.780
that there are three different
kinds of definitions.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.770
All of them important,
all of them different,

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.670
all of them hopeless.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.010
The boundary definition that's
a life, that's not life,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.830
there is the boundary.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.290
Well, I think
that's pretty easy.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.956
Life is anything that
occurs on a planet

00:13:26.956 --> 00:13:29.410
rather than a dwarf
planet, right?

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.750
Those of you who fought the
Pluto wars will get the joke.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.305
It's easier to define
what's a planet

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:38.050
and what's not a
planet sometimes

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.720
than to divine what's
life and what's not life.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.010
The central question
is what is it

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.430
at its core that makes
life something that we're

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.620
going to have a packed
house for seven weeks trying

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.920
to figure out what it is.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.970
But for the scientists looking
for life in the universe,

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.780
the much more
practical question is

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.660
what's the gizmo we can
build that will give us

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.520
a yes or no answer that
everyone will believe?

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.660
Now, we've got Carl
Sagan here next

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.720
to a model of the Viking Lander.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.400
Viking landed on Mars in 1976.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.030
And it had three
experiments that

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.660
were going to look for life.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.840
Four, actually.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.390
Because Carl
insisted it also had

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.200
to have a camera, in case any,
you know, silicon giraffes

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.810
walked by.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.700
I won't go into the
details of the experiments

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.780
except to say that when
they got the results back,

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.530
they knew that if
they got this result,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.290
it would mean there was
some life on the surface.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.760
If they got that
result, it would

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.343
mean there was no
life on the surface.

00:14:39.343 --> 00:14:42.810
And instead, they
got a third result.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.790
Because they had made too many
assumptions about what life

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.130
would do, and they had
built their experiments

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.690
to look for what they
were looking for.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.920
The philosophers of science
say that every experiment

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.600
is theory laden.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.670
You do the experiment
knowing ahead

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.604
of time what the answer
ought to look like.

00:15:00.604 --> 00:15:01.270
And you have to.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.895
Because otherwise, how would you
know the answer if you saw it?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.940
But this has been an issue
in trying to figure out

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.990
how to search for life ever
sense we've been thinking

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.830
of searching for life.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.560
Now, I mentioned
the 48 descriptions.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.180
Here's a couple of them
I want to share with you.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.830
The vital forces are
molecular forces.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.190
It's TH Huxley.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.490
Huxley and Darwin--
well, let's just

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.020
say if you ever saw the Marx
brothers where they're out

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.740
of college, the
two colleges were

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.210
Darwin College
and Huxley College

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.448
and they were the big rivals.

00:15:41.448 --> 00:15:43.590
1868, that's important.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:48.470
Because this is the time when
most of science is convinced

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.017
that Newtonian physics has
the answers to everything.

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:52.600
There was a great
physicist who should

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.260
have known better, who
once said all of science

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.950
is either physics
or stamp collecting.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.720
But the vital forces--
there was a theory

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.330
going around that
said that there was

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.630
some kind of-- called vitalism.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.120
And that there was some magic
force that created life.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.040
And Huxley saying
no, the only force

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.180
that's happening
inside a living entity

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.300
are the forces in the
molecules themselves.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.400
This is the height of
the mechanistic view

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.910
of the universe.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.840
It's a very Victorian view.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.000
It's a very naive view.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.250
It's the view most
biologists have.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.136
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.480
And thus Browning,
a year later, could

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.335
say there is no boundary
between life and non-life.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.920
Now for the Marxists
in this room,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.430
Frederick Engels
points out that death

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.340
is an essential factor in life.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.770
If you can't kill it,
it was never alive.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.550
Well, maybe.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:05.569
By 1929, life can be eliminated
from the scientific vocabulary,

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:10.930
since it is an
indefinable abstraction.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.550
But of course by
1929, we're already

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.619
beginning to see
that the world is not

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:20.869
quite as simple as the Newtonian
mechanists wanted it to be.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:24.069
So we have Horowitz
in 1959 saying well,

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.230
we can make a list of
things that life does.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.520
Mutability, it changes.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.020
Self-duplication, it reproduces.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.760
Heterocatalysis.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.470
Ooh, I like that word.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.310
I had to look it up in Google.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.180
I probably have it
wrong in my memory.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.470
Basically a catalyst,
as you might recall,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.751
is a little lump that doesn't
change at all during a chemical

00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:48.250
reaction.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.070
But it promotes the reactions.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.604
And there are autocatalysts
which make more of themselves,

00:17:55.604 --> 00:17:57.020
and there are
heterocatalysts that

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.478
make things that are a little
bit different from themselves

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:02.280
but continue to be catalysts.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.040
Now, we've got the 60s.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.410
How many people here
remember the 60s?

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.770
You weren't there.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.510
Self-realization of
the potentialities

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.800
of atomic electron state.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.850
Ah!

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.300
That explains it.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.560
Now I know what life is.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.990
I can build a machine that
will look exactly for that.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.560
Multiplication,
heredity, variation.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.960
Kind of a similar
system as before.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.290
By 1997, we're into the
electronic age, the computer

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.110
age, the information age.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:41.290
So now we know that life is
a flow of energy, matter,

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.615
and information.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.390
What is information?

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.599
Oh, we should have a seven part
series on what is information.

00:18:50.599 --> 00:18:51.765
Information in the universe.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:02.210
This book itself ends up with a
definition that having evolved

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.330
from inanimate matter,
life constitutes

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.570
autocatalytic, evolvable,
telenomic organic systems

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.740
that can transfer, store,
and process information

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.130
based on template and
sequence-directed reactions,

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:22.820
all of which characterize
autopoietic entities.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.260
So I've got a list
of words up there.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.150
If you can find synonyms
for them in one syllable.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.360
Autocatalytic, it
makes more of itself.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.150
Evolvable, it can
make more of itself

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.240
but change into something else.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.230
Telenomic and organic.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.390
Organic just means it's
full account of carbon

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.670
as far as the chemists
are concerned.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.130
Telenomic is a wonderful word
because it's really tempting

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.920
when you're doing
evolution studies to fall

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.540
into the characterization
of saying well,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.580
this animal evolved
the human eye

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.450
in order to be able to see
to hunt better as if there

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:07.712
was a direction, an end,
a teleology directing

00:20:07.712 --> 00:20:08.295
the evolution.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.291
Now, the word
telenomic was invented

00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:14.790
to say the same
thing without making

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.150
that kind of implication.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.300
But other than that, I
can't tell the difference.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.740
Maybe some of the
other biologists

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.830
will get into the subtleties
of the difference.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.730
Again, we have
transferring, storing,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.380
and processing information.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.470
As if we knew what
information was.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.480
Because, in fact, what's
information to one

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.074
operating system
is random jibberish

00:20:35.074 --> 00:20:36.240
to another operating system.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.920
It's based on template and
sequence-directed reactions.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.430
Basically, they're
talking about DNA

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.090
and how the atoms line up
and reproduce themselves.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.130
Autopoietic-- they
reproduce themselves.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.610
So they're reproductive
objects that reproduce

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.160
into reproducing objects.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.360
Lucas Mix is going to be
giving a series of talks.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.940
He used to be the
Episcopal chaplain here.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.340
And he's also a
biologist now at Harvard.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.910
And he's come up with
other definitions

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.550
he's seen through
history, Wouse &amp; Fox.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.660
Anything that can be
related to the tree of life

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.960
must itself be alive.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.690
Which is really limiting
if you're trying

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.060
to look for life elsewhere.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.600
Darwin, anything that
evolves by natural selection

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.964
will be alive.

00:21:28.964 --> 00:21:30.380
So if I'm going
to go to a planet,

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.750
I have to stand and watch these
entities for about 10,000 years

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.880
to see if they change.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.970
Haldane, anything
with homeostasis,

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.900
maintains chemical equilibrium.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.440
This is a little bit closer to
the kind of working definition

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.740
that most people
are interested in.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.720
Because one of the
characteristics of life

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.710
is that it is, among other
things, a chemical process.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:01.170
And it's a chemical process
that maintains an equilibrium.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:06.070
But it's not a particularly
stable equilibrium.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.820
Now, when we're teaching
freshman physics,

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.580
we try to give the
idea of an equilibrium.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.134
You have a valley.

00:22:11.134 --> 00:22:12.050
And you roll the ball.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.670
It goes bum-da-dum-da-dum.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.170
It sits in the
bottom of the valley.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.500
And it's at equilibrium
because it's not moving.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.030
And it's stable because there's
no place it's going to roll to.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.030
If I have a hill
and I put the ball

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.452
at exactly the top of the
hill, it's at an equilibrium.

00:22:27.452 --> 00:22:29.160
Because it's not going
to move because it

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.100
can't decide which
way to-- it doesn't

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.090
roll one way or the other.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.550
But it's not a
stable equilibrium.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.330
Because the slightest breeze, it
goes woosh and then it's gone.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.660
If you have a hill and then
a little dimple in the hill,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.100
you might have
something akin to life.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.460
While it sits in the dimple,
it's in a local equilibrium.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:55.210
But it doesn't take much for it
to completely leave that place.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:59.070
And once it leaves there,
it can never come back.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.060
Maybe the hill without
the dimple is even best.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.380
Because you've got a little
ball that's in equilibrium.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.190
But then you have to
keep blowing on it

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.120
with little gas jets or
something to maintain it.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.326
You need energy at the outside
to keep it at equilibrium.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.814
This idea actually goes back to
Kant, Critique of Pure Reason.

00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:19.480
But then everything
in science goes back

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.950
to Kant and the
Critique of Pure Reason

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.356
so that doesn't
tell us anything.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.620
One of the more
interesting takes

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.510
in the history of
what is life questions

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.380
comes from Erwin Schrodinger.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.220
Now Schrodinger is
not somebody you'd

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.550
think of as being a biologist.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.940
Schrodinger certainly did
know that the mechanistic view

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.980
of 19th century
doesn't work because it

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.630
was his theories and his
explanations of quantum

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.760
mechanics that showed
that it doesn't work.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.250
Schrodinger is
probably most famous

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.642
in the world of biology
for Schroedinger's cat.

00:23:50.642 --> 00:23:52.350
Schroedinger's cat is
a way of explaining

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.433
how quantum physics works.

00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:54.910
I won't try to explain it here.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.410
Because whenever I
try to explain it

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.820
to my students, first of
all they get very confused.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.970
And then secondly, they
feel sorry for the cat.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:06.180
But to give you an idea of
what he's talking about,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.620
take a look at this interesting
film pulled off YouTube.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.410
It's alive.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.400
Little bugs moving around.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.000
Actually, it's not alive.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.090
Each of these are particles
less then a tenth or a hundred

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.600
of the size of a human hair.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.670
We're able to see them by
shining a laser through them,

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.540
and the particles will forward
scatter the laser light.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.880
And they're in water.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.430
And water has a
certain temperature.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:42.920
Because they are so small, the
water molecules hitting them

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.040
from every direction
do not completely

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.710
hit them at the same
rate in every direction.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.690
Once you get small
enough, there's

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.930
going to be, from
moment to moment,

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.280
a mismatch in the number of
molecules hitting this way

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.870
and the number of
molecules hitting that way.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.010
And as a result,
the little particles

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.560
move back and forth in
a totally random motion.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.960
Robert Brown figured this out.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.220
He saw this in
pollen in the 1830s.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.920
It's called Brownian motion.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.510
And it's simple enough that
people immediately understood

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:21.760
it after they read Einstein's
paper about it 100 years later.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.750
One of the things
about this image

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.850
is that it's only
about a minute clip.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.420
And I'm running it
backwards and forwards.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.510
And you can't tell
the difference.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.910
At the scale we're looking at,
there is no time arrow of time.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.370
But what this
shows, first of all,

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.170
is that things moving
isn't enough to declare

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.610
that something's alive.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:50.670
And it reminds you that at small
scales, the laws of physics

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.660
are no longer absolute.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.170
Rather, they are probabilistic.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.930
All you can say is that on
average, those particles

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.870
are going to be in one place.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.652
On average, the
particles don't move.

00:26:07.652 --> 00:26:09.110
But at any given
moment, they might

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.370
be moving one way or the other.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:15.730
Thinking about this,
Schrodinger pointed out

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:22.360
that to do biology in terms of
a mechanism and a chemistry,

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.590
you've got to have laws
that absolutely work.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.010
And work exactly the
same way all the time.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.880
You can't have lots of
randomness throwing things

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.980
into the world.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.580
Because though we
do have mutations,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.140
mutations are slow and gradual
and take years to develop.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.440
They can't be happening
every couple of seconds.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:49.500
But the laws of physics only
give you that kind of certainty

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.410
when you're looking at
really large things.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.269
Where the probability
of a very large ensemble

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:59.060
averages out so that
you can predict what's

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.620
going to happen from
moment to moment.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.380
If nothing else, this
tells him that life

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:12.240
must be based on genomes that
are really, really, really big.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.050
And of course he
wrote this in 1994,

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.970
almost 10 years before DNA
was finally worked out.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.350
And the idea of the
macromolecules that formed

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.960
genomes were truly understood.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.950
When it comes time to
dry and determine life,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.040
the temptation is to come
up with these laundry lists

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.120
of what life is and
what life doesn't.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.670
But the longer the
list, the more likely

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.360
you are that you're going
to be ruling out something

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.160
you actually think is alive.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.240
Multiplication,
heredity, variation.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.030
Mules don't reproduce.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:50.790
But they're alive.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.041
Jesuits don't
reproduce and they're--

00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:54.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.800
Dual income, no kids dinks.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.690
You yuppies.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.493
You don't-- and yet
you're still alive.

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.920
It can't be merely reproduction.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.290
It can even be the
possibility of reproduction

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.040
that makes something
alive or not alive.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.970
What's more, there are
plenty of things that

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.410
do reproduce that aren't alive.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.930
Fire reproduces.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.350
Plagioclase crystals reproduce.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.720
If you make a short
list to try to stop it

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.390
from being overly
dependent, you can

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.730
find lots of these examples.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.500
Mutability, self-duplication,
hetero-- OK.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.860
Are computer viruses alive?

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.100
They reproduce.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.980
They can mutate if you merely
make them clever enough.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.550
Heck, computer viruses--
what about real viruses?

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.510
Great debate.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.240
What about-- one of the
biologists kept saying

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.330
don't forget prions.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.840
Prion, that's a Japanese
sport car, right?

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.790
The prion a prion
is a protein that's

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.170
been folded in a funny way.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.100
And then when it gets
introduced into a cell,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.550
it induces all
the other proteins

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.915
to fold itself the same way.

00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:09.540
And what you're left
with after a while

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.960
is something like
mad cow disease.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.350
It reproduces.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.065
But no one would say that
the prion itself is alive.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.740
None of these
definitions are useful.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.220
If we only have
a snapshot, we've

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.860
landed our Lander on Mars,
we've only got a year

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.590
or so to look at something
to determine whether or not

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.150
it's living.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.640
So these fail both in
that they don't really

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.150
draw the boundaries where
we know the boundaries ought

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.030
to be drawn.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.000
They fail in that
they don't give us

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.690
a way of making
a machine that we

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.530
can run the crucial experiment
and say yes, this is alive, no,

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.860
this isn't alive.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.350
And of course none
of them answer

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.710
the philosophical
question, why am

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.844
I interested in
this entity instead

00:30:00.844 --> 00:30:01.885
of a lump of plagioclase.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.140
The answer that you usually
get after hours over a beer

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.450
when you talk to
a biologist, it's

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.242
like the definition
of pornography.

00:30:16.242 --> 00:30:18.450
I don't know what it is,
but I know it when I see it.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.552
The trouble with
that definition--

00:30:24.552 --> 00:30:26.510
which fundamentally is
the definition we're all

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.570
going to be using--
is that it does

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.030
have certain cultural
assumptions built in.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.910
Here is an example
of a great case where

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:40.300
that definition, that I know
it when I see it definition,

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.920
won out over all the
other definitions.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:48.340
About in 1984, a meteorite
was found in Antarctica.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.251
And it was found
in the Allan Hills.

00:30:50.251 --> 00:30:51.792
And when they looked
at it, they said

00:30:51.792 --> 00:30:52.916
this is really interesting.

00:30:52.916 --> 00:30:55.230
Tell the guys back at NASA
when they open the bags,

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.550
open this one first.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.810
And so it became Allan
Hills 84001, because they

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:02.510
knew it was the most important.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.000
Sure enough, it had all
of the evidences which

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.550
said chemically,
isotopically, age

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.220
dating that it was from Mars.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.160
That's another hour long
lecture if you really

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.040
want to get into that.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.020
In 1996, a group of scientists
at the Houston Johnson Space

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:28.300
Center in Houston looking into
this found a number of things.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.670
In this meteorite, was the
oldest Martian meteorite,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.500
was four billion years old.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.940
It dated back to a
period in Martian history

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.747
when there was probably
a lot of water,

00:31:39.747 --> 00:31:41.330
when there was a lot
of carbon dioxide

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.830
because there are
carbonate minerals.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.954
So if there is ever
going to be life,

00:31:46.954 --> 00:31:48.620
there might have been
life at that time.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.800
And they found this little thing
that looks just like a bug.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.120
Fossilized bug.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.540
But wait.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.590
Along with that, they
found polycyclic aromatic

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.720
hydrocarbons.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.650
Which is the kind of
gunk that comes off

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.750
of your steak when you've
burned it too long in the grill.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:08.590
It's what happens
when life dies.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:13.390
They also found
crystals of sulfides

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:17.110
that are always associated on
earth with living creatures.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:20.640
And they also
found tiny crystals

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.820
of magnetite, which within
their limits of the resolution

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:33.120
were not inconsistent
with the possibility

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.000
that they were the kinds of
pure magnetite crystals made

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.350
by bacteria in order to let
them use a magnetic field

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.080
to know whether to
swim up to the light,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.246
or down away from the light.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:53.990
Four independent lines of
evidence all saying this

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.680
is a body that was formed
when there was life around.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.590
This

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.850
Made it into the popular press.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.000
This made it into--
the president

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.505
had a news conference about it.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.390
Excuse me.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.850
It was presented at
scientific meetings.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:22.320
No one in the field
doubts that the evidence

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.699
was as they presented it.

00:33:23.699 --> 00:33:25.490
They have been arguing
about whether or not

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.370
the crystals really were
this kind of crystal or that.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.770
Because it's also not
inconsistent with other kinds

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.330
of crystals.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.890
But it's not like no one
could reproduce the evidence.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:39.130
You take the rock, you can find
stuff more or less like this.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.770
Nonetheless, 20
years later nobody

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.580
believes that it's
a hard evidence.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.370
And one of the
people who will talk

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.290
to you more about
this, Tim Swindle,

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.030
has a great story about this.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.880
I'll merely say
that when he talked

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.840
to people soon afterwards,
well, half the room would

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.210
say it's worth looking into.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.380
And the other half
of the room said eh.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.230
They're all looking
at the same data.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:11.650
But it didn't pass the I'll
know it when I see it test.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:14.449
And that's really the
only test it didn't pass.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:15.989
Occam's razor.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:21.010
Occam's razor says that if
you have multiple hypotheses,

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.320
you choose the simpler one.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:27.350
So maybe that's actually
just an optical illusion

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.130
that comes from weathering.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.639
Maybe the polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.230
came from the exhaust
pipe of the SkiDoo

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.312
in Antarctica that had
pulled up next to the rock

00:34:36.312 --> 00:34:37.270
when they recovered it.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.730
I was in Antarctica, I know
how they recover these things.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.385
Maybe the sulfides were
made by other processes

00:34:44.385 --> 00:34:46.760
that have nothing to do with
life, which we know happens.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.929
Maybe the magnetite
crystals are actually

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:52.000
a different kind of crystal and
they're kind of fooling you.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.340
Which is the simpler answer?

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.660
Four lines of evidence
that can all be explained

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.590
by one hypothesis, life.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.770
Or four lines of
evidence that all

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.305
can have non-life explanations.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.580
There is no calculus
that will tell you

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.620
which is the simpler one.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.950
At the end of the day, you
just have to look at it

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.790
and say could be, I don't know.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.678
Let's move on.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.230
The big trouble with
the I'll know it

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.440
when I see it, the
common sense approach,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.360
is that common sense
has changed over time.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.920
Back in the
pre-scientific world,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.640
where the world
was flat, there was

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.030
water above and below the earth,
a dome holding the water above.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.990
And if you dig deeper now,
you get that water again.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.680
This is not something
out of Genesis.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.500
When the guy wrote Genesis,
the author of Genesis

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.630
took the best
science of their day,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.510
which is Babylonian science.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.510
Which is based on the
fact there is a flat earth

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.230
with mountains at the edge.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.160
Go outside tomorrow
morning in Tucson.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.550
Flat ground, mountains
around the edge.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.520
There's a dome.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.830
If you don't see it, you
are not paying attention.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:12.140
These were good observers.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.710
They were seeing what
anyone could see.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:20.020
What they also saw was
that things that were dead

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.110
stood still.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.060
And things that
were alive moved.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:30.050
What's more, the wind
can make things move.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.610
And when animals breathe, they
have wind going in and out.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:38.380
So they used the same word,
anima, to mean the wind,

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:42.378
to mean the soul, to mean
the definition of an animal.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.340
Rivers flowed because there were
living creatures in the rivers.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.900
The gods of the rivers, the
goddesses of the rivers.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.850
The trees had gods
and goddesses.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:59.837
Everything that moved was alive.

00:36:59.837 --> 00:37:01.920
Now the Greeks had a little
more sophisticated way

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.270
of looking at it.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.710
Everything that moves is
alive except of course things

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.400
that go up and down.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.614
Because rocks falling
due to gravity-- well,

00:37:11.614 --> 00:37:12.780
they didn't call it gravity.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.820
Rocks falling due to the
fact that Earth is trying

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.550
to reach its natural place.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.520
Water that bubbles up from the
ground when the rocks fall down

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.960
because it's trying to
reach its natural place.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.270
Bubbles in the water
that bubble to the air

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.430
because it's trying to
reach its natural place.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.670
Fire in the air
that's going upwards

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.870
because it's trying to
reach its natural place.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:37.340
Gives us the four elements
and the four natural layers.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:42.390
That kind of motion is obviously
nothing to do with life.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.180
But backwards and forthward
motion cannot be explained

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.270
by this up down force.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.400
And you look in the sky and
you see stars that move.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.860
And planets that move among
the stars in sometimes very

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.330
complicated ways.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.090
So clearly, the
planets themselves

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.870
were imbued with
planetary intelligences.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.180
And they somehow
communicated with each other,

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.550
sending little demons,
little geniuses.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.360
And if you happened to be
born when the genius of music

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.910
was overhead descending on
you, you'd be a musician.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.540
If you happen to be born
when the genius of sleep

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.135
was descending on you, then,
well, I've been like that.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.290
Now we laugh at the idea
of demons and geniuses

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.120
communicating.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.800
I'll talk to a
particle physicist

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.640
about virtual photons.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.720
Sounds very similar.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.170
What was also in
Aristotle's philosophy

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:49.080
was the observation that
if you have muddy places,

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.620
you'll find animals in the
mud coming out of the mud.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.270
If you leave food
out, after a while,

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:02.070
even though the food
is dead and rotting,

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:05.590
animals will appear
within the food.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.360
Different kinds of mud produced
different kinds of mollusks.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.420
So clearly, we have the
spontaneous generation

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.690
of life out of
inanimate material.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.760
You find this even
in Shakespeare.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.660
Where in Anthony and
Cleopatra, they're

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.600
talking about the snakes
and crocodiles that

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.810
come from the mud of the Nile.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.640
To illustrate
this, I went online

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.360
and was looking at
pictures of maggots

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.730
and pictures of rotting meat.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:43.070
And decided you'd probably
rather see a picture of Pasteur

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.500
How was this disproved?

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.310
Well, Radian, 1668,
did experiments

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.240
where he covered the meat so
that flies couldn't land on it.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.010
And left other meat uncovered.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.170
And by golly, the maggots
only appeared where

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.910
the flies landed on the meat.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:02.510
Pasteur had a much
more complicated series

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.394
of experiments.

00:40:03.394 --> 00:40:05.560
It's usually described as
oh, he put them in bottles

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.660
and sterilized them.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.730
It's a lot more
complicated than that.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.110
He was a very good scientist.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.980
And he pretty much
showed that you could not

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:20.280
explain-- you could not
observe life occurring anyplace

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.810
that had been sterilized.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.430
You can only see
life occurring where

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:29.078
there was contact and possible
contamination from microbes.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.370
This still left the question as
to what made life so different

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.010
from non-living things.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.430
Because there is such a
quantitative difference

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:50.070
between a rock and a maggot.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:56.870
Was there some essential
ingredient, some vital force?

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.200
If we had that vital
force, could we

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.450
stick it into our monster
and create the Frankenstein

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:03.320
monster?

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.690
Or alternately, if
there is no vital force,

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:14.080
then why shouldn't we be able
to take pieces that are almost

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.712
alive and get them going again?

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.970
One thing that was
known by the chemists

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.950
in the early 19th century was
that organic chemicals which

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.410
were rich in carbon were a
heck of a lot more complicated

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.070
than inorganic chemicals.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:37.060
And every organic chemical had
been made by an organism until

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:40.610
Friedrich Wöhler by
accident synthesized urea.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.591
And said oh, I made this
without any life around.

00:41:44.591 --> 00:41:46.720
You know, I did this in 1828.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.550
It's only a matter
of time before we'll

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.660
be able to create life
in the laboratory.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.060
200 years later.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.790
Even Pasteur
himself was not sure

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.476
whether or not there was
this vital action going on.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.280
Furthermore, we have
to remember in worrying

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.960
about life in other universes,
life on other planets,

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.950
or even life here on
earth, that we have never

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.120
lived in a time where
we didn't ponder it.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.680
Whether we're talking about the
creatures of ancient Greece,

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.430
the mythologies of all
the ancient cultures,

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.210
the first travel
to other planets

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:30.080
science fiction story
which dates from AD 160.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:36.780
Even the Bible has got the
Nephilim, the sons of gods.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.985
And angels for that matter.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:44.310
How would you know
it if you saw it?

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:49.670
Well, I come to science
through the very, very

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.332
holy and important gateway
of science fiction.

00:42:53.332 --> 00:42:55.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.810
And one of the great
masters of science fiction,

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.870
Gene Roddenberry, the fellow
who invented Star Trek was once

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:06.790
quoted as saying if I'm going
to put a creature on television

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.960
and I want people to
believe that it's alive,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.850
it doesn't matter what shape it
is, it doesn't matter what form

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.010
it is, it doesn't matter
how many tentacles it has,

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.800
it doesn't matter
what color it is.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.834
As long as it's got two eyes.

00:43:17.834 --> 00:43:19.500
Then everyone will
know that it's alive.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:26.340
Our sense of what is living
and what isn't is deeply

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.280
embedded in the
culture we live in.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.907
And we cannot remove
ourselves from that culture.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.830
What do we know about
life on other planets?

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.050
Well, what do we know
though about other planets?

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:45.300
As soon as Galileo
and Kepler working

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.510
on the theories
of Copernicus had

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:50.150
convinced the scientific
world that planets

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.010
were places like the
earth, or that earth was

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.300
a place like other planets--

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.260
And a little hobby horse
by the way, don't ever

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.990
think the medieval
world view was

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:01.590
that the Earth was
special for being

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.010
at the center of the universe.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.410
Because if you read Dante,
you dig through the Earth,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.790
what's actually at the
center of the Earth?

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.857
The lowest realm of the inferno.

00:44:11.857 --> 00:44:14.190
That would mean the inferno
was the most important place

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.971
in the universe.

00:44:15.971 --> 00:44:16.470
No, no, no.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.990
They thought the Earth was
the bottom of the universe.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.810
When Copernicus said the earth
is a planet like other planets,

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.955
it was promoting the earth or
demoting the other planets.

00:44:28.496 --> 00:44:30.120
But as soon as that
idea was out there,

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.760
Kepler and Wilkins and
Godwin and de Bergerac

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.995
are all writing stories about
traveling to other planets.

00:44:36.995 --> 00:44:39.370
And what good is a story if
you don't have people around?

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:40.870
So it's traveling
to other planets

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:43.360
and interacting with
other creatures.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.590
Kepler, you know,
is the astronomer.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.730
Godwin was a bishop.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.340
De Bergerac was the great
swordsman with a big nose.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.300
It was, actually.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.950
Conversations on the
Plurality of Worlds.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.010
This was a book
trying to describe

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.150
a conversation between a
countess and a philosopher

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:07.300
on what lives might
be present and could

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.550
be possible on other planets.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:13.000
Not just around our sun,
but around other suns.

00:45:16.862 --> 00:45:18.320
These are speculations
that go well

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.895
into the 18th and
19th centuries.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:27.800
We look today for
evidence of life

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:32.050
on planets recognizing
that we have

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:36.440
both our cultural
assumptions and the fact

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.060
that we're fighting against
those cultural assumptions.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.670
There have been bursts
of methane seen on Mars.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.960
Well, that was seen
first by a telescope,

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.702
but the evidence
wasn't very good.

00:45:48.702 --> 00:45:50.660
So now they put a lander
with a little detector

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:55.700
to actually look for methane
from a detector on the lander.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.590
And they have found
little bursts of methane,

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:59.200
which go away really quickly.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.960
Which means they're being
produced by something.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.020
Rotting, decaying
organic material?

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.320
You know, the
flatulence of cows?

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.400
Who knows.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.990
It could also be outgassing
from the spacecraft that's

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.239
holding the little instrument.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:24.040
We have looked at icy moons,
like Europa and Enceladus.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.530
And we have excellent
evidence that there is

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.580
liquid water under the crust.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.840
What's the excellent evidence?

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.090
Every now and then,
you can see some

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:33.492
of the liquid
water squirting out

00:46:33.492 --> 00:46:34.700
through a crack in the crust.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.805
It's probably there.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.080
The first time anyone
talked about life

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.650
in an ocean of Europa was here
at the University of Arizona

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:55.050
at the Jupiter meeting in 1975.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.370
And it was a smart aleck-y
a young graduate student

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.420
who made the suggestion.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:06.850
And when I made that suggestion,

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.020
Carl Sagan turned to
me and said if you've

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:14.080
got 100 kilometer crust of
ice, or even a 10 kilometer

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:19.730
crust of ice, how is it going
to get sunlight into the water

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.140
to drive the life?

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.970
That led to a whole
series of other arguments.

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:32.000
Can you have a life where
there is no sunlight?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.810
It's not as clear as you
might think either way.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:40.190
One great place that has been
suggested for life is Titan.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.080
Titan is a moon of Saturn.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.230
It's covered with an atmosphere
that's rich in nitrogen. Sound

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.260
familiar?

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.690
But 1.5 times the
pressure of the

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.960
atmosphere here on
earth, not that bad.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.340
It's got mountains, it's
got lakes, it's got rivers,

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.466
it's got evidence
of rain occurring.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:07.000
Of course it also is about 200
degrees below zero Celsius.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.954
How do you have lakes there?

00:48:08.954 --> 00:48:10.370
Because they're
not made of water,

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.661
they're made of liquid methane.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:18.740
Could you devise life
that could function

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.980
at a really low
temperature like that?

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.450
Well, maybe nature is
very clever and it can.

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:29.890
I remember this was discovered
by the Huygens probe, which

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.272
was a probe built by
a bunch of Europeans.

00:48:32.272 --> 00:48:34.480
I lived in Europe 20 years,
I've gotten to know them.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.620
Some of my best
friends are Europeans.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.450
One of them from the
Netherlands came here

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.900
to give a talk at the
lunar lab a few years ago.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.544
And he said we've
done calculations--

00:48:43.544 --> 00:48:44.960
this is before the
lander actually

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.000
got to Titan-- we've
done calculations

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.500
on the atmosphere of Titan.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.210
And it looks like the clouds
should be liquid droplets just

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.050
like water clouds on Earth.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.800
And there should be rain
that falls out of the clouds,

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.580
just like rain
falls here on earth.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.910
But if our calculations
are correct,

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.250
that rain might
actually evaporate

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.220
before it hits the ground.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.960
Who ever heard of such a thing?

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.300
Until we explained to him go
outside in the desert here

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.010
and you see it all the time.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:22.360
Our assumptions
of what is normal

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.900
are so deeply built
into our own experiences

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.835
that it's very hard to break out
of those cultural assumptions.

00:49:37.582 --> 00:49:39.290
It gets even worse
when you start looking

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.070
for life on other planets.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.640
There are thousands of planets
we have confirmed that we have

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.650
seen around thousands of stars.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.620
Of those, we already
know of a dozen or so

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.260
that are close to being
earth like in size.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.480
And another dozen that are
close to being in regions that

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.800
appear to be where water would
be neither too frozen or too

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.360
boiling to allow [INAUDIBLE],
so that we could actually

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.150
have life present, the
so-called Goldilocks zone.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.100
And of those dozen,
there's actually

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.820
one or two that are both.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.839
They're earth like
and they're in regions

00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:14.047
that might have liquid water.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:26.070
If life is this weird out
of equilibrium chemistry,

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:32.070
if life is this thing which is
balancing on a teeter point,

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.264
what's doing the balancing?

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:36.180
Schrodinger had a wonderful
description of it.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.180
He said life consumes
negative entropy.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.180
That explains it, right?

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.430
It means that there is
a source of energy which

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:49.460
is allowing these incredibly
complicated chemicals that

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:56.590
make us alive continue to exist
even when the sun goes away.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:00.075
So that we can still
survive even at night.

00:51:00.075 --> 00:51:01.700
The way we do it on
earth is that we've

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.510
got plants that take the
equilibrium product, carbon

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:08.550
dioxide, and break it into
free oxygen. Oxygen is

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:13.150
the second most reactive
element in the periodic table.

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.860
Oxygen wants to react
with everything.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.540
It wants to react with the wood.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.526
It wants to react
with your clothing.

00:51:19.526 --> 00:51:21.025
That's why we have
fire departments.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:27.164
And because we can use this
chemical reaction day in

00:51:27.164 --> 00:51:28.580
and day out, even
though it's only

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.870
produced during the daytime,
we can maintain ourselves.

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:36.700
But as a byproduct, we have this
really reactive chemical agent,

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.630
free oxygen.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.620
Another reactive agent
like that, methane.

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.160
If the temperature is
such that really methane

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.380
shouldn't be in equilibrium
but you see it anyway,

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.810
it's a biomarker.

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.880
And free oxygen and
methane are the kinds

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.080
of elements that can
be pretty easily seen

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.380
in the atmosphere of a planet.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.820
So if we're going to use this
chemical reaction to describe

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.870
what life was and look
for the products of it,

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.310
we might be able to see it.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.770
We might be able to
say that this is not

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.360
inconsistent with the
possibility of life there.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.257
But it's never a proof.

00:52:16.257 --> 00:52:18.340
And in the meanwhile, the
science fictional people

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.620
can come up with
marvelous examples

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.990
that we haven't
thought of yet, that we

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:27.930
wouldn't see if we have
our expectations of life

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:28.470
too narrow.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:36.190
What is life, and
how does it function?

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.600
Life arises out of the
spontaneous reactions

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.510
of inanimate-- that's
spontaneous generation.

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.930
No, actually that's what every
theory for the origin of life

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:47.840
ultimately says.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.350
It doesn't go so quickly
from mud to a mollusk.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:54.850
But whether it
happened overnight

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:58.530
or it happens over a
period of a billion years,

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:01.510
ultimately our chemical
theories of life

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:05.348
still assume some kind of
spontaneous generation.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.220
From all we have learned about
the structure of living matter,

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:15.180
we must be prepared to find it
working in a manner that cannot

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:19.620
be reduced to the
ordinary laws of physics.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.070
Vitalism.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:21.690
No?

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:27.650
Schrodinger pointing out that
you have to-- at the scale

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:29.440
that things are
happening in biology,

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.931
you have to take account
of quantum effects.

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:38.850
I know it when I see it.

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.430
What if you were raised
on a desert island?

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:44.940
In the desert island,
surrounded by trees.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.600
And you had a pretty good
idea of what a tree was.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:54.400
And then somebody
showed you that.

00:53:57.050 --> 00:54:01.056
How would you know that
that was also a tree?

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.790
You need more than
one example to be

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:10.420
able to determine what
are the essentials

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.345
and what are the accidents to
use the words of Aristotle.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:20.470
I know it when I see it.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:25.480
What are the characteristics
that tell me something

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.320
about the center of what
it means to be alive?

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.130
Some of the things
that I hope I would

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:34.210
be able to see in any
entity that is alive.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.410
Life does change.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:39.330
It changes both for the
better and for the worse.

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:42.360
And sometimes these changes
occur simultaneously.

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.870
And sometimes you can't be sure
what is better, what is worse.

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:49.370
This is a photograph
of Pope John Paul II.

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.060
When I first arrived at the
Vatican more than 20 years ago,

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.230
I got to meet Pope John
Paul II as a young man.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:55:00.540
Very well-educated,
very sharp, great guy.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.180
Wonderful skier

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.530
I have to confess--
don't tell anybody,

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:09.967
as long as it's just among
us-- after meeting him

00:55:09.967 --> 00:55:11.800
the first time, I was
a little disappointed.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.110
Because he was just a guy.

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.870
He puts his cassock on one arm
at a time like the rest of us.

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:25.730
But he got older, and he got
weaker, and he got more frail.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:32.720
And by the early 2002,
2003, 2004, an amazing thing

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.152
happened when you saw
him in a public audience.

00:55:35.152 --> 00:55:37.110
We have these summer
schools, we bring students

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.154
from around the world
to study astronomy.

00:55:39.154 --> 00:55:40.570
And at the end of
the school, they

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.694
get to meet the pope usually.

00:55:43.694 --> 00:55:46.360
And some of the students will be
Catholics and they say oh cool,

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.030
I get to meet the pope.

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:49.750
And some of them would
be harsh atheists.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.840
I don't want to
meet this pope guy.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.154
And after they met John
Paul II, the Catholics

00:55:55.154 --> 00:55:56.570
would go yeah,
that's pretty cool.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.380
I got to meet the pope.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.420
And the atheists
would go oh my god.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.870
Oh my god.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:05.840
Because, and I don't
know how to describe it,

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.834
but there was something
about this guy.

00:56:08.834 --> 00:56:11.250
Agree with him or disagree
with him, love him or hate him,

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.880
you know, follow
his theology or not,

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.190
he had a power at
the end of his life

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:21.940
that he did not have when
he was young and vigorous.

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.430
People change.

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:25.000
And the changes are complicated.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.190
Living entities
are unpredictable.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:38.830
Like the little things going
around in Brownian motion,

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.330
but they are not random.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:46.270
If you follow a cat, the cat is
always going to surprise you.

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.500
But afterwards, you
can work out OK,

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.124
that's what that cat was doing.

00:56:50.124 --> 00:56:51.540
And yet once you've
worked it out,

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.830
you can't go then
and predict what

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.996
the cat's going to do again.

00:56:56.850 --> 00:57:00.146
Entities that are
unpredictable but not random.

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:07.370
That's maybe what you
mean by a flow of energy.

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:10.110
On the other hand,
I'm not sure I'm

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:12.530
going to be able to send
a probe to another planet

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.629
and wait for cats, much
less to talk to their elders

00:57:15.629 --> 00:57:17.170
and see if they have
that same wisdom

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:19.720
that the elderly pope had.

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:26.190
Life can die.

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:27.870
We go back to Engles.

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:30.740
It's not that there
isn't life on earth

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.600
which is in one sense immortal.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:37.560
Bacteria, in a sense,
never die from old age.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.970
You can kill them.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:43.080
Something that is alive is
something that can be killed.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.880
And it's different from
a machine breaking down.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.760
Because you can
take an old machine,

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.980
polish it up, install a few
new parts, and it works again.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:56.560
But when death occurs, it
occurs catastrophically.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.255
When that equilibrium is
finally lost, it crashes.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:06.700
There is something about
the complexity of life

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:12.020
that means that death is
an essential part of life.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:15.390
And yet 50 years
from now, 500 years

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.580
from now, 1,000 years
from now, will we

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.030
be able to take the pieces
of Frankenstein's monster

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:26.030
and actually glue them
together and make them work?

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:29.390
I don't want to have a
definition of life that

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:32.790
is overwhelmed by
changes in technology.

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:37.160
And yet this is
something that I feel

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:40.910
is an essential part
of what we are looking

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:44.710
for in our cultural
biases of 2015

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:46.451
when we say we're
looking for life.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.790
Most importantly
though, we will not

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:57.680
know life until we see
more than one example.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.770
The two fish are looking
at the snow globe.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.560
And now they've got a
second universe to look at.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.070
And the one says
to the other great,

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:09.150
now I'm going to have to come
up with a whole new cosmology.

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:13.120
Neither of them recognizing
that they're on a table,

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.970
on a planet Earth,
which we all know

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:17.400
is flat and surrounded
by mountains

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.320
and has a big dome over it
just like the snow globe does.

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.700
Or maybe it's surrounded
by crystal and spheres

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.720
like the fishbowl is.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:30.500
Our knowledge is always
going to be incomplete.

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.268
That's why we keep looking.

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.650
There's one more thing, though.

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:48.560
To get back to my
original point that we

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.290
have to understand not only
the question of what is life,

00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:56.450
as opposed to what makes life
interesting, as opposed to

00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:00.810
how can we find it,
how can we describe it.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:07.980
You can go to a Best Buy and get
a really good plasma screen TV.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.990
You can get one with 3D glasses.

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:14.730
You can see
immensely fascinating

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:19.490
3D films in this plasma TV.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.686
Now, the plasma TV has behind
it a whole set of pixels.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.840
And the pixels are
very complicated.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.840
If it weren't for the
pixels, the TV wouldn't work.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.860
So what's real?

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.370
The image that you're seeing in
your head with the 3D glasses?

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.050
Or the pixels making the image?

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:48.940
Well, to quote the great
philosopher Dumbledore,

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:52.090
just because it's in your
head doesn't necessarily

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:55.440
mean it isn't real.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.720
Because while it's true that
the pictures would never

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.240
be created without
the pixels, no one

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.620
would ever have built the
pixels except that they

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.871
wanted to watch the movie.

01:01:09.577 --> 01:01:12.527
And furthermore,
confusing the two things--

01:01:12.527 --> 01:01:14.110
I mean, if you're
looking at the movie

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.370
and you suddenly are
able to see the pixels,

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:18.608
something's gone
very, very wrong.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.970
That's the fundamental
philosophical mistake

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.310
behind vitalism.

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:29.070
Because it reduces
whatever life is

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:31.260
to one more magic ingredient.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.570
And people want to say
that this was supernatural,

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.780
this is the thumbprint of God.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.270
Not only is it the
God of the gaps,

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:43.080
but it's reducing god to one
more chemical that we just

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.200
hadn't distilled before.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:52.050
At the end of the day
we have to remember

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:59.310
that we live in a universe
both of pixels and of stars,

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:02.380
and of the images
of pixels and stars

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.610
that are inside our brain.

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:11.440
As you've heard, the seven of
us who have these lectures going

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.130
have talked a lot
among ourselves.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:16.990
When I first presented
these ideas to that group,

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:19.420
I said the important
thing to remember

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.830
is that we have to talk about
more than just the pixels

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:25.780
at the end of the day.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:30.100
We can talk about life,
what is life, why is life,

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:33.070
functional, how can we
find it in other planets.

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:36.120
But we should never
forget the reason

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.840
why we're coming to
seven lectures on life

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.630
and not seven lectures
on plagioclase.

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:45.970
And at that, I hope that
the other people here

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:48.070
will be able to get as
many good laughs out of you

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:49.470
as I've been able to get.

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:51.443
Thank you very much.

01:02:51.443 --> 01:02:53.174
