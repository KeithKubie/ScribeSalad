00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.171 align:end position:100%
Oh, Clovers,
just like that.

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:08.207 align:end position:100%
Hey, hey, hey.
You got to leave Clovers alone.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.143 align:start position:0%
First of all, it's none
of your business

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.277 align:start position:0%
what Clovers and me do.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.212 align:start position:0%
Secondmost,
it's his idea.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.548 align:start position:0%
We're trying to have
a gentle, romantic moment here.

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:17.316 align:start position:0%
Oh! Whoo!

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.652
(Forrest voice-over)
This inmate, an armed robber
named Cassius,

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:20.820
may have started it,

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.022
but in no time at all,
sex with Clovers

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:26.325
had become the new prison slang
for masturbation.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.061
[prisoners shouting]

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.730
Everybody all at the same time.
How is that even possible?

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.766
(Cassius)
Get the balls, Clovers.
Oh! Oh!

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.836
(Forrest voice-over)
I had now had enough human
contact with my fellow prisoners

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.205
to know that I much preferred
to be left alone

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:40.740
with my imaginary friend.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.875 align:end position:100%
Hey, Clovers,
forget about MacNeil.

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.811 align:end position:100%
Come over here, play a little
Connect Four with me.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.380 align:start position:0%
Yeah, Clovers says,
"No, thank you," okay?

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.948 align:start position:0%
We're having
a good time.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.984 align:end position:100%
Whoa, and here he comes.
My man, Clovers.

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:54.287
(Forrest voice-over)
It appeared that Clovers
had now become a symbol

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.022
in a prison yard
power struggle.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.125
Cassius wanted to show he could
take whatever he wanted from me

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.460
whenever he wanted.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.361 align:start position:0%
Oh, Clovers,
that was mean.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:05.364
You just tricked Cassius that
you were gonna go play with him,

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:07.467 align:end position:100%
and now you're coming back here
to play checkers with me.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.268 align:start size:41% position:59%
Oh! Oh, snap!

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.404 align:end position:100%
You were only
tricking MacNeil

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.372 align:end position:100%
into thinking that
you were tricking me.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:14.841 align:start size:69% position:31%
That's a double cross.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.910 align:end position:100%
You're a bad man.
You're a bad man, Clovers.

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.480
The triple cross?
Unbelievable!

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.148
I mean, he really,
really thought

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.349
that you were gonna play
Connect Four.

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.118 align:start size:50% position:50%
Quadruple cross!

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.285 align:start size:72% position:28%
And what are you doing?

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:28.254 align:end position:100%
Putting an electromagnet
in your pants

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:30.756 align:end position:100%
so you can't get up off
of this metal seat?

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.758 align:start position:0%
Five cross?
Unbelievable.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.227 size:88% position:44%
And the magnet doesn't work.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.129
I understand you have to stay
in contact

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.663
with him so you can
eventually murder him.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.332
Maybe you're intimidated,
you feel like you have to

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.833
go over there
but there's no reason for that.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.335
Guys like this
are all bluster.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.804 align:end position:100%
What you really would like
to do is dance?

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.706
- Come on.
- Be careful. Leave me alone.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.374
[laughs]

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:49.609
Dance-off, MacNeil.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.944
Oh, get 'em, Cas.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.746
[laughter]

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:54.881
Pardon me, may I cut in?

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.916
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh!

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.518 align:start size:53% position:47%
Come here, buddy.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.019 align:start position:0%
Oh, you don't like that style
of dance?

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:02.522 align:start position:0%
Oh, traditional Irish
step-dancing?

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:03.890 size:81% position:41%
I don't know but I'll try.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.124
Oh, you're really good at it.
Look at you.

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:07.059
Nobody likes feeling
like a leprechaun.

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:08.227 align:start position:0%
Time for break dancing?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.829
Oh, break it out, MacNeil.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.931
Who thinks that Clovers wants
to be my best friend?

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.933
- Yeah!
- Looks like he made his choice.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.334
- Then circled the table.
- He made his choice.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:16.669
- We're gonna play checkers.
- Taking a lap

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.337
to think about it.
Here he comes around here.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.872
- Look it. There he goes.
- The rude faces you're making.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:20.940
Oh! He just put a yellow in!

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:22.208
Oh! He didn't do that [bleep].

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.376
- You put that yellow there.
- [shouting]

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.510
[guard blows whistle]

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:25.378
- You put it there.
- [shouting]

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.379
Visiting hours.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.380
MacNeil.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.749
You got one.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.117
- [bleep].
- There he goes.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.218
[shouting]
- There he goes.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.553
[laughs]

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.052
- After you.
- [bleep].
