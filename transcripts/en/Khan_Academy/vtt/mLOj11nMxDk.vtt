00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.440
- [Instructor]
Three-dimensional facial scans

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.220
are being used to determine

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.850
how well patients have aged

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.400
in comparison to their peers.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.890
So I actually like the word used.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.990
It felt very clean.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.060
I'm using only one word here,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.710
and I was able to understand what it said.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.880
Three-dimensional facial scans

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.310
are being used to determine

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.420
how well patients have aged

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.110
in comparison to their peers.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.070
So I actually like this,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.250
so I'm already inclined to no change,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.720
but let's just look at the other choices

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.670
and hopefully feel a little bit better

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.590
why those would be bad choices.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.970
Three-dimensional facial scans
are being usefully employed

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.030
to determine how well patients have aged

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.220
in comparison to their peers.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.640
So usefully employed, it's not
really changing the meaning,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280
it's not giving us anything more,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.930
and it's just more wordy.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.440
It's a little bulky.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.030
Three-dimensional facial scans are being,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.730
instead of saying, are
being used to determine,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.150
we're saying, are being
usefully employed to determine.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.030
Well, I could just say used.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.970
This is more concise, it's more clean.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.560
If you can get the same meaning across

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.393
and do it in a simpler way

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.360
and a more concise way,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.370
you should do it that way.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.340
So I definitely not
like usefully employed.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.550
Three-dimensional facial scans

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.480
are being put into action

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.440
to determine how well patients have aged

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.980
in comparison to their peers.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.550
Well, put into action is
another way of saying used,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.240
and used is cleaner, it is more concise,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.300
it gets to the point.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.440
While put into action,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.910
put into action to determine how well,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.820
it just, a little bit bulkier.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.690
This wouldn't be, if someone wrote this,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.210
it's not like they committed some crime

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.940
by writing put it, are being
put into action to determine,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.610
but if I was editing that sentence,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.370
I'd say, well, why don't you
just replace that with used?

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.130
It's much simpler and
cleaner, easier to read.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.700
Three-dimensional facial scans

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.030
are being employed and utilized.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.860
Once again, this is a very bulky way

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.120
of saying used.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.970
So no need to add bulk to your sentences,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.210
just to kind of add more words.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.010
Three-dimensional facial
scans are being used.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.363
That's very nice and clean.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.420
So, oh I didn't, I haven't
answered the question,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.673
that's an important part of it, no change.
