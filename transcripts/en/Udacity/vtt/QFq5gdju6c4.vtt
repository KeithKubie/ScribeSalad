00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Often both natural languages and programming languages

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
have optional parts that don't have to appear in every utterance.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For example, "I think" is a totally valid sentence,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but so is "I think correctly," where we've added the adverb "correctly"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that modified the verb "think."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You don't need to do this, though.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can leave it out. The sentence on the left is perfectly fine.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We're going to want to represent this optional construction,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
this optional adverb, in our formal grammar.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here on the bottom half of the screen

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I've drawn a slightly more complicated grammar.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Sentence goes to optional adjective, subject, verb.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Subject and verb work a lot like they did before.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This time our subjects are either William or Tell,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and our verb is either shoots or bows.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But our optional adjective can either be the adjective "accurate"

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or it can be nothing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It disappears.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We can either leave this blank, or if you like,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we could write that same epsilon we used to have there

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
when we were talking about finite state machines

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that means the empty string or no input.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Looking at this grammar, I have a quiz for you.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Fill in the blank.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Starting from sentence, how many valid utterances are there?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
How many strings can we make in this language?

00:01:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
How many different things can this formal grammar produce?
