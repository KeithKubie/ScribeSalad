[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:07.970
AARON ZEMACH: We're very
excited to welcome Jack.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.000
He is the Artistic
Director for the Encores!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.760
Concert Series at New York
City Center as well as

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.969
the Creative Director at
the Jujamcyn Theaters, which

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.384
include the Eugene O'Neill
Theater, where "Book of Mormon"

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.900
is currently showing, and the
Al Hirschfeld Theater, where

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.379
"Kinky Boots" is
currently showing.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:24.170
And we're very excited
to welcome him here.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.066
So, everyone, please
welcome Jack Viertel.

00:00:31.424 --> 00:00:33.090
JACK VIERTEL: I'm
here in my snow boots.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.230
So I'm not quite
at my most dapper.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.890
Hello everybody.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.570
Hello, Aaron.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.278
AARON ZEMACH: Hi.

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.930
So, I guess from that
intro, I mentioned

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.150
you're the Artistic
Director for Encores!

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.540
And you're the Creative
Director at Jujamcyn.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.110
But how would you
really describe

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.020
what you do as your jobs in
the theater in those roles?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.910
JACK VIERTEL: It's
been a journey

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.490
of a bunch of different--
even though my job

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.395
title hasn't changed much,
a bunch of different things.

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:01.020
When I first-- well,
I started out life

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.200
as a theater critic for the
Los Angeles Herald Examiner

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.290
in the days when there were
still multiple newspapers

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.640
in cities like Los Angeles.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.440
No longer true.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.320
And then I became a dramaturg
at the Mark Taper Forum,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.050
which is the big not-for-profit
theater in L.A. Sort

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.200
of the equivalent of the Lincoln
Center Theater or the Public

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.130
Theater.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.590
And in that capacity, which
only lasted two years,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.880
I worked with a lot
of young playwrights

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.700
working on and reworking
their material.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.000
I wrote a lot of program notes.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.320
I did sort of general literary
things around the theater.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.250
And then I got hired to come
to Jujamcyn in 1987 at a time

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.030
when the theater--

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.770
you're all-- it's
interesting being--

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.700
I'm often the youngest
person in the room.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.670
This is a day when I'm the
oldest person in the room.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.086
I'm the oldest person in the
building, possibly the oldest

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.980
person on the block.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.320
Back in 1987 and '88,
many Broadway theaters

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.690
were empty much of the time.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.860
And Times Square
was this sort of,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.780
to me, charming, but to other
people slightly scary hellhole.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.510
And so we produced everything
that went into our theaters

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.060
ourselves because the typical
theater owner job, which

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.910
is to rent your
theaters to producers,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.950
there were no plays to
put in the theaters.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.620
So we made our own, basically.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.952
And that went on for 10 or 15
years until the theater got--

00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:24.660
sort of turned itself
around for a number

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.920
of kind of interesting
reasons that we

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.480
can talk about, if you want to.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.290
And Times Square got
completely resuscitated

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.670
by Disney and the Times Square
Business Improvement District.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.479
And suddenly there
were more shows

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.770
than there were theaters to
put them in, at which point

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.750
we stopped producing
pretty much.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.180
And I became a handicapper.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.436
I basically went around the
country and looked at shows,

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:49.560
came back home again, and
said to Rocco Landesman--

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.510
who was then my boss--

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.300
book this one,
don't book that one.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.891
And that went on for a while.

00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.390
And then in the
midst of all of that

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.270
I was hired to be the
Artistic Director of Encores!

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.900
Encores!

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.030
does-- if you haven't
seen one and you're

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.180
a musical theater nerd like
me, you might want to come.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.970
We're actually doing a Cole
Porter show next week--

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.420
resuscitates these rarely
seen Broadway musicals--

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.770
usually rarely seen-- and
puts them on for seven

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.810
performances with
a full orchestra

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.780
and a full chorus and
a minimal production.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.920
But you can hear what the show
sounded like in their day.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.602
And the one we're
doing next week

00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:30.060
is called "The New Yorkers"
and it's written by Cole Porter

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.890
and it was produced
in 1930, right

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.900
at the beginning of
the Great Depression

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.230
and in the dying
days of prohibition.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.150
And, you know, if you
have a fascination

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.140
for what Broadway was
like back in that era,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.430
it's an interesting thing to do.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.920
It's been a very
successful series.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.920
I've had really a great
time putting on shows

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.200
that I either
never saw, or shows

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.060
that I saw when I
was a little kid,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.800
or shows that I'd
always wanted to see.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.750
And my creative genes have
sort of moved over there.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.760
And at Jujamcyn,
I've become more

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.120
of a sort of dramaturg for hire.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.300
I get hired by producers
who are producing

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.390
new shows to join
the creative team

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.459
and sort of help them sort out
some of the dramatic issues

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.019
and musical issues
and other issues

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.019
that a new show tends to have.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.030
And that also has
been very rewarding.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.090
So it's a lot of different jobs
without a lot of different job

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.591
titles.

00:04:27.591 --> 00:04:28.381
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah.

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:30.900
And you've taken that history
and the breadth of knowledge

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.774
that you have about
theater and really put it

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:36.109
in this book, "The Secret
Life of the American Musical."

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.400
And you use this great analogy
that I love in the intro

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.880
that shows are both an
animal and a machine.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.630
And you talk about how
this book is really

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.800
breaking apart the machine.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.880
I wonder if you could
talk a little bit

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.440
about what you mean by that.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.231
JACK VIERTEL: Yeah.

00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:49.590
I mean the book came out
of a couple of classes

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.150
that I taught at NYU for almost
a decade about musical theater

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.810
structure.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.830
And I think teaching the
classes grew out of the fact

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.606
that I had worked
on so many shows

00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:01.980
that although I
don't think I had

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.950
any particular genius for it, I
had just learned a lot of stuff

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.880
about how you put
a show together.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.009
And, you know, storytelling
has its mechanical aspects.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.300
I mean, if you're a screenwriter
or a television writer

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.697
or a writer of plays or
musicals there's just--

00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:22.530
if you want to hold the
audience's interest,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.190
there are ways to do it.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.280
And the more shows I
worked on, the more I

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.520
realized that the musical has
a kind of unique bunch of tools

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.490
in its tool box,
and therefore they

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.880
tend to tell their stories in
more or less the same ways.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.780
But audiences aren't
even aware of that.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.916
And so I wrote the book.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:42.290
I taught the class
and then wrote

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.870
the book as a way
of sort of saying,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.170
well, you know, this
is how we tell a story

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.975
on the stage with music.

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.350
And it's quite
different than how

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.090
you might want to tell
a story in a movie

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.280
or a novel or a television show.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.060
It's not better.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.870
It's just that we
have these tools

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.605
and we deploy them
in a certain way.

00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:00.920
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah, so
maybe let's talk about that

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.850
a little bit.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.985
Let's say I come into the
theater to see a show.

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:04.610
I'm in my seat.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.300
Lights go down.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.604
The overture finishes.

00:06:06.604 --> 00:06:08.020
And then you say
in the book the--

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.480
JACK VIERTEL:
You're lucky if you

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.990
have an overture these days.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.320
AARON ZEMACH: Sure.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.361
The overture finishes or
they've finished telling

00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:14.630
me to turn off my cell phone.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.127
And you say at this point
the audience is in trouble.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.710
And the first thing
we're going to see

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.140
is them getting the audience
out of trouble, right?

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.740
JACK VIERTEL: Well, yeah.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.320
I mean, this was a great quote
from a director named Michael

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.164
Blakemore about musicals.

00:06:26.164 --> 00:06:27.830
He said, the minute
the curtain goes up,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.330
the audience is in trouble.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.580
And what he meant
by that was there's

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.800
so much information
coming at you,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.530
and you have so little
knowledge of how

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.410
to detect what's important
and what's not important,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.800
that it's the show's
responsibility to show you

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.050
who's the main character,
what era are we in,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.510
what kind of show is this,
is it a comedy or a drama,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.230
is it, you know,
romantic or dramatic?

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.014
And an opening number has to
accomplish all those goals.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.930
Interestingly, the one
thing an opening number

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.780
doesn't have to do, although
some of them do it anyway,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.930
is to tell you anything
about the plot at all

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.860
of what the show is.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.950
But there are so many unanswered
questions when the curtain goes

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.160
up that a good opening number,
whether it involves everybody

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.860
in the cast or whether it's
simply one character walking

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.840
out and talking to
you or singing to you,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.620
sort of is supposed
set your mind at ease.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.400
OK, I get it.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.020
We're in the
Oklahoma territories

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.240
at the turn of the century.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.770
We're on a farm.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.450
It's a romantic story.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.820
All of that kind of
stuff it needs to get

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.920
taken care of in the first
two or three minutes.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.370
If the audience is confused
about what kind of show it is,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.780
they won't go there.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.610
I mean, they just
won't get on the ride.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.800
And if they don't get on
the ride at the beginning,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.440
they probably won't
get on the ride at all.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.440
So those opening numbers are
complicated to figure out.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.629
And often I've found in
the shows I've worked on,

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:50.420
and also in a lot of
shows I've read about,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.040
they are last thing written.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.970
Usually the authors
write an opening number,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.700
then they write the
rest of the show,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.770
then they realize what the
rest of the show really is like

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.800
and what it's really about.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.383
Then they throw out
the opening number

00:08:00.383 --> 00:08:03.410
and write a new one to
support what they've written

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.610
after the opening number.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.380
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah, one of my
favorite anecdotes in the book

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.090
is you talk about
the opening number

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.400
to "A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum."

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.850
JACK VIERTEL: Right.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.930
AARON ZEMACH: And how
that got rewritten

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.880
and totally changed the
direction of the show.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.230
JACK VIERTEL: Yeah.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.740
It actually turned a
flop into-- one number

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.940
turned a flop into a hit.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.520
I mean, it's an interesting--
you may all know this story,

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.920
but the show opened out of town.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.450
It was a terrible disaster.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.690
And my friend, Frank Rich-- who
was for a long time the theater

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.630
critic for the Times and now
writes for New York Magazine--

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.850
was a teenage ticket taker
in Washington back in 1962

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.325
and says vividly that he
remembers a matinee of "A Funny

00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:39.950
Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum"

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.200
trying out in which there
were 50 people sitting

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.710
in a 1,200-seat auditorium,
and how horrifying that was.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.870
And Jerome Robbins, who
was a famous director

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.975
and choreographer and
sort of theater Yoda,

00:08:54.975 --> 00:08:57.350
came down to look at the show
and said, well, the opening

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.070
number is all wrong.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.111
The opening number is this
charming little number

00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:01.670
called "Love Is In
the Air" and then

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.770
the show is this wild knockabout
farce slapstick, bad puns,

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.170
you know, whatever.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.570
Said, it's not a charming show.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.360
It's a funny, noisy show.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.700
So write a funny, simple,
funny, noisy opening

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.470
number that says what
you're going to see

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.210
is a funny, noisy show.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.206
And Stephen Sondheim wrote
"Comedy Tonight" out of town

00:09:20.206 --> 00:09:22.580
and literally changed the
fortunes of the show overnight.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.500
It went into the first
preview in New York

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.900
and the show went from
being a disastrous flop

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.360
to being a long running
hit and still revived today

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.340
all the time.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.042
So opening numbers
can do that for you.

00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:35.750
When they're wrong,
they really hurt you.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.980
And when they're
right, they really

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.900
will carry you through
the first 15 or 20

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.760
minutes of a show because
the audience knows where

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.634
they are and they know
where they want to go,

00:09:42.634 --> 00:09:44.826
where they're going to
be, and all of that.

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:46.700
AARON ZEMACH: And then
you say the next thing

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.824
that you're looking for
after the opening number is

00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:51.950
the "wants" song of the show,
which you say it's the one

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.740
thing that no matter what, a
show typically needs to have

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.002
in order to be successful.

00:09:56.002 --> 00:09:57.710
So what is it about
the story structure--

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.955
JACK VIERTEL: Yeah,
this is interesting.

00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:00.390
Or I hope it's interesting.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.990
Maybe it's not.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.020
Musicals, unlike almost any
other form of storytelling

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.780
that I know of,
need to be powered

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:14.207
by somebody who desperately
wants to accomplish something.

00:10:14.207 --> 00:10:15.290
That's not true of movies.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.120
In movies-- movies
can-- there are

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.760
many, many successful movies
about some schlub walking down

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.400
the street and, you know,
something falls out of a window

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.130
and he finds himself transformed
back into the 19th century

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.650
or whatever.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.112
And he has to cope.

00:10:28.112 --> 00:10:30.320
Musicals can't be about
someone who just has to cope.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.440
They almost always have to
be-- there are exceptions

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.130
to everything, I'm saying I want
to preface this little screed

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.125
by saying that--

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:40.250
there are some shows that
don't follow these rules.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.430
But musicals are
almost always powered

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.650
by someone who wants
to achieve something,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.810
passionately wants
to fight for it,

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.390
and is willing to
virtually die to get it.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.140
And I think the reason
for that is that musicals

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.340
keep stopping and starting.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.020
Musicals are locals.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.212
And they stop for a song.

00:10:58.212 --> 00:10:59.420
They stop for a scene change.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.711
They stop for a costume change.

00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:02.960
They bring in a subplot.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.090
It's very hard for
the audience not

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.050
to get bored unless
there's somebody saying,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.110
I am, you know,
Alexander Hamilton

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.540
and I have absolutely
no credibility.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.150
I come from a small
island in the Caribbean.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.530
I'm illegitimate.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.440
And yet I'm going to fight
my way into this new country,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.600
and turn it into a
country, and fight a war

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.060
to make it a country, and
nothing is going to stop me.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.800
I mean, that is so--

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.180
you get on that ride.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.170
You want to know--

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.430
is he gonna or not?

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.660
Even though we all know
that America happened.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.320
We want to know how he
contributed to it happening

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.540
and how it almost didn't happen.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.560
Absent that, there are very few
shows that actually succeed.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.910
I can think of a handful.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.480
But not many.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.815
And so that song,
that "I want" song,

00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:50.690
there are actually two
of them in "Hamilton,"

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.640
just so you get it.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.380
The opening number
includes some,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.110
and then there's "My Shot."

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:02.310
That opening song is
such a generic thing,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.130
by which I don't mean it's
generic in the sense of it

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.550
being bad, but it's
a genre unto itself.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.600
So you have "Wouldn't it
be Loverly" from "My Fair

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.160
Lady," and "Some People"
from "Gypsy," and "My Shot"

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.754
from "Hamilton," and
"Free" from "A Funny Thing

00:12:19.754 --> 00:12:21.420
Happened on the Way
to the Forum," which

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.110
is a show about
someone who wants--

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.070
a slave who wants to be free.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.040
They come in all different
sizes and styles.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.990
But they always seem to
come somehow or other.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:37.380
Even the abstract ones, like
the one from "West Side Story,"

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.470
"Something's Coming,
Something Good,"

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.870
which he doesn't
know what it is.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.870
All he knows is he wants
to get out of this gang

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.480
and off of the streets
and into a better life.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.090
And it's sort of
a brilliant song

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.090
because it's someone
yearning for something

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.700
and he has no name for it.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.350
And yet, by the end
of the song, you

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.440
are following-- you know I'm
following that young man's

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.500
story.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.590
That's where I'm
going to invest.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.047
And it's a unique
musical theater thing.

00:13:04.047 --> 00:13:05.880
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah,
it's interesting to hear

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.629
that list you bring
up of all these shows,

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:10.980
from "My Fair Lady" to "West
Side Story" to "Hamilton."

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.400
And in the back, you talk
about how throughout the book

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.170
you quote lyrics from
"The Wedding Singer"

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.330
and know lyrics even
from "South Pacific."

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.580
So as you were going through
and looking for examples,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.680
was there any rhyme or reason
for how you looked for, like,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.420
what's the ideal
show to highlight

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.830
a "want" song or highlight
an opening number?

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.371
JACK VIERTEL: You know, I don't
think there is an ideal show.

00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:33.272
But you find the ones--

00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:34.730
I mean, when I was
teaching, I used

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.040
to find the ones that
were unequivocal.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.874
And then use the
"West Side Story" one

00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:41.040
as a way of saying, you
know, they can be equivocal,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.230
but they still have to be there.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.000
So a song like "Some
People" in "Gypsy,"

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.460
where Madame Rose
basically says,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.380
I'm going to get my
kids out of here.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.480
I'm going to turn them
into stars in vaudeville.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.855
I know just how I'm going to
do it because I had a dream,

00:13:52.855 --> 00:13:54.380
and here's what
was in the dream.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.710
And all she's really doing is
asking her father to loan her

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.290
some money so she
can leave town.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.360
And he doesn't want
to loan her any money.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.700
But it sets up
this character who

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.060
you think is slightly
scary and somewhat

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.150
insane, but fascinating
nonetheless,

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.650
and is going on a journey.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.560
And this is another
reality about--

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.240
it's really true of
any story, but it's

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.114
particularly true of
musical theater stories.

00:14:19.114 --> 00:14:21.440
The harder the journey is,
and the more opposition

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.810
you're going to meet along
the way, the more interesting

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.309
it is.

00:14:24.309 --> 00:14:26.690
Because that story--
any kind of story--

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.060
is essentially like an
athletic contest, right?

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.590
I mean, you go to
a baseball game

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.170
or you go to a football
game or a basketball game,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.330
you want the
interesting characters,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.284
the people with certain
kinds of virtuoso gifts.

00:14:38.284 --> 00:14:40.700
But you also want to find out
who's going to win the game.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.250
And this group of
people is going

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.690
to try to stop that group of
people from winning the game.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.190
And a story is
kind of like that.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:52.350
So when Madam Rose sets
out on this journey,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.530
she wants to make her two small
children stars in vaudeville.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.030
Vaudeville has not existed in
so many years that many of you

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.410
may not even know what it was.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.510
But it was a kind of
touring variety show that

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.490
would go around the
country in the days

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.680
long before there
were sound movies or--

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.790
radio had been
invented, basically.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.910
Although vaudeville
predates radio, as well.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.530
So she wants to make her two
daughters-- who are, like,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.120
seven and nine--

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.380
into kitty stars in vaudeville.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.210
What she doesn't
seem to understand

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.350
is that they're not talented,
they're not interested--

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.510
one of them is kind of
interested, but not really,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.534
and the other one is
completely not interested--

00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:34.950
and vaudeville is a dying art
that's not going to be there

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.310
for very much longer.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.400
So there's no way
for her to succeed

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.009
in getting what she wants.

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:41.550
But that's what
makes it interesting.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.730
Because she won't stop.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.760
If the story is milder, and
there's less going on in it,

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.470
we're less likely
to be interested.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.132
When "The Wedding
Singer," which is--

00:15:51.132 --> 00:15:53.340
I tell this story only
because poor "Wedding Singer,"

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.060
it was kind of charming,
hapless show that I worked on--

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.730
was in previews, and I
was teaching the class,

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.157
one of the producers said to
me, so how would you compare--

00:16:04.157 --> 00:16:05.490
I mean, I know we're in trouble.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.331
But how would you compare the
story of "The Wedding Singer"

00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:09.330
to the story of "Gypsy"?

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:14.257
Because I had just given a
two-hour section on "Gypsy."

00:16:14.257 --> 00:16:16.590
And I said, well, I said
"Gypsy" is about this woman who

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.990
has these two children
who aren't talented

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.850
and the business is dying.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.030
And she's going to make them
stars anyway or die trying.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.417
It's a great mountain to
watch someone try to climb.

00:16:26.417 --> 00:16:28.500
"The Wedding Singer" is
about a wedding singer who

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.120
wants to be a wedding singer.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.080
It's not about
anything, you know?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.910
And so how do you--

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.480
what's the audience
watching, exactly?

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.270
And the producer was not
happy to hear me say that.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.710
But, sadly, it turned
out to be true.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.020
It's a very-- it's a show with a
lot of charming elements in it,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.720
but it just doesn't--

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.400
it's not worth going on
that journey, you know?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.189
Especially at $150 a ticket.

00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:55.480
AARON ZEMACH: It's interesting,
thinking about "Gypsy,"

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.696
and even about vaudeville,
that in addition

00:16:57.696 --> 00:16:59.820
to talking about all these
things that a show needs

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.278
to have to serve
the story, there's

00:17:01.278 --> 00:17:05.520
also things like star
moments, and the main event

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.016
in the second act, and sort
of the spectacle pieces

00:17:08.016 --> 00:17:09.599
that might not need
to serve the story

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.654
but are part of the
theater experience.

00:17:11.654 --> 00:17:14.520
So I'm curious how you feel
like those play with the need

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.530
for a modern story
musical, and also this

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.619
need to go to the theater
and pay $150 for a ticket

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.605
and see some sort of
spectacle that I'm expecting?

00:17:22.605 --> 00:17:24.230
JACK VIERTEL: I think
you want to see--

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.630
I think people go to the
theater to be engaged

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.850
by live entertainment
in a way that

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.480
is simply different from
watching a movie or a TV show.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.830
And one of the--

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.520
or watching something on
your laptop or your iPad

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.160
or whatever.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.850
One of the things about live
entertainment is it's live.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.870
And it's actual people up there.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.750
And so one of the
reasons you go is

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.500
to watch real people, just
like yourself but presumably

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.020
more talented, at
what they're doing.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.720
You may have other talents.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.010
Clear the hurdles, you know?

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.960
You want to see them--

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.850
can they do it?

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.430
Can Al Pacino play
Shylock, you know?

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.920
What's that going to be like?

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.770
And sometimes that's an
individual performer, a star

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.670
or person giving a
star performance,

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.430
even if they're
not a star, where

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.340
you're watching human
endeavor performed

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.740
by an actual human being.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.434
It's a very-- that
also, in a way,

00:18:19.434 --> 00:18:20.600
is like an athletic contest.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.780
It's fun to watch someone hit
a home run or intercept a pass

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.120
and run 70 yards with a ball.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.500
You want to see that live.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.360
You want to be startled by what
the capacity for human behavior

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.630
is and the delivery
of human emotion.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.430
And it's the reason
we laugh and cry

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:40.190
and we get excited
at the theater.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.120
Sometimes, however,
that's also the spectacle

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.720
of what we can do on
a live stage, which

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.230
is so much less than you can
do in a movie or a television

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.230
show.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.130
But it's real.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.020
It's actually real.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.280
I mean, the flying
monkeys in "Wicked"

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.760
may be on ropes
that you can see,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.260
but nonetheless,
there are people

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.600
flying around the theater flying
around you in the theater.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.750
And, you know, you get excited
by that stuff just because

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.870
of the humanness of it.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.650
And I think as we get into a
more and more technologically

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.100
advanced world-- and there's
no way that that's ever going

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.140
to stop, we're on a, I
mean, unless humanity ends,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.950
we're on a trajectory for more
and more invention in that

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.700
way--

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.600
the need to have contact with
human beings doing this stuff

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.980
gets bigger, not smaller.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.950
And I think it's
one of the reasons

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.783
that the theater has
become more successful,

00:19:30.783 --> 00:19:32.990
not less successful,
as we go along

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.570
this wave of
technological innovation.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.737
We want to see those people.

00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:37.528
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah.

00:19:37.528 --> 00:19:38.210
For sure.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.760
It's also really interesting to
hear you talk about your work

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.320
developing a new show.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.412
I'm kind of curious beyond
the want, and for the want

00:19:45.412 --> 00:19:47.870
of a show, when you're seeing
a new show for the first time

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.670
or reading the script
for the first time,

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.510
is there anything particular
that you zoom in on and say,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.740
oh, this is a sign that
this is something special,

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.617
or oh, this is a sign that we
need to go into triage mode--

00:19:59.617 --> 00:20:01.200
JACK VIERTEL: There's
a lot of things.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.000
And I think that nothing
beats good material.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.620
But what is good material?

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.740
Well, good material can just
be exciting on its own terms.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.430
A great song or a great
speech or a great scene.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.100
But good material,
really, when you're

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.140
talking about a musical--

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.750
and I've worked on a lot of
nonmusical plays as well,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.060
but that's sort of
another subject--

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.670
when you're talking
about a musical that's

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.440
a story, as opposed
to something that's

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.790
just a collection of songs,
like Smokey Joe's Cafe

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.860
or whatever, if
you're really trying

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.640
to tell a story, what I
look for is, first of all,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.220
are the characters outsized
and interesting enough

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.150
to hold my attention?

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.560
And is the problem
they're trying

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.540
to solve interesting enough?

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.210
I should have stopped with "The
Wedding Singer" on day one,

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.130
but I didn't.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.080
And then does the story
get told all the way

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.100
through to a satisfying climax,
to where, at the end of it,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.620
the audience will
feel, oh, I get it.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.780
I know why I sat
here and watched this

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.490
because I got an
outcome that was

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.130
both inevitable and
surprising at the same time.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.985
And it was worth it.

00:21:06.985 --> 00:21:09.110
And it was worth it because
it made me feel things.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.430
And it made me think things.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.810
But all of that
is in the context

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.600
of a story that comes to
an end, in the same way

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.880
that kids like to have
bedtime stories that

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.850
have a good structure and
a good ending to them.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.940
One of the things that is so
important in that process,

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.610
and I always look for it
when I'm reading a script,

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.880
is something that we call
the second to last scene

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.234
because it's the
second to last scene.

00:21:35.234 --> 00:21:36.650
Sort of like
"Alice's Restaurant."

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:43.870
But anyway, there comes a moment
when everything pulls together.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.900
And it's usually not
musicalized in a musical.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.590
It's usually spoken, when
either the two main characters,

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.510
or in some way or
other two people--

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.190
it's almost always two--

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.900
get together and
look at each other

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.540
and they actually
treat the audience

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.430
to what was this all about?

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.570
Why did we do this?

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.890
Why did we have this fight?

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.290
Why was I trying to get this?

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.870
And did I get it or not?

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.130
And sometimes it
can be very direct.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.270
The two I like to quote,
because one is direct

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.610
and the other is thematic, is at
the end of a very long argument

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.800
in a dressing room at
the end of "Gypsy,"

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.174
the mother finally gives up.

00:22:24.174 --> 00:22:25.840
This mother, who has
pushed her children

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.460
and pushed her children and
pushed her children-- one

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.860
of them has run away and gotten
married and the other one

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.990
has become a stripper,
the most famous stripper

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.730
in the world, Gypsy Rose Lee.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.310
And the mother is now-- who
was the most powerful character

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.250
in the show-- is now
stripped of all of her power

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.060
because Gypsy is so famous
and the mother is nobody.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.890
And the mother says,
all right, I give up.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.480
Basically, you win.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.800
I just want to know one thing.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.380
Everything that I
did for you kids,

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.574
all the ways I saved and
scrimped and sewed our costumes

00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:56.740
and did everything, got us
from one town to another,

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.210
why did I do it?

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.910
And the daughter says, I
thought you did it for me.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.620
And that's what
that show is about.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.620
And in that moment, an audience
that's been watching the show,

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.600
thinking maybe it's
about show business

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.870
and maybe it's about family
and maybe it's about both,

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.320
you suddenly coalesce
around this idea

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.380
that this mother has done all
these things for her children

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.224
that she really was
doing for herself.

00:23:19.224 --> 00:23:20.890
And her daughter has
just called her out

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.431
about it for the
first time and said,

00:23:22.431 --> 00:23:24.370
I thought you were
doing it for me.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:30.010
And it's like a big cymbal crash
at that moment in that show.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.560
And the other one,
which is so different--

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.480
and the same, because it's
also a question and an answer--

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.719
is a thematic moment at the
end of "Fiddler on the Roof."

00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:41.260
At the end of "Fiddler
on the Roof"--

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.900
and these are two characters who
are not important characters--

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.230
as everybody is planning to
leave Anatevka and this little

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.260
village is about to be destroyed
and disappear forever from

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.470
the face of the earth and this
little group of Jews is about

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.310
to go wandering across Russia,
out of Russia into wherever,

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.510
to America, to Palestine,
to wherever they're going,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.020
one of the villagers turns
to the rabbi and says, rabbi,

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.480
all our lives we've been
waiting for the Messiah to come.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.120
Wouldn't this be a good
time for him to come?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.290
And the rabbi says, we'll have
to wait for him someplace else.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.020
Now, that's not about the
story of "Fiddler on the Roof."

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.750
That's about the whole
history of the Jews.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.640
And it lands with
an audience in a way

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.539
that they almost
gasp when he says it,

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:24.580
even though it's nothing.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.790
It's a song cue, basically.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.750
And they sing their
little Anatevka song.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.240
But those moments,
when they work,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.730
make you feel like you
know why you were there.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.880
You were there to witness
something in human history

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.600
happening.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.380
Or something in people's
emotional lives happening right

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.700
in front of your eyes.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.050
And that's why we go, I think.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.870
And in musicals, it's all
elevated because of music.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.156
If there was no
music, we would just

00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:50.530
talk to each other
like this, you

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.480
know, the way people talk
in an Arthur Miller play.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.938
And, yes, the
language is elevated.

00:24:53.938 --> 00:24:55.270
It's somewhat poetic.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.360
And it's not really like
people chitchatting.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.760
But it's still in
the realm of realism.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.560
Musicals take it up from there.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.810
That doesn't make them better.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.954
It just makes it a different
way of telling you a story.

00:25:07.954 --> 00:25:08.870
AARON ZEMACH: Awesome.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.286
So in just a minute we're going
to open up the microphones

00:25:11.286 --> 00:25:12.800
to Q&amp;A from the audience.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.190
So feel free to line up
for any question you've

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.860
ever had about Broadway theater
but have been afraid to ask.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.861
JACK VIERTEL: Almost none
of which I can answer.

00:25:19.861 --> 00:25:21.526
AARON ZEMACH: Before
we do that, though,

00:25:21.526 --> 00:25:22.960
I just have one other question.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.700
If you had to give
one piece of advice

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.810
to an aspiring Broadway
composer, Broadway librettist,

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.630
or book writer, what would
that piece of advice be?

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.086
JACK VIERTEL:
Interesting question.

00:25:37.086 --> 00:25:38.460
I think in the
broadest sense, it

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.810
would be write about people
more interesting than yourself.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.640
Don't write a musical
about what it's

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.130
like to get up in the
morning and go to work.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.822
Write a musical
about somebody who,

00:25:49.822 --> 00:25:51.780
even if they're a lower
middle class person who

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.446
gets up in the morning
and goes to work,

00:25:53.446 --> 00:25:56.940
is in some way or other an
amazing and compelling figure.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.860
Because if you don't
do that, you're

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.250
not using what music can do.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.700
You're just wasting music.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.340
Because music takes you
into that higher realm.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.370
So write about-- when you
think about the great musicals

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.650
and who they're about,
they're almost never

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.790
about average Joes.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.380
And when they are
and they succeed--

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.546
I always point to "Company"
as sort of the exception

00:26:18.546 --> 00:26:20.430
to, well, so many
different rules--

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.650
when they succeed, it's
because of two things.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.060
It's because the
basic subject matter

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.640
is compelling and interesting,
even if the characters are not

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.230
particularly so.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.100
And the skill and inspiration
with which the work is done

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.910
is at such a high level that
you can't get out of its way.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.262
It's just too brilliant
not to interest you.

00:26:43.262 --> 00:26:44.970
But "Company"'s a
tough show because it's

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.040
about a average, everyday guy.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.811
And it has always been
just marginally less

00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:52.560
than completely
successful, even though it

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.512
was revolutionary in its time.

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:55.470
And I think that's why.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.559
It's not about an
interesting person.

00:26:57.559 --> 00:26:58.350
AARON ZEMACH: Sure.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.430
So we've got some
questions over here.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:01.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.790
Thank you for coming.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.710
You touched on this a
little bit in your talk,

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.730
but you mentioned
that in the 80s,

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.280
Broadway was not doing so good.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.815
Right now it seems to me that
Broadway is doing pretty good.

00:27:10.815 --> 00:27:11.940
First of all, is that true?

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.314
Is Broadway doing
well right now?

00:27:13.314 --> 00:27:16.075
And second, if so, what
do you ascribe that to?

00:27:16.075 --> 00:27:17.950
JACK VIERTEL: It's doing
very well right now.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.130
But it's important to
distinguish between Broadway

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.449
as a business and each
individual show as a business.

00:27:23.449 --> 00:27:25.740
The number of shows that
succeed versus the number that

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.510
fail probably hasn't
changed very much.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.960
The ones that really
succeed run so much longer

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.670
than shows ever used to run
that they lift the numbers

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.910
and you can't find a
theater to go into.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.620
There are no vacant theaters.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.110
So, yes, it's a
very good business.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.870
And the reason is tourism.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.240
That's the big reason.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:50.200
Someone asked somebody in a
talk like this a few years ago,

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.650
what's the most important
innovation in the theater

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.910
in your lifetime?

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.720
And he said, the jet airplane.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.980
And, of course, it has nothing
to do with the theater.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.250
There is so much wider an
audience coming to the theater

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.190
now than there was when I was
going to the theater in the 60s

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.500
or when I was working in
the theater in the 80s.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.190
It's crazy.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.020
And if you don't believe
me, just go to Times Square.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.520
You'll never want
to go there again.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.880
AARON ZEMACH: Over here.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.780
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to say thanks

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.280
for spreading the word about
the importance of the structure

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.650
underlying Broadway musicals.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.177
I took BMI workshop
a couple of years ago

00:28:22.177 --> 00:28:24.510
and it's like a small group
of folks who know this stuff

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.730
and remembered it and pass it on
from generation to generation.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.464
And it just revolutionizes
the way you look at musicals.

00:28:30.464 --> 00:28:32.880
I actually wanted to object
to the "Wedding Singer" stuff.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.610
I think I saw that show because
it was free a couple of years

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:36.225
ago.

00:28:36.225 --> 00:28:38.683
And I thought, oh no, this is
going to be terrible, wedding

00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:39.630
singer, it was free.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.236
I thought it was a great show.

00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:43.110
It was a silly movie
and a silly, silly show,

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.974
but I thought everything
worked structurally

00:28:44.974 --> 00:28:46.140
and the songs were charming.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.740
So if you were involved in that,
then thank you for doing it.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.510
JACK VIERTEL: Well,
I appreciate that.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.000
It's almost the first
time anyone's ever

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.990
said anything nice about--

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.220
AUDIENCE: It was really good.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.636
JACK VIERTEL: I
have to say that I

00:28:54.636 --> 00:28:56.760
saw a workshop of "The
Wedding Singer" which

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.870
was a no sets, no costumes,
just people acting and dancing

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.730
and talking.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.480
And I was very taken
with it, which is why

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.786
I came on board to work on it.

00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:06.660
And it wasn't until I
was in the middle of it

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.090
that I realized that
for all its charms,

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.400
it never lifts itself
above a certain level.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.840
And that just wasn't enough
for a high priced ticket

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.830
to a Broadway musical.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.774
It just wasn't enough.

00:29:21.774 --> 00:29:23.440
But thank you for
saying that about BMI.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.060
I owe a lot to Lehman
Engel, who wrote

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:32.050
the first books about this stuff
and created the BMI workshop.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.361
It's a great place to
learn all this stuff.

00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:35.610
Then, of course, you have to--

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.840
once you understand
all the rules,

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.280
you have to figure out
how to break some of them

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.738
to write something
really original.

00:29:39.738 --> 00:29:41.100
But it's good to know.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.600
If you're going to
break rules, it's

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.558
always best to know what
they are, seems to me.

00:29:46.854 --> 00:29:47.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.210
I'm Julia.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.340
I actually work
on the Google team

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.060
that helps Broadway advertise
on YouTube and Google.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.620
So very happy that you're here.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.849
I had a question about Encores!

00:29:57.849 --> 00:29:59.390
because I think that
they're awesome.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.015
I just went to, well, I guess,
a couple of years ago, "Violet."

00:30:02.015 --> 00:30:03.670
And then transitioned
to Broadway.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.628
So it made me think, you
know, as you were just

00:30:05.628 --> 00:30:08.940
saying earlier, like
80% of Broadway shows

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.420
do not return their investment.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.590
So people come out at
a loss financially.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.520
And with Encores!

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.380
being that they for all
intents and purposes

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.740
are a full scale Broadway
show with the set

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.200
and the full orchestra, and
you get a lot of big names,

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.920
as well, how do you guys
make that work financially

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.180
if it's such a short period?

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.090
I know that some shows do end
up going to Broadway but most

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.034
of them don't.

00:30:31.034 --> 00:30:31.950
JACK VIERTEL: Encores!

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.070
is a not-for-profit, like a
museum or a symphony orchestra

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.080
or a ballet company.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.500
So we expect to get between 55%
and 60% of the cost of a show

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.380
back from the box office.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.080
And the other
majority share comes

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.380
from foundations, corporations,
corporations like yourself,

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.260
and individual donors.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.507
So it's a money--

00:30:57.507 --> 00:31:00.090
from a commercial point of view,
it's a money losing business.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:01.830
But like all of those
other institutions,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.000
it's designed to be a
money losing business.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.650
So you have to have financial
supporters who float the thing.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:13.590
And because there's enough
of that, we're able to do it.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.650
But it doesn't--

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.922
I mean, the shows that
move to Broadway--

00:31:16.922 --> 00:31:18.630
and there have been
probably half a dozen

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.844
over the course of 24 years--

00:31:21.844 --> 00:31:23.760
the only one that really
made a bunch of money

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.289
is "Chicago," which
continues to keep running

00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:28.080
and continues to pay
royalties to Encores!,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.040
among other royalty recipients.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.922
But that's not ever
how we've figured

00:31:33.922 --> 00:31:35.130
we were going to stay afloat.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.570
We were going to
stay afloat from what

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.900
we call honored income, which
is income that's donated.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.250
You mentioned that overtures
are becoming scarce these days.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.470
And that raised the
question in my mind

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:55.080
about where you think-- if you
think musicals are evolving

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.420
in structure or in music.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.920
Because I was
thinking, you know,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.950
you hear about
mold-breaking musicals

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.430
like "Book of Mormon"
or "Hamilton."

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.352
But to me, those are
still-- like, according

00:32:07.352 --> 00:32:09.060
to the structures you
were talking about,

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.250
they still sort of fit that
mold a little bit, you know,

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:11.820
with the language.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.028
And "Book of Mormon" might
be breaking the mold a bit

00:32:14.028 --> 00:32:16.245
or that the music
in "Hamilton" might

00:32:16.245 --> 00:32:17.370
be breaking the mold a bit.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.460
But do you see, as
things have been

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.937
progressing over the
years, any changes in--

00:32:22.937 --> 00:32:25.020
JACK VIERTEL: Oh, there
have been enormous changes

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:30.720
to music as well as to
the shows themselves.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.139
Just to take them as slightly
separate issues, musically,

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:35.430
what's happened-- and the
reason I think you don't hear

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.780
overtures as much--

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.570
is that finally,
after, you know,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.880
decades and decades and
decades of resisting,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.110
Broadway has broken down.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.981
And so what you're hearing
on Broadway, at least

00:32:45.981 --> 00:32:47.730
in terms of orchestration
and arrangement,

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.410
is basically pop music.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.419
It's not orchestral music.

00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:54.210
And that's because,
you know, rock and roll

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.000
has been here for
60 or 70 years.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.750
So it's about time.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.845
But the result of that is a
couple of different results.

00:33:02.845 --> 00:33:05.220
You don't hear overtures in
part because you don't really

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.840
have orchestras anymore.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.980
You have bands.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.650
And a band playing an
overture seems sort

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:11.880
of foolish somehow or other.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.520
So you get these little preludes
and then the action starts.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.440
Also, I think people--

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.310
and this is partly
Google's fault--

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.800
people are not actually
comfortable sitting

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.644
and listening to an
orchestra anymore.

00:33:22.644 --> 00:33:25.060
If an orchestra starts playing,
they take out their iPhone

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.260
and check their email.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.806
And so the purpose
of an overture,

00:33:27.806 --> 00:33:30.430
which was to get you in the mood
for an evening in the theater,

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.170
is sort of something
old fashioned

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.750
that we don't really
quite believe in anymore.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.936
The other thing
that's happened is--

00:33:39.936 --> 00:33:41.310
it's a musical
question in a way,

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.620
but leaving aside the actual
question of music is--

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:50.310
shows like "American Idiot" and
others, like "School of Rock,"

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.874
I think are--

00:33:51.874 --> 00:33:53.790
"School of Rock" is
somewhat more traditional.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.330
But there are so many
elements of the rock concert

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.860
itself in them.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.440
And rock concerts
became so theatrical,

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.680
in terms of lights
and smoke and sound

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.740
and costumes and everything,
that we're seeing

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.179
that line blur a little bit.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.540
So the story musical
that really tells a story

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:17.110
all the way through is not the
only musical in town anymore.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.760
I think the ones like
"American Idiot" that

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.040
can't decide whether
they're a story musical

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.139
or not tend to suffer.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.300
And that show, which
got fabulous reviews

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.400
and didn't run nearly as
long as people predicted

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.510
it would, for an audience was
like, what is this exactly?

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.739
Am I listening to an album
or am I watching a story?

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.560
And if I'm watching a story,
why am I not interested

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.643
in these three characters?

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:40.860
Well, because we didn't make
them interesting enough,

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.239
you know?

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.389
But that's happening.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:46.178
And what that evolution
will lead to, I don't know.

00:34:46.178 --> 00:34:47.969
Musical theater is
always evolving, though.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.409
I mean, if you look back to--

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.270
those of you who would dare--

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.150
to Sigmund Romberg and Rudolf
Friml all the operettas

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.710
of the first part
of the 20th century

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.210
and look at Rodgers
and Hammerstein,

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.890
or look at the
Gershwin shows and then

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.639
look at the Rodgers
and Hammerstein shows,

00:35:00.639 --> 00:35:03.270
and look at the Sondheim shows
and look at what's followed.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.910
"Rent."

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.130
Everything is
evolving all the time.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.930
Even the earth is
evolving all the time.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:13.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.580
Thanks for coming.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.140
This has been quite
educational, as I'm writing

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.080
my own musical outside of work.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.290
But my question has to
do with ticket prices.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:29.780
I was wondering what is
Broadway currently doing

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.060
and what should they do
better to include people

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.940
from different
socioeconomic backgrounds,

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.536
bringing them into
Broadway shows?

00:35:36.536 --> 00:35:38.660
JACK VIERTEL: Well, there's
two questions, I think,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:39.826
wrapped up in that question.

00:35:39.826 --> 00:35:41.390
One is about pricing.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:46.300
And the other is just about
outreach in some way or other.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.130
In terms of pricing,
what we're seeing

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:54.080
is now that dynamic
pricing is really possible,

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.420
which I mean not only high
prices but prices that

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.060
change every other minute
like a stock market,

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.790
almost, you're seeing very,
very, very high prices,

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.360
which is a good news story.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.990
But you're also seeing
steeply discounted prices,

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.960
assuming you don't want to
go to "Hamilton" tonight,

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.350
because there is inventory,
what we call inventory.

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.380
It's like the number of
seats on an airplane.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.629
And, you know, if they're
not sold at a certain point,

00:36:19.629 --> 00:36:22.400
they're not worth anything to
the producer or their show.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.070
So you're seeing lotteries
and you're seeing--

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.840
it's harder to get cheaper
tickets than to get--

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.870
getting expensive
tickets is easy.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:33.110
You pay a huge premium and
they'll bring the tickets

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.157
right to your door.

00:36:34.157 --> 00:36:35.990
But if you're willing
to fight a little bit,

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.531
there actually are still ways
of getting into Broadway shows.

00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:41.150
Not at a cheap price, but at
a price that a lot of people

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.440
can still afford.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.690
In terms of outreach, I don't
think we do a very good job.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.110
But I do think that the
not-for-profit theater does

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:48.830
a good job.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.820
The theaters like the
Public and Lincoln Center

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.740
and all around the
country, places

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.780
like Center Stage in
Baltimore and the Arena

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.360
Stage in Washington,
they really feel

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.300
mission driven to do
outreach to different kinds

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.400
of cultural communities.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.780
I wish we did more
of it than we do.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.240
But we don't.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.082
Part of the reason we don't, I
think, is that to some degree

00:37:11.082 --> 00:37:13.040
because we're a commercial
business, everything

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.070
we do is driven toward
maximizing profits, which I

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.360
think is a sort of short view.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.320
But nonetheless
that is the view.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.430
Whereas not-for-profit theaters
are mission driven, rather than

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.220
profit driven.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.290
And so they feel
part of their mission

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.670
is to get people into the
theater who have never

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.110
come to the theater before.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.020
We do a little of that through
the theater development fund.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.470
But not as much as we should.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.509
AUDIENCE: I have, I guess,
more comments than questions.

00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:39.800
I'm sorry that you mentioned
"Company," because as soon

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.320
as you talked about
the want driven show,

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.750
that was my first
counter-example.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.430
But you stole that from me.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.554
But I still think--

00:37:48.554 --> 00:37:49.970
what happens in
that show, though,

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.689
is that the character
finds out what they want.

00:37:52.689 --> 00:37:54.980
And I think the high point
of that show is being alive,

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.313
where they suddenly realize
that they did want something

00:37:57.313 --> 00:37:58.290
all along.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:58.830
Is that--

00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.350
JACK VIERTEL: I'm sorry.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.150
There's something like a
big noise behind me so I--

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.270
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
was saying that--

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:03.440
JACK VIERTEL: When you
got to the question part

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.247
I didn't hear it.

00:38:04.247 --> 00:38:06.080
AUDIENCE: Well, in
"Company," it seems to me

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.350
that the character doesn't want
something from the beginning.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.544
But they realize,
in being alive,

00:38:11.544 --> 00:38:12.710
that they do want something.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.980
JACK VIERTEL: Right.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.534
AUDIENCE: That's
what you've been--

00:38:14.534 --> 00:38:15.950
maybe that's what
pulls you along,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.741
not that the character
has a definite want,

00:38:17.741 --> 00:38:20.270
but that you see that maybe
he does want something that he

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.395
doesn't know that he wants.

00:38:21.395 --> 00:38:22.700
JACK VIERTEL: Yeah.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.770
I mean, it's a very--

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:24.270
look.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.770
"Company"'s a very experimental
show in so many different ways.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:28.730
It doesn't have a plot.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.870
It has a series of
sketches, basically.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.680
It's almost like a review.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.460
The songs aren't actually
dynamic, emotional things

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.510
between characters.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:39.219
They're comments.

00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:41.426
They're, generally speaking,
commenting on the action

00:38:41.426 --> 00:38:43.160
rather than being
part of the action.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.380
It did so many things
so brilliantly.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.980
And as a comment on American
marriage and New York,

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.910
it was so scabrous and
fearless that I think you

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.770
can't discount its brilliance.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.080
And it does have an "I
want" song at the very end.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.880
But for a lot of audiences
who were not cutting edge

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.730
audiences-- they were just Sam
and Rose from the Upper West

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.870
Side who wanted to
go to the theater--

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.500
they would rather have
been at something that had,

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.380
you know, they would
have preferred something

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.050
that delivered a more
traditional story in a more

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.940
traditional way.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.090
But the reason I cite
"Company" in particular

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.730
is because Bobby,
that character,

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.710
is actually not a very
interesting character

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.360
for a very long
time in the show.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.160
He finally comes
to a realization

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.650
at the end of the show
that makes it interesting

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:35.420
and makes you feel like
it was worth your time.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.700
But, basically, what was
worth your time in "Company"

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.055
is the brilliance of
the actual material.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.400
It doesn't deliver
satisfaction in the way

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.310
that a typical story
delivers satisfaction.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.720
It has other elements
that are fascinating.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.710
And, you know, it's one
of my favorite shows.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.168
I don't mean to
put it down at all.

00:39:56.168 --> 00:39:59.990
It just doesn't kick the
stone down the road in the way

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.120
that most shows do.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.050
AUDIENCE: My second question
was about economics.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.280
Wallace Shawn was just
here a week or two ago

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.010
talking about his new play,
which had a limited run.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:13.010
And he said, you know, I'm
here, but in a week it's closed

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.760
and it's sold out.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.339
So you can't see it.

00:40:15.339 --> 00:40:16.880
And I said, can't
you extend the run?

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.980
And he said, the
economics now are

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.080
such that you can either
have a limited run

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.260
or you can go to Broadway, which
is prohibitively expensive.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.050
Is that right?

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.560
Is there no Off-Broadway
extended run kind of--

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.280
JACK VIERTEL: There
is, but it's very rare.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.960
And I don't know
too much about it

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.470
because it really has to do with
Off-Broadway show economics.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.300
You know, what the
stagehands get paid

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.970
and what the theater rent
is and all that stuff,

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.290
which I know very little about.

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:45.060
I just know that in the
30 years I've been here,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.170
I've watched commercial
Off-Broadway theater go from

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:52.820
being a thriving business
to being a completely--

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.830
it's like watching a
lake that gets polluted

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:55.970
and everything dies.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.010
I mean, there's little
sprouts here and there.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.060
But there's not much left.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.035
And exactly why,
economically, I don't know.

00:41:02.035 --> 00:41:04.160
You'd need to have an
Off-Broadway producer explain

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.212
it to you.

00:41:05.212 --> 00:41:05.920
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.722
JACK VIERTEL: Yeah.

00:41:06.722 --> 00:41:08.180
AARON ZEMACH: So
I hate to do this,

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.350
but we have to end
a little early.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.060
So I think we probably have time
for these last two questions.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.070
Huge fan of Encores! and
a huge fan of Cole Porter,

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.470
so I'm very excited
for next week.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.942
And on that note, I've
been hoping for many years

00:41:20.942 --> 00:41:23.150
that Encores! would continue
to do Cole Porter stuff.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.350
And so I'm curious--

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:25.580
and some of the other
things that we all have

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.600
things that we'd love to see--

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.000
I'm curious if you could talk
a little bit about how you

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.130
choose what to do at Encores!

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.495
after decades of choosing
things that are exactly

00:41:33.495 --> 00:41:34.370
the right fit for it.

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.120
There are so many.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.580
How do you pick
three every season?

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.470
JACK VIERTEL: We-- just to be
brief and then I think we can

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.280
deal with all the questions,
or both of the questions--

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.680
we pick a show
that we want to do.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.440
And then we have to form
a season around that show,

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.390
because otherwise--
we do three shows.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.920
If you can only
pick one, there's

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.640
no way to pick the other two.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.800
So we start with something.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.640
And then we figure, well,
what can we do around that?

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.910
You know, the problem
that we're facing is--

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.550
and this year the show we picked
was "The New Yorkers," which

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.330
we wanted to do.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.280
And then the other two--

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.980
the idea is that the three
shows should be nothing alike

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.188
so that the audience doesn't
feel like they're seeing

00:42:12.188 --> 00:42:14.240
the same thing three times.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.250
The problem with Cole
Porter, and with all

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:18.260
of the greats from
that period is,

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.170
so we've now done the five
best Rodgers and Hart shows

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.650
and the four best Porter
shows and the four best

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:25.310
Gershwin shows.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.380
So now you're down to
the fifth best, you know.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.762
And it ain't that good,
to tell you the truth.

00:42:30.762 --> 00:42:32.720
So what we're doing in
"The New Yorkers," which

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.650
is quite a lost show that
people don't really know, is

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.620
for the first time, because
some of the score was lost,

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.161
we're actually importing
a couple of good songs

00:42:42.161 --> 00:42:43.160
from other Porter shows.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.020
AUDIENCE: Which he
famously was supportive of.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:45.410
JACK VIERTEL: Sorry?

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.650
AUDIENCE: Cole
Porter loved that.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:46.880
JACK VIERTEL: Yeah.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.110
And they did it in the show.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.700
They did it in "The New
Yorkers" originally.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.920
They were throwing songs out and
putting them in and everything.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.970
But we've never done it before.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.660
We've always tried to be, like,
deeply academically faithful.

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.560
But we've thrown caution
to the winds this time.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.769
AUDIENCE: Well,
thanks for doing it.

00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:01.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.018
JACK VIERTEL: Hi.

00:43:02.018 --> 00:43:03.517
AUDIENCE: Big fan, of course.

00:43:03.517 --> 00:43:04.850
I have sort of a silly question.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.370
But I can ask you.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.560
So I saw "Something Rotten."

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.070
And I just loved the song
that makes fun of musicals.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.390
JACK VIERTEL: Of musicals, yes.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.848
AUDIENCE: And I just wanted to
know your thought about that

00:43:16.848 --> 00:43:18.740
and if there's
other musicals that

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.480
have done that in the past.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.810
JACK VIERTEL: Well, there have,
particularly in the last 25

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.660
years or so, been musicals that
made fun of other musicals.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.370
Or, at least, quoted
other musicals.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.500
Or referenced other musicals.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.950
I mean, "Follies" is nothing--

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.740
it's many things, but
among other things,

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.812
is a series of tributes to
other composers and lyricists.

00:43:38.812 --> 00:43:40.270
And I think it's
a fun thing to do.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:41.540
And "Mormon" does it.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.790
I think "Mormon" does it
more brilliantly than anybody

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.550
because that "Little House of
Uncle Thomas" parody in act two

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.520
is just so--

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.770
whatever the hell it's called.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.050
Joseph Smith American Moses.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.935
It's one of the great, you
know, incredible things.

00:43:54.935 --> 00:43:56.810
You know, my feeling
about "Something Rotten"

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.540
is it never got better
after that number.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.260
And that was its
downfall in a way.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.176
I mean, it ran a year
and a half or something,

00:44:03.176 --> 00:44:05.810
but, you know, that number comes
about 20 minutes into act one

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.195
and nothing that good
ever happens again in it.

00:44:08.195 --> 00:44:10.070
So you just have to get
through it, you know?

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.642
But it was enough fun.

00:44:12.642 --> 00:44:13.350
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.445
JACK VIERTEL: Yeah.

00:44:14.445 --> 00:44:16.570
AARON ZEMACH: Thanks,
everyone, for your questions.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.210
I feel like everyone's going
to go buy tickets tonight, go

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.960
to Times Square, and
see a bunch of things

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.480
after being inspired by this.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.429
And I'd like to thank
Jack Viertel one more

00:44:24.429 --> 00:44:25.970
time for coming and
speaking with us.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.720
JACK VIERTEL: I'm so
happy to have been here.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.650
And I have to apologize
for having to run out.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.930
But, you know, yesterday
was a snow day.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:35.230
And so both yesterday and today
are happening to me today.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.689
So I have to go do
something that I

00:44:36.689 --> 00:44:37.896
was supposed to do yesterday.

00:44:37.896 --> 00:44:39.320
But thank you all
for being here.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.000
I really appreciate it.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.999
AARON ZEMACH: Thank you.

00:44:40.999 --> 00:44:44.020
[APPLAUSE]
