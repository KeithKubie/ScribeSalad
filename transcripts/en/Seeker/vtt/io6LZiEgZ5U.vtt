00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:09.360
If renewable energy is so awesome why haven’t
we pulled the plug on fossil fuels yet?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.459
Hey there light bulbs, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.289
If you watch this channel regularly, you’d
know that climate change is a serious looming

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.289
problem.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.860
In case you don’t watch often, I’ll catch
you up real fast: we’re burning too many

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.720
fossil fuels, releasing too much carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere, raising the planet’s

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.760
average temperature.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.500
As it goes up we see melting ice caps, sea
level rise, changes in rainfall patterns,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
the works.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.980
If burning fossil fuels is at the root of
the problem, why haven’t we kicked the dirty

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.980
habit yet?

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.079
You won’t be surprised to learn it’s complicated.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.809
Firstly, there’s the fact that power sources
like coal and natural gas are so entrenched.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.109
Edison built the first practical coal plant
in the United States in 1882.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.239
By 1961, coal was the major source of electricity.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.129
Americans haven’t really been able to get
off coal since.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.149
We have scaled it back; it generated 53% of
our power in 2000 but just 34% in 2015.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.620
But the ground coal gave up was taken over
by another fossil fuel: natural gas.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.480
New extraction techniques like fracking made
it cheaper, helping it take over some of coal’s

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.800
load and about 32% of our energy needs.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.210
While these sources are at the root of the
greenhouse gas problem, they do have certain

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.970
advantages over renewables.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.780
Namely they can ramp up output to meet demand.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.190
Solar and wind can’t do that; you only get
energy when the sun is shining and the wind

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.810
is blowing so we have to build capacitors
and batteries to store energy for when we

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.810
need more.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.570
Otherwise we’ll have to have some fossil
fuels or nuclear plants to meet demand.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.240
If renewables are going to pick up the torch
from fossil fuels completely, we’re going

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.130
to have to invest a lot of money.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.390
Happily as technology advances, investing
in renewables is looking more and more attractive.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.230
We’re getting to the point that building
and running new wind or solar facilities will

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.570
be competitive with coal and natural gas plants
over their lifetime.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.410
They’re more expensive up front, but their
fuel costs $0, so they become more reasonable

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.410
over time.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.210
The United States Department of Energy estimates
that a natural gas plant entering service

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.960
in 2018 will cost about $50 per Megawatt hour
of electricity generated, while a wind farm

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.630
will cost around $58.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.300
Photovoltaics are more expensive, at nearly
$81 per megawatt hour.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.700
That will translate to a higher electricity
bill, but a study from 2012 found most Americans

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.240
would accept an increase of up to $199 to
their annual electricity bill if it meant

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.569
going all renewable.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.900
Still, renewables will need a bit of help
by way of tax credits and subsidies to be

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.300
truly competitive.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.590
While that may sound unfair, keep in mind
that coal received over a billion dollars

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.720
in subsidies in 2013, while natural gas and
petroleum received 2.3 billion.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.670
Fossil fuels also have hidden costs associated
with them; because of the health issues like

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.310
chronic bronchitis, asthma, and premature
mortality caused by dirty air.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.140
The National Research Council reported in
2010 that natural gas was responsible for

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.560
740 million dollars in expenses per year.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
And coal?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.900
That was 62 Billion.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.900
With a B.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.430
This was before the cost of impacts from climate
change were factored in, which makes these

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.650
energy sources even more expensive.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.790
The bottom line is, investing in renewables
may be expensive and difficult now, but it’ll

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.849
pay off big time in the long run.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.840
And if we save the planet as we know it that’s
a nice bonus to.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040
If you think climate change won’t cost money
you may change your tune if your house becomes

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.130
a swimming pool.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.349
To find out what’s going to be underwater,
check out Tara’s video here.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.040
And we were all about the US in this video
but there are some places that run entirely

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.560
on renewables already!

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.290
Check out Seeker daily’s vid on that here.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.930
So are you on board the renewable hype train
or are you stopped at fossil fuel station?
