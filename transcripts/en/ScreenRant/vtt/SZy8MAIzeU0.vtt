00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:04.080
Every now and again,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.379
there's a movie that will sadly break an actor. Whether it's a run-in with an

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.849
unfortunate altercation are being unprepared for the truth, to being on the receiving end of the downright

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.869
twisted, there are moments that leave actors scarred and remind us that they are people too with their own fears and problems. Thankfully these onset

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.560
altercations did not affect the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.570
determination of the actors who pulled through and carried on to finish their film. Here are 10

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.080
life-threatening movie moments that actors regret. Before we get started, can you name this movie from these emojis? If you enjoyed this video, don't forget

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.680
Alien. What is the scariest and most well-known moment from the original Alien film?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.680
You're probably thinking of the chest burster scene, in which a baby alien

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.840
explodes from John Hurt's stomach. While it's fun knowing now that the cast was unprepared for the alien to pop out,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.729
what may shock you more is learning that the baby xenomorph was partially made up of real human skulls.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.859
Scriptwriter Dan O'Bannon revealed during the commentary for return of the living dead that artist H.R.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.160
Giger went to India and bought human skulls for the prop. Even more unsettling is that the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.200
Xenomorph's teeth are made up from the skulls of

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200
human children El Banat observed.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200
Yikes,I bet he wish he didn't know that.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.200
Thank you, Mr. Bates.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:14.909
Norman Bates.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.189
Psycho. Another iconic moment in horror comes from the classic film "Psycho." As we're all aware in that film, Janet Leigh's character is

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.509
ultimately brutally murdered halfway through the movie in the iconic shower scene. However, the scene did quite a number on the actress. Leigh has stated that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.739
filming the scene left her so rattled that she decided to never do shower scenes, providing

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.439
it was absolutely necessary to the plot. The actress would later state that watching the scene over again left her realizing

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.689
how vulnerable and defenseless one is.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.619
The Last House on the Left

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.419
Sometimes being too real might be crossing a line when it comes to the safety of the actors. Wes Craven's breakout film, the original "Last

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.780
House on the Left," is a prime example

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.079
of this. One of the many horrible moments the cast had to endure on set saw actor David Hess is

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.199
confronted with a chainsaw. The twist here is that it isn't a prop.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.349
It's a fully operational chainsaw with no safety precautions in place to keep Hess safe.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.059
Couple this with Mark Schaefer holding Sandra Castle over a drop to get a reaction, and actual fist fighting for a shot,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.000
and it's no wonder these actors didn't quit acting all together.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.669
Halloween. One of the pillars of the slasher horror

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.370
genre, [Halloween] is deemed a terrifying classic and at the time of release, in the 70s, was pure terror.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.519
Especially for child actor Kyle Richards, age 9, who played Lindsay Wallace in the John Carpenter film. Yet

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.150
it wasn't until Richards saw the final

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.200
product at the premiere that she felt the true terror of the film, which resulted in the young actress having to sleep with her mom

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.899
until the age of 15 due to fear of someone sinister hiding under her bed. Talk about child therapy.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.119
This is why we avoid bringing children to r-rated horror movie premieres. Here's Johnny!

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.250
The Shining.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.000
Here's Stanley! Stanley Kubrick was known for being something of an intense director, often doing his takes fifty to a hundred

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.520
times and pushing his actors to their breaking point in order to get the best possible shot for his film.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.119
This was no different when it came to The Shining, as Kubrick pulled no punches

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.470
with actress Shelley duvall who played Wendy. The actress was repeatedly pushed to the limit by Kubrick to the point of bullying which resulted in

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.170
Duval collapsing on set and her hair to actually fall out due to stress during the year-long shoot

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.189
Ironically about going mad. Don't know about you, but hair loss due to stress on the job doesn't sound like the best cup of tea

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.750
Die Hard

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.250
yippee-Ki-yay

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.769
am I right, mother flippers? The first die hard would go on to become one of the most beloved action films of all time and

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:50.059
introduced the world to the extremely talented Alan Rickman who made his theatrical debut as the German terrorist Hans Gruber to Bruce Willis's

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.879
NYPD officer, John McClane. In the Film's Climax,

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.819
Rickman is being suspended from the side of the High-rise and learn notified he would drop on the count of three what he didn't know

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.488
Is that director John McTiernan had a trick up his sleeve and dropped the actor on the count of one what you see is Alan

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.358
Rickman's genuine reaction as he plummets the actor was reportedly furious with McTiernan and would good cause as when doing a stunt like that

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.699
It's best to be mentally prepared to prevent any

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.129
injuries thankfully this didn't happen and hans would go on to become one of the most iconic villains ever

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.489
Aguirre, Wrath of God. You may not have heard of Aguirre, Wrath of God, the 1972 West German Epic, but

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.430
You'll have a hard time forgetting it after this story during the production

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.060
Director werner Herzog threatened lead actor Klaus Kinski to make sure he didn't leave the movie the catch is that he threatened the actor at

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.460
gunpoint

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.840
even firing said gun into a cabin filled with people because he found they were too loud which resulted in someone losing the tip of

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.740
their finger the director admitted in

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.880
1999 that he tried to have Kinski murdered by burning him alive

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.349
Which was prevented due to Kinski's dog. The director remained Adamant at the two were friends

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.389
but that the professional relationship ordered on

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.380
Psychotic and that he genuinely wanted to kill the actor note to self don't work on any films with any potentially psychotic directors

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.299
The Omen. When you make a film dealing with the son of the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.340
Antichrist, you're bound to get a few bizarre mishaps during the production and perhaps a few tragic occurrences.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.919
That's exactly what happened during the shoot for the original omen. The film saw its fair share of actual death around the cast and crew

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.789
starting with the tragic suicide of

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.239
Gregory Peck's son just two months before the premiere

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.260
Peck was almost killed himself when he missed a flight which in turn ended up crashing. Mere weeks after that, the animal handler was eaten

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:37.639
Alive by a lion maybe this film is indeed cursed if that wasn't weird enough though a special effects supervisor John Richardson's assistant

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.889
Lismore was gruesomely decapitated in a car accident after he himself designed a decapitation scene in the film featuring David warner

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.340
Thedate of the accident, friday the 13th

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.260
1976 all this is only the original version too. Please, no one remake the omen again

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.139
The Birds. Hitchcock strikes again on our list. In

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:07.449
1963 the Master of Horror released the Birds which would also become a classic in the genre in it actress tippi Hedren ends up being

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.510
Constantly haunted and tormented by the infamous birds themselves. Only there was something not quite right with these birds

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.260
Initially she was led to believe from Hitchcock himself that there were to be

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:23.439
Mechanical creatures and would be under the control of the film crew much to her own horror she discovered that the birds were in fact

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.799
Real with no control over the animal's behavior any actor might worry about one safety when it comes to potential injuries

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.750
Especially ones eyes, talk about being terrified by real-life birds for the rest of your life

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.840
Noah. when she's not casting spells or capturing hearts

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.579
Emma Watson is certainly creating a lasting impression with fans. The former Harry Potter alum

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.220
And un Goodwill ambassador has done a lot of good out there

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.589
But that doesn't mean the beloved actress has it easy while I'm set for Darren Aronofsky's Noah, Watson

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.349
Had an uncomfortable brush in with a stalker who confronted the actress in the woods during a biblical shoot in 2012

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.890
According to Daily mail Watson recognized the man from previous run-ins only this time he had confronted her alone in the woods

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.590
Thankfully security and the stun team caught up with the man who attempted to run away and was warned that she was trespassing

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:18.429
While one of our favorite witches must have regretted wandering off to the woods alone. She nonetheless overcame such a shocking moment

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.979
That's it for today everyone. What did you think of our list you feel bad for these actors? Are you happy?

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.310
They pull through their ordeals whether they are planned or a product of their environment?
