00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.711
So let's start by seeing how patterns are defined. So

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.620
what is the format of the pattern definitions. If we look

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.000
at the Gang of Four's book we can see that these

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.630
definitions contain a lot of information. In fact, what I'm listing

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.980
here is just a subset of this information. In this lesson,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.510
what I want to do is to focus on four essential

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.480
elements of a design pattern. It's name, the intent which is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.270
the goal of the pattern. The pattern's applicability which is the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.040
list of situations or context in which the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.560
pattern is applicable. I also want to cover the structure

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.700
and participants. Which is the static model that describes

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.870
the elements, so normally the classes or the object

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.900
involved in the pattern. In addition to that

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.400
the structure also describes

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.420
the relationships, responsibilities and collaborations

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.264
among these classes or objects. Finally what I want

00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:50.560
to cover is sample code. So examples that illustrate

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.490
the use of patterns.
