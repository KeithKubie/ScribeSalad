study where they they shocked people and

study where they they shocked people and
 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.280
study where they they shocked people and
these little like electric shocks and

these little like electric shocks and
 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.500
these little like electric shocks and
they asked people if they preferred

would rather know when the little

painful shock was coming so which kind
 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.110

of is interesting to me because you

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120
of is interesting to me because you
 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840
of is interesting to me because you
would think that the expectation might

would think that the expectation might
 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.270
would think that the expectation might
make it worse but but we like

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
make it worse but but we like
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.460
make it worse but but we like
predictability I guess so I think that's

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470
predictability I guess so I think that's
 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.530
predictability I guess so I think that's
one of the reasons why it's interesting

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540
one of the reasons why it's interesting

painful or excruciating that kind of

big part of my kind of cringe theory is

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060
big part of my kind of cringe theory is
 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.069
big part of my kind of cringe theory is
kind of what I'm calling it is there is

kind of what I'm calling it is there is
 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.859
kind of what I'm calling it is there is
a difference we don't like to pay

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869
a difference we don't like to pay
 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.840
a difference we don't like to pay
attention to it very much or I don't but

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850
attention to it very much or I don't but
 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.969
attention to it very much or I don't but
there is a difference often between the

yourself to the world and the way that

yourself to the world and the way that

the rest of the world is perceiving you

unlock this for me was the idea it's

unlock this for me was the idea it's
 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.039
unlock this for me was the idea it's
almost like a cliched thing that people

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049
almost like a cliched thing that people
 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.050
almost like a cliched thing that people
hate the sounds of their own voices or

recordings of themselves and in
 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.999
recordings of themselves and in
particularly the the thing that about

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009
particularly the the thing that about

people hating the sound of their own
 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.910
people hating the sound of their own
voices is a great example of this

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
voices is a great example of this
 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.969
voices is a great example of this
because your voice really does sound

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979
because your voice really does sound
 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.459
because your voice really does sound
different to you than the way everyone

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469
different to you than the way everyone
 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.690

else is hearing you so when when we hear

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700
else is hearing you so when when we hear
 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.179
else is hearing you so when when we hear
somebody talk you're you're kind of like

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189
somebody talk you're you're kind of like
 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.980
somebody talk you're you're kind of like
hearing someone else through like the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990
hearing someone else through like the
 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.840
hearing someone else through like the
air but when I'm hearing myself talk I'm

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850
air but when I'm hearing myself talk I'm
 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.219
air but when I'm hearing myself talk I'm
hearing myself through the air and

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229
hearing myself through the air and
 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.410
hearing myself through the air and
through the bones of my own skull which

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420
through the bones of my own skull which
 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.330
through the bones of my own skull which
actually transmits the sound differently

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340
actually transmits the sound differently
 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.860
actually transmits the sound differently
and makes my voice sound lower than

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
and makes my voice sound lower than
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.490
and makes my voice sound lower than
actually is

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
actually is
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.380
actually is
so it's a really common complaint people

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390
so it's a really common complaint people
 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.240
so it's a really common complaint people
are like they listen to their own voices

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250
are like they listen to their own voices
 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.250
are like they listen to their own voices
and they're like oh my gosh like it's so

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260
and they're like oh my gosh like it's so
 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.720
and they're like oh my gosh like it's so
much higher than I thought it was that's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
much higher than I thought it was that's
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.430
much higher than I thought it was that's
always what I think about when I hear my

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440
always what I think about when I hear my
 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.970
always what I think about when I hear my
own voice played back and I think that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
own voice played back and I think that
 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.030
own voice played back and I think that
this is a central part of my theory

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
this is a central part of my theory
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.270
this is a central part of my theory
about what makes us cringe is when the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280
about what makes us cringe is when the
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.280
about what makes us cringe is when the
you you think you're presenting to the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
you you think you're presenting to the
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.220
you you think you're presenting to the
world kind of clashes with the you the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230
world kind of clashes with the you the
 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.320
world kind of clashes with the you the
world is actually seeing and that makes

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330
world is actually seeing and that makes
 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.000
world is actually seeing and that makes
us uncomfortable because we like to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
us uncomfortable because we like to
 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.710
us uncomfortable because we like to
think that we're coming off in a certain

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720
think that we're coming off in a certain
 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.140
think that we're coming off in a certain
way and it's just like oh no like that's

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
way and it's just like oh no like that's
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.330
way and it's just like oh no like that's
that's what you think of me like that's

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
that's what you think of me like that's
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.430
that's what you think of me like that's
that's how you see me

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440
that's how you see me
 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.220
that's how you see me
and I think that's never gonna go away

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230
and I think that's never gonna go away
 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.380
and I think that's never gonna go away

at Emory University who has a name for

this he calls this the irreconcilable
 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.930
this he calls this the irreconcilable
gap and so he he really thinks it's even

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
gap and so he he really thinks it's even

in the name it's never gonna go away
 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.170
in the name it's never gonna go away
there's always gonna be this gap between

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180
there's always gonna be this gap between
 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.970
there's always gonna be this gap between
the way you perceive yourself and the

the way you perceive yourself and the

way others perceive you and I think
that's at the heart of what we call

that's at the heart of what we call
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.699
that's at the heart of what we call
awkward moments or awkwardness kind of

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709
awkward moments or awkwardness kind of
 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.400
awkward moments or awkwardness kind of

cringing at yourself or at somebody else
if you it takes a while but you can

if you it takes a while but you can
 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.020
if you it takes a while but you can
start to train yourself to think of that

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030
start to train yourself to think of that
 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.250
start to train yourself to think of that
as a useful piece of information if you
