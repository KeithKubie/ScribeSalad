00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:14.968
As an elementary school teacher,

00:00:14.992 --> 00:00:19.948
my mom did everything she could
to ensure I had good reading skills.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:24.818
This usually consisted of weekend
reading lessons at our kitchen table

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.926
while my friends played outside.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.306
My reading ability improved,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.060
but these forced reading lessons
didn't exactly inspire a love of reading.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.340
High school changed everything.

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:44.586
In 10th grade, my regular English class
read short stories and did spelling tests.

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:48.608
Out of sheer boredom, I asked
to be switched into another class.

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:52.016
The next semester,
I joined advanced English.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.572
(Laughter)

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:57.408
We read two novels and wrote
two book reports that semester.

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.709
The drastic difference and rigor
between these two English classes

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.408
angered me and spurred questions like,

00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:07.816
"Where did all these
white people come from?"

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.078
(Laughter)

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:13.105
My high school was over
70 percent black and Latino,

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:17.639
but this advanced English class
had white students everywhere.

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:22.058
This personal encounter
with institutionalized racism

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.740
altered my relationship
with reading forever.

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:29.120
I learned that I couldn't depend
on a school, a teacher or curriculum

00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:31.088
to teach me what I needed to know.

00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:35.580
And more out of like, rebellion,
than being intellectual,

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:39.316
I decided I would no longer allow
other people to dictate

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.102
when and what I read.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.348
And without realizing it,
I had stumbled upon a key

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.039
to helping children read.

00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:48.814
Identity.

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:52.266
Instead of fixating on skills

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.772
and moving students
from one reading level to another,

00:01:55.796 --> 00:02:01.310
or forcing struggling readers
to memorize lists of unfamiliar words,

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:05.031
we should be asking ourselves
this question:

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:09.407
How can we inspire children
to identify as readers?

00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:15.021
DeSean, a brilliant first-grader
I taught in the Bronx,

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:18.585
he helped me understand
how identity shapes learning.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.348
One day during math,
I walk up to DeSean, and I say,

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:25.308
"DeSean, you're a great mathematician."

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:27.409
He looks at me and responds,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:29.970
"I'm not a mathematician,
I'm a math genius!"

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:31.255
(Laughter)

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.643
OK DeSean, right?

00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:35.575
Reading?

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.244
Completely different story.

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:38.868
"Mr. Irby, I can't read.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.731
I'm never going to learn
to read," he would say.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.966
I taught DeSean to read,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.291
but there are countless black boys
who remain trapped in illiteracy.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.168
According to the US
Department of Education,

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:57.178
more than 85 percent
of black male fourth graders

00:02:57.202 --> 00:02:59.202
are not proficient in reading.

00:02:59.643 --> 00:03:00.888
85 percent!

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.399
The more challenges
to reading children face,

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:10.471
the more culturally competent
educators need to be.

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:15.087
Moonlighting as a stand-up comedian
for the past eight years,

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.979
I understand the importance
of cultural competency,

00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:20.950
which I define as the ability to translate

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:25.085
what you want someone else
to know or be able to do

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.324
into communication or experiences
that they find relevant and engaging.

00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:33.365
Before going on stage,
I assess an audience.

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:35.998
Are they white, are they Latino?

00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:39.675
Are they old, young,
professional, conservative?

00:03:40.468 --> 00:03:43.084
Then I curate and modify my jokes

00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:45.849
based on what I think
would generate the most laughter.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.940
While performing in a church,
I could tell bar jokes.

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:52.905
But that might not result in laughter.

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:54.784
(Laughter)

00:03:54.808 --> 00:03:59.949
As a society, we're creating
reading experiences for children

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:03.084
that are the equivalent
of telling bar jokes in a church.

00:04:03.694 --> 00:04:06.392
And then we wonder
why so many children don't read.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.285
Educator and philosopher Paulo Freire

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:13.461
believed that teaching and learning
should be two-way.

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:18.021
Students shouldn't be viewed
as empty buckets to be filled with facts

00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:20.179
but as cocreators of knowledge.

00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:25.297
Cookie-cutter curriculums
and school policies

00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:28.442
that require students to sit statue-still

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.848
or to work in complete silence --

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:35.854
these environments often exclude
the individual learning needs,

00:04:35.878 --> 00:04:38.745
the interest and expertise of children.

00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:40.828
Especially black boys.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:44.782
Many of the children's books
promoted to black boys

00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:49.539
focus on serious topics, like slavery,
civil rights and biographies.

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:54.054
Less than two percent of teachers
in the United States are black males.

00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:57.751
And a majority of black boys
are raised by single mothers.

00:04:58.323 --> 00:05:02.769
There are literally young black boys
who have never seen a black man reading.

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.658
Or never had a black man
encourage him to read.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.720
What cultural factors,
what social cues are present

00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:16.880
that would lead
a young black boy to conclude

00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:18.997
that reading is even
something he should do?

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:22.944
This is why I created Barbershop Books.

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.748
It's a literacy nonprofit

00:05:26.772 --> 00:05:30.772
that creates child-friendly
reading spaces in barber shops.

00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:33.407
The mission is simple:

00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.498
to help young black boys
identify as readers.

00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:41.260
Lots of black boys go to the barber shop
once or twice a month.

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:45.393
Some see their barbers
more than they see their fathers.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.599
Barbershop Books connects reading
to a male-centered space

00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:54.649
and involves black men
and boys' early reading experiences.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.953
This identity-based reading program

00:05:57.977 --> 00:06:01.713
uses a curated list of children's books
recommended by black boys.

00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:04.544
These are the books
that they actually want to read.

00:06:06.543 --> 00:06:10.405
Scholastic's 2016 Kids and Family Report

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:16.103
found that the number one thing
children look for when choosing a book

00:06:16.127 --> 00:06:18.294
is a book that will make them laugh.

00:06:19.198 --> 00:06:24.742
So if we're serious about helping
black boys and other children to read

00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:26.687
when it's not required,

00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:29.460
we need to incorporate
relevant male reading models

00:06:29.484 --> 00:06:30.817
into early literacy

00:06:31.605 --> 00:06:36.241
and exchange some of the children's books
that adults love so much

00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:41.090
for funny, silly or even gross books,
like "Gross Greg".

00:06:41.114 --> 00:06:45.208
(Laughter)

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:50.801
"You call them boogers.
Greg calls them delicious little sugars."

00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:52.118
(Laughter)

00:06:52.142 --> 00:06:56.086
That laugh, that positive reaction

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.541
or gross reaction some of you just had,

00:06:58.565 --> 00:06:59.732
(Laughter)

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:03.775
black boys deserve
and desperately need more of that.

00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:09.496
Dismantling the savage inequalities
that plague American education

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.150
requires us to create reading experiences

00:07:13.174 --> 00:07:16.555
that inspire all children
to say three words:

00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:18.651
I'm a reader.

00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:20.357
Thank you.

00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:25.999
(Applause)
