00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:14.583
I think that this is an incredibly exciting time 
because of the advances in technology.

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:20.166
  It’s also a scary time because when I sit back
 and I read the media and I listen, 

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:25.542
 I look at the literature that is out there, 
I look at the statistics, it’s mind-boggling.

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:31.458
 Because you realize that currently 50 percent of the jobs that we have

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:35.750
   no longer most likely will exist two decades from now. 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.500
Two decades is, for most of us, still in our lifetime.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.166
 And what does it mean?
 So half the jobs that we have today will no longer exist.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:50.458
Worse yet, the Institute for the Future put out statistics that indicate 

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:56.208
that 85 percent of the jobs that will exist in 2030 don't exist yet.

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:59.542
 And that means that we need to be very attuned to the fact 

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.625
to embrace the changes that are taking place.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:07.208
 But also think about how do those push us to do something differently. 

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:10.834
There was a wonderful example when we look at the hotel industry.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:14.959
The hotel industry invested millions and millions of dollars

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.959
 advancing, enhancing the quality of what they provided.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.208
 Advancing the environment, better customer service,

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.875
 just all the things that made so much sense

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.917
 because that’s how you get ranked, that’s how you get rated,

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.333
 that’s how you survive as a business. 

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.709
And then all of a sudden a whole new model came along 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:37.291
where people could actually have places to stay
 without needing to stay in a hotel, 

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:39.500
also known as Airbnb. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.583
And you could step back and say what does it mean for universities?

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:47.125
 We can continue to compete with each other to get better, 

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:51.500
not competing just to win, but competing to deliver the best.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.834
 But what is it? With all these changes that we talked about

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:57.709
 that’s going to make us realize that the way in which

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.792
we’re doing things no longer fits with what we promise 

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:05.750
our students and our alumni is that we will prepare you

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.709
 to have meaningful lives. To have successful careers 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.417
and to be able to have a positive impact on the world. 

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:15.750
The question that we have today is there is so much knowledge,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.166
what does it mean when we say that the 

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:24.458
responsibility of institutions of higher education is to provide knowledge?

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:27.583
 There is an increasing awareness that what is more important

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:32.875
 is being able to acquire knowledge,
 to translate that knowledge then into daily life. 

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:36.125
Technology has a lot of flexibility, but it has limits. 

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:40.834
More important, technology doesn’t have empathy 

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:44.001
 and that’s what we are going to need. So at the end of the day,

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:47.291
 technology yes, will change our world, it will change our lives.

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:50.333
 It will make some of it better and some of it we will regret

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.250
 because it’s not like the way it was. 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.500
But between the flexibility and the empathy 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.959
and those are things that you learn through the kind of education
 that we offer at institutions like Emory,

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.375
 we should be excited about the possibilities. 

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:08.959
We should be excited about the fact that it’s pushing 
us to not only think about being the best,

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.625
 but what are the different models that prepare people the best to be ready to 

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.000
succeed in the world of the future?
