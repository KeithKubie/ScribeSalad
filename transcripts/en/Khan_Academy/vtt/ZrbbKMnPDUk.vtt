00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:04.307
We have now seen the Nazis come to power in 1933 -

00:00:04.307 --> 00:00:08.532
and by mid 1933 they are the only allowed party in Germany.

00:00:08.532 --> 00:00:11.667
And Hitler is fundamentally the dictator of Germany.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.872
But they aren't happy with just that consolidated power,

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.149
they want to ensure that they stay in power.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:21.609
And so as we get into 1934 they continue to consolidate their power

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.000
and now more directly start eliminating their opponents.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.002
And when I say eliminating, they are actually directly killing these individuals.

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:34.333
And there is an entire Nazi power apparatus that is at play,

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:38.803
but the three figures here are the ones that are most notable other than Hitler.

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:42.479
This is Joseph Goebbels who is the head of Nazi Propaganda,

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.803
Hermann Göring, who is the head of the Nazi's secret police, the Gestapo,

00:00:47.803 --> 00:00:51.341
which later goes under the control of the SS, under Heinrich Himmler.

00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:57.480
He is a major player in the rearmament of Germany for war footing.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.647
He eventually helds the Luftwaffe which is the German airforce during the World War II.

00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:06.476
We have Heinrich Himmler who is the head of Schutzstaffel,

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:13.070
more famously known as the SS, which is the paramilitary group of the Nazi party,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.474
used to intimidate and eliminate (as we will see) their opponents

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:20.737
and they are also responsible for the execution of the actual

00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:24.470
the planning and the execution - of the actual holocaust.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.342
And so as we get into 1934 Hitler is eager to eliminate more of his opponents -

00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:33.599
and we are not just talking about opponents outside of the Nazi party,

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.472
we are also talking about rivals within the Nazi party.

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:40.146
And the most notable of these was Ernst Röhm

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:44.139
who as you see at this picture was clearly a Nazi.

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.603
He was head of the Storm Battalion or the SA, which was the paramilitary group

00:01:48.603 --> 00:01:52.474
that the SS splintered out of and it was far more

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:55.008
independent than Hitler would have liked and it was not

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:56.667
popular amongst the German people

00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:04.056
because of its violence - and Hitler and his lieutenants viewed Röhm as a potential rival to Hitler's authority

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:10.145
within the Nazi party. And so in 1934, June 30th in particular

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.405
- or we could say June 30th to July 2nd -

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:15.804
you have what's called the Night of the Long Knives

00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:18.894
and it really should be called the Nights of the Long Knives

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:23.481
but the Night of the Long Knives,

00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:32.563
where under the pretext of a supposed a coup d'état or a putsch on the part of Ernst Röhm

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:37.888
The SS and the Gestapo start rounding up Röhm,

00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:41.736
his allies and any perceived enemies of Hitler.

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:45.736
Start rounding them up and eliminating them and shooting them...

00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:50.224
And Ernst Röhm is arrested and when he refuses to kill himself in his jail cell

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:52.306
he is shot at point-blank range.

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:58.309
Gregor Strasser, who is a former rival of Hitler within the Nazi party, he is eliminated.

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:05.004
Kurt von Schleicher who is a previous chancellor
of Germany, perceived as a rival to Hitler

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:07.002
- he and his wife are gunned down.

00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:14.335
Gustav Ritter von Kahr who is in no way anymore a rival to Hitler

00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:18.670
but he was one of the major actors for putting down the Beer Hall Putsch -

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.139
the fail the Beer Hall Putch of 1923.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:26.002
He is hacked - he is hacked to get dead.

00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.337
And these are just four of the more notable folks.

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:34.603
On those few nights over 85 major officials in Germany were eliminated.

00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:40.070
And as we will see this is just the beginning of the consolidation of Nazi power

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.070
and now they are doing it through extra legal means.
