WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.810
Johnson and Johnson just got permission to use to,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.600
to market their version of ketamine.
And right now,
uh,

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.410
the dose of Ketamine I had was,
is like $90 a,

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.890
they're going to sell it for $15,000.
That's,

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.870
that's the danger of it getting properly legalized.
And as you said,

6
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:20.360
turned into a successful business.
Oh,
that's terrible.
Yeah.

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.690
Now why is it so expensive?
Just so they can make money off of it.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.750
Now this is the therapeutic dose of ketamine in some sort of a psychiatric sort

9
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.750
of circle.
Like what's the environment they're going to do it.

10
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.650
And so they want to have it very much controlled.
Um,

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.560
but it looks like they want to stop there.

12
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:44.090
The therapist's giving it in the study,
um,
in their own office.
I mean,
which is,

13
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:47.900
which is what's going on now and have it controlled under,
under,
um,
you know,

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.430
the universal hospitals sort of situation.
And that there is a very good,
um,

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.170
and it's not even underground cause I'm not sure even shorts,

16
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:58.640
it's not illegal here.
Right?
Ketamine,
I think it isn't illegal.
Um,

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.330
but there are therapists giving it out now.
And I,
I bought mine legally.
You know,

18
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.660
I think you can,
oh,
you bought it with a prescription real?
Yeah.
Yeah.

19
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:10.520
With the prescription in New York.
Oh,
maybe I'm wrong.
Is Ketamine legal?

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.990
<v 0>Legal under prescription.</v>

22
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:16.810
Maybe it's a schedule two drug or something along those lines.

23
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.681
I was going to get that.

24
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:21.480
Someone sent me the message about the $15,000 and what that fucking craziness.

25
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.440
Yeah.
90 to 15,000.
Yeah.
Which is far worse.
Far,
far more than the,
the,

26
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.180
the,
you know the amount that Martin Shkreli,
um,
put up the price right.

27
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.140
And went to jail for yeah.
But uh,
yeah,
he's,
he's a Douche bag though.

28
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.610
It's easy to point at him.
And he now owns that Wu Tang clan album.
Yeah.

29
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.930
Well haven't we?
That someone's got it,
man.
He's in jail.

30
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.123
So I studies,

31
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.450
I saw he's still running as business from like a burner cell phone in jail.
Oh,

32
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:53.000
that's hilarious.
Well,
what he saying is though,

33
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.920
what happened in the Wu Tang clan album?

34
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.353
<v 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.340
<v 0>I thought it was in possession of the FBI in there,
it off or something.</v>

36
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:03.650
Come on son.
That shit is hilarious.

37
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.440
That might be one of the most hilarious parts of that story.

38
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:10.160
The FBI owns the Wu Tang clan forbidden album.

39
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.840
How much did he pay?
Any like $1 million for it.

40
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:16.910
You paid a lot because it was up for auction.

41
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.640
I think this says you paid 2 million.
Wow.

42
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.640
You can never get that money back.
Especially if the track's got released.

43
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.890
But what a great marketing tool.
It's worth more than $2 million in marketing.

44
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.770
And I feel so pretend is not released.
He confirmed he paid 2 million for it.

45
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:40.950
Yeah,
but he's full of shit.
That's,
yeah,
I bet he did though.
I mean,

46
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.220
if I had a gas,
you know,
I mean,
how many wealthy people out there,

47
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.970
Wu Tang clan fans?
A lot.
Yeah.
Probably probably a healthy bid.

48
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.710
Healthy bidding war as of uh,
this is as if like a year ago,

49
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.940
the feds have it.
So I don't know if there's an update on that.
There's always,

50
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.740
I mean,
when it's an individual that's like him,
that's easy to,

51
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.220
it's easy to look at him disparagingly.
Like,
look at this guy.
He's a deck,

52
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.821
you know,
oh,

53
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.600
he wants to raise the money or raise the price of these drugs that can help

54
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.560
people.
Fuck him.
Let's go get them.
But if it's Johnson and Johnson,
it's like,

55
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.540
yeah.
First of all,
they make baby powder.
Yeah.
You know,

56
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:20.620
they're so respected.

57
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.910
It's such a common household name,

58
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.780
and then I'm calling it ketamine.
They're calling it s ketamine,
s ketamine.

59
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:33.580
Slightly different.
That sounds like a snail,
right?
It sounds like.
Yes.
Cargo.

60
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.750
And it's a nasal spray.
Oh,
Jesus.
Different.
That makes it,
but,

61
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.550
huh.
Well,

62
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:43.150
it's better than shooting it up because I know that a lot of people take it

63
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:47.170
intramuscularly.
Where are you?
Just Jab it into your thighs,
I believe.
Yeah.

64
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:47.561
This is,

65
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:51.580
the drug will only be given by accredited specialists who must monitor patients

66
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:54.460
for two hours after administration.
I don't think you can just get it.

67
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.980
Go home and,
oh,
that makes sense.
Because a,

68
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:00.520
I know Neal Brennan did it and he had some very good results from it.

69
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.590
I took that.
I've spoke to him a few times.
He's tried everything.
He's,

70
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.090
he's trying.
He's had a,
he's a fucking hilarious guy.

71
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.850
He's had some real depression problems though.

72
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.470
He has some very good relief from a magnetic therapy.
Yeah.

73
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.070
And if you seen the involuntary trembling thing,
he did as well.
No.

74
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.710
What's the video of that was that,

75
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.630
I have no idea in voluntary tremble and she's sitting there and like,

76
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.640
cause I'm in shoulder is just going.
But he,
they just shit,

77
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.810
it was great juice them up with something.
Nothing.
Just 10 just talking.
Oh,

78
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:30.790
so he just does it on purpose.
Yeah.

79
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.350
Oh this therapist in the night gets him to do it somehow and that helps him.

80
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.970
Yeah.
I you'd have to ask him.

81
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:40.990
I don't know why I watched the three Mike special thinking it was just another

82
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.600
company stand up.
Right.
I had no idea about that.

83
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.530
That Mike being the serious stuff.
Yeah.
I thought it was incredible.

84
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:47.710
I thought it was a brilliant guy.

85
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.430
Very smart guy in his standup is outstanding and the kid just keeps getting

86
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:54.940
better.
But you know,
he's a guy fighting demons.

87
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.860
Yeah.

88
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.690
He's the classic case of the comedian that can never be held happy unless he's

89
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:05.710
on stage killing,
you know,
and then,
you know,
even then that's brief.

90
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.090
Like he's just never this jovial,
funny guy,
but he's a brilliant comedian.
Yeah.

91
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.090
But as long as I've known him for many years,
he struggled.

92
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.090
And it sounds like he's kind of an unofficial executive producer for a bunch of

93
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:18.010
other comedians as well.
Um,
how so?

94
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.950
Like advising them and giving them notes and it seems like a whole bunch of

95
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:24.340
people,
I'm sure he does doesn't and get his input.
People definitely respect him.

96
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.940
But yeah,

97
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.630
I'm sure he gives people tag lines and gives them advice and stuff like that.

98
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.570
Very smart guy.
But to be as honest as he was and,

99
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.970
and not even end it with a joke.
Right.
You know,

100
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.750
just to tell a serious story then.
Yeah,
that blew me away.
Yeah.

101
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:41.500
I met him on the Friday night and watched it on the Saturday morning and had no

102
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.650
idea and it was,
it was one of the best things I've seen for a long time.
Wow.

103
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.150
Yeah.
Now he's a special guy.
It's,
uh,
it's hard when,
you know,

104
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.960
I've had a few friends take their life three in the last year.

105
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.160
Um,
and you know,
you,

106
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.580
you see a guy like Neil and you know,

107
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:06.110
he's constantly pursuing all these different therapies and constantly trying to

108
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:11.111
find something that alleviates this depression and you just keep hoping you keep

109
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:12.230
opening,

110
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.030
you keep searching and keep hoping that one of these things sticks wise things

111
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.710
really see.
I mean he's very,
very proactive.

112
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.190
He's always searching for new things and very open about it and talking about
it.

113
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.010
But the ketamine does seem to have helped him quite a bit.

114
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:27.800
And he was telling me like,
man,
he's like,
this is so fucking crazy.

115
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:31.040
I'm going to this doctor's office and having these full blown psychedelic

116
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:33.080
experiences at the doctor's office.
Yeah.

117
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.990
When two hours later you're out on the street feeling completely normal,

118
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.440
what was your ketamine experience like?
Uh,
I took a tablet.

119
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.740
You put it under your tongue and let it dissolve for,
for 10 minutes.

120
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.760
And then I laid on the Sofa in a therapist office for two hours and I was out on

121
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:49.680
the street again two hours later.
So how long did it take before it kicked in?

122
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.950
And I don't really know cause I never thought it was kicking in.
Um,

123
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.130
but then I just found myself saying things and concluding things that I wouldn't

124
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:59.180
normally say.

125
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.380
And for the next week and a half I just felt like that was just a weight off.

126
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.350
Did you have any sort of a hallucinogenic experience?
No.
None whatsoever.

127
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.580
No hallucinating though.
Not Listen to listen to music.
Quite quietly put,

128
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:15.650
put an I,
I,
you know,
I must go on for a few minutes here and there.

129
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.150
Sometimes it didn't talk a tool.
Um,
but yeah,

130
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:22.100
just there was just this relief,
especially afterwards,

131
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:25.250
like in the week and a half or so off switch just felt this,
just this lightness.

132
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.780
And you know,
to your point about Neil being so open to trying everything,

133
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.440
even that,
even taking that step is hard sometimes.

134
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.340
Even getting out of the door sure is hard,

135
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.230
let alone researching this stuff and trying everything.

136
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:39.500
And when I first moved to America,
I said,
okay,
you're not going to do yoga.

137
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.570
You're not going to do therapy.
You're not gonna get prescription drugs.

138
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:46.080
That's in New York.
Bullshit.
Not to drop that skepticism and to,

139
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.520
to try everything.
You can be genuinely open to everything.
That's,
