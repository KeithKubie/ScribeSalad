00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.840
Among the things that make the Earth hospitable
to life is that atmosphere, which is rich

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.279
in nitrogen.

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.859
But why?

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.280
Hey everyone, Amy here for DNews, breathing
in this lovely, life supporting air we have

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.280
on Earth.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.360
The chemical composition of the air that sustains
all life on Earth is due in large part to

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.360
photosynthesis.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.090
For millions of years, plants have been removing
carbon dioxide from the air and replacing

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.090
it with oxygen.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.289
But only about a fifth of our atmosphere is
oxygen; the rest is largely nitrogen, the

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.760
source of which has been a mystery.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.760
But geoscientists from the Carnegie Institution
of Washington have a possible explanation,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.999
and it all comes down to plate tectonics.

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.239
The theory of plate tectonics says that the
Earth’s uppermost layer, called the lithosphere,

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.190
is divided into seven plates - all of which
move relative to one another.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.379
When they collide, they change the global
landscape, forming mountain ridges, rearranging

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.839
continents, and sometimes even pushing eachother
deeper into the planet, a process called subduction.

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.960
When the ocean’s crust is subducted in this
way, it often releases volatile elements containing

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.829
nitrogen into the rock above it.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.030
Buried in the Earth’s crust, that nitrogen
tends to form ammonium ions that are readily

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.150
incorporated into solid silicate minerals
and among the most abundant on the planet.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.780
And under the right conditions and in the
presence of compounds containing oxygen, these

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.890
ammonium molecules can break down into water
and nitrogen.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.160
So here’s where the other part of the puzzle
comes in.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.350
Active volcanoes don’t just vent hot ash
and molten rock when they erupt, they also

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.450
vent a significant amount of gases that would
otherwise stay locked in the earth’s depths.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.490
And it turns out that volcanoes near active
plate tectonics vent more nitrogen than any

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.610
other gas.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.630
This goes a long way in explaining why the
Earth alone has a nitrogen rich atmosphere,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.750
at least in our solar system: neither Mars
nor Venus have active plate tectonics like

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.360
our own planet has, and the have just trace
amounts of nitrogen to show for this inactivity.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
So how do you guys think this link between
plates tectonic and our atmosphere will change

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.110
the way we look for life on other planets?
