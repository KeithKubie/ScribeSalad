00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.830
Welcome to lesson two. In the last lesson, you created

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.270
an app that tracked the very basic elements in a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.500
music festival. Before we talk about what we're going to learn

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.140
in this lesson, you're going to hang out with Samantha and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.420
Andy in a real music festival, and get a better

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.210
idea what exactly what your app needs to do. There

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.100
were just so many things going on, I mean obviously

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.870
there are the bands, and the stages, and the attendees.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.870
&gt;&gt; And lots of stuff.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.520
Food, drink vendors, but there were some unexpected things too.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.820
&gt;&gt; I really liked the view from the Ferris Wheel. That was pretty cool.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.720
&gt;&gt; Definitely, and then the silent disco is awesome.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.690
&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness taking off those headphones, and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600
then not being able to hear the music anymore.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That was like trippy.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.750
&gt;&gt; Very surreal.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.870
&gt;&gt; The bubble guy.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.950
&gt;&gt; That was super cool, and the alien parade.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.270
&gt;&gt; There are those ladies on stilts who you refused to dance with.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.630
&gt;&gt; Look, I don't have as much rhythm as you okay, Andy?

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.880
&gt;&gt; Alright, so it's safe to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.740
say there's a lot going on, but despite all

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.140
the chaos, the festival overall was pretty well organized.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.330
&gt;&gt; And yeah, we were able to find our way around the festival to make it

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.440
to the right stages at the right times, and see the bands we wanted to see.
