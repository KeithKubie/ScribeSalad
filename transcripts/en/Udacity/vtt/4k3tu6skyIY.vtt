00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.770
So it started when I was looking for
someone to help me with a marketing task

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.570
and I searched for someone on Elance and
he said, hey I can do it.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.200
Said okay let's do it and
we started talking,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.210
we had our first our discovery meeting.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.300
Scary phone call and he said,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.980
you know what by the way I
also have another R&amp;D company.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.060
And I said, really?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.900
Yeah, we have like ten people here.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.850
And I told him, I'm looking for
an R&amp;D company,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.480
do you think you can do this project?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.970
And I was just working on my first
project working with a similar web and

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.100
he said yeah.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.220
And since then we
started working together

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.400
in almost everything that they did.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.580
He became a part of the company,
a real part of the company and

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.910
we became partners.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.759
Because he understood what I need,
I understood what he needs,

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.552
we wanted to help each other.

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:07.762
And in our relationship became so solid
that eventually I came to visit him and

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:12.653
to visit his employees because they
wanted to personally know the people

00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:15.238
who are working for us on the project.

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:16.875
I wanted them to know that I care.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:20.380
I do care, one of them just
invited me to his wedding.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.800
And they are really great people, and
I wanted to know them more in person

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.276
because they're just like employees
they just happen to live far, far away.

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:35.110
And and that I was there for

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.220
36 hours but that really changed
everything for us because

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.030
all the sudden it's a real person,
it's not an email, so it's not a Skype.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.110
It's not someone on Slack.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.120
It's a real person that you're going and
having fun with went all for drinks and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.270
dinner and play ball and
all of a sudden we're

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.910
part of the siame group that actually
meet not also only work remotely
