00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.810
In the last video, I
claimed that this formula

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.550
would come handy for
solving or for figuring out

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.850
the antiderivative of
a class of functions.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.040
Let's see if that
really is the case.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.700
So let's say I want to take
the antiderivative of x

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.591
times cosine of x dx.

00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:19.590
Now if you look at this
formula right over here,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.230
you want to assign part of this
to f of x and some part of it

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.190
to g prime of x.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.140
And the question is, well do I
assign f of x to x and g prime

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.270
of x to cosine of x or
the other way around?

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.850
Do I make f of x cosine
of x and g prime of x, x?

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.697
And that thing to
realize is to look

00:00:34.697 --> 00:00:36.530
at the other part of
the formula and realize

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.540
that you're essentially going
to have to solve this right over

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.279
here.

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.820
And here where we
have the derivative

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.880
of f of x times g of x.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.830
So what you want to
do is assign f of x

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.920
so that the derivative
of f of x is actually

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.620
simpler than f of x.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.397
And assign g prime
of x that, if you

00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:52.480
were to take its antiderivative,
it doesn't really

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.630
become any more complicated.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.400
So in this case,
if we assign f of x

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.610
to be equal to x, f prime
of x is definitely simpler,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.460
f prime of x is equal to 1.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.030
If we assign g prime of x to be
cosine of x, once again, if we

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.150
take its antiderivative,
that sine of x,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.610
it's not any more complicated.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.026
If we did it the
other way around,

00:01:15.026 --> 00:01:17.545
if we set f of x to
be cosine of x, then

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:18.920
we're taking its
derivative here.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.990
That's not that much
more complicated.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.549
But if we set g prime
of x equaling to x

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.340
and then we had to take
its antiderivative,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.520
we get x squared over 2,
that is more complicated.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.690
So let me make it
clear over here.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.310
We are assigning f of
x to be equal to x.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.710
And that means that
the derivative of f

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.700
is going to be equal to 1.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.270
We are assigning-- I'll
write it right here-- g

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.840
prime of x to be equal to
cosine of x, which means

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.790
g of x is equal to sine of x,
the antiderivative of cosine

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.660
of x.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.630
Now let's see, given
these assumptions,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.570
let's see if we can
apply this formula.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.980
So this has all of this.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.730
Let's see, the right-hand
side says f of x times g of x.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.056
So f of x is x.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.363
g of x is sine of x.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.070
And then from that, we are going
to subtract the antiderivative

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.280
of f prime of x-- well,
that's just 1-- times g of x,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.670
times sine of x dx.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.950
Now this was a huge
simplification.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.400
Now I went from trying to solve
the antiderivative of x cosine

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.120
of x to now I just have
to find the antiderivative

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.480
of sine of x.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.300
And we know the
antiderivative of sine of x dx

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.000
is just equal to
negative cosine of x.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.460
And of course, we can
throw the plus c in now,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.240
now that we're pretty
done with taking

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.890
all of our antiderivatives.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.910
So all of this is
going to be equal to x

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:12.990
sine of x, x times sine of
x, minus the antiderivative

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.115
of this, which is just
negative cosine of x.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.660
And then we could throw in a
plus c right at the end of it.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.050
And doesn't matter if we
subtract a c or add the c.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.210
We're saying this is
some arbitrary constant

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.660
which could even be negative.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.490
And so this is all going
to be equal to-- we

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.810
get our drum roll now-- it's
going to be x times sine of x,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.360
subtract a negative, that
becomes a positive, plus cosine

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.940
of x plus c.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.904
And we are done.

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:46.070
We were able to take the
antiderivative of something

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.490
that we didn't know how to take
the antiderivative of before.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.500
That was pretty interesting.
