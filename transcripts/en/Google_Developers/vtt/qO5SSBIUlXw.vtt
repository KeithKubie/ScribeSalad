00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:06.170
FRANCIS MA: Our mission
is to help developers

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.395
like you build a
better app and grow

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:10.190
a more successful business.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.880
DAN GALPIN: Hi.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.620
I'm Dan Galpin reporting from
GDD India for the Developer

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.270
Show.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.120
And I'm here with
Francis Ma, and we're

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.770
going to be talking about
Firebase Predictions.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.120
So Francis, what's
Firebase Predictions?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.410
FRANCIS MA: Firebase
Predictions is our first step

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.020
of taking Google's machine
learning to Firebase,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.270
enables developers
to predict and create

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.060
user groups on actions that
users are likely to take.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.940
So for example,
being able to predict

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.230
which users are likely to churn
or likely to spend in your app.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.739
DAN GALPIN: How is this
related to Firebase Analytics?

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.280
FRANCIS MA: Well,
Analytics gives you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.640
insights on actions that
users have taken in the past.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.580
And Predictions helps you
take it a step further

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.830
to anticipate actions
that users are

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.870
likely to take in the future.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.710
DAN GALPIN: So why did we
end up building Predictions?

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.460
FRANCIS MA: Well, our
mission for Firebase

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.320
is to help developers
to be successful.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.340
And one of the feedback that
we've gotten from developers

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.310
is wanting to get more
from just analytics,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.710
but also being able to
take more proactive actions

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.140
and create more
engaging experiences.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.780
And so we've taken our
machine-learning technology

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.260
and patched it up so that it's
much easier for developers

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.142
to anticipate, predict, and
to take proactive actions.

00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:23.600
DAN GALPIN: What
kind of technology

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.449
did we end up using
to build Predictions?

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:27.740
FRANCIS MA: Well, this is
all built on Google's machine

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.640
learning, and so we use
TensorFlow under the hood

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.025
to make Predictions work.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:34.400
DAN GALPIN: Does
a developer need

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.295
to know anything about machine
learning to use Predictions?

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:38.420
FRANCIS MA: No, not at all.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.940
We have applied the
machine learning,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.670
but have made it in such a
way such that developers don't

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.820
need any machine learning
know-how or expertise at all.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.730
All you need to do is
to enable your analytics

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.770
and we'd automatically
generate the predictions

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.422
based on your analytic events.

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:55.130
And then from there,
you can take actions

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.550
using other Firebase products
like Remote Config or Cloud

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.270
Messaging, and
you're good to go.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270
DAN GALPIN: What's the
most interesting use case

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.860
you've found for Predictions?

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.568
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.

00:02:04.568 --> 00:02:08.479
We've seen many game developers
use Predictions as a way

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.470
to drive more user engagement.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.750
So for example, creating
user in-app promotions

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.230
for users who are likely to
leave their app, to churn.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.840
And so instead of waiting
for users to leave the app

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.600
and do the hard work of
trying to bring them back, now

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.000
developers can take
more proactive actions

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.210
to give them that
offer before they leave

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.360
and to continue on to keep
them engaged in the game.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.102
DAN GALPIN: Were there any
surprises about Predictions?

00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:35.810
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.630
We've just released
Predictions a few weeks ago

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.630
and we're certainly pleasantly
surprised at the amount

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.420
of interest we've
seen in this product.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.430
And as I said, since this is
a fairly new release for us,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.831
we're also really excited to
see what developers do with it.

00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:54.830
DAN GALPIN: Speaking of
that, how can developers

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.166
find out more about using
Predictions in their apps?

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:58.790
FRANCIS MA: We have
all the information

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.671
on Firebase.google.com.

00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:02.420
DAN GALPIN: Great.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.970
Well, thank you so much,
Francis for talking to me here

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.887
at the Developer Show.

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:07.178
FRANCIS MA: Always my pleasure.

00:03:07.178 --> 00:03:07.680
Thanks, Dan.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.471
DAN GALPIN: And once
again, I'm Dan Galpin,

00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:11.780
reporting for the Developer
Show at TDD India.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.610
You can find out more
about Predictions
