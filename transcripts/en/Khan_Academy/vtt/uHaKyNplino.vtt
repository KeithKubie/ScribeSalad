00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.190
Convert 51.8 decimeters
to kilometers.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.740
So let's just think about what
decimeters means in terms of

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.440
meters, and then we can think
about what kilometers mean in

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.770
terms of meters, and
then convert them.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:21.210
So we're going to start
with 51.8 decimeters.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.600
Now, as a starting point, just
to keep things simple, we're

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.360
going to convert them into
meters, because this prefix

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.710
tells us a lot about how
many meters this is.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.390
So if we want to convert it
into meters, our units are

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.640
going to have to be meters
per decimeter.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.260
And we need this because this
decimeter and that decimeter

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.820
are going to cancel out, and
we're going to be just left

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.700
with meters.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.830
Now 1 meter is how
many decimeters?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.130
Well, the prefix deci
means 1/10.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.880
So 1 decimeter is
1/10 of a meter.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.410
Or another way of thinking
about it is there are 10

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.630
decimeters for every meter.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.110
This is a smaller unit.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.100
10 of these make up 1 of these,
or 1/10 of a meter per

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.540
decimeter, which is exactly
what that is telling you.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.550
1/10 of a meter.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.850
Now if you multiply these two
things, what do we get?

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.140
Well, the decimeters cancel out,
and we divide 51.8 by 10.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.800
Multiplying by 1/10 is the same
thing as dividing by 10.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.300
So this is going to be equal
to 51.8 divided by 10.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.840
The decimal's just going
to move to the left.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840
It's going to be 5.18.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.970
So this is going to
be 5.18 meters.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.360
And you should always
do a reality check.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.490
Did it make sense?

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.740
Does it make sense that
51 decimeters

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.940
are equal to 5 meters?

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.650
Well, sure.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.490
It should go down.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.520
We're going from a smaller unit
to a larger unit, so we

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.420
should have fewer of that larger
unit to make the same

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.370
distance in this case.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.260
A meter is a unit of length.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.290
Now, we're at 5.18 meters, and
we want to now convert it to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.540
kilometers.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.030
So we're going to want meters
in the denominator and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.100
kilometers in the numerator.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.960
Why?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.450
Because this meter and that
meter will cancel out.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.570
Now, how many meters make
up a kilometer?

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.900
The kilo tells us 1,000.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.010
That is 1,000 meters.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.770
So 1,000 meters are equal
to 1 kilometer.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.170
So if we were to multiply this,
the meters cancel out

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.910
and we'll just be left
with kilometers.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.590
And multiplying something by
1/1,000 is the exact same

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.840
thing as dividing by 1,000,
and that makes sense.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.190
We should get a smaller number
here because we're going from

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.020
a smaller unit to
a larger unit.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.670
So we're going to need
a much smaller amount

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.190
of the larger unit.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:05.940
So this is going to be equal
to 5.18/1,000 kilometers.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:15.890
Now, the easy way to do this,
if we take 5.18/10 is equal

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.880
to-- we just move the decimal
one to the left.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.080
It's going to be
equal to 0.518.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.950
If we take 5.18 and divide it
by 100, we're going to take

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.130
the decimal two to the left.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.100
So one, two, we're going to
have to add a zero here.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.090
So it's going to be 0.0518.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.356
And if we take 5.18 and we
divide by 1,000, we're going

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:47.230
to move the decimal
three to the left.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.200
So we'll just do it.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.610
So if we start with 5.18-- the
decimal started here-- we're

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.470
going to go one, two,
so that's one

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.470
zero, and then three.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.380
And that's where the decimal
is going to sit there.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.170
So this is Or another way, this
is a little over 5/1,000.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.030
This right here is 5/1,000.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.620
It's a little bit
more than that.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:22.930
So our final answer: 51.8
decimeters is equal to 0.00518

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.220
kilometers.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.800
And always do a reality check.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.310
Does that make sense?

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.070
Well, sure.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.800
We're going from a really small
unit here, a bunch of a

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.950
small unit, to a very small
amount of a large unit.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.940
It makes sense.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.960
It makes sense that this number
goes down while the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.790
actual unit becomes larger.
