00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:09.750
Hello, good morning.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.650
First thing I feel I ought
to do is apologise for my

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.900
incredibly boring shoes.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.020
But, I don't know if you
can all see this

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.990
thing on the table.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.160
I'm quite excited to be here
at The Royal Institution.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.370
It's a famous organisation,
and so I thought I'd and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.750
relate what I'm talking about
to the the Institute.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.260
So I've got something you
can all make at home.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.580
What I'm about to show you
excited one of my students so

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.490
much, he made one for his
mum for Valentine's Day.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.250
Are you supposed to make
things for your mum for

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.500
Valentine's Day?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.170
I don't know, but he did.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.480
Anyway, it's very simple.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.982
You need a battery, some
neodymium magnets, which you

00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:48.265
can buy off the internet or
steal from - borrow from -

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:50.560
school, and some copper wire.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.220
And you twist the copper wire
so that a bit of it sits on

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.150
top the battery, and the bottom
has to be touching the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.055
magnets, and if you get it just
right, it will do that.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.069
Yeah, come on.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.150
Alright, so that will carry
on for quite a while.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.710
A student of mine had an idea
that you could put a

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.640
photograph of your mum and
it would spin around.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.770
My kids really like their
mums, obviously.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.530
This is a very, very simple
electric motor.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.070
It's the kind of thing that you
have in your hair dryer or

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.810
lawn mower or any other thing
that moves due to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.890
electricity, really.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.740
And this phenomenon was
discovered right here by

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.150
Michael Faraday, who worked at
the Institute in the 1800s.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.620
And, it's one of the things
he discovered that

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.050
transformed the world.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.880
But he also discovered
something else that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.250
transformed the world even more,
if that makes sense.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.620
And, I've built my own version,
because obviously I'm

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.388
a sad, lonely man who has
nothing better to do than sit

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.890
at home building models of
things Faraday made.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.192
But this is again some
magnets - can you

00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:01.370
see that in the back?

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.830
There's some neodymium magnets
- again you can tell I like

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.690
those - and some copper wire
again, and there's an LED at

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.190
the top - it's a light bulb.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.086
And those things are not
connected to each other, so I

00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:13.890
don't know if you can
see the whole

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.140
right through the magnets.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.170
So the wires are connected
to the light bulb.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.500
There is no power source.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.910
There's no source of
electricity, and yet if I do

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.090
that, you can see that the
light bulb lights up.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.890
So, obviously, I'm producing
electricity, because the LEDs

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.390
need electricity to work.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.810
And this is, in fact, how all of
the electricity and all of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.540
the power stations in the
world is generated.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.680
You get some magnets, and
you move them round

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.090
next to some wires.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.840
And again it was Michael Faraday
who discovered this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.560
phenomenon.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.850
And this has changed
the world.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.230
And it relates to what you
guys are talking about,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.340
because once we learned how to
make electricity like this, we

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.230
built giant versions of this,
which we drive by burning

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.410
fossil fuels to make steam.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.480
So it's a fantastic invention,
it transformed our world.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.260
It gave us easily accessible
and available electricity.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.760
But, at the same time, it's
probably what led to some of

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.850
the issues we've got today.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.700
Now I haven't got lots of facts
and figures for you,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.260
you'll be glad to know.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.685
There's my Twitter handle for
anyone who wants to follow me.

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:13.392
I'm not actually sure it's
appropriate for students to

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:16.260
follow me, so don't follow me.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.160
What I'm going to talk about
today is, should science in

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.020
schools be compulsory?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.640
Now Faraday, like me, was
obviously a geek, loved

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.700
science, didn't go to school,
taught himself.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.420
So keen to find out about the
natural world, that he taught

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.310
himself science.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.220
And, all of you guys would have
to learn science up to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.480
16, it's compulsory, you
didn't have any choice.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.030
And your obviously here because
you've got some

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.035
interest in science or because
your teachers made you, I

00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:41.620
don't know.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.290
But, they'll be lots of kids in
your school, like lots of

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.170
kids that I've encountered, who
don't really want to do

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.410
science up to 16.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.890
They're not really interested
in it, no matter how hard

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.290
people like me try to get them
interested, they're not.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.370
So is it fair that we force them
to study science up to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.580
the age of 16?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.070
That's something I'd like
you to think about.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.050
And if you conclude that, yes,
we should make all students

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.880
study science, then I'd
like you to think

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.890
about some other things.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.180
For example, what should we
teach in school science?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.700
Now, I guess what I'm trying to
get at is what's the point

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.100
of learning science?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.029
For some of you, and far too
often, I think it is presented

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.410
as you have to do it because
the government says so, and

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.115
you can get some pieces of
paper, which than let you do A

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:25.690
levels, which get you more
pieces of paper so you can go

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.250
to university.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.580
And, I don't know, maybe that's
a good reason for doing

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.620
science at school.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.440
One of the things that the
current government and

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.530
previous governments have been
thinking about is the point of

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.830
science education.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.110
And some people argue that the
point of science education is

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.900
to create future scientists.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.360
So, you know, England can
have people doing

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.530
science in the future.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.780
Now, I've just read a book
called Geek Nation, and that's

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.380
about India.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.640
And there's lots of Indians
doing science.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.120
So, I don't know if we even
need British people doing

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.300
science, because the Indians are
doing it pretty well and

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.155
the Chinese.

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:02.880
So, should science education
be about creating future

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.570
scientists?

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.080
Is that what science
education is about?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.100
There is another way
of looking at it.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.670
Perhaps, science education
should be about educating all

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.550
citizens, so that they can take
part in the democracy

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.070
that we live in.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.600
We live in a very science driven
society, and we need

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.630
people to be sufficiently well
informed, so that they can

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.730
make decisions that
involve science.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.430
So maybe we should educate
people at school using the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.280
idea of science for scientists,
rather than

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.170
science for future scientists.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.620
However, there's another way
of looking at it which a

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.670
friend of mine, Alice Bell,
she's on Twitter as well, if

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.500
everyone's doing this
Tweeting thing.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.340
She says that we should all do
the same thing at school, that

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.450
we should all get to play with
science stuff - learn about

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.300
science - and it becomes a
shared cultural experience.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.420
So that when we all grow up, we
can all chat about science.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.900
I personally think that's
an interesting way

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.930
of looking at things.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.300
But, the government, in I
believe around 2006, that they

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.200
did come up with this idea of
splitting science, so that you

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.000
can have science for
future scientists

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.240
and science for citizens.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.720
And I don't know about your
schools, but I know that there

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.080
are GCSE courses that take
students down either route,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.620
and those are already
available.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.050
Now, you've learned lots of
facts at school like Ohm's

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.740
Law, or Hooke's Law, or
osmosis and stuff.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.250
And obviously there's an awful
lot of stuff - facts - in

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.140
science that you could
learn at school.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.010
And the question is, which of
those facts should you learn?

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.780
Again that's something I want
you to think about.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.760
What is important?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.590
What facts of science
should you learn?

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.910
So, for example, should we
concentrate on the big ideas

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.080
like evolution, or should we
look at modern science and

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.480
things that are more relevant?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.560
I'm always hearing people saying
you should make science

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.000
more relevant at school.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.080
You can probably tell from the
way I said that I don't

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.170
necessarily agree with that.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.540
But, there might be a strong
argument for it.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.820
You might think, you know, I
don't really need to learn

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.300
about electric motors.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.510
Maybe we should be learning a
bit more about global warming,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.660
although I think they do global

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.880
warming in Latin nowadays.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.860
So, I'm not sure we need
anymore of it.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.090
I didn't say that, that
probably upsets you.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.160
Or perhaps, perhaps we should
forget the facts, and look at,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.960
instead, the history and the
philosophy of science.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.090
Again, this was a change to
the curriculum that was

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.640
brought in around 2006, where
people thought, hold on, maybe

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.330
we don't need to just
teach them facts.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.430
We need to teach them something

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.510
called, how science works.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.700
OK?

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.660
And I can hear muttering in
the audience, so you've

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.380
clearly come across the idea.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.650
And you might want to think
about whether we

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.810
keep that or we don't.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.800
It's up to you.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.050
Finally, you've all probably
done practical work at school,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.830
I don't know.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.460
Probably Hooke's Law, have
you all done Hooke's Law?

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.370
What's the point Hooke's Law?

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.360
You get some springs, you hang
some weights off of it.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.770
And it's probably incredibly
boring, right?

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.692
And, Hooke already
did it, right?

00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:54.740
So, you didn't really find out
anything new, and the school

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.550
has to spend loads of money
buying springs every year

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.450
because I know you mess them up,
right, and the weights and

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.810
the things.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.460
Because I know you borrow
equipment occasionally.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.340
Practical work in schools
is really expensive, OK?

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.950
And here's something some of
you won't know, and some of

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.120
the adults might not know.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.160
Research, science people have
gone and looked at whether

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.210
students learn anything from
practical work, or not.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.690
And the results are
inconclusive.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.140
There's some evidence that
suggests that practical work

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.500
might largely be a
waste of time.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.320
Would you include practical
work in your ideal science

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.540
curriculum, or should we
scrap it altogether?

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.800
Now, the other guys had lots of
fantasy graphs and things,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.352
and I think I've run out
of stuff to talk about.

00:08:35.352 --> 00:08:35.809
Look at that.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.640
Sounds like a sound bite, you
want sound bites, don't you?

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.120
These are real issues, right?

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.669
The Tory government is going
to develop a new national

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.480
curriculum.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.420
And the people who have to make
decisions about what's

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.510
going to be on that curriculum
are going to be thinking about

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.160
these very issues.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.830
And I don't know what answers
they're going to come up with,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.450
but I'm looking forward
to seeing what

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.640
you make of it all.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.350
I'm done, I've probably
finished a bit early.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.600
So, thank you.
