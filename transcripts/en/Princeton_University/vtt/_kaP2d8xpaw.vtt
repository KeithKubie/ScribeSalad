EVAN HEPLER-SMITH:
I'm Evan Hepler-Smith.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm originally from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.690
And I'm in the program
in History of Science

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.250
at Princeton.


00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.120
I'm in my fifth year.


00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.880 position:97%
 


00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.630
I study the naming of
chemical substances.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.580
Nomenclature is something
that every chemist

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.740
has to study still.


00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.040
For a long time, chemists
had to study quite a bit

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.370
about nomenclature.


00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.930
They spent a lot
of time memorizing

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.210
rules of nomenclature,
rules for naming, creating

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.660
policy syllabic,
long, sprawling names.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.720
I study where that collection
of rules came from.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.640
At very end of my
undergraduate career,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.310
I took a course in the
sociology of science.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.110
And that, a light
bulb clicked on.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.670
And I realized
that the same sorts

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.200
of methods I was learning to
study how literary texts were

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.490
put together from
the sentence level

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.630
all the way up to the level of
how narratives are constructed

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.350
could be used to study
something like science, how

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.740
scientific knowledge is made.


00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.670
MICHAEL GORDIN: When
I first met Evan,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.920
which was before he actually
applied to graduate schools,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.380
he was looking at
various programs.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.970
Within five minutes
of talking to him,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.410
it was clear that he had the
knowledge of organic chemistry

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.010
that was well beyond what an
ordinary undergraduate who

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.480
majored in it would have.


00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.880
And it's largely self-taught.


00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.620
It's a characteristic
of Evan that he

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.700
is able to pick up enormous
amounts of information

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.910
by sheer application and will
power and a set of native gifts

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.750
that you will already be able
to see in other contexts.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.250
EVAN HEPLER-SMITH:
During the period

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.780
that I study from
1880s to 1940 or so,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.180
nomenclature wasn't tedious.


00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.130
And that's what's interesting
about this particular period.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.100
That's why I chose these
beginning and end dates.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.320
There was a period of about 40
or 50 years in which chemists

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.390
from the most senior, august
scholars in Europe to chemists

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.050
teaching in high schools felt
that nomenclature was something

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.980
that was both very important,
worth thinking about,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.430
and up for grabs.


00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.750
But I think that attending to
historical examples in which

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.780
something goes from being
an object of public debate

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.040
to the technical, boring
business of specialists

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.470
is a really important
place to look.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.150
Because the politics attendant
on that transformation

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.330
determine what is
in and out of bounds

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.680
of debate for the
public, for scientists,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.790
for people who might potentially
have an interest in rules that

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.550
are being made about how
information is organized

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.330
and shared at many
different levels.
