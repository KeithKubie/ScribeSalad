1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,330
How do you balance the idea of checking
the ego well in an interview scenario

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,860
where you need to talk about
yourself? Okay, so good question.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,260
I,
I would say in that situation,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,150
and this is something that it's not
just an interview situation where you're

5
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:20,740
going to need to do that. I mean, you're
dealing with your, your superiors,

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,160
you know, throughout the course of
your career, whatever that may be.

7
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:26,320
You're constantly interacting
with people and you,

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,450
you're gonna want to make
an impression. Uh, so I,

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,660
I think one of the best ways to do this
is instead of you speaking about why

10
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,094
you're so awesome,

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,220
just state facts of let's
say accomplishments and let
them speak for themselves.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,570
In other words, you know,
you wouldn't want to say a,

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,260
yeah,

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,150
Yup. I am the best project manager in
the entire world. Right. That's not,

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,580
that sounds ego centric.
You know,

16
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:07,260
instead you'd say, uh, you know, I got
this, we had a $38 million project,

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,710
got it done on time, under
budget, ahead of schedule.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,970
And when I got done with that,

19
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,180
when they moved me to another project
that was off track and we got that one

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,970
back on schedule and
back on track as well.

21
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,250
So that's the kind of
experience that I've had.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,880
And I'd love to bring that here to this
company. Right. So you're not, you're not,

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,300
you know, there's a hint of, hey, this
is what I did. I can get some stuff done.

24
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,990
But you're not saying, listen, I'm better
than the people you currently have,

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,470
so you should hire me because I'm the
best cause you don't want to do that. Um,

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,870
and you know, so yeah, just
build, think about it, you know,

27
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,580
before you go in, how, what,

28
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,080
what experience that you have represents
the good qualities that you have.

29
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,670
So then you can say, if they say, you
know, how are you at meeting timelines?

30
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,530
You don't say, I am perfect. I'm never
late. I'm dope. You just say, you say,

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,960
you say, well, you know, as
far as meeting timelines,

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,050
here's a bunch of projects
that I got completed on time.

33
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,080
The only one that I missed was one that
we had to roll back because whatever

34
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,600
that way you're actually showing a little
bit more humility. You're saying, hey,

35
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:11,510
here's what happened. You're being logical
about it and you'll speak into that.

36
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,410
I actually got a good question
that's similar to this one. Um,

37
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,710
about what's the best way to interview
people to see if they can be in a

38
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,470
leadership position.
And this is really hard.

39
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,070
This is really hard cause it's really
hard to interviews and working.

40
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,770
I worked with all kinds of different
companies and everybody always has,

41
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:32,990
you know, hey, what's the best
way to interview? And Man,

42
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:34,790
I interviewed this guy
and he seems so great.

43
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,200
Or I interviewed this woman and she
seemed incredible and or her paper looked

44
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,034
great,
you know,

45
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,260
she looked great on paper and we hired
her and she's a disaster or he's a

46
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,340
disaster or whatever the case may be.
Because,

47
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,420
because there's people that are
very good interviewers, right?

48
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:50,660
I mean there's people that can interview
well, they have the gift of Gab.

49
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,990
They can, they can bs their way through
anything and make themselves sound good.

50
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,170
So it can be really hard to identify if
someone's good is actually going to be

51
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,830
fit for a leadership position
or really any position.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,730
So one of the things that that I always
tell people to do is when you go into

53
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,320
these,
when you want to ask interview questions,

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,700
ask them scenario based questions and
say, okay, here's what's going on.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,980
You got these three people
in your department and one
of the people has come to

56
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,950
you and said that they think there might
be something illegal going on with the

57
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,190
other two. What actions do
you take? And, and you know,

58
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:30,880
have a scenario built out that you can
actually talk through and see where

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,730
they'd go and see what their mindset is
and see what they're going to develop as

60
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,290
a plan and see how they
would execute plans.

61
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,310
So it's a great way of
figuring out how people think.

62
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,380
And then you know, even that's not a
guarantee because there's people that can,

63
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,620
can navigate those types
of answers as well.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,650
So you don't want that you can do is
hire people on a little bit of a trial

65
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,930
basis.
And that can be difficult.

66
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,590
Some situations where people are walking
away from one job into another job and

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,530
they're not going to do it
on a 90 day trial basis.

68
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,060
But when you do have that opportunity,
it's a good thing to do as well. Um,

69
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:01,751
but hey,

70
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:06,160
so going back to the first question
about keeping your ego in check in an

71
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,720
interview,
like I said,

72
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,710
be confident but not cocky and let the
facts of your experience speak for your,

73
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,300
your abilities rather than
beating your own chest.

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,430
Yeah. So it's almost like, I mean,
correct me if I'm wrong here,

75
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,290
so you s you essentially,
even if you're talking yourself up,

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,460
you just, you simply state the
fact that you just state the fact,

77
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:34,110
don't say your opinion about it.
Like, just like how you were saying,

78
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,153
please state the facts.

79
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,590
What I did, you know, we turn
this project around, we got it on,

80
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,780
on track and on budget and that,
that's the type of,

81
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,700
that's the type of experience that
I have in those situations. Right.

82
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,960
Just like how you're saying,

83
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,820
even if someone had got like
an award to be the best,

84
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,440
whatever sales right of the year,

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,220
that right tells me that you're the
best whatever of the year. And then, um,

86
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,010
like to say that in a
factual way would be,

87
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,860
I was recognized as the
best guy in the world.

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,610
Instead of saying I'm the best guy in
the world, who's my award to prove it,

89
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,610
you know? So it's like you're seeing the
fact that you were recognized, you know,

90
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,890
not so much the fact fingered way of
doing it. Stick to the facts, right.

91
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:15,150
Just the facts,
the facts.
