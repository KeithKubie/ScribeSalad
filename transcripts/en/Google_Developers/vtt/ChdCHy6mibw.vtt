ELLIE POWERS: So I'm
going to talk today

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.020
about getting the
most from Google Play.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.060
My name is Ellie Powers.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.960
I'm a product manager
on the Google Play team.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.330
And I work on apps.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.640
Many of you are here
building apps, but why?

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.190
Right?

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.529
Why are we doing this?

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.070
Well, for some of
us, it's because we

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.610
have a particular idea that
we're really passionate about,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.390
and we want to get
out into the world.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.890
For some of us,
it's because we have

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.760
an idea for an exciting
new business that

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.480
doesn't exist yet.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.560
And the sort of world
that we're talking about

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.580
is this multi-device,
multi-billion person world

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.250
that's grown over the
past decade or so.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.460
And we're also going to talk
about how Google, specifically

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.320
Google Play, is
uniquely positioned

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.890
to help you get your idea
and your business out

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.180
into the world and as
successful as possible.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.770
So first a little bit about me.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.560
I love to travel.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.510
I've been to countries
all over the world.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.984
And my favorite
thing when I travel

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:57.650
is to go to a place
that's going to make

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.540
me feel a little bit
out of my element.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.220
The other reason
I love to travel

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.709
is they tell me
that it's supposed

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:06.250
to be a really good idea to get
away from your work from time

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.070
to time.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.260
But unfortunately, when
you work on mobile apps,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.440
this is getting really
hard to do actually.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.040
So about a year ago, I went on
a trip to Thailand and Cambodia.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.750
And when I was on the subways
in Thailand thinking-- yeah,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.460
I'll get away from my work-- I'm
seeing ads for Android games.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.230
And then I go to the
markets in Cambodia

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.500
and I see Android
devices for sale.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.220
And it's really a nice reminder
that the work that we're

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.080
doing here, to build this
mobile ecosystem together,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.800
is really reaching people
all over the world.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.270
And today here we are
in Moscone Center,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.220
and we're seeing that
the wave of Android

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.090
is now going in both directions.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.830
Not only are our
users everywhere,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.450
but there are developers
all over the globe.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.440
Just actually across
here on the floor here,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.790
we have a developer
called Rayark, also

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.200
from Southeast Asia.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.977
And they've made a beautiful,
immersive game experience.

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:55.810
And if you haven't seen
it yet, I definitely

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.400
recommend that you go and
check it out afterwards.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.200
So these are the sorts of
strong mobile ecosystems

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.090
that we're building
all around the world

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.830
and they're tied together
through Google Play.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.139
So how did Google get involved
in this whole mobile apps

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.690
thing?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410
Let's go a little bit further
back into Google's history.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.730
So my first experience
with Google was this box.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.900
And you could just
type stuff into the box

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.730
and it would just
find things for you.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.646
It was magic.

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:23.770
And this was the first
opportunity that a lot of us

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.650
had to see just how
big the world was,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.380
and that seemingly far
away ideas and places

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.640
were now becoming within reach.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.700
And so this was what
Google started out with,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.270
connecting people with the
information and the products

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.330
that they were interested in.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.280
So what happened next?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.700
Well, on April 1,
2004, Gmail launched.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.880
In 2005, YouTube joined Google.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.780
And then with maps and
other key launches,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.840
Google became known for
customer-centric internet

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.941
experiences and really,
really enormous scale.

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.440
I mean, you may
have remembered what

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.850
a big deal it was
over 10 years ago

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.680
when you finally got a whole
gigabyte for your online email

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.190
where people were offering
just a fraction of that.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.690
And this meant that
your information

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.450
could be truly
accessible from anywhere.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.630
And this was
happening on the web.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.102
It was happening on
desktop computers.

00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:13.810
Maybe you remember
having a dial-up modem

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.340
and that big upgrade
moment to DSL.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.440
And this was cool and exciting.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.510
And let's fast forward to today.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.440
Well, Android had
joined back in 2005.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.834
What's happened in
those almost 10 years

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:26.750
is that we've now moved
on to the next chapter

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.620
of the internet.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.720
We have billions of
people connecting.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.780
Many of them are using
Android as their first device.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.980
And what happens?

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.150
What is the difference
between your desktop computer

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.190
and a website with your
mobile device today?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.030
You're now in this kind of
loop of constant interaction.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.280
You've replaced
clicking and typing

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.762
with touch screens, voice
controls, and sensors.

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:50.720
And Google's still doing
what Google has always

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.950
done best which is
connecting people

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.400
with the information
and products

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.140
that they find most interesting.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.460
What this means here is now
connecting people with the apps

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.150
that they love on
a range of devices.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.240
So what we're going
to do today is

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.040
talk about what this means
to developers like all of us.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.280
So again, why do we develop?

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.365
Why do we build apps?

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:15.370
It's to get our ideas and
businesses out into the world.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.019
And an app is
definitely the best way

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.950
to do that in this day and age.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.610
So what we're going
to talk about today

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.506
is how your app can reach the
right users at the right time,

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:25.880
and the approach
that you'll take

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.920
is going to depend on
what stage your app is in.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.420
So first, I want
to talk to those

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.370
of you who are just
getting started.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.194
Maybe you've just built an app
or you have an idea for one.

00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:36.860
You don't have any
users yet, so that'll

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.310
be your first challenge.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.821
So before you publish
your app, you probably

00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:43.070
want to understand this
ecosystem that you're joining,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.960
and that's Google Play.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.370
So what is Play?

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.220
Play is an ecosystem of apps,
developers, and the store.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.080
We have the one billion devices
that were discussed before

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.440
and the people who use them.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.550
Well over a million
apps are in the store.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.230
And behind the scenes,
we have massively

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.930
scaled cloud computing
services that

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.930
can help to do everything that
we're going to talk about next.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.130
What I think about what Google
Play really is at its core

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.720
is a matchmaker.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.810
If I'm a user, it's going to try
to match me with a sort of app

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.002
that I'm going to want.

00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:16.210
Maybe I'm looking for that
app, or maybe I don't even

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.709
know I'm looking and it's just
helping me discover something

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.276
new about what my device can do.

00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:22.150
And then on the other
side, if I have an app,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.180
it's going to match me
with the sort of users

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.640
who are going to be
interested in my app.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.836
So let's start out
with something new,

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:30.460
something that's
coming soon, something

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.640
that we're incredibly
excited about.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.790
So earlier in the keynote,
you heard the discussion

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.190
about material design.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.990
And on Play we're
really trying to take

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.910
this beautiful, interactive
layout to heart.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.910
Now, when you launch a
new app and you put it up

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.820
on the Play store,
you really want

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.840
to make a great
first impression.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.130
So we've decided to
make the store listing

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.540
on Google Play even
more appealing.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.690
And by the way, this is
just a general concept.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.047
It's not totally
done, but we wanted

00:05:59.047 --> 00:06:01.130
to share with you early
so that you can understand

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.640
the context in which your
app will be available.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.120
So at the top you can see this
beautiful feature graphic.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.830
And at the bottom you can
see a quick text summary

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.820
where you can explain to users
exactly what your app will

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.900
for them.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.470
So you might want to go
into the Developer Console

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.650
and make sure that you
actually have this graphic

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.380
and text available so that
when we roll this out,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.060
your app will be ready.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.560
And in the middle
here, you're going

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.660
to see the reasons why the user
may want to install the app.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.150
So for example, a great
reason to install the app

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.860
is it's got a high star rating.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.360
So we call that
out really clearly.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.520
Or maybe it's got
a lot of downloads.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.180
Or maybe, it's
because your friend

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.630
has installed it and
given it a high rating.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.560
So this is going to
be rolling out soon,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.080
and we hope that it'll help you
make your apps give a better

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.120
first impression.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.230
OK.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.350
When I go out in the world and
actually talk to Android users,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.330
I like to ask them how they
find about their favorite apps.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.264
The number one reason I hear
again and again is-- well,

00:06:58.264 --> 00:07:00.430
I found this app because
my friend told me about it.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.810
Perfectly natural.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.670
And that's why on
Google Play we're

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.360
trying to reflect
the same behavior.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.270
Whenever we see that your friend
has rated or plus-oned an app,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.970
we tell you about it.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.654
And we also show you why we
make each [? introduction. ?]

00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:15.070
We don't just say
install the app.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.570
We say you should
install this app because.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.840
So what this does is it
creates a ripple effect.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.150
If you find one user
who installs your app

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.050
and gives you a
rating of plus 1,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.470
it'll ripple out to effect
all of their friends

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.930
and build more momentum
behind your app.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.650
You can also now
follow top brands

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.420
like Wired or the New
Yorker, or even celebrities.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.930
So we talked about Play
being a matchmaker.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.800
How do we do this?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.810
We're using the
full power of Google

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.270
and the user's
full profile to be

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.640
able to target the right
app to the right user

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.890
at the right time.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.790
We've also created
these targeted groups

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.570
of apps based on user interests.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.900
So here, you can
see racing games

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.080
and you can also see
food and drink apps.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.970
And we don't necessarily show
these groups to everybody, only

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.290
to the people who we know
have these interests.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.150
We also show personalized
recommendations

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.085
that are based on a
whole variety of things

00:08:04.085 --> 00:08:05.460
we know about the
user, including

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.470
what their friends
have recommended.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.160
And Play Games is
something that's

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.240
really helpful for those of
you who are making game apps.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.770
Play Game Services
are a great way

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.660
to enhance your app, to make
it more social and more fun.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.310
We launched it last
year at I/O, and we've

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.690
heard that it's a great
way to discover more games

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.430
and also to engage
with the games

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.850
that you're already playing.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.800
So today at I/O we announced
some really exciting features,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.980
including the new user profile,
which you can see here.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.470
It's showing which games you
play in the achievements.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.390
For example, on the
screenshot behind me

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.159
you can see how many
experience points

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.380
that this particular
user has accumulated

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.000
in different types of games.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.910
And then you can
also create what

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.637
are called quests
inside your app.

00:08:47.637 --> 00:08:49.970
You can say-- hey, user, why
don't you go and accomplish

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.630
this particular objective
in a limited time.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.970
And then we'll also go and show
those quests in the Play Games

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.230
app to help recruit new users.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.520
So if a user is looking for
your app, if you're a developer,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.610
you want to be absolutely
sure that that user will

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.830
find that app no matter
where they're looking.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.070
And so that's why it's
integrated with Google Search.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.610
So if someone is on an
Android device and searches

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.420
for your app in
Google Search that

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.620
could be in Chrome or maybe
in the Google search app,

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.430
will actually show your
apps in the search results

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.430
in a nice way with an
easy install button

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.207
so they can install the
app directly from there.

00:09:26.207 --> 00:09:28.540
And then a new feature that
we're rolling out this year,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.956
and we're very
happy to say is now

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:33.310
available to all
developers, is app indexing.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.110
So you're probably familiar
with the idea of Google indexing

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.380
websites, but actually, Google
can do basically the same thing

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.740
with apps too.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.850
So what does this
allow us to do?

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.620
It can allow us to link a
search with a particular page

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.740
inside an app that a user
already has in your device.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.810
So let's give an example.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.310
So here, the user
is saying-- I want

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.924
to search for a Chromecast,
where can I buy it?

00:09:53.924 --> 00:09:55.340
And it turns out
this user already

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.670
had the Walmart app installed.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.330
So when they click
on the link, it'll

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.890
actually launch the
Chromecast app-- sorry,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.360
launch the Walmart
app-- directly

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.517
to the Chromecast page.

00:10:03.517 --> 00:10:05.350
And so this means that
we're giving the user

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.190
the best possible
experience on their device.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.270
So if you're interested
in trying this out now,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.500
this will be available
in the developer console

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.000
through a special
link where you can

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.380
link your app to your website.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.880
OK.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.340
So that's how Play can
act as a matchmaker.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.060
And you publish your app,
and a lot of this goodness

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.910
just happens for
you automatically.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.910
We help you get a lot of
your reach for your app

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.390
without a lot of effort.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.040
So now, I want to talk to
those of you who already have

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.450
an app that's good, and you
already have some users,

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.000
but you want to go
to the next level.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.220
You want to make your app great.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.970
So your next step
is to find a way

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.030
to make your app one that
everyone wants to come back to.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.410
And you want to
use Play to focus

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.070
on finding the exact right
audience for your app too.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.820
So here's the whole
life cycle of an app.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.320
Right?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.886
Design, develop, distribute.

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.260
And this week,
you're going to be

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.759
going to tons of
different sessions.

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:59.310
So we're just going to
focus on a few things here.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.390
Let's take a look at how
we can combine the best

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.970
that the Google has to offer
for Google Play developers.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.640
So from building to promoting
and monetizing your app,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.660
we have a lot of really
interesting solutions

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.880
available.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.930
So let's say we're
launching a new app.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.640
[? Urs ?] showed us
some amazing stuff

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.080
in the new Cloud Platform.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.790
And the classic problem
we hear from developers

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.460
is-- I want to build something
that's ready for massive scale,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.080
but I don't have a huge budget
on day one, so what do I do?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.790
So we've actually created the
Cloud Platform mobile starter

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.290
kit.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.450
And what this can do
for you is allow you

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.190
with very little programming
to be able to set up

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.920
your back-end infrastructure,
and then if you need to scale

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.570
you can just do it like that.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.420
And this allows you to
scale to huge applications

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.040
and get that super
fast performance

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.870
that you expect from Google.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.850
Now, if you're
thinking about making

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.050
your application richer--
maybe through, let's say,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.070
the maps API or
the in-app billing

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.360
API-- the best way to
do that integration

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.480
is through the
Google Play Services.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.410
Now, this is something
that we automatically

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.840
install in the user's devices.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.644
And most importantly,
it's kept up to date.

00:12:04.644 --> 00:12:05.935
So what does this mean for you?

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:08.900
You can just make calls directly
to Google Play Services.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.610
There's no SDK to maintain.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.610
You don't have to wait
for any sort of roll-out.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.990
So you can access these
new features immediately.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.840
So at I/O today, we announced
new activity recognition

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.310
services, including
walking and running.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.650
So you can make a really
interactive application

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.590
that knows what the
user's doing physically.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.130
And we also
announced Cloud Save.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.470
The Cloud Save API allows you
to synchronize data easily

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.250
with your mobile applications
without any sort of background

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.210
programming.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.240
And what this gives
you, for the user,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.970
is the ability to sync
data quickly and easily

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.750
when the user goes
offline and online

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.290
and works across
multiple devices.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:46.900
OK.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.275
So you have a good
app and you're

00:12:48.275 --> 00:12:49.692
ready to get it into the world.

00:12:49.692 --> 00:12:51.525
Well, we've heard from
a bunch of developers

00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:54.650
that as they scale and go beyond
just one application and one

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.250
language to dozens
of applications

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.630
and dozens of
languages, it can get

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.440
to be a little bit
difficult to manage.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.190
You want to produce a
store listing that's

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.630
going to give a great
tailored experience.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.400
If you're in a certain
language, so that

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.550
would mean localized text
and localized graphics.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.760
Or, if you're on,
let's say, a tablet,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.030
you want to provide
tablet screenshots too.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.760
And this ends up meaning that
you have to copy and paste

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.530
a ton of times or manage
hundreds of assets.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.480
So we have a solution that we're
very happy to announce today.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.070
With the new Developer
Publishing API,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.360
you'll be able to
integrate the publishing

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.910
process with your
existing build system.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.230
So you'll be able to manage your
beta testing, stage roll-outs,

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.950
production releases,
and all of the assets

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.520
and images and graphics that
you're looking to roll out.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.450
You can even manage your
in-app product catalog as well.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.370
So this is currently
in a closed beta,

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.210
and we're looking to
roll it out more soon.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:51.860
OK.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.980
So last year when we
talked about beta testing,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.380
we were really excited to
tell all of our developers

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.720
that this feature was coming.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.820
But I've got to say, I
was pretty overwhelmed

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.950
by the reaction.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.660
Developers have
really taken this on

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.629
and made some amazing things
happen for these features.

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:09.920
And I wanted to talk with
you about one developer who's

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.950
actually here in the
audience today, ZenStudios.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.350
So they had a new game that
they were going to launch,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.752
CastleStorm-Free to Siege.

00:14:16.752 --> 00:14:18.210
And if you're a
game developer, you

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.970
know that with every new title
you put so much work into it,

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.950
and you want it to be
perfect when you launch it.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.000
So how do you do this?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.460
Well, ZenStudios decided to
use the beta testing feature.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.120
They decided to make
it a public beta,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.630
although they could
have kept it private.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.060
And they said-- maybe, we
can get about 1,000 users.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.530
So they posted it
on their website.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.490
They posted it on social media.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.410
Three days later,
they had 3,000 users

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.770
and it soon expanded
to about 6,000 users.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.240
So they had a huge amount of
interest in this beta test.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.810
And because they care so much
about the user experience

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.184
and making their
game great, they

00:14:51.184 --> 00:14:53.260
said give us your
honest feedback.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.240
And users, absolutely,
they came back

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.490
with all sorts of great stuff.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.750
They said that the controls in a
couple places were hard to use.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.050
They mentioned exactly
where they were frustrated,

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.860
and this allowed
ZenStudios to be

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.180
able to improve user retention
at some tricky points.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.630
The other feedback
they got was-- well,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.950
different sorts of users
and different countries

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.730
than they had expected actually
wanted to play their game.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.800
So they actually ended
up modifying their launch

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.530
countries.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.140
And they were able to give
a bit of sense of how much

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.510
marketing budget that they
should invest for this game

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.010
because they were able to see
what some of the early metrics

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.500
might look like.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.160
So this early data
and analytics meant

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.430
that they had a much
more successful launch.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.560
Usually, what game
developers end up doing is

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.870
they do a small launch in
maybe a certain smaller

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.780
country like, let's say, Canada.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.860
Or, they might spend a
bunch of money up-front

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.090
on trying to do some
paid user acquisition.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.800
But in this case,
ZenStudios didn't

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.950
need to do either
of these things.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.660
So the result was they had
a really successful launch.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.966
They got a star
rating of 4.5 stars.

00:15:52.966 --> 00:15:54.590
And they now have
hundreds of thousands

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.006
of happy users
playing their game.

00:15:59.468 --> 00:16:00.920
Wrong slide.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.550
OK.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.400
So next, we're going to
talk about staged rollouts.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.950
This feature is all about
keeping the momentum

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.570
going when you push out
new versions of your app.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.310
When we talked with Jack
Threads, they said-- hey,

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.230
we want to redo our
Android app and make it

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.097
the best mobile experience ever.

00:16:16.097 --> 00:16:18.180
But if you're going to
take on a project this big,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.270
you're going to
be really worried.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.728
If you have an
eCommerce app, you'd

00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:22.670
be afraid to touch
the checkout flow

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.237
because you might
break everything.

00:16:25.237 --> 00:16:27.320
Can you imagine having an
eCommerce app and no one

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.240
could buy anything
for a few days?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.080
That would be a huge problem.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.790
So what they said was
with staged rollouts,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.360
they were willing to touch
these trickier bits of code

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.290
and make such a fundamental
change without all

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.984
this worry about breaking stuff.

00:16:40.984 --> 00:16:42.900
And they said that they
can now move much more

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.412
quickly with their small team.

00:16:45.412 --> 00:16:47.120
During the rollouts,
what they do is they

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.657
check the desired metrics,
the stats, the ratings,

00:16:50.657 --> 00:16:52.490
the installs, and the
crashes, and make sure

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.480
that this new version is
performing at least as

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.920
well as the previous one.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.250
So as a result, they
now use staged rollouts

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.160
with every single
launch they do.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.500
And most importantly,
because Google Play

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.554
is such a great platform
for trying new stuff,

00:17:04.554 --> 00:17:06.970
they actually try out their
new features on Android first.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.170
OK.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.750
So you can see why we
launched beta testing

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.920
and staged rollouts, to help
developers make great apps.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.440
So I wanted to
share a few numbers

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.810
about how much of a
response that we've gotten.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.078
We've had over 80,000 apps
use beta testing so far.

00:17:23.078 --> 00:17:25.619
And if you look at all the apps
that have tried this feature,

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:29.390
they have an average rating of
over 4.2 stars, which is great.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.600
This is clear evidence
that people are really

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.070
using this to improve the
quality of their apps.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.180
And over a third
of the apps that we

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.340
see coming from our top
charts are using beta testing.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.380
And many of them are
using staged rollouts too.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.300
It's become a best
practice at Google as well.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:46.900
OK.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.790
So another thing I
hear from developers

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.720
is-- I have limited resources, a
small team, and a lot of ideas,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.070
so how do I know what
to focus on first?

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.820
So optimization
tips is something

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.690
we rolled out last year to
help you localize your apps.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.980
So for example, if
we notice that you've

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.811
gotten a lot of users
in a certain country,

00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.060
but your app isn't available
in their native language,

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.380
we let you know.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.510
Or for example, other
types of opportunities.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.510
Like, if we notice that
you haven't upgraded yet

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.250
to the new in-app
billing V3 API and that

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.870
might be hurting your sales,
we let you know about that too.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.460
So these are all opportunities
to improve your app

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.382
and get more out of Google Play.

00:18:21.382 --> 00:18:23.090
And you said in response
to that-- I also

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.380
want to know when
something's gone wrong.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.112
And so in response to
that, we announced alerts.

00:18:28.112 --> 00:18:29.570
So we'll let you
know if you launch

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.284
a new version of your app
and your ratings go down.

00:18:32.284 --> 00:18:33.700
Developers like
this too, and what

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.350
we heard from you was-- well,
I want to find out even sooner.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.160
So we're also releasing a way
that you can now go and sign up

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.990
to receive email
alerts every time you

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.510
get a new alert in the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.060
OK.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.268
So once you have your app
and it's doing pretty well,

00:18:50.268 --> 00:18:52.210
you probably want to
take a closer look

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.620
at what users are
doing inside your app.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.120
And so that's where Google
Analytics can come in.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.800
It's the easiest way to
get this deep insight

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.030
into in-app behavior.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.700
And it also can
allow you to see how

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.100
users behave as they move
from your mobile apps

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.650
across different
platforms to the web.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.260
So one of the best things
about Google Analytics,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.800
why it's so easy
to integrate, is

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.950
it uses the Google
Play Services which

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.370
is already on the user's device.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.020
This just means that you need
only a couple of lines of code

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.470
added to your application with--
and you don't blow your APK

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.495
size by adding
another Analytics SDK.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.700
And once you get a sense of what
people are doing in your app,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.070
then the next thing you
want to do is experiment.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.830
So what you can do here
is set up a few goals.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.960
Maybe your goal is to have
your users watch more videos,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.490
or make more purchases,
or things like that.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.600
You set the goal.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.800
Then you can set up a
couple of different options,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.900
and over time it'll
switch automatically

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.450
to whatever the best option is.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.290
So last year, we
announced that we

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.960
were helping you identify which
of your marketing campaigns

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.060
was the most successful at
recruiting new valuable users.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.120
So what you can do here
is for each campaign,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.014
you can see how many users view,
install, and launch your app.

00:20:10.014 --> 00:20:11.680
And that means you'll
end up focusing on

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.090
the most effective user
acquisition channels

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.700
and fine-tuning your campaigns.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.720
And usually we find
with developers

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.640
as they get more
sophisticated, they'll

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.320
define some sort
of group of users

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.350
that they think is
the most valuable.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.320
So for example, in
this game, we might

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.980
say that we want
to track users who

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.100
came in through a
certain campaign.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.080
They've reached at
least level seven,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.040
and let's say that
they've spent $5.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.700
And you can track how that group
of users is doing over time.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.240
So we've seen freemium apps
become the most popular way

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.160
to monetize on Google Play.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.180
And so AdMob recently
launched a new product

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.300
to help make these freemium
apps more relevant and more

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.620
successful.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.650
So let's take a look
at how this works.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.950
So when you're
having an app that's

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.050
monetized through
in-app purchases,

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.980
it's really important
to reach the right user

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.410
at the right time with the right
in-app product that constitutes

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.280
a meaningful interaction
for the user,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.950
and some time when they're
willing to make a purchase,

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.280
basically.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.320
So these ads can
really help improve

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.820
the relevance of
the in-app products

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.095
that you're showing to users.

00:21:19.095 --> 00:21:21.220
And if you've already set
up that segment of people

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.670
who came in through Campaign
X and are on level seven

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.970
and have spent at least
$5 in Google Analytics,

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.810
you can use these user
segments here in AdMob

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:35.360
to be able to show those
right ads at the right time.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.050
We talk to our best
developers and we

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.240
try to understand how
they got so successful

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.970
from a financial perspective.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.020
And then we want to make
that information available

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.010
and that top expertise part
of the regular experience

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.630
in the developer console.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.550
So some of the top metrics
we find our best developers

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.820
tracking are the average
revenue per paying

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.670
user and the number of buyers
that they have in their app.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.780
So we've added these
now, and we're also

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.960
going to offer breakdowns
by country so that you

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.680
can see how are these important
metrics tracking as you expand

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.770
your business into new markets.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:09.690
OK.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.900
Another trend that we've
seen is subscriptions.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.290
We're seeing more and more
apps moving to this model

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.980
and it's become the
fastest growing way

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.770
to make money in apps.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.640
And this can be really
helpful for your app,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.450
especially if it
has fresh content

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:23.970
or is frequently updated.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.050
And if you can manage to
find the right product,

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.670
it can make a great,
steady recurring revenue

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.960
stream for your users--
for your business, too.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.750
So this year at I/O, we're
very happy to announce

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.000
that we're going to be rolling
out weekly and seasonal

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.640
subscriptions pretty soon.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.264
So if you're making a
World Cup app, for example,

00:22:41.264 --> 00:22:43.430
this can be the right way
to structure that offering

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.730
to users.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.230
OK.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.110
So earlier today, we
announced that we're

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.320
going to be offering direct
carrier billing on tablets.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.650
All the user has to do is
set it up on their smartphone

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.930
and it'll keep working
on their tablets.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.580
And direct carrier
billing is super popular,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:04.430
and it's available on about
50 percent of all play users.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.194
We've also seen with the launch
of PayPal and gift cards,

00:23:08.194 --> 00:23:10.610
there's just more and more
ways for users around the globe

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.490
to pay.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.880
So what this means is
as our business expands

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.650
and more people in all
over the world buy devices,

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.400
they're able to make
purchases as well.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.100
OK.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.580
So let's say that you're a
developer who has a great app.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.950
You're already measuring
your business carefully,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.670
and your next step is to be
part of the next big thing.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.450
So here's a couple of
advanced strategies

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.600
if this is the place
that your app is in.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.120
So previously, we were
talking about reaching

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.560
users one by one, but we
have some new exciting ways

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.880
to reach users in groups
through the organizations

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.090
that they're a part of.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.740
So if you have an
app that's targeted

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.280
towards educational purposes,
particularly classroom

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.080
education, you can submit
your app for inclusion

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.380
in Play for education.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.000
What this does is it
puts your educational app

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.370
in front of school
administrators and teachers,

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.780
and this opens up a
new opportunity for you

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.270
through bulk purchasing.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.330
So if you haven't signed
up for this program

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.330
yet but you think your
app should be part of it,

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.680
you can sign up in
the developer console.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.319
And then announced
earlier today, we've

00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:14.860
talked about how
we're making Android

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.520
much much better
for enterprises.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.810
So this is another way to
reach users and groups.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.350
If you have an app that's
great for people in a business

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:27.170
context, this can be a fantastic
way to expand your reach.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.970
We're going to be making
a bunch of changes

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.470
across the Android platform
and across Play when

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.492
system administrators
will be able to say-- hey,

00:24:34.492 --> 00:24:35.950
I want to take this
app and make it

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.890
available to my whole company.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:38.791
So stay tuned.

00:24:38.791 --> 00:24:40.290
This is a very new
program and we're

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.420
excited to tell you more soon.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.210
So Android Wear is
something you've

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.990
seen a lot of people
talking about today,

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.480
and it's something that we're
incredibly excited about.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.170
This is an
opportunity for a user

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.410
to have a device with
them all the time

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:58.270
and not just in their pocket or
in their bag, but on their arm.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.600
And there's a lot of new
interaction opportunities

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.770
that come up there.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.830
So when we told the
Huffington Post about this--

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.371
they were one of
our early partners--

00:25:05.371 --> 00:25:08.172
and they said-- yeah, this would
be a really cool opportunity.

00:25:08.172 --> 00:25:10.380
There app already worked
great on phones and tablets,

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.920
and they were looking to keep
being part of that leading

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.350
device availability.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.842
So they decided to extend
their app onto the watch.

00:25:17.842 --> 00:25:19.300
One of the cool
features they added

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.670
was the ability to get headline
alerts 24/7 for their biggest

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.240
news aficionados.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.980
And you can also share
stories really easily

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.390
without even taking your
phone out of your pocket.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.880
So how Google Play is helping
expand onto these new devices

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.410
is by knowing which
devices a user has.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.040
And then we can
surface the groups

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.350
of the best apps
for those devices

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.934
to those specific
users who have them.

00:25:43.934 --> 00:25:45.600
And this helps you
reach the right users

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.310
in the ecosystem for
these specialized devices

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.470
that you build apps for.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.031
OK.

00:25:52.031 --> 00:25:53.780
So now we're going to
talk about the thing

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.950
that I am the most
excited about,

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.600
compared to everything else.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.050
We all talked about the
promise of the internet,

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.800
connecting the whole
world, and we finally

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.180
have the ability to
realize that promise

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.330
in the very near future.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.900
So in the mid-1990s,
it took about ten years

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.490
to connect the first billion
people to the internet.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.210
Then it took about five
years for the second billion.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.830
And the third billion should
be connected just about any day

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.330
now.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.559
We're almost there.

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:22.100
And for many of
these people, Android

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.490
is really their first computer.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.160
It's their first experience
at being connected and seeing

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.230
how the internet can
enhance their lives.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.760
And the way that
this has turned out

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.640
is that all these three billion
people are on mobile devices

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.390
and they want apps.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.170
So if you want to reach
every person in the world,

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.430
you need to understand
what countries they're in.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.855
And we can see what top
countries are available.

00:26:42.855 --> 00:26:44.480
Sure, the US is on
there, but it's only

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.720
a teeny, teeny part
of that big doughnut.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.140
So when you're thinking
about how to reach the world

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.920
and how to grow
your business, it's

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.200
great to think about
other countries, and all

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.750
the opportunities
there for users

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.580
who want a lot of
the same things,

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.940
or sometimes different
things for mobile apps.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.140
And an app should also
speak the user's language.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.870
Yes, English is
popular, but also

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:09.270
Chinese, Spanish, Japanese,
Portuguese, et cetera.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.530
And that's what Samuel Braff
from textPlus told us about.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.370
His challenge was he wanted
to make this great messaging

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.360
app that would help
users exchange messages

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.020
or make calls for free
or for a small fee.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.500
And he realized that in order
to get people fully engaged

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.480
with this application,
they needed

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.410
to really understand
what the app did.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.505
And that meant explaining
the features clearly

00:27:30.505 --> 00:27:32.980
in the user's native language.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.430
So he looked at which countries
outside the US and Canada,

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.190
where he had initially
launched, had some usage,

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.110
and he decided to localize.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.240
He saw four times the growth
in the non-English speaking

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.760
markets since then.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.130
When we launched the app
translation service last year,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.032
the company was pretty
quick to get involved.

00:27:50.032 --> 00:27:51.740
And here are the
reasons why they told us

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.170
that they've stuck with our
app translation service.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.822
First of all, it's an XML file.

00:27:55.822 --> 00:27:57.280
With previous
services, they'd have

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.250
to copy and paste
all their strings.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.280
The turnaround time
was also very quick,

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.880
so there were no more delayed
releases due to translation.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.380
And it was affordable,
so that meant

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.080
that they could localize
into more markets.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.050
So this strategy has helped them
reach over 100 million people

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:15.020
globally, and Android is a
key part of that strategy.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.690
So this is what the app
translation service looks like.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.570
First, we show you
some optimization tips

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.944
recommending where
you might want

00:28:20.944 --> 00:28:22.590
to consider
translating your app.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.030
Then you can request
the languages

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.575
that you want to translate
into and pay easily.

00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:30.510
You get back a professional
translation pretty quickly.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.352
OK.

00:28:31.352 --> 00:28:32.810
So what have we
talked about today?

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.366
The world's population is
about 7 billion people.

00:28:35.366 --> 00:28:37.615
About 3 billion of them are
connected to the internet.

00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:41.320
And there's a billion or so
Android devices actively being

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.244
used.

00:28:42.244 --> 00:28:43.410
And this is really exciting.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.900
Play is available on more
devices than any other app

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.950
store in the world.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.450
And so it's the
best way to reach

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.900
the right user at
the right time.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.240
So in this new mobile
world, connecting everybody

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.490
is really exciting.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.870
And this is, for me, why
I got into technology,

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.120
and I think for
many of you as well.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.510
So we know that
people really want

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.480
to find great apps to
connect with each other

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.760
and to really make the
most of their lives

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.074
and enhance what they're
doing on a daily basis.

00:29:09.074 --> 00:29:11.240
And so with Google, we're
really happy to be helping

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.190
users find these
great experiences.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.659
Connecting people with the
apps and the information

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:17.200
that they're looking
for so that they

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.325
can make the most of their
devices and their lives.

00:29:19.325 --> 00:29:21.820
So thank you to everyone
here for helping

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.280
us build these experiences and
being part of this new world.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.088
Thank you.

00:29:26.088 --> 00:29:31.541
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:32.040
All right.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.915
We'll take questions.

00:29:32.915 --> 00:29:35.456
It would be great if you have
a question if you could come up

00:29:35.456 --> 00:29:37.560
to this microphone here
or that microphone there.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.510
No question.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.380
Great.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:49.880
Oh, wait.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.140
One question.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.760
We have one-- wait, maybe.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.770
OK.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.500
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
interested in what

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.000
the future is for subscription
billing in the Play store.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.590
One thing we've noticed, and
we had a big rollout of it

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.730
this year, is the lack
of testing tools involved

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.300
in a namely sandbox testing.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.080
It's actually really
hard to test expiration

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.360
of subscriptions
and also get data

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.970
on how many people are
renewing and basically

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.070
what your turnover rate
is, what your churn rate

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.615
is on subscriptions.

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:18.073
So I just wanted
to see if you have

00:30:18.073 --> 00:30:20.120
any plans on enhancing
that [? future step. ?]

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.801
ELLIE POWERS: So it's really
about trusting subscriptions?

00:30:22.801 --> 00:30:24.550
Or were there some
other figures there too

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.550
that you're wondering about.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.560
AUDIENCE: Really
just subscriptions.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.601
I mean, right now you guys
have really good tools

00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:32.130
for just one-off consumable
purchases in the in-app store.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.210
But more, the
subscriptions are lacking.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.001
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah.

00:30:35.001 --> 00:30:36.270
That's a great point.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.470
I think it's a new product.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.910
It's one that we've been
really excited to see so much

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.110
take up of over the
past year or so.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.326
I think we've definitely
heard the issues that you're

00:30:45.326 --> 00:30:46.950
bringing up, especially
around testing.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.260
And we don't have anything
to announce right now,

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.801
but we're definitely
looking into it.

00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:53.610
So thanks for raising that.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.275
Yes.

00:30:54.275 --> 00:30:54.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.829
Thanks for your talk.

00:30:56.829 --> 00:30:59.120
You mentioned Google Play
for Education and the ability

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.562
to do bulk purchasing.

00:31:00.562 --> 00:31:03.815
What about apps that are
freemium with in-app purchases?

00:31:03.815 --> 00:31:07.050
Do you have a timeline for
being able to do bulk purchasing

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.120
on in-app purchases, either
in Google Play for Education

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.857
or in general for businesses?

00:31:11.857 --> 00:31:13.440
ELLIE POWERS: That's
a great question.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.600
I think as we're seeing more and
more organizations being really

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.910
keen to adopt Android
and Google Play

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.430
to distribute to
their users, it's

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.700
becoming something that's
more pertinent to what

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.670
these companies and
schools are looking to do.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.390
So we don't have anything
to announce today.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.524
But yes, I think
we're looking into it

00:31:30.524 --> 00:31:31.940
and we're aware
that it's becoming

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.856
more and more of an
issue, especially as we're

00:31:33.856 --> 00:31:37.550
seeing more and more even
educational apps moved

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.740
to a freemium model.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.590
So we are definitely
looking into it.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.490
Yes?

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.660
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
what the state or plans are

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.120
for a business-to-business
app store,

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.315
such that we can do
business-to-business apps that

00:31:50.315 --> 00:31:53.110
are centrally managed,
rather than delivered ad hoc.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.860
ELLIE POWERS: Hmm.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.230
So business-to-business store.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.410
So I guess we're not
announcing everything

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.550
yet about the new
improvements that we're

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.160
making for Android
on enterprise.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.830
But probably the sorts of
things that we're looking at

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.720
are a greater ability
for, let's say,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.240
an IT administrator at a
company to take initiative

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.750
to make purchases of
apps, or to decide which

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.454
apps can be available on users.

00:32:16.454 --> 00:32:18.370
So maybe we can talk
more about it afterwards,

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.550
but we're definitely
looking at ways

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.820
that a company can say--
this is a software we want

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.084
to have available to our
company, make that purchase,

00:32:24.084 --> 00:32:26.000
and then distribute it
out to the right people

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.550
in the company.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.050
It's definitely something we're
thinking a lot about as part

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.560
of these enterprise
projects that we're doing.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.170
AUDIENCE: OK, but
specifically as far as custom

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.310
made applications,
specifically for a client.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.540
ELLIE POWERS: Oh, I see.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.309
So something that's just a
bespoke application for-- yeah,

00:32:40.309 --> 00:32:42.100
we should probably talk
offline about that.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:42.600
Yeah.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.241
Thanks.

00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:44.740
Yes?

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.540
[? AUDIENCE: Exclusive ?] of
all the countries which have

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.420
different RPU.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.320
Like, in India, the
ad pool is very low

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.030
as comparatively people
do less in-app purchases.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.800
So the only way to get
the [? downwards ?]

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.150
is only the organic traffic.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.890
And when we see the
offering sections

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.980
and we see the radio
sections of the store,

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.500
we see very different type of
apps that should not be there.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.640
You know that there
is some problem there.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.330
So is Google working
out how to fix

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.740
the problem of getting
more organic traffic

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.120
for the [? represent? ?]
If the developers can hold

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.030
the logic behind this
reason, you can get a better

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.880
organic traffic, or if you do
this, then this would happen.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.338
Because this is a very important
question for the countries

00:33:21.338 --> 00:33:22.429
where the RPU is very low.

00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:23.220
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.750
So just to make sure I
understand your question,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.374
I think you're asking
about what are we

00:33:26.374 --> 00:33:28.090
doing to help getting
organic traffic,

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.840
especially in markets where
the RPU doesn't facilitate

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.610
spending a lot of money
on paid user acquisition?

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.110
Yeah.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.450
I think it's something where
we're looking carefully

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.432
at how we can tune
our algorithms best.

00:33:39.432 --> 00:33:41.890
I think one of the trends that
we've seen that's definitely

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.780
difficult is Google Play
has become very popular.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.926
There's many apps in
store, and everyone

00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:48.550
wants to make sure
that they're getting

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.950
their share of that traffic.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.159
So we've definitely been looking
at ways to tune the store.

00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:54.700
And I think when we
talk about things

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.520
like doing user targeting,
what we're hoping to do

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.800
is if I have a mobile device and
my mother has a mobile device,

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.440
Google Play should offer
us different things.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.190
And so the great news
there can mean that

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.449
rather than offering the
same application to me

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:11.679
and my mother, if you offer us
each a different application,

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.889
it's not a loss to any
developer because an app

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:16.931
that I might want, she might
not want, and vice versa.

00:34:16.931 --> 00:34:18.639
So I hope through
better personalization,

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.960
that's where we're
going to be able to make

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.334
the most of the
store real estate

00:34:21.334 --> 00:34:23.739
so that we're surfacing
only apps that the user is

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.350
likely to be interested
in and not other apps.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.800
But it is a big challenge.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.670
Yes?

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.010
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the optimization

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.400
depreciation that
Google Play dashboard.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.730
So right now, it's only
focused on the localization,

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.440
localizing this language
and that language.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.170
One thing in my
experience I've seen

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.159
is that oftentimes the
certain devices which

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.850
are popular in the geography.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.030
So for example,
in India, Micromax

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.389
is among the top 10 devices.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:56.580
But in my list of
devices, they feature

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.070
on the fifth or sixth number.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.900
You know?

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.750
So can you share if my app
is popular in a particular

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.540
geography, can the
optimization tip be in a way

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.390
that you are populating
[? Russia ?] you might as well.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.970
But this phone, which is
highest download in Russia,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.720
is not in your top ten.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.245
So I might as well optimize
the presence for that.

00:35:16.245 --> 00:35:17.120
ELLIE POWERS: Oh, OK.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.120
So just to make sure I
understand your question.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.330
So you're saying if
you're offering your app

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.800
in a certain market, you want
to highlight which devices

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.150
might be more popular there?

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.780
AUDIENCE: I believe my
distribution pattern

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:34.210
across devices should also
shadow the overall distribution

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.830
better than the geography.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.250
If I'm not, then I'm leaving
money on the table, right?

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.240
ELLIE POWERS: I see.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.184
Yeah, it's a good question.

00:35:42.184 --> 00:35:44.850
Yeah, I think we definitely want
to show which devices you have.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.808
But I guess also it gets
a little bit sensitive

00:35:46.808 --> 00:35:48.890
because some of our
partners may not necessarily

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.556
want to share overall
statistics about that.

00:35:52.556 --> 00:35:53.930
But I think it's
a good question.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:56.179
I think a common question
that we hear from developers

00:35:56.179 --> 00:35:58.080
is when they're moving
into a new market,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.430
they definitely want to
be able to understand

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.050
which devices they're going
to support, and to make

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.910
sure they're not, like you said,
leaving money on the table.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.880
So I think it's an interesting
problem to figure out.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.635
Maybe we could talk
more about it later.

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:13.260
AUDIENCE: Can I have a
follow-up question on the same?

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.970
Plus-one seems to be
a big driver for us

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:19.990
for getting the organic traffic.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.260
Intuitively it makes
sense to recommend people

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:28.790
and to plus one the app when
they are in a-- down the

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:31.570
funnel when they're three or
four days into the process.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.660
But some developers
I talk with, they

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.440
say it's right at the outset
if you ask them, they do it.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.037
So when is the right time
to push that request.

00:36:39.037 --> 00:36:40.620
ELLIE POWERS: That's
a great question.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.980
I actually haven't looked
at the data for that.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.020
I think each
developer will depend.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.630
I've seen, I guess
similar to you,

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:50.060
I've seen a couple developers
and sometimes they say-- hey,

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.746
you've used this
app for this long,

00:36:51.746 --> 00:36:53.120
it looks like
you're enjoying it,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.940
would you mind
giving us a rating?

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.327
So I think it will depend
on your application,

00:36:58.327 --> 00:37:00.410
but I haven't actually
looked at the data for that

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.640
to see if there was
an optimal time.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.931
But I would guess it probably
varies on the type of app

00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:04.660
that you have.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.050
If the user is very
enthusiastic for your app,

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.484
then they're probably
more happy to do it.

00:37:09.484 --> 00:37:10.900
If they're in the
middle of a task

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.400
and doing something that they
consider to be very important,

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.713
that may be a distraction
for them at that point.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.606
Yes?

00:37:19.606 --> 00:37:20.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.800
It's not a question,
but I'd just

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.780
like to hear your
opinion about the gaming

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.030
category and the
top-grossing list.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.340
Once you have a strong
title on the top-grossing,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.460
it's very easy for you to
cross-promote and create

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.060
other titles that go
up in the same list.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.780
And that makes this
list very static.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.090
So what are the chances
for indie developers,

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.810
for new developers,
gaming studios,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:52.130
to launch games and reach this
top-grossing in the gaming

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.935
category?

00:37:52.935 --> 00:37:55.702
ELLIE POWERS: You know, I
think if you look at games,

00:37:55.702 --> 00:37:57.910
you're right that there are
a lot of very big players

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:58.910
who are very successful.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.770
But I think at the same time,
there's always something new.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.740
Flappy Bird, where
did that come from?

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.240
Right?

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.112
Somehow that managed
to get to the top.

00:38:06.112 --> 00:38:07.570
So I think that's
something that we

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:08.944
look at a lot,
which is how do we

00:38:08.944 --> 00:38:13.770
offer this balance between
things that are trending,

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.824
things that are really
new, and some people want

00:38:15.824 --> 00:38:17.990
those sorts of things, and
other people kind of want

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.210
the stuff that's really
well-known big brands.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:22.780
So I think we offer a
variety of different charts

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.029
to be able to do that.

00:38:24.029 --> 00:38:25.570
And then we're always
looking at ways

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.440
to tweak those
algorithms to make sure

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.379
that they're counting
things right.

00:38:29.379 --> 00:38:30.920
I think in terms of
indie developers,

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.420
we do a lot of different special
featuring programs there.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.620
We put together a lot of
groups of applications

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.686
of very high quality games
that we actually call out

00:38:39.686 --> 00:38:40.810
is-- these are indie games.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.360
And so certain types of
gamers are really interested

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.586
in that type of thing.

00:38:44.586 --> 00:38:46.460
And again, I think a
lot of it will come down

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.870
to the personalization
whereas if we can find out

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.190
what sort of person
likes your application,

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.910
then we can show it to that
person, but maybe not to my mom

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.910
who might not like
that type of game.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.000
So I think it's definitely
a big challenge.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.295
You have a balance
of big companies

00:39:01.295 --> 00:39:03.670
who know what they're doing
and are really, really strong

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:06.450
at being able to do a
great marketing campaign

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:07.504
and building a great app.

00:39:07.504 --> 00:39:08.920
And then also
wanting to make sure

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.960
that the platform can remain
responsive to new people who

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.100
are entering and making really
exciting, different stuff.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:15.600
Thank you.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:22.690
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about alternative Android app

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.820
store markets.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.510
There are a few other ones
besides the Play store.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.440
You had mentioned
with Google Analytics

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.950
that it ties in with
the Play Store that's

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.310
installed on the device.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.800
There's also other utilities
that are just basic function

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.970
utilities of a
person's cellphone.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.730
Like for example, GCM.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:45.220
So it seems that if I,
as an Android developer,

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.300
want to be able to
support a plethora

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.770
of different
distribution channels,

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.530
I have to bend over
backwards to be

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.200
able to support some core
functionality like push

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.625
notifications or
Google Analytics, which

00:39:58.625 --> 00:39:59.720
is very robust.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.780
And it doesn't
currently-- it's not

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:06.330
supported on devices
that were customized

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.220
for alternative stores.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.680
And is this something
that Google feels

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.720
is a problem or an unnecessary
burden to developers?

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:20.450
And is there any direction of
moving forward about unifying,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:23.620
being able to create a
solution that prevents people

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.790
like myself from having
to have multiple versions,

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.510
different binaries
that I'm submitting

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.470
to different locations?

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.020
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.770
I think-- one of the
points that you mentioned

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.790
is that you have the
flexibility on Android to create

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.550
a variety of binaries
and to tailor them

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:45.265
based on the device or the
market or the particular store.

00:40:45.265 --> 00:40:47.140
There's a number of
definite stores out there

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.910
that also offer
analytics services

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.312
and other capabilities.

00:40:50.312 --> 00:40:52.520
On one hand, you definitely
have a lot of flexibility

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.811
there where you can create
all these different binaries

00:40:54.811 --> 00:40:57.330
and tailor each one to
the stack of services

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:02.099
that you expect to have
on that user's device.

00:41:02.099 --> 00:41:02.640
I don't know.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.310
It's a good question.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.143
I haven't actually heard
your exact question

00:41:05.143 --> 00:41:09.820
before around how the
Play Services connects

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.835
in those other environments.

00:41:11.835 --> 00:41:12.960
I have to think about that.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.570
I mean, I think
usually what people

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.466
want to do is either create
a very specific binary that's

00:41:17.466 --> 00:41:20.090
integrated with what's happening
in that alternative app store.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.760
So I haven't actually
heard about people saying

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.176
that they would
want to try to use

00:41:23.176 --> 00:41:25.270
Play Services with
those other app stores

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.040
because I think-- again,
depending on what market you're

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.900
looking at, those users
may or may not even

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.840
have those services
installed on their devices.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.885
So it would depend.

00:41:33.885 --> 00:41:34.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.300
I think it's a
particularly painful point

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.300
with push notification.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.350
That can be something that's
a challenge for especially

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:41.762
smaller development teams.

00:41:41.762 --> 00:41:42.470
ELLIE POWERS: OK.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:43.150
That's good feedback.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.566
I've actually never heard that
particular feedback before.

00:41:45.566 --> 00:41:46.540
So thanks.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.420
ELLIE POWERS: All right.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:50.920
All right.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.685
Well, thank you, everybody.

00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:53.210
I really appreciate
all your time today

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.126
and all the questions.

00:41:54.126 --> 00:41:54.700
Thanks.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.008
