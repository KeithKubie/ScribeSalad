00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.288
(techno music)

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.455
- I'm really delighted to be able to

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.591
participate in this wonderful symposium.

00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:30.238
What I would like to tell you today

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:33.141
is one particular aspect that is

00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:36.600
absolutely essential for
normal brain development.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.575
That is to have proper parenting.

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:43.406
We've heard from the wonderful talk from

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:46.471
BJ Casey right before me how important

00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:49.388
proper nurturing from caregivers is

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.614
for normal mental health of the infant

00:00:53.614 --> 00:00:55.531
that then become adult.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.789
The question we've been
very interested in is

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.087
what makes a parent a parent?

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:04.587
If you think about

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.126
parenting involve

00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:11.284
one, two, sometimes multiple adults

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:14.442
that take care of an infant.

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:17.344
The relationship is
completely asymmetrical,

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:20.340
there is really a very helpless individual

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.193
that requires a lot, a lot of
care for very, very long time.

00:01:25.193 --> 00:01:28.026
What makes parents be parent?

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:31.207
It's I think a very interesting behavior,

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:34.156
a long-term behavior that has

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.385
a lot of emotional components.

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:39.802
This is a behavior also that is displayed

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:43.374
by many animal species.

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:45.603
It is absolutely essential
for the development

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:48.761
and the survival of the species.

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.619
So the idea is that there may be some

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.218
genetically pre-programed
neural signal in the brain.

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:56.516
And what we're interested in is really

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:59.164
trying to understand the neural basis.

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:01.764
What are the specific
neurons that are involved

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:04.272
in the control of parenting behavior,

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:06.594
in the display of parenting behavior?

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:11.284
And when is it that these
behavior actually goes wrong?

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:13.165
There are a number of circumstances

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.278
in which the behavior goes wrong.

00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:18.528
This is one of I think, one of the most

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:24.587
really impressive or very surprising slide

00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:26.971
related to mental illness.

00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:29.269
That's the number of
psychiatric hospitalization

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.988
after childbirth.

00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:34.053
You can see right at
the time of childbirth

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.259
this enormous peak in

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.417
psychiatric hospitalization of women.

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:43.584
These are patients that suffer
from post-partum psychosis.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.102
This is very quite rare.

00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:49.401
It requires hospitalization
because these women

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:53.604
have obsessive thought about
harming their children.

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:56.832
And therefore they require
very intensive care.

00:02:56.832 --> 00:02:58.457
These

00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:02.624
way less severe form which
is post-partum depression

00:03:04.262 --> 00:03:07.072
that affect 10 to 20% of mother

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:10.903
and five to 10% of fathers in the US.

00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:13.132
And these also comes right after birth

00:03:13.132 --> 00:03:17.219
and result in an inability to emotionally

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.030
connect with children

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.613
and in affect impact parenting.

00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:26.878
There are quite a number of risk factors,

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:29.084
_, life circumstances prior depression

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:32.149
and sensitivity to hormone changes.

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:33.482
As it turns out,

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:37.884
right at birth there's an enormous change

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:41.134
of hormonal levels in the young mother.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.781
You can see here progesterone, estrogen,

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:48.124
oxytocin, prolactin, there's really

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:51.793
an enormous and very sudden
drop in hormone level.

00:03:51.793 --> 00:03:54.092
Some people call these hormonal cows.

00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:56.994
Women in particular that are sensitive

00:03:56.994 --> 00:04:01.012
to these hormone fluctuation
have really difficulty

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:03.821
in coping with those changes.

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:06.584
How do we understand the positive

00:04:06.584 --> 00:04:09.696
and the negative regulation
of parental behavior?

00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:11.669
Well let's turn to animals.

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.156
So in animals

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:14.656
and human as well,

00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:19.680
the primary care giver
is usually the mother.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.002
And in animals and in
mammals in particular,

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:23.697
this makes a lot of sense

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:26.114
because in mammals the mother

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.779
nurtures the fetus, the embryo in utero

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.498
for a long period of time

00:04:32.498 --> 00:04:34.541
and then is involved in lactation.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:38.094
So really involve enormous
maternal resources

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:42.552
in nurturing the infant and
therefore it makes sense

00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:45.802
that mom continue to nurture the infant

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:48.612
through parental behavior.

00:04:48.612 --> 00:04:49.982
What about males?

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:52.304
In most mammalian species,

00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:55.369
a very large subset of mammalian species,

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:58.342
the males actually attack the infants.

00:04:58.342 --> 00:05:02.010
Attack them sometime or very
often actually kill them.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.750
This infanticidal behavior has been widely

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.417
observed in many animal species.

00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:11.243
It is thought that this is actually

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.267
an evolutionary driven aggressive behavior

00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:19.843
of the males in order to gain access

00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:22.490
to the females that are not accessible

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.486
when they are nurturing their own infant.

00:05:25.486 --> 00:05:27.529
Interestingly, this is a behavior

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.828
that is absent in monogamous species

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:32.150
in which both the male and the female

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.959
are nurturing their infant and therefore

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.514
there is not this conflict of access

00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:40.254
of the male to the female.

00:05:40.254 --> 00:05:43.063
Infant neglect and aggression is also

00:05:43.063 --> 00:05:46.221
occasionally displayed
by distressed female.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.216
This is seen in animals
as well as I mentioned

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:52.537
in post-partum depression
and psychosis in human.

00:05:52.537 --> 00:05:54.232
We're not working with human,

00:05:54.232 --> 00:05:55.857
we're not working wit primates,

00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:57.483
we're working with mice.

00:05:57.483 --> 00:06:01.314
And in mice, there is in
this animal species I mention

00:06:01.314 --> 00:06:04.054
a very clear sexual dimorphism in

00:06:04.054 --> 00:06:08.221
the behavior of animal male
and female towards infants.

00:06:09.162 --> 00:06:11.495
Females even virgin females,

00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:14.805
or sexually inexperienced females,

00:06:14.805 --> 00:06:17.707
spontaneously take care of infants.

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:21.724
They will build a nest, they
will lick and groom the pups,

00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:26.043
retrieve them to the nest and
huddle around the infants.

00:06:26.043 --> 00:06:28.621
Virgin males in contrast
will spontaneously

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:32.452
attack infants, wound
them and kill them through

00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:34.751
infanticidal behavior.

00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:37.305
Very, very different set of behavior.

00:06:37.305 --> 00:06:41.067
However males are not always infanticidal

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:45.386
and in fact and strikingly
males after mating

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:48.079
with the female are no
longer infanticidal.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:50.773
The video I would like to show you here

00:06:50.773 --> 00:06:54.720
is from _ certified infanticidal male.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.248
This male attacked infants
three weeks earlier

00:06:59.248 --> 00:07:02.150
and then we had that
male mating with a female

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.471
and then we are testing
the behavior of this male

00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:07.138
now with these pups.

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.880
As you can see, the male has built a nest

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.386
and now is retrieving
these pups one by one.

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:17.174
And I should mention by the way that these

00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:20.239
are not the pups of that particular male.

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:22.282
This behavior will be displayed towards

00:07:22.282 --> 00:07:23.782
any infant that is

00:07:25.347 --> 00:07:27.576
to which they are exposed.

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:30.827
All the pups are now
collected to the nest.

00:07:30.827 --> 00:07:33.079
And as you see this is a really good dad,

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.143
he's checking that it has
not forgotten any pups.

00:07:37.143 --> 00:07:38.643
Nobody left, good.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.643
Let's go back to the nest and
then take care of the pups.

00:07:44.643 --> 00:07:47.708
So this is a really
fascinating switch in behavior

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:51.214
that really indicate that
even in infanticidal males,

00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:54.720
there's the ability for
these males to be parental.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.857
How is this happening?

00:07:56.857 --> 00:08:00.850
Evolutionary speaking, this is
actually not that surprising

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.008
because if you look at
various animal species,

00:08:04.008 --> 00:08:08.629
insects, fish, amphibians,
reptiles, birds and mammals,

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:10.765
there are species in which the female

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:14.713
is always the one handling the progeny.

00:08:14.713 --> 00:08:18.265
You can see little eggs here
and little larva over here.

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:21.075
Here's a tadpole on the back of that frog.

00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:23.977
But very similar species,
genetically very similar

00:08:23.977 --> 00:08:28.250
show animal in which
there's biparental care.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.804
So both the male and the female handle

00:08:30.804 --> 00:08:33.103
the nurturing of the progeny.

00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:36.005
And similarly also very
similar species genetically

00:08:36.005 --> 00:08:40.371
have the male that exclusively
takes care of the progeny.

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.925
For example this beetle here
with the little eggs here,

00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:45.293
or this male amphibian who's a tadpole,

00:08:45.293 --> 00:08:48.219
or here this fascinating
monkey, the Titi monkey

00:08:48.219 --> 00:08:51.470
in which the male is actually
providing exclusive care

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.258
of the infant.

00:08:53.258 --> 00:08:54.883
So what's happening here?

00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:58.111
In mice, what's happening is that

00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:00.920
there's a dominate male
that mates with the female

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.312
and the female have a communal nest.

00:09:03.312 --> 00:09:06.145
This male is always parental.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:08.955
However subordinate males that do not have

00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:12.275
access to the female are infanticidal.

00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:15.526
Will tend to attack
the male, kill the pups

00:09:15.526 --> 00:09:18.080
and that in turn enable
them to mate with the female

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.982
and at that time, they become parental.

00:09:20.982 --> 00:09:24.140
From a neuroscience
standpoint, this is fascinating

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.695
because what it shows is that the brain

00:09:26.695 --> 00:09:28.761
has actually two types of circuits.

00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:30.712
One driving infanticidal behavior

00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:33.080
that is displayed by virgin males,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.261
and one that drive parenting behavior

00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:39.767
but is displayed by females and fathers.

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:42.159
The question we're very interested in is

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:44.319
what are these neurons that control

00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:46.664
parenting and infanticidal behavior?

00:09:46.664 --> 00:09:48.289
What I would like to tell you today

00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:50.588
is how are we able to identify neurons

00:09:50.588 --> 00:09:54.512
that are necessary and
sufficient to drive parenting

00:09:54.512 --> 00:09:57.090
behavior both in males and in females.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.757
What we use is a way
to identify molecularly

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:06.122
neurons that are active
during a certain behavior.

00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:07.842
And the idea is that when a neuron

00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:09.816
is firing action potential,

00:10:09.816 --> 00:10:11.859
they are changing their gene expression.

00:10:11.859 --> 00:10:14.762
And in particular they turn on particular

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:17.060
geno transcription factor called cFos.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.729
So if have a female or a
male interacting with pups,

00:10:20.729 --> 00:10:23.724
then the neurons that
are involved in parenting

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:27.718
will fire and therefore they
will express this gene cFos.

00:10:27.718 --> 00:10:30.807
So if we look at the brain
of parenting animals,

00:10:30.807 --> 00:10:33.964
both males and females
compared to infanticidal male,

00:10:33.964 --> 00:10:37.378
we find that there is a
subpopulation of neurons

00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:40.861
in one particular area of the
brain in the hypothalamus,

00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:43.508
in the area called the
medial preoptic area

00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:47.107
in which you see these
very dense collection

00:10:47.107 --> 00:10:49.313
of neurons that express this gene cFos

00:10:49.313 --> 00:10:52.633
after the animals has
interacted with pups.

00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:54.514
Both males and females.

00:10:54.514 --> 00:10:56.139
This is very interesting.

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:58.183
It's actually not that surprising

00:10:58.183 --> 00:11:00.830
because already in the 50s, 60s, 70s,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.429
a number of groups
through lesion experiment

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:08.260
have shown that maternal behavior requires

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.511
the function of the medial preoptic area.

00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:13.624
What we really would like to know

00:11:13.624 --> 00:11:17.989
is which precisely, what
precisely are the nature,

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:22.842
the identity of these neurons
that are cFos positive.

00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:26.093
In fact this area, the
medial preoptic area,

00:11:26.093 --> 00:11:27.879
fulfill a lot of function.

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:30.271
It's involved in mating
behavior, thermo sensation,

00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:32.799
also the odd function of parenting.

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:35.005
So knowing precisely and specifically

00:11:35.005 --> 00:11:37.397
which of the neurons that express cFos

00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:39.626
is something that we really need to know

00:11:39.626 --> 00:11:42.900
if we want to understand the
control of parenting behavior.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.849
We tested the number of candidate genes

00:11:45.849 --> 00:11:49.610
and we found to our delight
one particular gene,

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.093
the gene that encodes for
the neuro peptide galanin

00:11:53.093 --> 00:11:57.389
as being very nicely
co expressed with Cfos

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:59.339
when the animal are parenting.

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:02.756
Interestingly the number of galanin cells

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.372
in the medial preoptic
area is identical in males

00:12:08.372 --> 00:12:10.578
and females, in virgin males

00:12:10.578 --> 00:12:14.038
and in virgin males and mothers.

00:12:14.038 --> 00:12:16.824
In fact, in other words,
these neurons are there

00:12:16.824 --> 00:12:19.634
in the male and the
female brain irrespective

00:12:19.634 --> 00:12:22.699
of whether these neurons
are parenting or not.

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:26.298
Now galanin is a peptide
expressed in many different areas.

00:12:26.298 --> 00:12:29.107
It's been involved in
many different functions

00:12:29.107 --> 00:12:32.428
such as nociception, sleep,
thermoregulation, etc.

00:12:32.428 --> 00:12:34.146
So we don't know whether galanin has

00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:36.956
any role to do to play
in parenting behavior.

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:39.765
But the fact that we
know one genetic marker

00:12:39.765 --> 00:12:42.157
gives us genetic tools.

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:44.711
In other words, we are
able to use a genetic line

00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:47.451
that express this enzyme called Cre.

00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:50.191
Think about the scissor if you wish

00:12:50.191 --> 00:12:53.674
that enable to activate
specific molecular tool

00:12:53.674 --> 00:12:57.180
to manipulate the activity of neurons.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.756
The experiment that we've done is

00:13:00.756 --> 00:13:03.589
to inject a conditional toxin into

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.163
the preoptic area of a galanin Cre mouse.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.741
And what this does is that it enabled us

00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:14.920
to kill specifically these galanin neurons

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.242
present in the medial preoptic area.

00:13:17.242 --> 00:13:19.704
No other neurons outside of the brain

00:13:19.704 --> 00:13:21.747
or within the MPOA,

00:13:21.747 --> 00:13:24.905
nothing else than this specific galanin

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:27.390
expressing cells are affected.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.433
What's happening when we test the behavior

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:33.009
of females and fathers
when we kill galanin

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:35.377
neurons in the medial preoptic area.

00:13:35.377 --> 00:13:37.119
The effect is very striking.

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:39.928
The ablation of these MPOA galanin neurons

00:13:39.928 --> 00:13:43.760
entirely abolishes both
maternal and paternal behavior

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.848
and actually elicits infanticide.

00:13:46.848 --> 00:13:49.425
So they seen to be a role of these neurons

00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:51.376
not only in driving parenting behavior

00:13:51.376 --> 00:13:55.811
but actually inhibiting
infant mediated aggression.

00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:59.038
Now we tried the other experiment,
a sufficiency experiment

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:01.616
which is if we know
take an aggressive male

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:05.284
and activate artificially galanin neurons

00:14:05.284 --> 00:14:08.141
in these infanticidal
males, what's happening?

00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:11.345
What's happening and we
performed this experiment

00:14:11.345 --> 00:14:13.226
using a technique called optogenetics

00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:17.226
that enable to express a
light activated channel

00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:21.585
in the neurons and then
using an optic fiber

00:14:21.585 --> 00:14:24.139
to activate these cells.

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:25.927
And what we find when we shine light

00:14:25.927 --> 00:14:28.830
and activate these galanin neurons is that

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.732
infanticidal male are
no longer infanticidal

00:14:31.732 --> 00:14:35.308
and instead display paternal behavior.

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:37.862
So what this shows is that these specific

00:14:37.862 --> 00:14:40.765
population of neurons are both necessary

00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:43.412
and sufficient for the
control of parental behavior

00:14:43.412 --> 00:14:45.579
in both males and females.

00:14:48.979 --> 00:14:51.303
Parental behavior is a complex behavior

00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:54.136
and what we'd like to do now is really

00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:57.294
to understand this behavior
in mechanistic terms.

00:14:57.294 --> 00:15:01.461
These neurons as we've seen
are able to control parenting.

00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:04.794
Parenting means a lot of things,

00:15:04.794 --> 00:15:07.186
grooming, licking, crouching, retrieving,

00:15:07.186 --> 00:15:10.437
nest building, and then
inhibiting infanticidal behavior.

00:15:10.437 --> 00:15:13.850
But these neurons do all of
these according obviously

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.099
to the presence of an
infant but also according

00:15:18.099 --> 00:15:19.910
to the physiological state.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.997
Male for example will
either trigger this behavior

00:15:23.997 --> 00:15:25.878
or not trigger this behavior according to

00:15:25.878 --> 00:15:28.153
whether they are fathers or not.

00:15:28.153 --> 00:15:30.731
What we would like to understand

00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:33.889
is how are all these different
display being performed?

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:36.443
And what is the role of this environment

00:15:36.443 --> 00:15:38.672
in the activity of these neurons?

00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:41.064
The first set of
experiment that we've done

00:15:41.064 --> 00:15:44.407
is really try to understand
whether these galanin neurons

00:15:44.407 --> 00:15:46.265
really are involved in all

00:15:46.265 --> 00:15:48.912
these different part of parenting.

00:15:48.912 --> 00:15:50.793
The experiment that
I'm gonna show you here

00:15:50.793 --> 00:15:54.554
is what is called bulk
imaging or volume imaging

00:15:54.554 --> 00:15:57.016
or these galanin neurons.

00:15:57.016 --> 00:16:00.336
The idea is that these
neurons now are expressing

00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:05.120
a genetically encoded
indicator of neural activity.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.952
So these neurons are now
gonna emit fluorescence

00:16:07.952 --> 00:16:12.457
when they are active and only
in these particular area.

00:16:12.457 --> 00:16:15.847
And what we're gonna have,
we have an optic probe

00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:18.448
that enable to visualize
the intensity of the signal.

00:16:18.448 --> 00:16:20.654
So it's called bulk imaging because

00:16:20.654 --> 00:16:22.953
we don't have cellular resolution.

00:16:22.953 --> 00:16:25.019
In other words we're
looking at the activity

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:26.714
of all these neurons together.

00:16:26.714 --> 00:16:28.595
And so what you see here is a female

00:16:28.595 --> 00:16:31.149
and here a bunch of pups over there.

00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:33.982
The animal has an optic fiber here

00:16:35.422 --> 00:16:38.487
and what you can see here is

00:16:38.487 --> 00:16:40.275
the level of calcium.

00:16:40.275 --> 00:16:42.666
And as the female approaches the pups,

00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:45.244
you can see the level of calcium going up.

00:16:45.244 --> 00:16:50.190
And she's licking the pups
and indeed the level of

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.357
calcium stays high and as she
brings the pup to the nest

00:16:58.905 --> 00:17:02.566
and starts licking the pup,
then the level of calcium

00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:04.983
is really going out the roof.

00:17:06.838 --> 00:17:08.974
Interestingly we found that all the paths

00:17:08.974 --> 00:17:13.758
composing parenting behavior
involve this galanin neuron.

00:17:13.758 --> 00:17:15.453
So that's quite interesting.

00:17:15.453 --> 00:17:17.682
Now I'm gonna show you another video

00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:20.236
in which this female
here has a very similar

00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:22.372
type of behavior as you can see.

00:17:22.372 --> 00:17:24.787
She's grooming something, licking.

00:17:24.787 --> 00:17:29.036
Then she's gonna bring
that thing to the nest

00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:31.335
exactly how she's done with the pups,

00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:35.352
but as you can see here,
the level of signal

00:17:35.352 --> 00:17:36.792
is completely flat.

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:37.907
What's happening?

00:17:37.907 --> 00:17:39.346
Well although the behavior looks

00:17:39.346 --> 00:17:40.972
very much like parenting behavior,

00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:43.363
actually she's handling a fish cracker.

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:45.613
(laughter)

00:17:50.097 --> 00:17:51.560
And in these circumstances,

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.766
galanin neurons are totally silent.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:56.088
Again although the behavior
looks exactly the same,

00:17:56.088 --> 00:17:58.294
what's happening in the
brain, the significance

00:17:58.294 --> 00:18:01.707
of this behavior is completely different

00:18:01.707 --> 00:18:05.469
and involve very different
parts of the brain.

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:09.068
In summary, we started by the idea that

00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:11.808
parenting is an essential behavior

00:18:11.808 --> 00:18:15.476
and that in different species
it's displayed differently

00:18:15.476 --> 00:18:17.497
by males, by females, sometimes both.

00:18:17.497 --> 00:18:20.306
That we were really interested in going

00:18:20.306 --> 00:18:23.464
to the cellular molecular
basis of this behavior.

00:18:23.464 --> 00:18:27.342
We found this really
interesting system in the mouse

00:18:27.342 --> 00:18:29.524
in which animal are or are not parenting

00:18:29.524 --> 00:18:32.520
and we found this
fascinating neural cell type,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.607
this MPOA galanin neurons that now really

00:18:36.607 --> 00:18:40.531
give us entry into how parenting
behavior is controlled.

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:43.015
What are the different
regulation of these neurons,

00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:45.221
what are the sets of projection,

00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:46.939
what type of input do they receive,

00:18:46.939 --> 00:18:50.515
and how all of these changes
in both during development,

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:54.432
in males, in females and
during mental illness.

00:18:55.816 --> 00:18:57.442
I would like to thank the people,

00:18:57.442 --> 00:18:59.555
the wonderful collaborator in my lab

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.528
who've performed this work.

00:19:01.528 --> 00:19:02.518
Thank you.

00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:04.768
(applause)

00:19:05.838 --> 00:19:08.505
(techno music)
