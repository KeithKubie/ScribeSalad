&gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK THIS ONE'S

THIS IS ACTUALLY-- THAT'S
ACTUALLY MY FRIEND TIM'S CAT.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:48.408
I SWEAR TO GOD.

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:49.610
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT THAT WAS CHRIS
BROWN'S CAT.

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:55.916
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.251
&gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS, YOU KNOW

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:02.489
TOGETHER TOMORROW.

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:05.893
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU GO SHOPPING FOR
A BOWLER HAT THAT SMALL?

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:08.362
A HIPSTER HAT --I WOULD HAVE
SMACKED ( BLEEP ) OUT OF THAT

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.229

THIS DOG-LOVING CAT.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.448
JASON?

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.284
&gt;&gt; OH, THIS IS GOING TO END
HORRIBLY.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.118
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: YOU THINK SO?

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.985

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:47.901
THAT'S NOT A FUNNY CAT.

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:49.703
