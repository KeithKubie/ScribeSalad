00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.749
People always tell me that the most accomplished
people in the world get up super early and

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:11.019
workout and have meetings and do all these
things, but can't I just like… keep sleeping?

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.260
Hello sleepy-heads, Trace with you on DNews
this morning… is it morning?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.779
I don't even know anymore.

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.779
Here’s the thing.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.380
Genetics determine how fast or slow our internal
clock runs and, as a result, how closely it—and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.619
our body’s functions—align with the 24-hour
day.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.480
Harvard Medical School says, if your clock
runs fast, you're more likely to be a morning

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.239
person, and if it runs slow you're a night
person.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.579
But sometimes it's just SO HARD TO WAKE UP…
and that might just be part of your genes.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.160
In a 2012 study, scientists found a single
nucleotide on the "Period 1” gene, which

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.100
helps control daily behavioural clock.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.239
That nucleotide correlates with wake-sleep
behaviour.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.079
The researchers found that the nucleotide
base adenine is linked to someone being a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.079
morning person, while it’s base pair guanine
is linked to being a night owl.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.989
So, people with the AA genotype, on average,
wake up an hour earlier than people with the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.339
GG genotype.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.580
Another study by genetics company 23-and-Me
backs this up, finding genetic markers that

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.890
correlate to self-described morning or night
people.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.450
But look, you can have genes that tell your
body all sorts of things, so if you want to

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.229
be the day man, fighter of the night man -- you
can DO IT.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.250
We all have this thing called a circadian
rhythm.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.159
It’s a roughly 24-hour cycle controlled
by the brain that tells us when to wake up,

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.119
when to sleep, and when other biological processes
should happen in between.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.300
It’s governed by social and environmental
clues, but none is more significant than the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.350
Sun.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.970
Back in the day, we used to rise with the
Sun and sleep when it got dark.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.140
In either case, disruption to the natural
rhythm can lead to sleep disorders, depression

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.220
and even obesity.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.310
And it doesn’t help that our modern lifestyles
don’t necessarily line up with our natural

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.310
body clocks.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.930
Lights, phone screens, and late-night social
occasions are one thing, but even with all

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.539
that it's possible to trick your body into
becoming a morning person!

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.010
Basically, it's like shifting your body into
a new time zone without actually travelling;

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.860
you’re effectively resetting your body clock.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.110
Say you get to bed at 1am and wake up at 9am
but you want to get up at 6am to seize the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.110
day.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.110
You can do it.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.090
You just have to get over your self-induced
jet lag.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.550
Sleep experts suggest setting your alarm a
few minutes earlier every day, gradually shifting

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.411
your wakeup time, and of course you'll have
to go to bed earlier too; we never said it

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:30.390
doesn't take effort.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.890
On top of that, you have to actually get up.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.820
Set one alarm and when it goes off, get out
of bed and find some daylight.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.780
The daylight triggers the suprachiasmatic
nucleus in your brain (the thing that regulates

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.260
our sleep-wake cycle) to decreases the hormone
melatonin which makes you sleepy.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.510
If you need a reason to get out of bed, some
people recommend saving something you enjoy

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.310
for the morning as a treat to look forward
when that alarm goes off.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.220
Have a morning ritual: reading, email, facebook,
or the news.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.190
Whatever it is, make that ritual part of your
wake-up cycle and you'll have an easier time.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.570
So you can train yourself to be a morning
person, but if you’re not genetically predisposed

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.360
to be one, it might just suck more for you.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.050
Though, you could be neither.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.360
A study in Current BIology, looking mainly
at athletic performance, shows some perform

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.100
better in the morning, and some in the evening
-- and yet others… are neither!

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.350
48 percent of people perform of the day!

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:42.320
And if you're on the road a lot, like I am,
training yourself to be a morning person is

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.460
super helpful, but worrying about home security
isn't.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.710
AT&amp;T Digital Life Smart Home Security helps
keep you connected your home, so there are

00:03:50.710 --> 00:04:00.850
no more what ifs.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:09.090
Do you night people want to be day people?
