00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.790
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Bailenson: Thank you for hosting
and it's an absolute pleasure to be here.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.030
I've lived in Mountain View for about eight
years now and have been walking my dogs in

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.440
this neighborhood for quite some time.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.740
Obviously you're at the center of the technology
universe and I'm just excited to be here and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.580
to share my work with you.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.210
And so, I'm a professor and I'm part social
scientist and part engineer.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.500
For the last 15 years I have been studying
the psychology of avatars, meaning I build

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.519
virtual environments.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.570
I put people in these representations I call
avatars and I study the psychological effects

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.080
of spending time inside an avatar.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.260
I've been doing this work for a long time
and it's real exciting for me that the work

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.400
you guys are doing the work that others are
doing in Silicon Valley that has made the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.250
work that I do from this weird science fiction
stuff, -- think about a guy until the late

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.700
90s who is studying avatars to really a household
name.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.070
It's especially fun for me to talk about this
work that I've been doing for so long to you

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.120
guys.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.370
Everything I'm going to talk about today -- I'm
going to give you a very broad sense of what

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.590
I'm doing.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.799
All the work I'm talking about is published.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.240
This is the URL of my lab.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.119
You can go on the lab's website and see all
the PDFs of the published work.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.460
I'm going to give you a really broad perspective.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.869
I'm going to cover 50 experiments today in
35 minutes time.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.810
I'm not going to bore you with details about
the control condition,s about the measures

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.810
that we used.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.969
Feel free to ask that in the question and
answer session.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.749
I've also been asked to tell you to hold your
questions until I stop speaking at about 12:45.

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.650
At that point we'll do a formal question and
answer using the microphone.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.700
Okay.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.770
So the big question we're going to ask today
is when I am in an avatar in virtual space,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.460
there's certain rules in the physical world
that govern all social interaction.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.590
When you enter a virtual world, all of those
rules are thrown out the window.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.240
When you interact with a virtual version of
someone, say you're in hangout in Google plus

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.660
or you're Skypeing or in a place called Second
Life as a virtual world or a video game, you're

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.870
interacting with virtual representations of
other people.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.850
And the rules that govern face to face, --my
identity, how attractive I am, how tall I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.130
am, my gender, even my species--, all of these
rules can be thrown out the window.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.170
What I'm going to do today is describe to
you a world where social interaction is changed

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.650
in a way that we've never really seen before
as a human specie.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.750
My book is called Infinite Reality and it's
written with Meredith's father, Jim Blascovich,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.750
who has been a great mentor to me, and this
book really covers the history of our work,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.170
the 15 years of our work.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.750
We write it as scientists but we also write
it as journalists.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.290
I have the luxury of being in Silicon Valley,
getting to go to Jaron Lanier's attic and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.040
look through his materials.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.730
I really interviewed the main players in the
history of this.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.730
I really think you should view this book as--.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.530
If you're curious about what avatars are,
or what virtual worlds, virtual reality is,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.600
and want to understand the psychology behind
it, the social science behind it, and how

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.220
it's really going to change the world, that's
what this book does.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.480
So please, if you enjoy this talk do read
the book.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.940
How many of you, show of hands, have worn
a helmet and walked around in a virtual reality

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.480
before?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.340
About 20 percent of you, great.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.510
So I'm going to show you a video of a gentleman
in my lab and what is he doing?

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.511
&gt;&gt;Male #1: A tight rope?

00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:44.511
&gt;&gt; Jeremy: A tight rope is close.

00:03:44.511 --> 00:03:47.430
We're forcing him to walk the virtual plank.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.960
So what he's seeing when he looks down is
the Wile E. Coyote-type chasm with a rickety

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960
plank.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960
And how does virtual reality work?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.610
The way virtual reality works is by tracking
and rendering.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.541
So we've got sensors in the room that are
tracking the way that his head moves, where

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:06.580
his legs are, where his body position is,
where his head is turned.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.870
,Physical cameras in the room track those
positions.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.430
About 100 times a second, a computer senses
his movement and redraws the virtual world

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.450
to reflect that movement.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.310
So if he walks one meter in the physical world,
the virtual world is drawn one meter behind

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.750
him so that every action is accompanied by
a virtual reaction.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.740
That's all sent to some audio-visual display.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.159
In this case, he's wearing what we call the
HMD, the headed mounted display, and the cycle

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.860
of tracking and rendering happens about a
hundred times a second.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.129
So he walks, the world is updated and it feels
very realistic as you're walking around.

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.139
As you watch to this guy, you can see he's
feeling very high what we call 'presence',

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.569
meaning he forgets that he's in the physical
room as he's walking this virtual plank.

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.460
To give you a sense, I've probably run over
5,000 people over this virtual plank in the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.010
last 15 years through demonstrations, through
experiments.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.390
On average, when you look at adults, that
is people my age 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, one in

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.240
three people won't step within a meter of
the edge of that pit.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.069
They'll see that plank and they just won't
go there.

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.629
It's really compelling.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.919
You're all welcome to come to my lab and do
this experience.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.139
Stanford has rebuilt my lab.

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.889
It's really cutting edge and we do tours once
a week on Fridays for the informed public.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.830
What makes, I think, this book very relevant
and timely and also relevant to the Google

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.659
audience, is that it's no longer, VR is no
longer for people with expensive labs at big

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:36.659
Universities.

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.509
So Jaron Lanier, who is the pioneer in many
ways of the field, who coined the term 'virtual

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.629
reality', has said for decades, as long as
you've got to wear crap on your head and have

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.159
a dedicated room to run this thing, virtual
reality is never going to be important.

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.220
But what is virtual reality?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.860
We just talked about VR as tracking your motions
and then

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.800
rendering the world, drawing the world, and
showing it to you.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.990
And tracking your motions, a great team from
Tel Aviv, a company called tracking your motions

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.539
PrimeSense , using infrared cameras has not
solved this problem but all of a sudden made

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.150
tracking--.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.460
By leaps and bounds, we can now track very
easily.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.550
So how many of you guys have used the Microsoft
Kinect?

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.289
Okay, only three or four of you.

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.300
This is, if you have children or grandchildren,
this is--.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.559
They're all going to be clamoring for that
this Christmas.

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:25.419
Many kids have this in their homes already.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.300
This uses a single camera to track all of
your body motions.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.000
The hardest part about virtual reality, knowing
what your body is doing physically that used

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.620
to require a room with zillions of cameras,
is now in every living room in the country

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.159
, or half the living rooms in the country
right now.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:45.009
The Kinect is actually the fastest selling
consumer electronic product ever.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.620
Everybody has this half of VR.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.840
The other half of VR is something we're calling
autostereo.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.460
This is something called a lenticular display
which gives you stereoscopic vision without

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.979
you even having to wear glasses such as when
you go to the theater.

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:59.349
How many of you have used the Nintendo 3DS?

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:00.349
Okay.

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:07.500
Nintendo 3DS has--, beams of hologram half
way between you and the game that you're holding.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.490
It uses technology called lenticular displays
that refracts light in various directions.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.339
It's very similar, you know those postcards
that you use, those cheap post cards that

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:17.460
give you a sense of stereo.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.139
Had it for decades.

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.889
It's a very expensive version of that.

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.300
Everything I'm going to talk about has been
done in a fancy lab.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.710
But this year, in particular, VR, tracking
your movements, and showing you a immersive

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.509
perceptual experience, is in the living room.

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.940
So everything that we study as a lab and that
we talk about in this book is now being done

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.080
on the school buses, in the classrooms, and
in your homes.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.039
But I'm a social scientist and I'm not a technologist
as my primary field and what I study is social

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:48.039
interactions.

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:53.229
So when you're a subject in my lab we take
two photographs of you.

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:57.530
We then have a group of undergraduates in
a room networked down the hallway and they

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.629
feverishly drag these points onto your face
in something called photogrammetric software

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:07.449
and after I get a front on and a side shot
of you 25 minutes later when you enter virtual

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:10.759
reality you're wearing a 3D model of your
own head.

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:11.759
So what does this look like?

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.319
This is my colleague Jack Loomis.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.960
Those are two photographs of him.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.119
And this is a 3D model of his head and face.

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:20.159
It's a digital model.

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:25.289
It can be animated so any set animation I
can fathom we can make his head do.

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:28.110
It lasts forever the same way anything digital
does.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.770
I can make a million copies at a whim.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.060
A little digression.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.759
How many of you guys have seen the commercial
with virtual Orville Redenbacher?

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:41.310
When you get done with this, go to Youtube
and type in virtual Orville Redenbacher and

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.570
you'll see that Orville Redenbacher passed
away some years ago.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:50.850
His grandson gave permission to an advertising
agency to use the hundreds and hundreds of

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.089
minutes of video that they had from these
television commercials.

00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:55.269
Hours and hours of video.

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:59.090
They reconstructed a 3D model of him from
beyond the grave.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.640
Orville now acts in commercials without having
given permission to do so because once you

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.279
built a virtual representation, it can do
anything an animator can dream of.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.780
So Orville from beyond the grave is dancing
around with an iPod and saying this iPod is

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.779
light and fluffy just like my popcorn.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:18.019
It holds 30 gigs.

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:19.130
It really raises questions.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.910
When I build your avatar, it lasts for longer
than you do and I have complete control over

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.910
its actions.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:30.750
So one of the themes of this talk today is
in a world where I've built a version of you,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.740
what is that world like and what happens when
I've got a version of you that can do things

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.339
that you don't necessarily do.

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:40.779
And it's really fascinating space as a social
scientist, as a technologist.

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:43.790
But it's not enough to make an avatar look
like you.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.190
The avatar also has to behave like you.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:51.560
And what I'm going to show you here is software
that we use,without putting anything on your

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.670
face, tracks your facial expressions.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.160
So this is the model that I built in the previous
slide.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.160
This is the real-time video that we get from
a crappy $30 webcam and this is me animating

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.190
that model based on a computer vision algorithm
that tracks 22 points on your face.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.839
We're deforming this model based on knowing
what the face is doing.

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:12.660
So you walk into my lab.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.779
We build this model of you from those photographs.

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:20.300
30 minutes latter when you enter virtual reality
you are being seen by others not only with

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.810
a model that looks like you but literally
expresses every facial expression that you're

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.330
doing and captures all the nuances of your
emotions.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.790
And it's a really powerful experience.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:36.350
I want to bolster the point about who is using
avatars?

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.810
Because again, it used to be an academic question
and it's no longer an academic question.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.970
And what I really want to point you toward
is this stat on the bottom.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.949
So a colleague, my colleague Don Roberts from
Stanford studies children with media use.

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:51.709
He did a study with Kaiser Family Foundation
that was published last year.

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:53.300
He presented this to Congress.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.490
And he surveyed kids' media use.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:01.980
So kids between the ages of 8 and 18 are spending,
on average, outside the classroom almost eight

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.170
hours a day consuming digital media.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:10.920
Of those 8 hours a day 1.25 hours on average
are spent using avatars and video games.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.660
To put in in perspective, the amount of time
they spend looking at print is 38 minutes

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.660
a day, okay?

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.920
So they're spending over three times as much
time in an avatar as they're reading newspapers,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.380
books, everything combined.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:29.450
So the idea of, the question of what do avatars
do to society is no longer one that we need

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.760
to think about in terms of the future.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.110
Our kids are living, breathing, and eating
digital media all day and a lot of these are

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.420
spent wearing these avatars which can be very
different from them.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.519
Why is this important?

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:46.420
Sometime ago we developed this theory of transformed
social interaction which is not a new idea.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.220
A lot of these ideas have been taken from
science fiction novels.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.860
It's as old as humans, this idea of behaving.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.389
But in the physical world right now what I
do you guys see.

00:11:56.389 --> 00:12:01.399
So, if I make a social blunder, I make a bad
facial expression, I curse by accident, I

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:04.350
trip and fall, what I do you guys see.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.990
When we're interacting via avatars -- let's
revisit how virtual reality works -- The way

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.839
that it works is, I take a step a meter forward.

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.830
In my system, it tracks my motion.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.140
My computer automatically sends you that I've
moved.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.290
And then on your computer you've got a version
of my digital model, you draw me in a different

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.470
location.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.339
So the idea is I perform on my end.

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:31.100
My computer sends you high level information
about the nature of that behavior.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.220
You draw it locally on your end.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.649
And that happens hundreds of times a second
and it happens with you guys, too.

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:41.000
So if one of you guys yawn, your computer
senses your mouth opened, sends that to my

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.970
computer and I draw you yawning.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.190
That's fundamentally different from a video
conference because in a video conference all

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.500
you're doing is sending pixels over the network.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.019
So whatever I'm doing, you capture that image
and that image is automatically sent in a

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:55.880
non-smart way over the network.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.000
Is that difference clear?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.339
Why is that important because it allows transformed
social interaction.

00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:09.089
Instead of seeing the actual Jeremy, you will
see an optimized, strategically-transformed

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:14.290
version of me that has been chosen specifically
to accomplish some conversational goal.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.810
So everyone in this room can be seeing a different
version of me one that I've chosen because

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.470
it's going to help me sell you guys books,
okay?

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.170
And that sounds very abstract now.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.760
I'm going to now take it through lots and
lots of empirical examples that should convince

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.680
you quite robustly that this is something
we need to think about.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.069
So first one I want to talk about me transforming
my avatar to influence other people.

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:44.750
And the first study that Jim Blascovich and
I did in the late 90s deals with what we call

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.529
augmented gaze.

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:50.080
As humans we've known for a long time eye
contact is important.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.189
As psychologists for the last hundred years,
about, we've run experiments looking at this.

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:59.509
And other than me poking you in the chest
physically me, looking you in the eye is the

00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:01.760
most important nonverbal tool I have.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.240
It makes your heart beat faster.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.160
It makes you listen more to what I say.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.230
It makes you remember what I say.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.490
It makes you more likely to look back at me
and to speak to me.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.300
We know from tons of research that eye gaze
is important.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.709
But in a physical room, I have a problem.

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:20.410
So right now there's about 65 of you in this
room and I can only look at each of you in

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:25.920
the eye for less than three percent of the
time, two percent of the time.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.319
I can look at you all in the eye but only
one at a time.

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:34.970
In the virtual world, it's free for me to
send all of you varying information about

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.870
where my eyes are pointing.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.920
It could be the case as I'm giving this talk
every single person in this audience can feel

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.060
as if I'm just looking at you and perceiving
that I'm giving the talk in that manner.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.500
So to test this idea, we brought in three
people.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.949
We put them all in virtual reality.

00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:54.129
And this guy randomly get assigned to be the
teacher.

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:56.519
These two guys randomly get assigned to be
the learners.

00:14:56.519 --> 00:15:01.730
Unbeknownst to the teacher who's looking trying
his best to look at both of them we've taken

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:07.300
his head movements and each one of these guys
sees the teacher looking at him for 100 percent

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.300
of the social interaction.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.300
Okay?

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.879
Why did we do that?

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:12.269
The answer was, it's the late 90s.

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:16.240
I'm not a fantastic programmer and this was
the easiest thing we could think of.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.139
I always like to say as a programmer of artificial
intelligence, we start with something really

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:22.209
simple and we examine the social effects.

00:15:22.209 --> 00:15:27.050
So if an algorithm that was so dumb which
is simply make this guy stare at both people

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.589
for the entire time, if that works, then you
can imagine an algorithm that added a little

00:15:31.589 --> 00:15:35.800
bit of noise or only looked at you if you
weren't talking to them or did it only for

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.259
50 percent of the time.

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:40.579
So what does this look like for learners?

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:44.910
Imagine I'm giving this talk and the entire
time I'm talking, everything I say, I'm looking

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.149
right at you for this whole time.

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:50.360
You can imagine this is a strange social interaction,
right.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.839
So the way we run social experiments, we typically
bring in triads.

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:57.670
We bring in 100 triads and we examine their
behavior.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.480
We've now replicated this study four separate
times, hundreds and hundreds of people.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.329
And we get four things consistently.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.759
The first thing that you get is people can't
stand this, okay?

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:10.129
[audience chuckles] They're extremely uncomfortable.

00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:13.170
Humans rarely look at each other for more
than 7 seconds.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.450
Ever, unbroken.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.290
And that's typically if you're intimate with
someone.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.220
These are people that for a 20 minute lecture
got stared at the entire time.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.279
And people are not comfortable at all with
this.

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:27.720
However, not a single person has ever detected
that it's not real gaze.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.600
So no one has said, "you know that guy stared
at me the whole time but I think it's computer

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.600
gaze not real gaze".

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.980
Not a single person has ever thought that.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.620
You don't like it but you think it's real.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.709
The third thing that we get is attention.

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.670
So if I'm a teacher, if I'm a salesman, if
I'm a politician, if I'm trying to get the

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:50.430
message to you, half the battle is getting
you to listen and with virtual reality one

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.779
point I want to return to toward the end of
the talk is whenever you're in a virtual simulation,

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:55.779
everything you do is tracked.

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:56.779
Meaning recorded.

00:16:56.779 --> 00:17:00.860
Everywhere your eye points; where your body
is standing; every little behavior you can

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.060
ever imagine doing gets dumped to a file so
we can go through that file and actually look

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.380
at where you're looking.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.589
When I give you guys 'super-gaze' as a group,
you guys return my gaze more often than when

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.880
I do my normal gaze.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.949
So, just with a simple change to where my
head is pointed, all of you are getting different

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:19.949
versions of me.

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:23.500
It took me literally eleven lines of code
to do this, all right?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500
This is not hard to do.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.309
You take the packet saying where the eye direction
is and you change it a little bit.

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:29.710
Not hard to do.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.860
We're changing where you're looking, where
you're pointing your head.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.760
But the fourth thing and the most important
thing is social influence.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:41.260
So in this experiment, we designed a survey
that Stanford students had to sign when they

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.539
left which was very unpopular.

00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:46.529
If you are caught on Stanford's campus without
your identification.

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:48.539
you are going to get in trouble.

00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:50.950
So you can imagine nobody wants to sign this.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:55.280
But the odds of you signing this are higher
if you get 'super-gaze' than if you get a

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.960
normal type gaze where you can look at people
one at a time.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.179
So with eleven lines of code, I'm changing
the amount of time you're listening to me.

00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:08.190
And then I'm also increasing the probability
that you're going to be influenced by what

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.660
I say in a persuasive manner.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.330
Next line of studies is called digital chameleons.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.321
This takes a powerful idea called of mimicry.

00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:20.470
A woman named Tanya Chartrand in the late
90s, ran a very famous psychology experiment.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:26.690
She had subjects go into interviews and the
subjects either mimicked the gestures of the

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.690
interviewers.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.730
And so, if the interviewer crossed his legs,
then the subject crossed her legs.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.490
If the interviewer, if she leans forward then
the subject, he would lean forward.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:39.250
So we just told people face to face to go
in and mimic the gestures of the interviewers.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:44.800
Nobody consciously recognized the mimicry,
but people who went in and mimicked the interviewer

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.340
were more likely to get the job than people
who didn't.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.130
One of the overriding themes of social psychology
is people love themselves.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.140
And if you can subtly manipulate that, you
are more effective.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.440
We said wait a minute how does virtual reality
work?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.730
VR works because I'm sending you information
about my behavior so you can draw me locally

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.929
on your machine doing it.

00:19:03.929 --> 00:19:05.000
It is trivial.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.620
It is literally four lines of code for me
to take that packed you sent me which is telling

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.860
you your behavior, hold on to it for a few
seconds, put my name on it and send it right

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.020
back to you.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.309
So the technology is built for mimicry.

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:18.950
And so what does this look like.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.950
This is Nick Yee.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.630
He's a brilliant PhD student who's done much
of this research and all we're doing here

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.330
is that she's trying to persuade him about
this policy to have your ID card.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.280
And what he's doing, he's moving and listening.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.000
Her head movements are a four second mirror
of his.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Okay?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.130
So he looks up.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.980
One, two, three, four, she looks up.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.049
Everything he does is a -- everything she
does is a slow mirror of him.

00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:47.930
Why do we do it this way?

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.370
Again, we start off real simple on the artificial
intelligence.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.440
Let's start easy.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.580
Whatever he does, she's going to do four seconds
later.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:02.470
At this rate, a four second lag with exact
mimicry, only one in 20 people consciously

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.240
recognize that the avatar was mimicking them.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.049
So even though I'm stealing your exact head
movements, barely anyone has the ability to

00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:12.029
explicitly realize this is happening.

00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:15.809
And those instances tended to be if somebody
spun around in their chair, okay?

00:20:15.809 --> 00:20:17.679
[laughter] Or something very extreme.

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:20.230
We didn't build for the exorcist.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.230
So what happened?

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.779
The exact same things as in the previous studies.

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:28.500
Nobody detects this consciously, but when
I mimic you, when my avatar mimics you, you

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.930
look at me more and you're more likely to
sign this petition later on that you wouldn't

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:34.930
have signed otherwise.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.910
You also rate me as more attractive, more
credible, more trustworthy, and you like me

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:39.910
more.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.240
So really simple tweaks I can do to my avatar,
automatically, that are having drastic changes

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.400
on your nonverbal behavior, on what you say,
and ultimately how you decide to live certain

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.029
aspects of your life.

00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:57.810
Which brings me to this next study which doesn't
look at facial mimicry but -- sorry doesn't

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.460
look at nonverbal mimicry but looks at your
face.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.429
So I want to show you a video now and I want
you to be extremely impressed by this video.

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:10.820
The reason I want you to be impressed is because
this video e built in 2003 using $19 software

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.990
in less than 20 minutes by a freshman communication
major, okay?

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.990
It took no training.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.240
And it was cheap and it took no time.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.930
And you can see it is a morph from Arnold
Schwarzenegger to Gray Davis.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:29.130
And all we're doing is blending one face to
another and it's really simple to do this.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:35.080
And we wanted to ask the question, if my avatar
takes on your facial characteristics, is that

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.710
going to change how you interact with me?

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:43.039
So think about this Brady Bunch grid of faces
that we have on a hang out and one could do

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:44.039
with this.

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:49.720
What do I know about if your face looks like
mine from the social psychology literature?

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.900
If you look more like me, you're more willing
to buy something from me.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.830
Studies by Dovidio have shown that if I'm
lying on the ground clutching my knee in agony,

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.520
the odds of you stopping to help me increase
if you look like me.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.130
And Lisa DeBruine in England has demonstrated
that if your face looks more like mine, I'm

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.410
more likely to hand my children over to you
to babysit for them.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.679
As humans, we like to think that we're this
very deep race where we look to the inner

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:19.230
beauty of people but it turns out subtle characteristics
of your face and body have drastic consequences

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.370
to how you interact with others.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:26.830
I worked my colleague Shanto Iyengar who is
a political scientist and we wanted to look

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.960
at the 2004 presidential election.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960
Okay?

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.490
And what we did is we had three groups of
subjects.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.860
One group of subject had pictures of George
Bush and John Kerry that were just like the

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.750
actual pictures of Bush and Kerry.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.029
So this middle row here are the actual pictures
of Bush and Kerry.

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:52.679
We then got a focus group to collect from
about 600 people to passively acquire photographs

00:22:52.679 --> 00:22:53.750
of voters from across the country.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.669
And we got a national random sample.

00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:56.860
Meaning it wasn't just college kids.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.700
We paid money to get variance in socioeconomic
status, location, age, all these important

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.149
demographic variables.

00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:09.010
Then over the next six months, we had undergraduates
morph the faces of the potential voters with

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.630
Bush and Kerry.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.160
That is a picture of me before I got tenure.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.090
[laughter] You can see I was much more clean
cut then.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:22.990
This is a picture of George Bush and on the
top right is the 60/40 blend between me and

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.070
Bush.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.830
We've now run this experiment five separate
times.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.420
Over 1,000 people.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:33.149
We've asked them to write a paragraph about
the picture of George Bush.

00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:34.750
Write a paragraph about what his face looks
like.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.809
To date, not a single person if you stable
them 40% on the blend, on the has ever consciously

00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:43.039
detected that his own face has been put in
the candidate.

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:46.000
Nobody has any idea consciously that this
is occurring.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.419
This is a woman in my lab, Julia.

00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:49.299
This is her with John Kerry.

00:23:49.299 --> 00:23:50.299
Three groups of subjects.

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:54.440
If you had the normal Bush versus Kerry meaning
just the actual photographs of them.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.860
For a third of our subjects, his or her own
face was morphed with George Bush.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.480
And for another third of our subjects, his
or her face was morphed with John Kerry.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.570
And what we simply did is, a week before the
election, we asked which of them they were

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.350
going to vote for.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:12.710
And what we demonstrated is that in the control
condition actual photos we exactly replicated

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.810
the national sample.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.510
It was 46/44 in favor of Bush.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:22.320
Bush wins by a landslide when the subject's
face was morphed with Bush by 20 points and

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.019
Kerry actually wins by 7 among the people
with whom Kerry's face was morphed.

00:24:28.019 --> 00:24:29.019
So think about this.

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:33.840
A week before the election, who you say you're
going to vote for is based on whether or not

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.649
the candidate looks more like you.

00:24:35.649 --> 00:24:37.909
So we got this data.

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:41.780
And as citizens we were terrified but as social
scientists we were very excited [laughter]

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:47.059
and we sent this to the best journal in political
science and they rejected it without even

00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:48.059
sending it out for review.

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:49.419
They said the voter is not rational.

00:24:49.419 --> 00:24:50.419
Sorry.

00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:51.480
They said the voter is rational.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.790
They don't make decisions based on this.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.770
The whole field of political science is based
on that notion.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:59.960
In order to publish this work, we actually
had to replicate it in five separate studies

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:05.870
over a period of five years with different
candidates., 2008 elections, Small elections.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.090
This effect doesn't go away.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:11.789
One of the most powerful effects we demonstrated
in the lab is if my face steals portions of

00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:17.799
your face ,you're going to like me better
and choose me in ways of social influence.

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:22.500
And what does this mean for the world of Google,
the world of online social interaction?

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.490
It's trivial to grab someone's face and to
morph my face with it.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.780
What we demonstrated is very important decisions
can be based on a simple blend of my face

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.880
with yours.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.860
Next line of studies we did was, can I train
a teacher to be a better teacher with a simple

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.860
tracking algorithm?

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:47.549
So, in this room, I'm doing my best to spread
my eye gaze as best as I can but it's hard.

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:51.360
As I am talking, it's very hard to hit everyone
in the room and as we've demonstrated that

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.940
top graph there is a U shaped birds eye view
of a classroom where the teacher is is the

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.130
blue T. The white cubes are pupils.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.270
This graph here is the percentage of time
people get ignored And what you see is that

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:08.570
you guys on the corner, you guys get ignored
for about one third of my lecture.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:14.790
What if you gave a teacher a tool which simply
showed me when I am not looking at you.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.669
And all we did is take the tracking data that
you naturally get from a virtual reality simulation

00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:22.590
and if I'm not looking at you, you start to
disappear.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:27.370
So you've actually start to turn transparent
and simply gave the teacher this tool as they

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.460
gave their lessons.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.700
What you see there is this graph here where
not a single person in the room gets ignored,

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.700
ever.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.990
And just using a simple tool of spreading
awareness of eye gaze, you're demonstrating

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.280
better learning in the classroom.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:44.141
So again, really cheap easy ways using things
you can glean from the virtual world as a

00:26:44.141 --> 00:26:46.320
way of increasing someone's performance.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.320
I've taken this exact paradigm and I've worked
with Peter Mundy who's at UC Davis, who works

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.980
with autistic children that have a hard time
maintaining eye contact.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:59.750
And what we've done is we've actually given
them training simulations to help remind them

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.750
to look people in the eye.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.630
And we've run two pilot studies now with very
encouraging results.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.029
So I think there's some great applications
of using VR towards helping people that have

00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:10.230
issues with social interaction.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.450
All right.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:17.330
I've talked a lot and hopefully I've convinced
you that I can use VR, my avatar, to influence

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.330
you guys.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:23.960
That there's things I can do that are going
to make you more likely to agree with me.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.899
Well, what happens to me?

00:27:26.899 --> 00:27:29.370
We now all understand that I can influence
you guys.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.350
But when I am changing my avatar, what are
the implications to me?

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.450
How does that affect me?

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.780
And that's a separate line of studies I want
to talk about now.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:44.360
So the paradigm here that we use here is a
stranger in the virtual mirror.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.540
So a typical subject will walk in the room
and we're tracking his motions as he walks

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.540
around.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.610
This is kind of an old virtual world but it's
good to get it used again.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:53.610
This is Nick Yee.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:54.860
He's walking around.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.789
He walks up to a virtual mirror. and a typical
subject in our studies we'll have them spend

00:27:59.789 --> 00:28:02.929
two minutes in front of the mirror gesturing
back and forth.

00:28:02.929 --> 00:28:05.740
So here you can see he's moving his head back
and forth.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.930
And he's a white man.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.500
He now is going to bend down and lose his
mirror image for a second.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.780
We track all of his movements.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.930
He pops up.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.570
And he's now a woman of color.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:21.070
And the question we ask is, if I change your
identity in a virtual world, do you come to

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:27.140
embody the social category of your avatar
compared to the social category of yourself.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:32.720
So can you use an avatar -- or does an avatar
change your identity?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.710
Small point of diversion here.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.429
Have you guys heard World of Warcraft?

00:28:38.429 --> 00:28:41.580
It's a video game where you have avatars.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.889
The average player of World of Warcraft is
in his late 20s.

00:28:45.889 --> 00:28:47.720
How many hours a week do you think he plays?

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.710
&gt;&gt;Male #2: 40
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: 40 is on the high end.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.130
On average it's close to 20.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.960
There are many people who spend 40.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.039
I'm saying on average the player is close
to 20.

00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:00.690
So think about, I put somebody in this for
about 90 seconds.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.950
A World of Warcraft player, he's spending
about 20 hours a week, in an avatar that could

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.399
be a different gender, it could be different
species.

00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:09.779
There's all sort of things that could be transformed
about this.

00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:13.929
So the idea of your virtual self being very
different from your physical self, is a common

00:29:13.929 --> 00:29:15.200
one.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.630
So in our typical experiments, you've got
the subject.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.150
He walks up to the virtual mirror and sees
himself in the mirror as something.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.830
And I'll talk about what that is in a second.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.639
He turns around and there's another person
to see, we'll call the confederate.

00:29:28.639 --> 00:29:33.659
He's part of the study and he has a set script
that he talks to the subject about.

00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:37.279
So the idea is I'm the subject, I look in
the mirror, I see myself differently.

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:42.340
I turn around and then I talk to someone else
and I think that other person sees me with

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.340
a new feature.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.399
And that sounds very abstract.

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.360
Let me talk you through one of them.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.460
The first study that Nick wanted to do was
attractiveness.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:54.670
We think as humans this enlightened species
but it turns out if you're good looking, you're

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.760
more extroverted.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.510
There's lots of changes in your behavior.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.419
Being good looking does change lots of psychological
attributes that people have.

00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:06.299
But in the virtual world, beauty is free.

00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:07.600
So everyone can be good looking.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.261
So Nick wanted to ask if I make you attractive
or unattractive in the virtual world, how

00:30:11.261 --> 00:30:12.760
does that change your behavior?

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.500
What he did is a study where subjects walk
to the mirror.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.620
They saw themselves in an avatar that had
carefully been chosen to be either one standard

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.870
deviation more attractive than average or
one standard deviation less attractive than

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:24.870
average.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.929
Keep in mind this is very subtle.

00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:29.580
It's not as if -- not a single person has
any idea they've got the good looking one

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.630
or the bad-looking one.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.480
All this is working on a subconscious level.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.190
And it's all -- no one's told they're in a
good-looking or bad-looking avatar.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.039
The confederate then says to the subject,
"come on, over here."

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:41.639
"come over here I want to talk to you."

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:46.090
And the first thing we measure is how close
the subject will stand to the confederate.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.610
When you have a good looking avatar, you will
step a meter closer to the confederate than

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.139
when you have a bad looking avatar.

00:30:53.139 --> 00:30:58.120
So a fundamental way about how you space yourself
in public spaces is changed by a very subtle

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.759
tweak to your avatar.

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:04.110
We then tape record everything that you say
in a 20 minute discussion with the confederate.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:09.309
We take those tape recordings and we mail
them off to nonverbal judges who are trained

00:31:09.309 --> 00:31:14.820
in actually seeing -- detecting how personable
you are by your voice.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:19.409
When you have an attractive face, for only
two minutes in a mirror, you speak more personably,

00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:20.970
you reveal more information about yourself.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:25.659
So a tiny tweak to your avatar is changing
how you interact nonverbally and what you

00:31:25.659 --> 00:31:26.980
say.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.960
In the next study Nick ran, he looked at height.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.820
So in the physical world, in the United States,
height is correlated with income.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.090
It's also correlated with confidence in situations.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:41.390
A very depressing study out of the University
of Chicago got back-end data to online dating.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:47.059
And it turns out, for men, for every inch
you are under 5'10", in order to get the same

00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:51.270
number of hits as a guy who's an inch taller,
you have to make an extra $30,000.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.520
[laughter] . So you can actually put a price
to height in the world of online dating.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.990
But again, in the virtual world, height is
free.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:03.019
And so what Nick the did is he had the subject
either be ten centimeters taller, very subtle,

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:04.320
nobody notices this consciously.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.940
Or ten centimeters shorter than the confederate.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.190
He then had them do a money-splitting game
called the 'ultimatum game' which is a task

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.350
used by economists, a standard way of gauging
economic performance.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:19.889
When I am ten centimeters shorter than you,
-- again I don't consciously notices this--

00:32:19.889 --> 00:32:24.200
No one's actually perceiving the height difference
in an explicit way--.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.380
When I am ten centimeters shorter than you,
I am three times as likely to lose the negotiation

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.940
than when I am the same height or taller than
you.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.820
This also occurs independent of your physical
height.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.350
So regardless of my physical height, it's
my virtual height which is changing my behavior.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:44.059
So real economic ramifications of a tiny tweak
of your avatar's height.

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:46.750
All these studies, by the way, I know they
sound a little bit out there.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.750
They're all published and just about every
one of them has been replicated more than

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:50.750
once.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:52.669
Meaning, when we try to go publish it the
reviewers say, "are you sure?"

00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:54.149
And they make us go back and do it again.

00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:55.190
And yes, we're sure.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.950
These are really powerful effects.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:01.780
The big question everyone asks is, "okay,
that's fine, but I'm not spending my whole

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.130
life in avatars.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:04.590
What happens when I leave?"

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:09.029
So with the attractiveness study, Nick ran
a study, a follow-up, where you were attractive

00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:10.190
in the virtual world.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:14.169
He then takes you out, pays you for the study,
walks you down the stairs and you're about

00:33:14.169 --> 00:33:15.419
to leave the building.

00:33:15.419 --> 00:33:18.530
Right as you're about to leave, another graduate
student runs up to you and says "wait, wait,

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.530
wait.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.179
I've got to get ten more subjects for my dissertation.

00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:24.659
If you fill out this questionnaire for five
minutes, I'll pay you $20."

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:25.659
Or $10.

00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:26.659
Everybody does it.

00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:28.450
No one has any idea it's related to this study.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.669
The survey is an online dating form.

00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:34.540
And part of it is choosing people you think
will go out with you.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.590
So people with whom you think you have a shot.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:41.000
Half an hour later, if I had a good looking
avatar, the confidence that you got from that

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.289
actually changes who I'm going to pick.

00:33:43.289 --> 00:33:46.830
So this experience in the virtual world doesn't
stay there; it changes at least for half an

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.940
hour in this instance who I am outside.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.409
With the height study, Nick did a very clever
manipulation where you're taller or shorter

00:33:53.409 --> 00:33:55.100
than the avatar in the virtual world.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.600
He took the helmets off of you and then you
met each other on chairs designed to ensure

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.390
that your height was exactly the same and
then repeated the negotiation and got the

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.970
exact, identical results.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:10.320
So this hierarchy that was formed from a height
differential extends face to face and you

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.429
still lose the negotiation.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:15.020
Very powerful in that sense.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.050
I want to shift now and I want to talk about
a different phenomenon that deals with the

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.349
self and I call this Veja Du.

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:22.399
I feel like I've never been here before.

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:25.050
And this takes the idea of Orville Redenbacher.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.470
What would happen if someone built that when
he was alive?

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:31.669
As a human species, avatars are giving us.

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.490
It's weird for this to happen actually.

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:39.220
In the history of media, avatars are giving
us something we've never, ever had before

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.520
as a perceptual experience.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.169
To me, it's flabbergasting.

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:45.889
I think it should be exciting to you as well.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.210
We've always had mirrors.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.480
We've been able to see ourselves.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.040
We've always been able to go up to water and
look at ourselves.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.220
In the last 50 years, we've been able to look
at ourselves asynchronously.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.270
Meaning, I can look at something I did on
video tape twenty years ago.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:03.420
For the first time ever, as people, we have
the ability to see ourselves doing something

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.650
we've never physically done.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.480
Somebody builds my avatar, any animator can
make it do anything he or she wants.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.619
For the first time ever, I can look at a screen
and see something that looks just like me

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:16.110
doing something I've never [physically done.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:22.319
I can't underestimate, as a social scientist,
how powerful this is or how -- just how strange

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:23.390
this is going to make the world.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.060
We can talk about applications later.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.839
The first study we wanted to do -- this is
Jesse Fox's dissertation deals with health

00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:30.839
behaviors.

00:35:30.839 --> 00:35:32.400
So Americans we know we're supposed to exercise
more.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.140
We're supposed to be healthy, but that message
doesn't get through.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.619
Jesse wanted to make it visceral.

00:35:36.619 --> 00:35:38.099
And so, what she did is, she built--.

00:35:38.099 --> 00:35:39.359
All you guys walk in the lab.

00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:40.900
We built your faces.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:45.410
And then you have to exercise in physical
space.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.200
So here's the video of that.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.579
Every three times that your knees cross your
chest the avatar which looks just like you.

00:35:52.579 --> 00:35:55.680
It's got your exact face -- loses a pound.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:02.190
So after 20 minutes, you watch your avatar
lose weight and get to what Jesse defined

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:06.250
as an ideal weight based on some health, government
standard.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:07.300
For ten minutes you do that.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.640
We then force him to stand still and all the
weight comes back.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.700
So what we're doing in a very visceral way.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.910
From here on out, what we can talk about is
VRs as a really cool tool to use avatars to

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.099
change behaviors that are difficult to change
and entrenched.

00:36:21.099 --> 00:36:25.730
So 24 hours later if you got this simulation,
we asked you to keep a diary and then turn

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:26.730
in the diaries to us.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.640
We -- you know that we're reading them.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.390
There's nothing personal in there.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:35.550
If you got this simulation, over the next
24 hours, you would exercise on average an

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.550
hour more than people in control conditions.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:43.210
For example, people that got the same simulation
with someone else's face instead of your own.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.960
Something real powerful about watching yourself
gain weight as a function of inaction and

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.210
then losing it when you get to --. Because
you're connecting the physical behavior with

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.829
what you all want to be.

00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:54.859
So she's changed your behavior up to a day
later.

00:36:54.859 --> 00:36:55.859
But that was self-report.

00:36:55.859 --> 00:36:56.870
We don't always trust it.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.710
So in a follow up study, she brought subjects
in, gave them this type of simulation, then

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.190
took the helmet off, paid the subject.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.410
Said, "you know what?

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.470
Next guy's not coming in for 20 minutes.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.210
You got some weights over there if you want
to work out you can."

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:13.010
People in this situation simulation worked
out for ten minutes longer on average than

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.010
control conditions.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:20.310
So people stayed in the lab in their school
clothes working out voluntarily because this

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.310
idea of fitness had been driven home in such
a powerful manner.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.270
We've replicated this a number of times including
eating.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:30.130
So Jesse ran a study where subjects sat down
and were forced -- we took control of their

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:34.600
virtual arm and they were forced to either
eat Reese's pieces and watch their thighs

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.069
grow and their guts grow over or eat carrots
and watch it come off.

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:39.880
And we showed that change in eating behaviors.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.869
A really nice idea there.

00:37:41.869 --> 00:37:46.920
On the negative side Kathryn Segovia brought
in preschoolers to the lab.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.560
And elementary school children.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560
Young children.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.460
The first time anyone has ever taken my very
expensive virtual reality equipment and subjected

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.010
it to hundreds of children.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.710
Very fascinating study.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.690
And she wanted to ask about false memories.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:07.390
So if a child sees herself swimming with a
whale does that become an actual memory of

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.280
something she thinks she does in a physical
world?

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.060
So in psychology a fairly large study on false
memory formations in the legal literature

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.869
and it's something that's very important to
understand if you're spending time in virtual

00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:20.690
spaces, how is that changing your cognitive
structure?

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:26.310
And so children that came into the lab and
saw themselves swimming with whales compared

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:31.910
to subjects who saw another child swimming
with a whale, in the treatment condition of

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:36.160
the self, 50 percent of our children, a week
later when we brought them back, thought they

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.630
had been to Sea World, described the hot dog
they ate beforehand, the smell of the fish

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.660
tank, had encoded this as a physical memory.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.710
One in two of our children believe they'd
done this physically.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.589
Compared to controlled conditions, this is
much higher.

00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:53.760
For children using or spending all this time
with digital media, it really raises some

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.780
concerns.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.160
Grace Ahn ran a series of studies on what
she called sell self-endorsing.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.370
This takes a big idea from science fiction
that if I'm wandering down the street and

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:06.520
a camera takes a picture of my face then you
encounter a billboard that has me using your

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.119
product and loving it.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:10.270
How is that is that going to change my attitude
to the product.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:15.850
In a line of four five studies that just got
published in the Journal of Advertising, you'll

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:16.890
like the product more.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:20.589
You won't have a conscious memory of me being
in the billboard later on but you'll still

00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:22.670
think the product is better for some reason.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.510
So very powerful.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.520
And then connection with a future self.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.320
A line of studies we ran with Laura Carstensen
at the Center for Longevity at Stanford.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.280
She's trying to have people have a good time
in their older age; to have a very enriching

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280
life.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.640
Children today aren't saving any money.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.620
It's going to be a crisis hen when they do
the math about saving.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.950
So when we brought subjects into the lab and
we aged them.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.180
And so, 18 year old subjects went to the virtual
mirror, saw themselves as they're going to

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.830
look when they're 65 compared to seeing themselves
at their own age.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.700
And the idea is that an 18yearold can't even
imagine what it's like to be a 30, let alone

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.700
65.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.380
If I'm trying to get him to save money, let's
show him what he's going to look like when

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.380
he's 65.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.300
And so, we did this and then the dependent
variable was we can give them some money now

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.849
or they can wait and get more money later
to put it in savings.

00:40:06.849 --> 00:40:10.420
And what we're showing is that when you show
the future self compared to when you ask them

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.290
to imagine the future self, you get more savings
and very exciting results.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:19.559
So I'm going to shift and conclude very quickly
because I want to leave time for Q and A,

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:23.501
about some work that I'm very excited about
because I think it's got some potential to

00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:25.170
make the world a better place.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.810
This asks about does it help if I can walk
in someone else's shoes?

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:32.390
And the first study was done with environmentalism.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:36.231
So again, VR can can be thought of as a way
to help those very entrenched, hard to change

00:40:36.231 --> 00:40:37.280
behaviors.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.650
We all know we're not supposed to drive alone
to work.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.150
We all know we're supposed to take shorter
showers.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.720
And what we did here there's an op ed that
came out in the New York times that said if

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.170
you're using that beautiful, fluffy, non-recyclable
toilet paper, over the course of your life,

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.020
you're sawing down two virgin trees.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.380
And so, what we did is half our subjects came
in.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.210
All were told that statistic.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.050
Half our subjects read a beautifully written
narrative about what it would be like to cut

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.050
down a tree.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:04.280
The other half were forced to use this apparatus,
a haptic device, that simulated a chain saw

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.860
and literally cut down a tree.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.609
And hear it thunderously crash around them
and the birds fly away.

00:41:09.609 --> 00:41:15.020
And basically step into the shoes of a logger
and experience what it's like to do that.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.589
And then what we did was Grace Ahn runs in,
she's visibly pregnant, 45 minutes later while

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:21.200
the subjects were leaving.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.369
She knocks down a glass of water and says
"I'm pregnant.

00:41:23.369 --> 00:41:25.839
Can you help me please clean this up?"

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:30.130
Subjects who got the virtual experience will
clean the mess using 20 percent less paper

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.920
than subjects who got the written experience.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.059
So think about it.

00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:36.540
Environmentalism , we all know we're supposed
to be green, but it's these hard to change

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:42.990
experiences that this disembodied virtual
avatar experience can change.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.990
The next one deals with diversity training.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.339
And we've done a lot of work with racism,
with ageism, with sexism.

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:52.220
The study I want to just briefly talk about
deals with attitudes toward the handicapped.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.030
We made subjects color blind which is not
too traumatic of a handicap.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.660
Half of our subjects imagined what it would
be like to not be able to differentiate between

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.660
red and green.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.550
The other half we just robbed the ability
to see red and green by a filter on the virtual

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.730
world.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:10.320
And so they had to go through some tasks where
it was very difficult to do the task because

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.520
you couldn't tell the colors.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.069
Then later on we asked them to volunteer their
time surfing the web and writing down websites

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:19.329
that were hard for red- green color blind
people to see.

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:23.580
And people in the VR condition, compared to
the imagine you were color blind condition,

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:31.620
spent 20 minutes longer on average helping
color blind people compared to others.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.400
Let me conclude.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.839
Avatars can be more human than human.

00:42:34.839 --> 00:42:36.150
That's actually a chapter in our book.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:40.900
Really talking about how avatars can not make
me as good a teacher as I am physically but

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:41.900
a better teacher.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:46.920
It's a really special cool ways that we can
make the world a better place.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.309
And immersion is going to be a game changer.

00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:52.310
If people are spending so much time online
right now and it's a flat 2D screen, what's

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:56.130
going to happen when, you know, we are we're
literally immersed in the content and we see

00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:00.640
everything perceptually everything feels real
which is what we're moving toward.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.270
And finally ethics are a great thing to talk
about.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.820
All these things can be viewed as deception.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.390
If I transforming my avatar, I am really hiding,
in some ways, who I am.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:12.640
All of these things may not be worth doing.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.900
It's a fantastic debate.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:20.990
So I would love to get at least 13 minutes
of your questions and thank you for your attention.

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.490
[Applause]

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:26.790
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: That was a very good talk.

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:28.950
And my goal has always been to get to 6 feet.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:33.119
But since I'm two inches short, my goal is
to make 60,000 dollars more now.

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:38.359
So if you have any questions, please come
up to the mic so that the folks on VC can

00:43:38.359 --> 00:43:39.359
also hear it.

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:44.290
&gt;&gt; Female #1: So I have a question about several
of the experiments.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:49.320
I can remember mirroring and face blending.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:55.550
There are subjects are fairly unsophisticated
in the techniques that can be created in a

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.250
virtual world.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:01.670
Do you get any sense that over time humans
will become more sophisticated about what's

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:06.400
happening in this world and what's being done
and will that make a difference to their reactions

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.910
in this space?

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.710
Because we seem to get more sophisticated
about other technology.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.920
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: It's a great question.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.170
So the question is subjects in my studies
may not have known anything about VR and as

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:21.640
we get used to the technology, none of this
is going to work.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.570
I think there's a good truth to that which
is there is a novelty effect what we're going

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:29.369
to see is an arms race very similar to spam
and spam blockers.

00:44:29.369 --> 00:44:34.670
People using these transformations, people
realizing they're not real, and then someone

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:37.210
having to go to the next level and going back
and forth.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:41.250
One thing I like to say is my purpose is to
inoculate.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:44.490
With the political morphing, I get approached
by political consultants sometimes.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.079
I just don't do that work.

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:48.700
I view my goal as informing the public.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.640
And when you consciously are aware of this
stuff, so when I tell you that candidate has

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.790
stolen your face, that backfires.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.150
And so, this is truly a case of knowledge
is power.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.500
And then the question is how sophisticated
are the users compared to the people trying

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.869
the transformations.

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:08.290
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So, could you give us an idea
what things avatars don't work for?

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:12.030
You must have had some negative results over
the years.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.530
&gt;&gt; Jeremy: So, great question.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.330
There's many things that don't work.

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:21.000
Those, academia doesn't reward you for publishing
things that don't work.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.859
One thing we tried was whites and blacks.

00:45:23.859 --> 00:45:28.030
We took white people and put them in black
avatars and forced them to walk a day in the

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:32.410
shoe of someone who's black with the idea
we wanted them to gain an empathy.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.030
And that was the case where we didn't actually
reduce racism.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:36.660
We actually increased it.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:41.121
So there's a fairly large literature on racial
priming which is that some whites, when you

00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:45.530
remind them of blacks, that changes their
behavior in a negative way just because it's

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:46.900
called priming.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.869
Unfortunately American whites generally have
negative associations in general with blacks.

00:45:50.869 --> 00:45:55.280
We thought if we put you in an avatar and
show you what it's like to be a different

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.020
race that would help and this is one instance
where it backfired on us and we're still doing

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.869
follow ups on that.

00:46:00.869 --> 00:46:04.279
I can talk for hours about the studies that
haven't worked.

00:46:04.279 --> 00:46:11.830
&gt;&gt; Male #4: The studies that rely on mainly
on looks like Veja Du and face morphing, I'm

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:16.240
wondering if you've even looked at identical
twins and if they're still susceptible to

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.309
the results.

00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:20.720
&gt;&gt; Jeremy: It's a great question.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.090
So the question was do they work on identical
twins in a different way.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.770
I'd love to do that study.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.520
It's hard finding enough identical twins.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.650
There are scholars who do that for the people
who study evolution.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:33.730
But I'll put that on the list.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.070
That's a great idea.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:42.280
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So you talked about the trade off
between real inches and real money.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.210
Have you thought about virtual money versus
virtual inches and all those other possible

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:48.840
permutations of that.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:54.240
&gt;&gt; Jeremy: The question is have we thought
about how this thing deal with virtual money

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.869
as opposed to to real money.

00:46:55.869 --> 00:47:01.370
My colleague, Jim Blascovich, quote unquote
real money U.S. dollars are supposedly a stand

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.710
in for gold.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:07.090
Currency by definition is representation of
something else.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:12.119
But we have looked at specifically Linden
dollars in some of our studies and found similar

00:47:12.119 --> 00:47:13.829
effects.

00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:18.980
Great question, thanks.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:25.099
&gt;&gt; Male #6: So you've done a number of different
studies.

00:47:25.099 --> 00:47:33.250
Which was a result that so surprised you that
it was like "oh" but you were completely surprised.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.000
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: Great question.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.230
The question is which study surprised us the
most.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.490
And there's a line of work I didn't get to
talk about in this talk that we call Digital

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:46.630
Footprints and this how many guys have seen
this New Yorker comic on the Internet "nobody

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:51.069
knows you're a dog" that shows a dog on the
Internet.

00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:56.329
We've run a study actually the military is
actually sponsoring a huge program with lots

00:47:56.329 --> 00:48:00.069
and lots of people studying this which is
based on what I call your digital footprint

00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:02.670
which is the stuff you leave behind in a virtual
world.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.710
So on a web you leave behind cookies.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:09.170
In a virtual world you leave behind where
you walked, everything you've said.

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:13.550
So in this online world Second Life you can
record everything everybody does; who they're

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.460
standing next to, if they're flying or walking.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.940
We've run studies now -- I ran a study where
I took 80 Stanford students.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.930
They spent 10 hours a week in Second Life.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:27.630
And they put on these buttons that recorded
everything they ever did in Second Life.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.829
But I also knew who they were in the first
world.

00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:30.829
They were my students.

00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:34.110
I knew their gender, I knew their age, I knew
their GPA, I knew their major.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.380
I knew they fill that personality metrics.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.770
And then what we then did is we used machine
learning algorithms which are statistical

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:45.990
methods where you can correlate data with
a right and wrong answer.

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:49.650
And what we did is we said can I use this
digital footprint, this massive amount of

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.500
data we're collecting on a second/second basis.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:56.220
Think about this: 80 student students,ten
hours a week, every second collecting about

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.599
50 parameters on what they're doing in the
virtual world.

00:48:58.599 --> 00:49:04.670
Can you take all that data and find me some
pattern that I can detect a man from a woman.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:08.780
Can how you walk in Second Life, does that
tell me your gender or your age.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:15.320
And what we demonstrated with extremely high
accuracies much higher than I thought possible,

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.849
I can tell a lot about you, your personality,
your race, based on things we thought were

00:49:20.849 --> 00:49:21.849
anonymous.

00:49:21.849 --> 00:49:25.720
So the joke is yes you may think that on the
Internet nobody knows you're a dog but it

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.059
turns out we know you're a dog.

00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:29.609
We know quite well.

00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:35.380
The Internet and virtual worlds in particular
have this illusion of being anonymous.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.530
Everything -- it's not me it's an avatar.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.430
But it turns out the digital footprint you
leave behind in a virtual world, is more damning,

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:46.430
in many ways, or depending on the point of
view more wonderful, than any face to face

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:50.900
encounter could be because there's a record
of every single behavior done by every person.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.450
Whereas face to face, I can do something embarrassing
but I can lobby later on for all of you not

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.200
to tell anybody; but in a virtual world that
doesn't work.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.359
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Other questions.

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:06.470
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: Thanks guys.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.589
Thanks a lot.

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:11.670
Appreciate it.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:12.710
[Applause]
