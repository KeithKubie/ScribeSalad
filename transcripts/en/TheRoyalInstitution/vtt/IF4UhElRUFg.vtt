00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:04.423


00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.848
Thank you.

00:00:10.732 --> 00:00:11.690
So it's great to be
back at the RI again.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.373
I spoke here last year and it's
such a fantastic auditorium.

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.435
I'm a professor of astrophysics
at the University of Sydney,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.966
and as was mentioned there,
I'm a cosmologist, right.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.686
My job is to try and
understand the forces that

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.513
have shaped the evolution
of the Universe,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.890
from a time when the
Universe was basically

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.590
formless to the rich
structure of the Universe

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.496
that we see around us today.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:35.888
So what I want to do
tonight is basically take us

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.503
all in a bit of a journey.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.140
What we want to do
is not take a journey

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.906
through space but a
journey through time.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.313
And we want to look
backwards first to see

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.530
how our Universe evolved from
its birth in the Big Bang

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.523
to the Universe with stars, and
planets, and galaxies today.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.033
And then we want to turn around
and run the Universe forward

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.786
and ask what fate
holds for the Universe.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.016
Just what is going to
happen as this Universe gets

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.436
older and older?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.590
So every journey starts
with a single step,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.013
and before we take a step
backwards into the past or step

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.133
forwards into the
future, I think

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.483
it's important to
understand where we are,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.886
where we are today.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.026
Just what kind of
Universe do we live in?

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:18.258
And, of course, the
starting point for that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.373
is where are we now?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.053
And we find ourselves
on the surface

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.596
of a small, rocky planet.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.806
And it's a very special planet.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.546
It's an extraordinary
planet, because out

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.103
of the thousands
of planets we know,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.336
that we've discovered
in the Universe,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.778
and the trillions
of planets we think

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:37.480
are out there in the
observable Universe,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.430
this is the only
one where we have

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.106
complete and utter evidence that
there is life on this planet.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.163
Sometimes it's a bit difficult
to see intelligent life

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.400
on this planet, but there
is life on this planet.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.450
OK.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.650
Now, I'm going to touch
upon life in the Universe

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.783
as we go out into the
future a little bit.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.963
So it's important to
try and understand

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.870
what we mean when we say life.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.683
And it turns out that defining
life is incredibly difficult.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.723
When you get down to the
details, how you define

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.000
whether what's alive
and what's dead,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.913
people set up rules and say,
this is my dividing line.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.123
This is the living stuff,
that's the dead stuff.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.490
Or this stuff on the dead side,
which just looks a bit alive.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.690
And that happens all the time.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.436
And there are arguments about
whether viruses are alive.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.350
Or the prions are
alive, these things

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.403
even smaller than viruses.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.721
And so defining life, that
would take another lecture

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:32.383
and probably a
few more lectures,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.883
and we would be here until
almost the end of the Universe

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.850
trying to define what life is.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.396
But what I'm going to touch
upon is an aspect of life

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.103
which, in my opinion, I think
is one of the key things

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.870
that life does if we're
going to define something

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.470
as a living organism.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.383
And that's to do with energy.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.903
All life processes energy.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.450
So what we have in
this picture here,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.490
we have a lovely sunflower.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.910
That sunflower has
captured sunlight,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.040
and that sunlight has
been stored as energy

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.493
in the chemical bonds
inside the plant.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.986
Creatures come along
and they eat the plant,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.923
and they can use that energy
to run their own chemical

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.450
processes in their body.

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:16.065
And, similarly, we
could eat the plants

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.914
or we could eat the animals
that ate the plants.

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:19.264
And so there's just a
continuous progression

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.360
whereby we use and
process energy,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.036
and that is one of the defining
characteristics of life.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.543
All life processes
energy of some sort.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.483
And that energy not only
drives the chemical reactions

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.490
in your body, but it also drives
the sort of mental reactions

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.717
in your mind when
you think, right.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.138
We all know that when
you have a sugar low,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.653
it's very hard to
think about anything.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.200
You need energy
to run your brain.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.303
In fact, it uses up
a very large amount

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.176
of the energy that you take in.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.506
So there's actually
a very strong link

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.123
between flows of energy and
processing of information.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.290
And any time you
run your computer

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.380
and your computer is doing
very difficult calculations,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.426
or updating Facebook,
or something,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.053
it's processing
information, and you

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.853
can feel the heat that's
generated by that information

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.866
being processed.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.850
So if any living creature is
going to be sentient and know

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.770
about its environment
and react to that,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.341
it's going to need to have an
energy flow to drive that sort

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.650
of behaviour.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.613
Now, the ultimate source of
energy on the Earth of course

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.520
is the Sun.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.236
In the middle of the Sun,
every second 11 million tonnes

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.256
of hydrogen get
turned into helium.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.726
That releases energy,
which takes 100,000 years

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.019
to percolate through the
Sun, and then 8 minutes

00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:43.658
to get from the
surface of the Sun

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.690
to the Earth, where it's
absorbed by this sunflower,

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.363
or it lands on the
pavement outside in London

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.603
and makes the place even hotter.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.026
So all life on Earth
exists because we

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.052
have a vast reservoir of
energy right next door to us

00:04:59.954 --> 00:05:00.354
in the Universe.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.133
And we can use that
energy, and that

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.040
has driven life and evolution
up until the present day.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.166
Take away that source of
energy, you have no life.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.126
What we'll be seeing
is that energy

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.340
will come to play a
critical role in what life

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.173
can do when we look at the
far future of the Universe.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.706
It becomes the scarce resource.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.793
It's the thing
that any life that

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.500
exists in the distant
future Universe

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.406
is going to need to seek if
it's going to continue to live.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.248
But let's just try and remember
our place in the Universe.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.538
As I said, we're on the
surface of this rocky planet.

00:05:36.488 --> 00:05:37.488


00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.963
Energy is given to
us by the Sun, which

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.503
is a very typical dwarf star.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.916
And our Sun is not
alone in the universe,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.616
but the Sun actually occupies
a small patch of the Universe

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.803
with roughly 300 billion
other suns in an object which

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.563
is known as the Milky Way.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.926
When we look out
into the Universe,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.573
we see that there are
possibly a hundred billion

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.513
to a trillion other
galaxies out there.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.786
So there's a huge number of
stars, huge number of galaxies,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.290
huge number of potential places
where there could be life.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.800
But we have no idea what
the frequency of life

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.946
is in the Universe.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.586
Life could be very common, or
life could be extremely rare.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.850
And all of our
observational evidence

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.846
is quite consistent
with this being

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.594
the only place in
the Universe where

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:26.294
there is life at the moment.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.423
So I said, this is
a special planet.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.533
So before we play the game
of looking into the future,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.776
let's work out how we understand
what happened in the past.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.073
And what we know
is that people have

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.523
looked at the skies
for thousands of years

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.202
and you see patterns
of stars on the sky.

00:06:44.564 --> 00:06:45.348
And people have
generally invented

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.580
stories of heroes,
and gods, and legends

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.926
to explain the various
patterns that we see.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.483
For us here at
the RI, of course,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.560
the important thing is
not just the stories

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.620
that people have
told but how they

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.586
came to apply science
to understanding

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.760
the evolution of the Universe.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.783
And this all
happened, of course,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.926
during the time of the
birth of modern science.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.386
And I'll just pop
up this guy here.

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:13.200
This, of course, is probably
Britain's most famous

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.215
scientist, second famous if
you consider Stephen Hawking

00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:18.152
as well.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.750
But this is Isaac
Newton, who in my mind

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.273
should be Britain's
most famous scientist.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:24.856
Isaac Newton was
around at the time

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.736
when there was just a
changing viewpoint on how

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.160
we understand the Universe.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.670
And I like this picture.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.870
This picture was taken off the
back of the old pound note.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.566
There's people in this
room who clearly have never

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:37.863
seen an old pound note.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.200
You're probably too young.

00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:40.682
But in the old days there
used to be a pound note.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.663
On the back of it was this
picture of Isaac Newton.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.933
And I like this
picture because it's

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.073
a picture of Isaac Newton
with his telescope.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.593
And he observed the Universe.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.716
He used his telescope to
see what was going on.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.260
Now, he was not the first
to look at the heavens.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:55.933
It's reported that Galileo
was the first to look

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.050
at the heavens and see, when he
looked at the planet Jupiter,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:01.633
that Jupiter had
companions, that there

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.946
were moons orbiting Jupiter.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.123
And that led to
this general idea

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.676
that there must be some sort
of order to the heavens,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.900
and then people wondering
whether the order

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.560
in the heavens is similar to
the order down here on Earth.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:18.970
And if I understand how
things behave here on Earth,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.060
maybe that will
tell me how things

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.146
are behaving in the heavens.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.240
And so what you
start to do is you

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.926
start to dispel the
need for gods and heroes

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.230
in describing what's
going on in the Universe,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:33.454
but what you want are
laws of science that

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:37.979
tell you how things behave.

00:08:38.344 --> 00:08:39.428
Now, the other reason
that I like this picture

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.393
is that in Newton's lap there is
his book, the Principia, where

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:45.340
essentially he lay down
the key ideas which

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.660
became classical mechanics,
how things react to forces.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.743
But also, in there he
described the law of gravity.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.070
And the picture that we
have in the background there

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.510
is sort of Newton's description
of how gravity works

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.020
in basically holding
the Earth in its orbit

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.613
as it travels around the Sun.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.320
And, of course, Newton's great
insight was to realise that

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.306
the force that takes an apple
and pulls it from the tree

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.033
and pulls it to the ground is
exactly the same force that

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.223
holds the Moon in its
orbit around the Earth,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.296
the Earth in its
orbit around the Sun,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.416
and Jupiter's moons in
their orbit around Jupiter.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.230
So you could write down
mathematical equations

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.506
and you could make predictions.

00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:33.595
You could predict
where Jupiter's moons

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.680
are going to be
because they are just

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.206
obeying the laws of science.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.483
No need to introduce any gods
or mythical beings anywhere

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.605
because it's all there
in the equations.

00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:45.213
Now, some people
don't like that.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:46.707
That leads to a very
sterile universe of course,

00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:48.845
where everything
is just governed

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:49.683
by mathematical equations.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.603
But it at least means
it's predictable.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.270
We know where things
are going to be.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.773
Now, in the 400 years or
so since we had Newton,

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.563
the only thing that's changed
is that we've gotten deeper

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.173
into our physical laws.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:05.853
We understand the
physical laws that

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.246
govern the Universe
in a lot more detail,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.406
and we've peered more
deeply into the Universe.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.656
And what we've done is
developed new telescopes

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.550
that can see further and further
out into the distant cosmos.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.843
And this picture here,
this is a telescope

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.340
that's currently
being constructed

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.350
in the southern hemisphere.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.160
This is the Square
Kilometre Array

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:26.453
which is being built in
South Africa and Australia.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.156
It will be a radio telescopes,
so it can only see radio waves.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.443
And it will basically
be a collecting area

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.656
of 1 square Kilometre.

00:10:38.207 --> 00:10:39.540
So we'll be able to see some
of the faintest things that

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.540
are out there in the Universe.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:42.848
But, as well as the
Square Kilometre Array,

00:10:45.432 --> 00:10:46.390
we have lots of giant
optical telescopes.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.473
You have telescopes
in space that

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.493
look at x-rays and
gamma rays, and look

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.586
at microwaves, et cetera.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.493
And what they've
revealed is a universe

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.690
which is, in my humble
opinion, being a cosmologist,

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.350
quite exciting.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.156
So what we've got
here, we have a picture

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.640
that was made by
the WMAP consortium.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.500
WMAP is just a telescope
that's in space, the Wilkinson

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.510
Microwave Anisotropy Probe.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.270
Its job was to look more
deeply into the universe

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.123
than any other telescopes.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.446
But what we've got here is a
picture of our entire Universe

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.806
as we understand it, both
in terms of what we can see

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:27.376
and in terms of what
we can understand

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.776
in terms of the physics that's
going on in the Universe.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.466
Now, because light travels
at a finite speed, when

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.193
you look at more and
more distant objects,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.913
you're looking further
and further back in time.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.063
And what we have is a picture of
our Universe from today as far

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.163
back as we can see,
and what we can see

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.023
is that the Universe has changed
and evolved over its lifetime.

00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:55.893
The first important thing is
to realise that our Universe

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.710
hasn't been around forever.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.243
The Universe appears to have
been born in an event now known

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.476
as the Big Bang that occurred
roughly 14 billion years ago.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.653
So our Universe
has a finite age.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:10.763
But looking back, we see
that the Universe in the past

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.403
was different to
the Universe today.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.060
So today around us we see
all these stars and galaxies.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.263
And as we look back in the past,
we also see stars and galaxies

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:24.750
but they're different
to the ones today.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.723
They're less formed.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.190
And as we push back further
and further, we get to a point

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.823
where there were
no galaxies at all.

00:12:34.476 --> 00:12:35.235
And we can push
back even further

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.916
and we run into the very
start of the Universe.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:39.650
So in terms of the
Universe's evolution,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:41.970
you can go from left to right.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.043
At this side, you
have the Big Bang.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.930
The Universe was
filled with material

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.436
all smoothly distributed.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.563
Then the laws of physics acted
over roughly 14 billion years

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.343
to give us the Universe
that we see today.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:56.546
And so there are a
number of key features

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.266
that people like to talk about.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.436
The very birth itself,
which is something

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:03.573
that we do not understand.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.896
We do not yet have
the laws of physics

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.233
to understand the very
birth of the Universe.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.113
But after that, the
evolution of the Universe

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.753
through this rapid expansion
known as inflation,

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:15.310
through the overall evolution of
matter into stars and galaxies,

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:19.660
that all seems to be
described very accurately

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.653
by the laws of physics.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.611
So, in fact, one of
the things that we

00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:27.213
like to do-- it's
actually a very

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:28.163
big part of modern
astrophysics--

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.096
is we like to build
our own universes.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:32.816
And I have PhD
students working for me

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.726
that, they generate
universes before breakfast.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.620
Well, generally not
because none of them

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.283
are ever up before
breakfast, right.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.356
So early afternoon they'll
generate a universe.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.233
So what do I mean by that?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.366
What do I mean by
generate a universe?

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.470
Well, as I said, we think
all of the processes

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.693
underway in the Universe
are just governed

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.753
by the laws of science.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.930
So if I take my laws of
science, my laws of physics,

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:58.356
my law of how gravity
works, how gases work,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.186
how nuclear physics works, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.153
and I translate those
equations into computer code,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.360
and I give the equations
to a computer and say

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.526
to the computer solve
the equations for me--

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.440
because that's what
computers are good at--

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.013
I can actually generate
a synthetic universe.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:18.840
And so in the next
sort of animation,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.260
I'm going to show you
the results of one

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.286
of the big simulations
of the Universe

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.043
that was done by a
group called Illustris.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.233
Essentially, what
you do is you just

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.109
say I'm going to take a
big volume of the Universe.

00:14:32.024 --> 00:14:32.624
This volume is
billions of light years

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.204
across, much bigger
than our own galaxy.

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:37.385
I'm going to put matter in
there, nice and smoothly

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:38.670
distributed like it
was after the Big Bang.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.323
And then I'm going
to hit Go and you

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.496
can solve all of the
difficult equations,

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.700
and you can tell me what
the Universe looks like.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.028
So one of the best things
about giving astronomy talks,

00:14:50.012 --> 00:14:51.221
you can just put on the
movies and you can dip out,

00:14:52.136 --> 00:14:52.632
have a cup of coffee.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.049
Come back when the
movie ends and just say,

00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:56.097
wasn't that lovely?

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.536
So what we're seeing
here, this is matter

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:00.853
moving in the early Universe.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.333
So it was originally
smoothly distributed.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.883
Gravity started acting and
pulling matter together.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.293
And the matter just doesn't
fall into one big lump,

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:10.576
but it falls into
several lumps connected

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.463
by this structure which is
known as the cosmic web.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.513
Inside these lumps,
gas can pool together,

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.400
and when that gas pools,
it can form stars.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:22.753
So where you get
these big lumps,

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.553
that's where you
form your galaxies.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:27.310
So inside these galaxies
we have stars burning away.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.576
But stars evolve over time,
and eventually the giant stars,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:33.956
they basically run out of
fuel and then they explode.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.441
And hopefully we should have
an explosion any time now.

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:40.158
There we are.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.240
Right on cue.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:42.950
What you've got
there is a giant star

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.446
that is being burning elements
in its core-- hydrogen

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.380
to helium, helium
into carbon, carbon

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:49.556
into oxygen, da da da da.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.006
All of those elements are caught
up in the heart of the star.

00:15:54.894 --> 00:15:56.278
But for life, having those
elements in the heart of a star

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:57.793
is pretty pointless.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.940
What you need them is
spread out through the rest

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.838
of the intergalactic medium--
or interstellar medium,

00:16:02.788 --> 00:16:02.846
I should say--

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.896
and for that material to be
recycled in the next generation

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.430
of stars.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.376
So that's what happens
when massive stars explode.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.436
These stars explode and they
spit out the heavy elements

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.856
that are needed for life.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.483
So it's kind of sobering
to think about this,

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.570
that you look at yourself
and you think, this is me.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.323
I am [MUMBLES]
years old, but I'm

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.866
made of water, mostly water.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:31.446
The hydrogen in that
water, that hydrogen

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.840
was formed in the Big Bang.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.486
That hydrogen is 14
billion years old.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.583
The oxygen in the
water, that oxygen

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.086
was formed in the
heart of a big star.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.473
And, in fact, the
elements that make up me

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.063
have probably been through
the hearts of several stars

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.236
through several generations
of being formed,

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.556
material spat out,
recycled, being spat out,

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.046
and being recycled.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.996
And the one that I
always like to mention

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.036
is that elements like this--

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.050
I was told by the
jeweller it's gold.

00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:05.792
It might be.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:06.849
But gold.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.160
Stars don't create
gold when stars burn.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.973
Gold is only created
when stars die.

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:16.527
That gives you the conditions
that can squeeze atoms together

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.275
so hard to give you gold.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.683
So I said, if you want
to be romantic then

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.316
you should say that a star had
to die to give us this ring.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.008
But we are implicitly tied
through that evolution

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440
of stars.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.426
There's no way we could have
had life in the early Universe

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.031
with just hydrogen and helium.

00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:33.821
There's just not the
complexity there to have life.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.770
So what we have got of course is
we've got our picture of today.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.090
This is today.

00:17:43.154 --> 00:17:44.088
This is a lovely
picture taken in Chile.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.553
This is the VLT, the
Very Large Telescope.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.040
We are not very imaginative
in naming telescopes.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:50.956
The ELT is coming--

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.843
Extremely Large Telescope.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880
I kid you not.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:59.310
There's also OWL, which is
Overwhelmingly Large telescope.

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.688
We should spend more time
when think of these names.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:02.750
But anyway, the VLT exists.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.380
It's in Chile.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.453
It's four 8-metre telescopes.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.713
All the good
telescopes in the world

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.453
are now in Chile because they've
got some of the clearest skies

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:10.703
and you can get up very high.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.433
And this is a beautiful view of
the centre of our own Milky Way

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920
galaxy.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.763
So if we were in
Chile, your eyes

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.113
do not see quite as good
as this but the view

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.440
is quite spectacular.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.903
But we find ourselves on
a rocky planet orbiting

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.730
a fairly typical smallish star
in a reasonably big galaxy,

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.446
which is one of many
hundreds of billions

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.026
or trillions of other
galaxies in the Universe.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.783
Now, one of the
issues about when

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.960
you think about evolution--

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.743
let's go back to the
evolution of humans--

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.121
is that we often
make the mistake,

00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:49.578
is that here we are,
here we are now,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.256
and therefore we are the
pinnacle of evolution.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:52.840
This must be the end point.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.093
How can it get better than this?

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.280
Right?

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:57.117
But of course we're wrong.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:58.000
Humans are still evolving,
still changing all the time.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.396
Evolution hasn't stopped
because we've suddenly

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.536
discovered the iPhone.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:05.516
We are still evolving.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:06.808
And there are
different pressures

00:19:07.425 --> 00:19:10.491
on how things evolve but
we are still evolving.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:10.893
And it's the same
with the Universe.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.870
You might think, well, this
planet is quite comfortable

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.693
and this Universe looks kind
of pretty and photogenic.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860
Maybe this is the
pinnacle of the Universe.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.019
This is the way that it's
always going to be from now on.

00:19:22.034 --> 00:19:23.767
How can it get any better?

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.016
Unfortunately, this is not
the pinnacle of the Universe.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.903
And at some level this is
the start of a long decline.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:34.336
So on that happy note, let's
now turn the picture around

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.283
and start looking at the future.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.141
Now, in understanding the
future history of the Universe,

00:19:43.972 --> 00:19:44.780
we have some
limitations that we're

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.363
going to have to acknowledge.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:48.973
Studying the Universe's
evolution from the Big Bang

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.370
to now, you can have
a telescope and you

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.963
can see what's happened
in the Universe

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.790
to guide you in what
processes were important.

00:19:58.202 --> 00:19:59.310
But unfortunately, we
don't have any telescopes

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.676
that can receive
light from the future.

00:20:02.177 --> 00:20:03.510
It would be beautiful to see
what the future Universe is

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.663
going to do because that would
help you make a prediction

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.623
because you can see it.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.000
So we don't.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.800
So at some level we're
working in the dark.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.303
We're going to make
predictions, and there

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:15.433
will be some level
of uncertainty

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.376
because we don't know everything
about our current state

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.423
of the Universe perfectly.

00:20:21.634 --> 00:20:22.868
But there's a bigger problem,
and the bigger problem

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.410
is that we don't know our
laws of physics perfectly.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.530
We know that we have some
very good laws of physics.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.783
We have quantum mechanics.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.540
If your iPhone wants to work,
it relies on quantum mechanics.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.766
We know that to a very
high degree of accuracy.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.410
We also have a really good
description of gravity

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:39.640
given to us by Einstein.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.193
Again, GPS works.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:42.920
It gets you down to a centimetre
on the surface of the Earth.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.090
You need to worry about
Einstein's theory of gravity

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.923
to make GPS work.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.440
The only problem that
we have is that, when

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.530
we have conditions where we
have to worry about quantum

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:54.743
mechanics and gravity
together, they just do not

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.596
fit together mathematically.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.343
So there will be places
where we go into the future

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:03.766
that this uncertainty of
how these sort of mesh

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.720
together are going
to cause problems.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.203
So as we go out into
the far future Universe,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.203
we're going to get a
bit more speculative,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.150
and I'll try and flash a
speculation metre as we go.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.230
But nearby times, pretty good.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.470
Distant times, things are going
to get a little more ropy.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.611
So what's the first thing
that's going to happen?

00:21:25.969 --> 00:21:27.278
So what we're going to do is
we're going to go forward.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:28.826
And we'll go forward
in steps, but the steps

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.293
will get bigger, because
the Universe will

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.383
have different epochs
where things are important

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.623
and they tend to be spaced out
at larger and larger steps.

00:21:38.957 --> 00:21:39.990
All we're going to worry
about at the moment

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.856
are the next few billion years.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.956
So as was mentioned, Brexit
might be solved in that time

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.716
scale or it might not.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.880
But what's going to happen?

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.700
Well, the first thing that
we need to think about

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.666
is essentially the end
of our Milky Way galaxy.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:56.680
Now, again, look at
that lovely picture.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.653
In a few billion
years it will be gone.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.510
So what do I mean?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.100
Well, here's our
Milky Way galaxy.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.089
It's a spiral galaxy.

00:22:09.811 --> 00:22:10.562
There's a bulge in the middle.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:11.566
Stars going around the outside.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:12.833
Our Sun is one of those
stars going around outside.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.093
The Sun takes 250 million
years to do one orbit around

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.786
the centre of the Milky Way.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.420
The problem is the Milky Way
is not alone in the universe.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.196
It inhabits this
patch of the universe

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.136
with two other big galaxies.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.000
One of them is called
M33 or Triangulum.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.263
It's a tenth the mass
of the Milky Way.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.170
We don't care.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.813
The other one,
M31, is Andromeda,

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.430
which is about the same
size as the Milky Way.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.063
And Andromeda is approaching
us at half a million kilometres

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.386
per hour, which, if we
do the maths quickly,

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.940
which says in about 4 billion
years it will be here.

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:50.405
So what's going to happen is
that Andromeda and the Milky

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.086
Way are going to collide.

00:22:53.699 --> 00:22:54.858
So you saw there, that
was the initial collision.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.103
Stars started to get ripped off.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:01.310
So gravity pulls the stars,
starts to fling them outwards.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.393
Now, the Sun might be
one of those stars that

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.560
ends up being thrown out
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:23:07.694 --> 00:23:08.478
So the collision
is just starting.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.068
Now, before I proceed,
I should point out

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:11.472
I've got a little
time scale up there,

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.896
and I've tried to use words
to describe the times.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.470
So a billion years,
that makes sense.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:18.980
We all know what a billion is.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.266
We all know what the national
debt is, et cetera, et cetera

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.060
et cetera.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.446
So we can understand trillions.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.393
But we're going to have
to go to bigger numbers.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.406
So there's scientific notation.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.683
5 times 10 to the 9 years.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.800
All that means is 5
followed by nine zeros.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.633
That's 5 billion.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.466
So you will see numbers
to the power of something.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.133
Just add that many zeros
on to the end, and just

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.596
say, wow, that's a lot of time.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.224
So we had this
initial collision.

00:23:48.309 --> 00:23:49.468
So if you saw on that
collision, the two galaxies

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.300
approached each other,
some stars got thrown off,

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.200
but then they separated.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:54.616
So it's going to get
kind of exciting.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.570
Why?

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:58.570


00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.216
Because in the collision, the
Milky Way galaxy gets shaken.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.573
It gets vigorously shaken by the
Andromeda Galaxy coming close.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.783
And what that shaking
does is it causes

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.076
gas clouds inside the
Milky Way to collapse.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.296
Now, that gas is the stuff
that gives you lots of stars.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.476
But if you shake it and make it
all collapse at the same time,

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.503
then what happens is you produce
lots of very massive stars,

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.933
very giant stars.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.986
So massive stars are hot.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.450
They glow blue.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:32.459
And so for a little
while our Universe,

00:24:34.094 --> 00:24:35.028
our local patch of
the Universe is going

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.230
to look like a Christmas tree.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:37.713
Our sky will be
completely filled

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.533
with these hot blue
stars glowing away.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.373
But the collision isn't over.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.363
Gravity started doing its thing.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.366
Galaxies will come
back together and they

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:47.496
will smack each other again.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.300
And notice that as they smack,
they get closer and closer.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.683
They're losing energy because
stars are being thrown out.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.610
But they are now
merging together.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.083
The other thing that happens
is that some of that gas,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.400
instead of getting
turned into stars,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.873
swirls down into the centre
of the resultant galaxy

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.006
that's formed from the Milky
Way merging with Andromeda.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.373
I'm going to have
apologise in advance.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.920
This object is
known as Milkomeda.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.366
I hate the name with a passion.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.593
I have to use it.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.320
Sorry.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:18.833
It's part of my
union card, I think.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.606
So there's going to be a
big black hole in the centre

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:24.893
of this remnant galaxy.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.900
Gas is going to go and fall
in towards that black hole.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.793
And that gas, as
it falls in, starts

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.203
to swirl around and crash
into other bits of gas

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.783
and get very hot.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.400
So the centre of this Milkomeda
or Milkdromeda galaxy will

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.370
start to glow.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.553
It will glow very,
very brightly.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.216
So we will not only
have this Christmas tree

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.593
of bright blue stars
across the sky.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.026
We will also have this
very active region

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.140
around the black hole glowing
brightly and shooting out

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:55.760
matter.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:55.856
Here you can see there's a
big jet of matter coming out.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.776
So that's all very exciting.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.733
So that would be nice to see.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.808
I'd like to hang around
for a few billion years

00:26:03.658 --> 00:26:05.124
to see this collision.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.216
But there's a problem.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.026
And the problem is
that it's all going

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.960
to be over way too quickly.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.893
What do I mean by that?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.113
Well, the massive stars that
we have in the Milky Way,

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.953
they are James Dean stars.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.463
Some people know
who James Dean was?

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.530
Live fast, die young.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.750
Amy Whitehouse.

00:26:26.772 --> 00:26:28.180
Other than that, my cultural
references are out the window,

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.690
I'm afraid.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.103
So giant stars live
fast, die young.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.180
So they burn for
10 million years,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:35.663
and then, bang, they're gone.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.130
So that Christmas tree
effect will go away.

00:26:40.842 --> 00:26:42.250
Similarly, that gas which is
swishing around in the middle,

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:43.883
well, that eventually gets
eaten up by the black hole.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.116
So the active galaxy, the part
which glows really brightly,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.530
that goes away.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.083
And what we're left with is--

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.103
the rest of the crash
is really boring.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:58.376
The two beautiful spiral
galaxies, Andromeda

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:01.913
and the Milky Way, which
were there at the start

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.000
are now completely gone.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:05.483
We are left with
this amorphous blob

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.776
with a rather horrible name.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.346
So that's kind of sad.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.553
One of the nice things
about being an astronomer

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.603
is looking up at the sky
and seeing that structure

00:27:17.503 --> 00:27:18.636
of the Milky Way.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.373
In this future galaxy
after the collision,

00:27:23.005 --> 00:27:23.693
either we will be
inside and we'll just

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:24.953
have a uniform spread of
stars all over the sky,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.413
or we'll be outside
from being spat out

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.686
and we're looking back
at an amorphous blob.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.850


00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:36.473
But there's more
things to worry about.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:38.996
So now we've moved on.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.070
We're now getting to roughly 7
billion years into the future.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.754
As I mentioned, these
galaxies collide,

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:47.418
but one thing is
kind of interesting,

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.100
is that stars are actually
very small compared

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.196
to the separation between them.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:53.260
So you're going to take
200 billion stars, 200

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.406
billion stars,
smash them together,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.393
and not one star will
collide with another star.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.736
So our Sun will
survive the collision.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.840
The Sun will sail past
all the other stars.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.123
I said it might end up
somewhere interesting,

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.290
and it might end up
somewhere not so interesting.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.426
But we're now getting towards 7
billion years into the future.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.490


00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.240
The problem is that the sun is
currently 5 billion years old.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.720
It was formed 5
billion years ago.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:27.700
And what I mean by the
Sun is 5 billion years,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.533
I mean for 5 billion years the
Sun has been turning hydrogen

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.586
into helium at the
core of the Sun.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:36.646
And we know how much
hydrogen there is in the Sun,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.200
and so we can estimate
how long the Sun has

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.580
got until it exhausts all of
its hydrogen. And it's roughly 5

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.046
to 6 billion years.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.850
So while the Sun might
survive this collision,

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.290
it's going to run out
of its hydrogen fuel.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:57.836
Now that's, I've said,
the death of the Sun.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:00.956
It's not quite the death.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.850
The Sun doesn't die
nice and quietly.

00:29:04.384 --> 00:29:05.168
When the sun runs
out of hydrogen,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:05.886
it sort of rearranges
its internal pieces

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:08.800
and tries to start burning
helium into heavier

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.893
elements rather than hydrogen.
That causes the sun to swell.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.263
It swells and cools.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.850
So it goes from being
a typical yellow star

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:22.483
into being a red giant.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:23.830
But it continues to swell
and swell and swell.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:25.976
It eats Mercury.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.050
It eats Venus.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.630
It gets brighter and brighter.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.296
And by this point, the
energy flow from the sun

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.210
strips the atmosphere off the
Earth, boils away the ocean,

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.821
and completely
sterilises the surface.

00:29:39.405 --> 00:29:40.405


00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.226
This is reasonably unavoidable.

00:29:44.524 --> 00:29:45.758
This is what's going to
happen when the Sun runs out

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.690
of hydrogen.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:51.536
So, eventually, we're
not quite sure how big

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.530
the Sun is going to get.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.246
There are some that think
that the Sun is actually

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.386
going to get larger than
the orbit of the Earth

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.663
and completely
swallow the Earth,

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.216
so the Earth will be completely
and utterly obliterated.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:06.196
And the Sun might even swell
out towards the orbit of Mars.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:06.666
After that point,
the Sun then goes

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.993
through a rather sort of
middle age crisis, whereby

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.166
it sort of shrinks
and grows, and shrinks

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.370
and-- we all know what happens
when you get to middle age,

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.210
right?

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.480
Shrinks and grows.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.396
And then, eventually, the Sun
becomes unstable and it blows

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.646
off its outer layers
and the Sun is gone.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.520


00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.706
Now, if this is the only
planet in the Universe

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.063
where there is life and
we haven't gotten off

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:30.550
the surface by then,
then that's the end

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.390
of life in the Universe.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.730
The Earth will not survive.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.166
Now, there's 7
billion years to go,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.193
so we sort of hope,
on that time scale,

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.363
that we can put our
differences between us

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.813
and work together
and think maybe it

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.273
would be a good idea
to get off the planet

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.090
before the Sun
completely evaporates it.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.313
It may take a few
billion years of arguing

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.266
to get to that point, but
this is going to be necessary.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.553
If life is going to continue,
it cannot hang around a single

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:06.270
star, because stars just
don't live for long enough.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.313
Life is going to have to move
from one star to the other.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.093
And so what we're going to have,
hopefully, fingers crossed,

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.426
is that life will--

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.490
humans or descendants of humans,
or maybe the cockroaches,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.796
will develop
technology that allows

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.410
them to travel to other stars.

00:31:24.627 --> 00:31:25.510
That's the only way
that life is going

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.586
to be able to protect itself
as the universe evolves.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.300
Now, the technology required
for travelling to stars is hard.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.410
We know we can't do
it at the moment.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.147
We just do not have
the technology.

00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:40.118
But, as I said, there's
a lot of time between now

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.786
and a few billion years, so
hopefully that kind of thing

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.013
can be developed.

00:31:45.474 --> 00:31:46.258
But you might sort
of think, well,

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:47.713
if I'm going to travel
between the individual stars

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.000
in our own Milky Way galaxy,
then how about I go large?

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:54.903
How about, instead of just
roaming the stars around here,

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.163
I think of jumping
between galaxies?

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.210
So I've got billions of
galaxies in the Universe.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.903
They're quite a
large distance away,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:06.653
but, again, as
technology evolves

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.150
it might become possible that
we could travel from one galaxy

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.676
to the next galaxy.

00:32:13.689 --> 00:32:14.548
And the more life
spreads, of course,

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.876
the more chance it
has of surviving

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.516
into the future Universe.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:20.900
The big problem is that,
if you're going to do that,

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.346
you better start
relatively nowish.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.380
Why?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.133
Well, because it's not
going to be possible when

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:30.576
we get up to the next steps.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.456
So now we're out to
about 100 billion years.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.680
Why is that?

00:32:35.934 --> 00:32:36.718
Well, as I mentioned
at the start,

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.006
what we've realised is that
our Universe today is dominated

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.540
by this strange stuff that we
don't really know what it is

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.646
called dark energy.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:47.866
We know it exists because we see
the expansion of the Universe

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:50.441
accelerating.

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:51.918
So something is there
that's causing the Universe

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.466
to do that, but we
don't know what it is.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.093
But it's dominating.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.213
70% of all energy
in the universe

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.040
appears to be in
this dark energy.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.960
And as time goes on that
percentage increases,

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.730
until very close to--

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.666
not too far into the future it's
going to be effectively 100%.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.280
What that does is drive the
expansion faster and faster

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.783
and faster, which means that
distant objects move away

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.123
from us faster and faster.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.916
Until eventually they're moving
so fast that any light signals

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.216
that they try to send
us never reach here

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:25.993
because the Universe
is expanding

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.113
so quickly in between the
distant object and us.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:31.700
And that means that,
basically, by the time

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.093
we get to roughly
100 billion years,

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:40.486
then what's going to happen
is that our distant Universe

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.493
is going to start
to fade from view.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.263
So, firstly, the most
distant galaxies we see

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:50.363
will basically freeze and
then become invisible,

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.360
and then the more
nearby galaxies,

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.266
until at 100 billion years,
the only thing we can see

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.516
are stars near us in
our leftover galaxy.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:03.713
Everything else is now
accelerating away from us

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.560
so fast that we will
never see it again.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.936
So any species or
civilization that

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.326
arises in this time
in the Universe

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:16.364
will never come
to the conclusion

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.935
that we live in an
expanding universe.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:20.448
Why?

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.813
Well, they'll take
their telescopes,

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.170
they'll look at the sky and
they'll say what do we see?

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.566
Oh, we just see stars
in the nearby universe

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.946
and everything else
is inky blackness.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:28.937
No evidence that
there's expansion.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:33.262
There will be no
future Edwin Hubble

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:33.990
who measures the
redshift of galaxies

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.676
because there will be
no galaxies to see.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.853
That also means that
life, then, is isolated.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.290
It's now stuck here on
this galaxy, Milkomeda,

00:34:48.662 --> 00:34:49.470
or any other
galaxies, but now they

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.013
are separated that
they will never ever

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.360
have contact ever again.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:54.450
So life is going to have to
deal with what's going on here

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:58.320
if it's going to
survive into the longer

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.566
distant future of the Universe.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.310
So what's next?

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:05.076
So we're going to now
take another big jump.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.663
We're going to move
from 100 billion years

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.003
out to roughly 10
trillion years.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:14.573
So the Universe
sits there evolving.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.253
What we're going
to see now is we're

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.053
going to see that remnant galaxy
of the Milky Way and Andromeda

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320
as they merged.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:26.130
And, as I said, when
they merge, they

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.570
create lots of hot
blue stars that

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:29.536
live for a very short
time before exploding.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.196
So all the blue stars
live for 10 million years

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.316
and then explode,
and they're gone.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.186
Then stars like our Sun
reach the end of their lives.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:43.866
So they too are getting
older and older and they die.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.343
Now, unlike the Milky
Way, which has lots of gas

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.523
and can produce new stars,
this leftover object,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.443
that used up all its
gas in that one burst

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.803
during the interaction.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.323
So there's no new stars born.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:00.826
And all you have is
this continuous death

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.906
of stars as they get
older and older and older.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:06.390
And, in fact, an interesting
relationship with stars

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:12.676
is that the bigger the
star, the shorter it lives.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:15.950
So the big stars live
for a few million years.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.640
Stars the size of the Sun
live for a few billion years.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.036
And tiny stars, these
little red dwarf

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.850
stars, they live for
trillions of years.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.693
So what we're going to have is
the stars continuously dying,

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.836
and our patch of the
Universe is going

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.436
to become redder and redder,
as these little faint

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.316
red dwarf stars are
the only things left.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:40.910


00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:43.043
They too, of course,
will be getting older

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.123
and the galaxy will
continuously fade over time.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.523
Now, you might say, well, OK.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.580
This object that collided,
it produced many hundreds

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.393
of billions of stars
all moving around.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.443
You've still got lots
of these red dwarfs.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.943
You think, oh, that's
not so bad for life.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.186
But red dwarfs are
not friendly stars.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.560


00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.336
What we've come to realise
quite recently is that red dwarf

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:11.813
stars, even though they look
nice, and quiet, and sedate,

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.033
are actually quite
violent and active places.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.426
These stars, instead of just
sitting there and nicely

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:22.920
putting our energy over
their trillions of years,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.440
what they do is they often
have big solar flares.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:29.439
They have big bursts of energy.

00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:32.360
And it's thought that
those bursts of energy

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.693
continuously sterilise
any planets that

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.813
are orbiting that star.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.556
So it's going to be
very hard for life

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:44.936
to evolve afresh on planets
orbiting red dwarf stars.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.530
But if life has
survived from our period

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.103
into this distant
part of the Universe,

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:56.176
they're going to have to
rely on the energy that's

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:00.183
generated by these red dwarf
stars to keep them going.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.390
Now, as I mentioned,
these stars are small.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:03.273
These stars are
faint, and so they

00:38:05.347 --> 00:38:06.230
don't put out a lot
of energy compared

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.463
to a star like the Sun.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:09.810
So any life in the future
part of the Universe

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:11.866
is going to have to
work very hard to become

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.540
very efficient at collecting
energy and using that energy.

00:38:18.164 --> 00:38:19.098
And there's been a
number of suggestions

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.060
on what you would do.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.380
I'll just put up this picture
because I think it's pretty.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.953
This is a Dyson sphere.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.130
Now, a Dyson sphere
is a simple idea.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.373
You have a future
civilization that can

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.734
do lots of difficult things.

00:38:32.412 --> 00:38:33.220
We won't talk about
how they do it.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:34.113
We'll just pretend
that they can.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.460
And they find a
star and they want

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.296
to be very efficient in
using the energy of the star,

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:40.360
so instead of
sitting on a planet,

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.486
you build a big sort of
enclosure around the star.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:45.820
That way, you capture
all of the starlight.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:48.886
You can use that starlight
to run your life,

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.460
and you can expend waste
heat out into the universe.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:56.876
So that's essentially what
you would probably want

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:58.099
to do with a red dwarf star.

00:38:59.707 --> 00:39:00.357
You have a red dwarf star.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.520
It's got a very little
amount of energy,

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.860
but if you can try and
capture all of that energy

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:06.200
in one of these
Dyson spheres then

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.246
maybe you can continue to
power life into the future.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.830
The next thing that
you might need to do

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.030
is possibly a
little more radical.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.640
And the big problem is that
this is highly inefficient.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.760
I don't mean just me.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.303
I mean all of us.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.613
Human living biological
life is highly inefficient.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.210
Given the thought processes
that we generate--

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.523
all the energy we
need to take in

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:42.263
and all of the various things
we need to do to keep us alive

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.406
is wasteful in terms of energy.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.920
So energy is now becoming the
rare commodity in the Universe,

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.060
and you might
decide, essentially,

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.210
that you may want to do away
with biological forms of life

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.986
and move into a more efficient
form of life, which effectively

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.220
is a computational
electronic form of life.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.416
Now, of course, there's a few
problems with all of that.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:07.413
Number one, we don't know
what consciousness is,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.893
so how you could take
consciousness and plunk

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.746
on a computer and say there
I am is an unsolved problem.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:16.256
But people think that
this is a possibility.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.426
Once computers get smart
enough and fast enough

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.913
that maybe you could have the
equivalent of consciousness

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440
on a computer.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.870
And that consciousness,
compared to the amount

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:30.656
of energy we need
to keep going, would

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.510
be highly energy efficient.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.336
You would need a lot less energy
to run a computer with you

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.283
on it rather than having you.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.186
So there might be a move away
from the actual physical life

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.233
into more electronic life.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.940


00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.126
This is a realm loved
by philosophers.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.956
They love talking
about this stuff.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.176
They point that, if this is
the case, that in the future

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.250
we move on to an electronic
form of life which

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.406
is much more energy
efficient, then

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.873
it would be very
easy to generate

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.483
a huge number of individual
conscious life forms

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.373
on your computer,
because they're

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.926
so cheap compared to having
biological life forms.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.206
And they say that, over the
entire history of the Universe,

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.096
then the most numerous
life form might

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.863
be computational life
somewhere near the time

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.033
we're talking about here where
the Universe is now dominated

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.566
by red dwarfs, and
that we effectively

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.466
are just at the start of life
and most life is yet to come.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.856
And then people
counter and say, well,

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.486
maybe we are the
computational life

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.760
running on a computer
around a red dwarf star.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:49.223
Which makes me think that if
this is a synthetic reality,

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.476
what must real reality be like?

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:55.910
Let's not worry about
that too much now.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.513
Anyway, so life will have to
do something kind of radical

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.556
if it's going to be able
to efficiently use energy

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.256
and survive into the future.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.280
But, again, there's a problem.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.320
We're going to go on a factor
of 10 out 10 trillion years.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:12.630
And there will come
a time when there

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.630
will be the last star in
the observable universe.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.876
There will be one star left.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:22.613
And that one star, once it gets
to around 100 trillion years

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.846
old, it will run out
of hydrogen in its core

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.946
and it will again
go through this sort

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:36.123
of like internal sort of ridge
again and try to burn helium.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.923
But these stars are small.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.630
So they settle down
for a very brief period

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.223
and they become
a blue dwarf star

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.256
for a very, very short period
of time, until, after a century,

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:49.556
they just go, oh, this
is too hard and give up.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.233
So the nuclear reactions that
power the star basically stop.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.346
And what happens
then is that the star

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:58.313
shrinks because gravity wins.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.346
There's no radiation
pushing outwards.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:01.740
So the star shrinks
down and down and down,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.300
and what you're left
with is a white dwarf.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.833
And a white dwarf
is a dead star.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.136
It's not generating new energy.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.250
All it does is sit
there and cool.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.636
So it cool through from
white, through visible,

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:18.990
into the infrared,
into the radio,

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.943
and then effectively disappears.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:24.470
So what we've got is that
we will get to a period

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:30.403
where our Universe will just
have these dead hearts of stars

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:31.786
floating around.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:32.896
And there will be
billions of them,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.143
but there will be
no more starlight.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.490
The only energy that we get will
be from these dead star hearts.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:41.910


00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.353
Life is going to struggle.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.806
Even a Dyson sphere
around a dead star

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:48.433
is going to pick up
very little energy.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.673
And here we run into realms
of rampant speculation.

00:43:55.904 --> 00:43:56.988
If you're going to have
life in this Universe,

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.656
it's going to have to seek out
energy wherever it can find it.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:01.283
And maybe instead of
having life concentrated

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:04.076
into a single Dyson
sphere, you spread it

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.890
out into something that
looks like a cloud.

00:44:09.159 --> 00:44:10.168
Now, this is actually
an interstellar cloud

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:11.476
in our own Milky Way.

00:44:11.824 --> 00:44:11.891
This is not a depiction of a
cloud of life in the future.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:15.823
But this is an idea
people have had,

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:18.250
is that maybe life is
distributed and grabs

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:23.530
bits of energy where it can and
it uses that to power itself.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.000
And it's not a new idea.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.750
There's a book by Fred Hoyle--

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:31.126
who is one of the
greatest astronomers

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.089
of the last century,
a British astronomer--

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:37.604
called The Black Cloud, where
he had this idea that these

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:41.430
clouds of interstellar gas,
they could be thinking beings.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:45.323
They have very slow
processes where they somehow

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:45.570
send information back and
forth, and they power themselves

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:49.020
in our time by going close
to stars, which is how

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:52.866
the problems start in the book.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:53.810
This black cloud comes to our
Sun to get some more energy.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.070
But it might be
that in the future

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.250
our life could be
spread out and grab

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:02.103
all the little bits
of energy spread

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.103
around and continue
to drive itself.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.606
So maybe that's it.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.863
We get to a point now where
all our stars are dead.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.923
What's left for the Universe?

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.393
Well, now we have to worry about
something kind of fundamental,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.366
and that's the
stability of matter.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040
This table seems pretty solid.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.153
I think we would all be rather
amazed if this table suddenly

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.220
evaporated into nothingness
in front of our eyes.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.280
We think of matter as being
a solid, long-lived object.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.746
Now, we know that matter
isn't purely stable

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:40.486
because we have radioactivity
and you can have one element

00:45:41.774 --> 00:45:42.474
change into another element.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.540
So uranium can decay
into other elements

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.533
through radioactive decay.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.170
But what if the bits
that make up atoms,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.476
are they stable on
very long time scales?

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:55.885
So what we're going to
do now is we're going

00:45:56.685 --> 00:45:56.933
to take a really big jump.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.570
So here we are at
100 trillion years.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.426
We're going to jump out to
100 nonillion years, which

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.200
apparently is a word.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.340
So we're jumping out
to 10 to the 32 years.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.481
And what we're going to
do is think about an atom.

00:46:12.145 --> 00:46:13.053
So what we're going
to do is we're just

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.143
going to zoom in on
a single atom here.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:16.850
So everyone remembers
their high school chemistry

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.143
and high school physics, yes?

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.266
That was not very enthusiastic.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.346
Anyway, let's try and recap.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.986
What we've got in an
atom, we have electrons

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:30.603
moving around the outside.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:31.533
So we have clouds of
electrons zipping around

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.793
at very high speeds.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.793
Electrons are tiny things.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.073
They weigh almost nothing.

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:40.028
But if we keep going
down deeper and deeper

00:46:40.952 --> 00:46:42.210
and deeper and deeper into
the heart of an atom, what

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.826
we eventually find is
the atomic nucleus.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.753
Now, the scales
here are incredible.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.890
The scale of an atom to
the scale of a nucleus

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.473
is the same as the
scale of a cathedral

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:57.136
to the scale of a fly.

00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:59.226
That's how big the nucleus
of each of your atoms are.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.780
And the rest of your
atoms are empty space.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.626
So most of you is
just empty space.

00:47:06.875 --> 00:47:10.008
Your mass is in all of
the nuclei in your atoms.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.046
When we look at an
atom, we see that it's

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.440
made up of a few particles.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:18.043
We have two of them.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.046
We have the neutron,
coloured blue,

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.233
so named because it's neutral,
and the proton, coloured red,

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:25.876
which carries a positive charge.

00:47:27.137 --> 00:47:28.320
And it's the protons and
the electrons interacting

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.153
which hold the atom together.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:32.596
What holds the nucleus
together is that yellow stuff.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.530
That's the strong force.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.293
And so the strong force holds
all those protons in this very

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.133
tight bundle at the
centre of the atom.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.880
Now, if I take a neutron and I
put it to the side and I wait,

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.873
after about 15 minutes
the neutron decays.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:52.190
The neutron will turn into
a proton, an electron,

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.700
and a neutrino.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.033
So it will decay.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.728
And it can do that through
Einstein's E equals m

00:47:58.605 --> 00:47:59.605
c squared.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.233
Neutrons are more
massive than protons,

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:02.700
so there's enough energy
there for the neutron

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.053
to turn into the proton
plus a few other things.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.573
Now, if we take a proton
and put it to the side,

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:11.648
protons have less mass.

00:48:13.165 --> 00:48:14.073
And if we do the
calculations and worry

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.973
about quantum
mechanics, it looks

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.080
like protons should be stable.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.866
If I put a proton there it
should stay there forever.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:22.360
Except, again, there's
a problem with that.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:24.766
And the problem is that there
is matter in the universe.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:28.216
Why is that a problem?

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:29.750
Well, when we use
our laws of physics

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.353
to predict the early Universe,
when the Universe was born

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.673
there should have
been equal amounts

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.006
of matter and antimatter.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.063
As the Universe cooled down,
the matter and antimatter

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.510
annihilate, leaving no
matter in the Universe today.

00:48:44.082 --> 00:48:44.214
Yet when I look around this
room, I see lots of matter.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:48.526
When I look through a
telescope I see lots of matter.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.173
I don't see a lot of antimatter.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.110
So something happened
in the early Universe

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.566
which meant there was more
matter than antimatter.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:57.700
And so what we
think is that there

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.153
was an additional force, one
that we don't quite understand,

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.620
that sort of treated matter
different to antimatter,

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.860
which made more matter in
the Universe than antimatter.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.546
That's all well and good.

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.780
The big thing is that if
that force still exists,

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:13.986
then it has a consequence,
and that consequence

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.360
is that protons should
eventually decay.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.326
And we've tried to
look for proton decay.

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:23.656
And we don't look at
it by taking one proton

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.113
and looking because that
would take a long time.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.450
You take lots of protons
and you stare at them

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.046
and you look for any
of them decaying.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:30.800
We haven't seen it
yet, but it's thought

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.640
that on this time scale
of 10 to the 32 years,

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.706
protons will decay.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.066
I'll just give you a
little illustration.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.993
So this is what a
proton looks like.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:40.083
It's not a fundamental particle.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.836
It's got quarks
buzzing around inside.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.586
But after around 10 to the
32 years, two of those quarks

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.800
will interact via
this unknown force.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.326
So we have to wait a long time.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:53.133
Eventually, this force kicks in.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.373
Two of the quarks will interact.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:56.853
The proton then
goes into a state

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:58.470
that it's never been in
before, and it decays.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:01.706
It decays into two photons,
which fly off in one direction,

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.300
and a positron, which
flies off in another.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.786
What that means is that, on
this time scale of 10 to the 32

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.300
years, matter will melt.
All of the atoms in here

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.490
will just steadily
disintegrate away.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.143
So if I waited long enough,
this desk would evaporate.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:26.063
I'd have to wait
10 to the 32 years.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.533
And that's quite a long
time, but that's ultimately

00:50:29.814 --> 00:50:30.598
the fate of what's
going to happen

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.230
to the matter in the Universe.

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:37.043
Now, life could try and
grab onto that energy

00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:38.000
and continue going,
but things are now

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.433
starting to get
difficult. You can pick up

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:41.950
these teeny bits
of energy and you

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:43.550
can use it to drive your life.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:46.699
But then you realise that your
own protons are also decaying,

00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:49.275
so then you've got to come up
with a way to make new protons

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:50.586
because they will
last a long time.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:52.833
But to make new protons
you need more energy.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.176
So where do you get the energy?

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.330
So there's one source left.

00:50:58.429 --> 00:50:59.438
We haven't really
mentioned them very much,

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.753
but that's black holes.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.793
I mentioned that there was a
big black hole at the centre

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:05.733
of the Milky Way, and that other
black holes are formed when

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:08.200
stars die.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.596
So you create these black holes,
these completely collapsed

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.750
massive objects,
down into points.

00:51:13.887 --> 00:51:14.920
They've got very strong
gravitational fields

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.320
and so you can extract
energy from them.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.723
You could drop things into them.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:21.010
Think about it this way.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:22.383
If you've got a black hole,
I've got a fishing rod.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:25.623
I've got a rock on the
end a fishing line.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:27.103
I drop that rock in.

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:28.690
In it falls.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:29.476
The spindle spins around.

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:30.423
I could extract that
energy and run the TV

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:33.120
and watch the cricket,
or something like that.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.126
But there are lots of
ways of extracting energy

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.753
from black holes.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:39.666
And they will still
be there in the dark,

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.843
so you might be able to
come up with a method

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.676
to use that extra energy
to keep life going.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.110
Except, of course,
there's a problem.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.033
And the problem is the
ghost of Stephen Hawking.

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:55.300
Why?

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.473
Well, what's Stephen
Hawking famous for in terms

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:59.073
of his scientific work?

00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.756
He's famous for
looking at black holes

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.236
and linking black holes
with quantum mechanics.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.395
And what he showed is that
black holes aren't really black.

00:52:08.031 --> 00:52:09.015
If you take quantum
mechanics into account

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:10.066
at the edge of the
black hole, they

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.360
emit teeny bits of
energy, tiny amounts.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.646
But, over time, that
energy which is emitted

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.263
takes away some of the mass from
the central of the black hole.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.803
Now, over immense time
scales, 10 to the 100 years,

00:52:28.629 --> 00:52:30.088
a big black hole, like the one
in the centre of the Milky Way

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:34.903
galaxy, will start to lose
enough energy that it actually

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.040
starts to shrink very rapidly.

00:52:38.419 --> 00:52:39.278
And what you get is
that, if you have

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:40.143
black holes in
the Universe, they

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.643
undergo what's known
as Hawking radiation.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.910
As they shrink they
emit more energy.

00:52:48.214 --> 00:52:49.448
And as they emit more energy,
they shrink even more.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.780
So they get this runaway
feedback, which essentially

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.276
drives them down to a
point, and then they explode

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:00.403
and all of their final mass
is released in a burst.

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:01.436
And this will happen
to all the black holes.

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:05.850
All the black holes will
be emitting this Hawking

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:06.530
radiation.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.156
So there will be these
continuous random bursts

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:11.943
of energy in the Universe.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.200
Now, if you are a
creature and you

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.953
are living in this distant
part of the Universe,

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.593
maybe you can harness this
energy as black holes wink out

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:23.780
of existence.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.026
But I think it's going to
be very, very hard work,

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:29.450
very, very hard work.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.506
And, effectively,
what you're doing is

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.953
you're only putting
off the inevitable.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:35.870
Because once these black
holes have evaporated

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.623
and they're gone, once
all the stars are dead

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.060
and their stellar
hearts have dissolved,

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.986
there is nothing left.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.243
There's no matter in
the form of stars.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:50.190
There's only electrons and
positrons buzzing around.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:56.043
There are no sources of energy,
only this soup of photons

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:56.430
bubbling through the Universe.

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.763
So the Universe reaches this
rather lovely named state

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.720
known as the heat
death of the Universe.

00:54:05.286 --> 00:54:06.645
And what that means is we've
got to a point where there's

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.726
no usable energy left for life.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:11.563
This is probably it.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.670
This is probably
as far as life is

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.680
going to be able to push
it into the Universe.

00:54:18.733 --> 00:54:21.999
Now, we don't want to
finish on a sad note, do we?

00:54:24.502 --> 00:54:27.435
We have also entered
the realm of speculation

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:28.100
and speculative physics.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.280
So let's be speculative on
the positive side, shall we?

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:33.696
We can't really be positive
about life in this Universe,

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:40.350
but we can be positive
about the Universe itself.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.580
And there are a lot of
ideas that if we really

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:47.763
stretch the age of the Universe
out 10 to the 2,000 plus years,

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:53.563
that the Universe might actually
manage to change its spots.

00:54:53.752 --> 00:54:55.010
I mentioned there's this
dark energy of the Universe,

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.493
that this material is there
and this energy associated

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.340
with space.

00:55:01.724 --> 00:55:02.808
There are lots of ideas
that that energy might

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.573
be able to decay and go
from one energy state

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:08.963
down to another energy state.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.413
And if it does that, then
that release of energy

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:16.556
as the Universe essentially
changes its energy state,

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.240
will give a new burst to the
expansion of the Universe.

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:26.963
So it will be like when you
open a bottle of fizzy water,

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:28.893
you get all these sites where
the bubbles form nucleation

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:32.275
sites.

00:55:32.885 --> 00:55:34.093
That's what they think will
happen to the Universe,

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.166
that in individual
places of the Universe

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.226
there will be this
change of energy

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:38.326
and you'll get these
rapidly expanding

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.900
patches of the Universe.

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.626
And these rapidly
expanding patches

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.866
would effectively
be new universes.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.180
Now, again,
speculation runs free.

00:55:50.531 --> 00:55:51.365
We don't know what
kind of universes

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:53.630
are going to be created.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.840
They might be universes
completely different to our own

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.593
in terms of the laws
of physics and how

00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:58.440
the universe is composed
of matter and radiation.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.800
Or they could be
just like our own

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:06.463
and the cycle could start again.

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:10.623
You could get matter forming
from this reborn universe

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:15.086
falling together, giving us
stars, the stars evolving

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.280
and giving us new burst of
life in whatever universe

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.913
follows this one.

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:24.643
Which is a reasonably
happy ending, isn't it?

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:25.373
Anyway, I'm going to finish
essentially with a quote from

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:28.306
one of my favourite authors.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.586
So this is Douglas Adams.

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:33.420
"There is a theory which states
that if ever anyone discovers

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.340
exactly what the Universe
is for and why it is here,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.370
it will instantly disappear and
be replaced by something even

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.896
more bizarre and inexplicable."

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:45.806
We may never actually answer the
deep philosophical questions,

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:47.756
but we may live in
a universe which

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:53.323
is replaced by something bizarre
and even more inexplicable.

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.133
But the line that really
got me when I read this

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.573
was the next one.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:56:58.903
"There is another theory that
this has already happened,"

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:04.756
and that this
universe itself could

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:09.076
have been born from the
death of a previous universe.

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:13.003
And we may have this endless
cycles of universes and life

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.380
going on from infinity in the
past to infinity in the future.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:19.633
So this almost sounds like
a Buddhist finish in there.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.100
But that was a
semi-positive note.

00:57:25.144 --> 00:57:25.928
I'll finish, though,
by putting up

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.466
a picture of what the Earth is
going to look like in roughly 7

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.063
billion years' time.

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.910
I'll finish there.

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.300
So thank you.

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:34.076
