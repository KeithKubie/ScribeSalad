00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.960
PAUL SMURL: Technology is
upending our entire industry

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.970
and has quickened in the
last few years-- shifting

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.620
the traditional media and
print-based organization to one

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.329
that is a global digital media
organization. "The New York

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.450
Times" is known for
the highest quality

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.550
journalism on the planet.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.190
We've been in business
for over 160 years.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.670
Folks who are using our
apps are more deeply

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.220
engaging with the content there.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.280
They're more likely to come
back frequently, go deeper,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.430
and ultimately
become subscribers.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.520
KATE HARRIS: We actually
debuted our Android app in 2010.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.870
So we were very early
to the platform.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.140
And since then, it's
just been about growth.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.410
And it's been-- over the
past two years-- explosive.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.810
To build a successful
Android product,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.740
it's essential to have a
team that really understands

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.980
the platform, that lives
the platform, that's

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.688
Android-obsessed.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.920
And we are very lucky to have
that at "The New York Times."

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.760
Android makes it
really easy to build

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.480
apps that are intuitive to use.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.730
It's also easy as an app
developer or publisher

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.480
to build apps that use our
own typography, to make

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.940
the app feel like
"The New York Times."

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.500
Before we integrated
Play Billing,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.330
our subscription process
took around two minutes.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.090
And we were asking
our users to fill out

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.560
a series of forms,
all on their phone.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.240
And now with Play Billing,
because the user has a credit

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.890
card or their Paypal information
associated with their account,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.900
the user can subscribe
to "The New York Times"

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.280
within two taps.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.720
Some of the tap features I
really like about Play Billing

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.310
was, one, we're able to
enable local currency

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.370
billing in over 50 countries.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.270
And, two, it was very
easy to add a free trial.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.680
With Play Billing,
we're able to realize

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.134
a 125% increase in
subscription conversion.

00:01:45.134 --> 00:01:46.300
PAUL SMURL: We did the math.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.720
We looked at whether
the upside, in terms

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630
of incremental subscriptions,
would more than

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.550
offset the 30% that
we pay to Google.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.530
And in fact, it does.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.990
Android is an incredibly
important platform for us.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.370
It's one of our fastest
growing platforms.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.810
We consider our investment
in Android an essential one.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.850
And in terms of our
international growth ambitions,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.220
Android for us has been a
table stakes investment.
