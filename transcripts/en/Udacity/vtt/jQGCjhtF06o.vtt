00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.499
And these are the numbers I get: minus 0.0881,

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.858
0.08662. And this is a wider confidence internval

00:00:07.858 --> 00:00:09.556
than before, that means we trigger less

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:12.242
frequently and we find less frequently problems with

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.410
our trading statistics.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.283
So letâ€™s now dive in on May 6, 2010, when the

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:20.168
Apple stock crashed and see if we could have

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:24.168
detected that crash and saved ourselves from risky trades.
