00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.990
PROFESSOR: In some ways, I won't
be able to compete with

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.610
live demonstrations of children
from last week.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.040
But I will try to talk about
adult development.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.760
And we will really sweep through
your minds and brains

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.890
from when you were not yet born
until you're going to be

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.590
in your '90s.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.540
So here's your life from the
beginning to the end viewed in

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.980
different ways.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.250
And we'll touch on a number
of different topics.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.930
So you know this question about
people have talked for a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.210
long time about the development
that one goes

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.349
throughout one's life.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.320
What walks on four legs in the
morning, two legs in the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.350
afternoon, three legs
in the evening?

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.030
You know the answer
to this, right?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.330
People.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.040
They're crawling, they're
standing up, and then

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.030
you get to my age.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.200
And we need an extra little
prop to move around

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.880
successfully.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
So sort of thinking about this,
that different things

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.460
matter to people at different
ages, that there's different

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.300
priorities, different
ways of thought.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.640
Erik Erickson is often given
credit for trying to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.170
articulate that.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230
And we'll just walk through
it for a moment.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.300
Where he said at different
ages, at infancy, early

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.990
childhood, through school,
adolescence, young adulthood,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.640
people are dealing with
different kinds of issues and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.010
different developmental tasks
in front of them.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.800
Your life is a constant
development.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.870
Not maybe as dramatic as infancy
where we saw last time

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.400
that children really see
the world differently.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.100
But there's different
challenges in front

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.690
of you at all ages.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.610
At infancy, you're deciding
who can you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.960
trust, who can you love.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.520
Is it a good world?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.860
And then the drama of potty
training, independence.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.510
How much are you becoming a
free agent in the world?

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.510
Early school, where you start
to interact with other

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.500
children, and play, and make
friendships, and think about

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.910
social groups.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.870
Later in schools, you're
becoming more advanced in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.460
terms of what you're learning in
school and more complex in

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.480
terms of the social networks
that you're developing.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.070
We'll come back to this at the
end, a period of high anxiety

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.130
and drama of adolescents.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.880
Then there's something about
young adulthood.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.750
You may have heard recently
people are speculating that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.380
what used to be the beginning of
young adulthood culturally,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.930
at least in the US, and maybe
Europe, and industrialized

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.350
parts of the world, that whereas
the '20s used to be

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.090
considered a decade of
adulthood, there are now

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.370
theories floating around or
impressions floating around

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.270
that '20s are the
new adolescence.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.710
What are you guys think?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.860
Everybody says, oh my '20s, I'm
going to discover this and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.550
discover that.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.390
But when I get to 30, that's
when we're playing for keeps.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.550
Is it?

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.435
Well, and part of it's because
you live longer, on average.

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:19.370
Or you count on living longer.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.110
And you do, on average,
live longer.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.160
For a person who's counting on
living to 90, which many of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.710
you are sort of, another decade
of finding your way,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.430
your 20s, seems reasonable.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.040
In a world where people didn't
live nearly as long, didn't

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.490
have as many options, by the
time you finished college--

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.510
or many people didn't go to
college-- it's roll up your

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.180
sleeves and get to adulthood.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.920
So there's all these sort of
magazine discussions, are the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.130
20s the new teens in terms of
whether people feel they have

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.900
responsibilities they have to
execute as a young adult.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.820
And this a little bit timed
also, a little bit

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.300
anachronistic, then
having a family.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.620
Although, I think we're much
more thinking about that's not

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.350
necessarily the root for
everybody at all.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.920
And then old age where
you give other

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.920
people lots of advice.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.600
So we're going to talk about
brain development from infancy

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.700
to young adulthood, cognitive
stability

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.079
and decline in adulthood.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.209
We've talked a little
bit about that.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.750
We'll talk a bit more.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.100
Alterations in hemispheric
specializations

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.290
that come with aging.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.520
A bunch of remarkable results
about exercise in the brain.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.300
All of us want as we get older,
or just even when

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.500
you're younger maybe, just
a pill you pop and

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.150
you're ready to go.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.290
That would be the best.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.120
It turns out there's remarkable
evidence about what

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.700
physical exercise does
for the brain.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.010
I'll share that with you--
especially in regards to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.840
aging, but at all ages--

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.190
ideas about how as you get
older, your social and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.900
emotional goals will tend to
change, a little bit about

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.630
rewards, and a little bit about
back to adolescence and

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.000
some thoughts about what's going
on in the adolescent

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.270
mind and brain.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.060
So we know if there's one thing
about the brain that's

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.490
stunning, and challenging to
grasp, and empowers us to be

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.790
humans, it's this complexity.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.650
There's a huge number of
neurons, fantastic number of

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.030
connections among the neurons.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.750
So there's just a phenomenal
complexity that all starts

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.470
with a single cell.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.720
And how does the brain
become this

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.100
dramatically complex organ?

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.580
And how does it organize in the
right way to let you be an

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.260
effective learner, an effective
partner in your

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.410
family, and so on?

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.120
So we start with the idea of
neurogenesis, a magical word,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.450
the neurons being born.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.960
And they have to make this
crawl, there's a huge path the

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.920
size of a neuron from the
ventricular surface, the

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.110
ventricle, the fluid-filled
space, to get to the place

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.040
you're going to be
in the brain.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.940
It's a huge adventure
per neuron.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.640
Cells dividing there, the
earliest neurons are existing

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.520
by the second embryonic week.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.190
So that's when you began
to produce your

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.340
neurons in your brain.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.600
By the seventh embryonic week--
so you're just two

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.820
months of pregnancy--

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.020
you're producing an estimated
500,000 neurons a minute.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.620
We said the neuron is kind of
like a moderate computer.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.840
Except unlike iPhones, it can't
keep track of where

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.090
you're going all the time.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.510
We said it's a moderate
computer.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.740
So 500,000 of those every
minute, I mean, staggering.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.495
That it all works out
is staggering.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.640
By the 18th week, you've mostly
made all the neurons

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.080
you're ever going to make for
the rest of your life except

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.490
in two brain regions.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.960
And there's been a big debate
in the last decade about

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.680
another brain region.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.910
I'll share those with you.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.290
But people have been taught for
many, many, many years in

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.090
medical school, and college, and
graduate school, that all

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.180
the neurons you get are
by the 18th week.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.030
So hang on to them
through healthy

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.340
living and wise behavior.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.910
Because you have what
you have, right?

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:52.660
So don't lose them.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.210
But we'll talk about that
you lose the vast

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.430
majority of them anyway.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.460
I still recommend
healthy living.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.890
Because you know, perhaps from
other courses, that the brain

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.600
does this wild thing.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.460
It excessively overproduces, by
massive scales, the number

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.370
of neurons and the connections
among the neurons.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.560
And then through use, it gets
rid of neurons and gets rid of

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.740
connections among neurons.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.350
It's exactly the opposite way
if you build a building.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.060
If you build a building,
what do you do?

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.820
You construct every bit of it
you need, and you're done.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.480
Well you don't do is say, I
need a two-story building.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.150
So I'm going to do a 40-story
building or a 90-story

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.310
building and then knock
off the stories

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.030
as they're not needed.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.180
You say, well, that's wild.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.620
Why would I do that?

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.030
But the brain brilliantly makes
many more neurons and

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.080
many more connections on epic
scales and then only uses the

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.280
ones that seem to be
useful for the

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.020
functions of the brain.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.680
And so for that reason, the
density of the neurons in the

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.360
brain is much higher in a
two-year-old than in you,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.470
where it was much higher when
you were two than it is now.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.220
So in a two-year-old, they
have 55% more gray matter

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.780
density in the frontal
lobe than an adult.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.690
Even at age five, even
at age seven,

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.380
they're 10% percent more.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.220
From a peak of around before
birth, you're constantly

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.300
shedding neurons and their
connections and keeping the

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.260
ones that seem to be
effective somehow.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.450
Now, for many years people said,
is there neurogenesis in

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.050
the adult brain?

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.070
Is everything you get before
you're born and

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.170
that's pretty much it?

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.730
And there's many reasons to
be interested in that.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.380
One is just how does
the brain work?

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.470
How do people work?

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.950
The second is for diseases
like Alzheimer's disease,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.880
Parkinson's disease,
and other diseases.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.110
We would love to replace neurons
that have died to help

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.940
people do better.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:50.570
So can the brain make new
neurons before birth?

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.230
There's compelling evidence in
animals, and some indirect

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.840
evidence in people too, that
neurogenesis does continue

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.980
into adulthood in the olfactory
bulb and in this

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.752
particular part-- and I'll come
back to this-- in the

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.940
hippocampus, a small part of
the hippocampus called the

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.730
dentate gyrus.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.955
Everybody's in pretty much
agreement on this for the

00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:10.590
moment, which is kind
of interesting.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.780
Why those two areas amongst all
the areas in the brain?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.640
What makes them different that
they can produce neurons all

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.140
throughout your life?

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.370
And then about a decade ago,
Elizabeth Gould at Princeton

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.520
said, oh, when I do the right
kind of experiment, I see new

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.232
neurons in the prefrontal cortex
of monkeys, and for

00:09:30.232 --> 00:09:31.320
human primates.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.250
That was a giant revolution.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.500
Because they said,
wait a minute.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.500
Maybe if monkeys are doing it,
people might be doing it,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.100
making neurons throughout
their life.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.950
We just did know that.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.150
It's not so easy to measure.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.980
If you think about it, the kind
of experiment to know for

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.440
certain if a human is making a
new neuron is not so easy.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.020
Because brain imaging
is very far from the

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.260
single neuron level.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.745
And even if we saw a neuron,
how could we tell it's new?

00:09:57.745 --> 00:10:01.090
And then Pasko Rakic, a big
developmental researcher at

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.360
Yale said, that what she
really saw was glia.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.300
The glia are the other cells in
the brain, not the neurons.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.460
They support the neurons.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.240
Everybody agrees that you make
glia all through your life.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.600
There's no debate about that.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.990
But glia are not the stuff
of thoughts and feelings.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.390
Neurons are.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.470
So what do we understand
about that whole story?

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.870
Here is an unbelievable
experiment, I think.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.040
It's really not an experiment.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.290
But it's a measurement.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.770
Published in 2006, it's one
approach to asking, do adults

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.570
make new neurons?

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.900
So the nuclear bomb tests that
occur during the Cold War sent

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.090
a carbon-14 into the atmosphere
from 1955 to 1963

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.380
until there was an international
test ban treaty.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.660
And then these decreased
and stopped.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.350
But there was a lot of nuclear
bomb testing in the

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.410
late '50s and '60s.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.380
That released carbon-14
into the atmosphere.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.530
And that integrates with DNA and
forms a date mark for the

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.600
cell of a birth.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.850
So this is not an experiment
we would want to do again,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.210
atmospheric nuclear testing,
and having nuclear stuff

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.810
floating around in
the atmosphere.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.340
I'll tell you the bottom line,
and I'll show you how they

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.820
figured this out.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.370
What they figured out is looking
at people who died a

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.170
few years ago, that

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.850
nonneuronal cells are generated.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.200
That was found before glial
cells are made throughout your

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.080
lifetime is the inference
from the finding.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.580
But neurons are not generated
in adult neocortex.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.140
The commentary in this article
said, no new neurons for you.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.110
OK, that's not quite true.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.570
We know these two little areas
in the brain do it but not in

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.720
most of the brain.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.060
And they also looked at
something called BrdU,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.070
B-R-D-U, which is another
way to take a

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.510
brain if you have it.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.700
It marks newly synthesized
DNA.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.030
So if you have the brain
directly to measure it, you

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.530
have a couple of measures of
newly synthesized DNA, which

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.090
would be the marker
of new neurons.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.670
So here's a fantastically
interesting thing.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.080
They took people who were born
in different times, took

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.580
postmortem samples, and measured
carbon-14 relative to

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.400
what was expected--

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.430
there's a line here-- it was
relative to what was expected

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.400
by the amount of carbon
in the atmosphere.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.580
And here's what they found.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.320
If they look for somebody born
after 1963, they have, in

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.820
their neurons, exactly the
amount that you would expect

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:22.350
if they made all their neurons
around here and the decrease

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.320
here didn't affect the
neurons at all.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.920
The glia are here, which is kind
of an average of here and

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.800
the rest of life.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.610
So if you measure the average
age of the glia, it was about

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.800
the average age of the life of
the person the carbon was

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.870
being picked up in the DNA,
because it's being made.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.400
It's being kept,
and being made.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.700
But the neurons all looked like
one value, the value that

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.500
has to do with when
you're born.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.980
So it's not changing the number
of neurons that are

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.770
showing the carbon-14.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.910
As if whatever you've got
at birth, that's it.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.450
On the other hand, here is
somebody born before 1963,

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.130
having essentially zero carbon
that's being showing up in

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.340
their neuronal DNA, and having
again the expected average

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.150
glial DNA as if glia
kept going.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.100
So this is fantastic.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.610
It's looking at the carbon-14
in the DNA of neurons and

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.620
glial of people who
have passed away.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.120
And saying the carbon-14 dating
looks like neurons.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.500
You get them all before
you're born.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.080
That's it.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.970
Glia, you keep making.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.830
And they can look at it more
directly by looking at this

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.260
thing that shows you recent
DNA, again, showing you

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.140
impressively that glia keep
making new glia with new DNA

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.170
but not new neurons.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.380
So the current conclusion in the
field, as far as anybody

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.860
can tell, is no new neurons for
you except in your dentate

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.780
gyrus and olfactory bulb.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.060
Now here's something
fantastic though.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.540
It appears that exercise--

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.980
I'll just show you one example
in animals and humans--

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.790
there's evidence that exercise
will pump up the number of new

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.060
neurons you make in the
dentate gyrus of the

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.330
hippocampus.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.290
And we know that the
hippocampus is

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.200
important for memory.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.850
So that's not a bad place
to make new neurons.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.340
So you know that going to
exercise will strengthen you

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.270
in various ways.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.490
But you never realized, unless
you follow this line of work,

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.890
that when you exercise, you're
enhancing the number of new

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.180
neurons that you're producing
in your dentate gyrus.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.700
So here's a couple ways people
have approached this.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.905
So one way is to measure
cerebral blood volume, how

00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:20.480
much blood is in the dentate.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.780
And I'm going to show you
evidence that mice that are

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.800
allowed to exercise push
up the blood volume.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.860
And that seems to go with
direct evidence of

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.430
neurogenesis.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.890
Because you can do that
in the animals.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.200
You can look up sacrificed
animals.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.010
And then in humans, some
indirect evidence that

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.970
exercise is, again, pushing
up the blood volume in the

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.590
dentate and pushing up a little
bit of memory abilities

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.010
that go with the part
of the brain.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.060
We can't go in and measure
neurons in the humans.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.210
So here are mice who exercise
or didn't exercise.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.980
They measured the
blood volume.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.350
Here in red is the dentate
part of the hippocampus.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.060
You can see it's the hottest
spot for blood volume.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.390
And it's the only part that
responds to exercise.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.780
So they had some mice
not get to exercise,

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.780
some mice get to exercise.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.150
The blood volume increases
within the hippocampus

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.050
selectively in a small component
of the hippocampus,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.040
the dentate gyrus.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.700
Exercise is pushing up
the blood volume.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.470
Now that's not direct evidence
about what's happening at the

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.460
cellular level.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.840
But they can sacrifice these
animals and show you that if

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.080
you look at this binding that
goes with new neurons, with

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.750
new DNA, that's pushed up
the exercise animals.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.160
Here's the statistics.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.980
Here's the picture.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.090
So in the animals, they can
correlate directly.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.070
More blood volume and more new
neurons going with more

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:41.960
physical exercise.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.690
In humans, they can measure
the blood volume.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.790
And so they had some people do
more exercise, some people

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.580
less exercise.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.870
Again, it was a dentate
gyrus selectively.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.930
It showed an increase in
blood volume in humans.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.280
And now they give them
a memory test.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.900
And it's not overwhelming.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.570
But at least in some cases, the
people who did exercising,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.230
who pushed up their blood
volume, also pushed up a

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.930
little bit their memory
performance.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.840
So in humans it has to be more
indirect, but all the data

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.370
aligned with the idea that
exercise is pushing up your

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.200
own neuronal genesis, the
creation of new neurons in one

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.700
of the two regions everybody
agrees we make new neurons,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.960
the dentate gyrus and
the hippocampus.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.350
But cells have to go incredible
distances at the

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.250
cellular size.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.800
Neurons have to travel to
the intended location.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.720
Migration occurs over many
months including eight months

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.650
postnatally.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.780
Here's this neuron following
it's little path to where it's

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.820
going to go.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.500
There's glial tracks following
molecular cues as to their

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.920
ultimate target location
to get organized.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.380
Its initial destination and
function are predetermined at

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.190
the start of the migration.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.940
People can measure things in
these that tell you where this

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.520
is going to end up.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.240
It's programed in these cells.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.260
Unless there's something that
blocks them, they know where

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.480
they're going to go and
make up different

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.970
parts of the brain.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.830
And then they form synapses, the
part where information is

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.310
sent from one neuron
to another.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.859
It occurs throughout the brain,
but at different rates

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:06.970
and different areas.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.500
So very early, you see
it in spinal cord.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.420
Very late, you see it in higher
cortical areas like

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.079
prefrontal cortex.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.470
At the peak growth, there's an
estimate-- these are all gross

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.290
estimates--

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:23.280
that you may be forming 1.8
million synapses per second.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.910
It's stunning, 1.8 million
synapses per second.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.510
And do you know how many
molecules are in an average

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.990
synapse by current
estimations?

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.970
1,000.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.860
There's 1,000 different
molecules in a synapse for it

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.300
to do it has to do.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.660
Multiply that times 1.8
million per second.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.210
It's spectacular biology.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.140
And then they keep getting more
and more until two years.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.600
And then you start
just losing them.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.770
By age 16, you'll have
lost a lot of them.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.650
And so the people have this
idea we mentioned before,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.640
pruning and selection.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.130
That we overgrow the number
of neurons, the number of

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.170
connections.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.640
What stays is activity
dependence, or this use it or

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.380
lose it neural Darwinism.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.560
Here's something amazing.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.770
There's an estimate that we lose
20 billion synapses per

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.910
day through adolescence.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.060
And that's not a bad thing.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.920
That's not the worst behaving
adolescents doing the worst

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.020
things they can do.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.470
That's the brain getting rid of

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.420
connections that aren't useful.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.090
It's an incredibly interesting
way to

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.670
construct a powerful brain.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.950
It's to get everybody
to way overbuild.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.260
And then eliminate the ones that
aren't powerfully useful.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.570
And another marker of
development is myelination.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.720
That's the growth of the fatty
sheath that surrounds the

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.050
neurons that are extending
distances.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.740
It insulates them and
accelerates their signal.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.110
It looks like white matter
in the postmortem brain.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.580
What happens through
adolescence--

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.000
here's age four to 22--

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.260
is that white matter goes up,
and gray matter goes down.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.990
So quite interesting, the total
brain size from about

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.100
age six to about 20-- young
adulthood, most of you--

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.770
stays about the same, the
total brain size.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.440
What you're doing is you're
getting rid of gray matter.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.870
And you're enhancing
white matter.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.800
You're getting rid of the
neurons that are nonproductive

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.850
and the synapses that
are nonproductive.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.810
And you're increasing the
strength with which different

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.840
parts of the brain can
communicate with one another

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.610
through the white matter.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.610
And so here's the kinds of
pictures of this growth.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.070
And some of the parts of the
brain that mature latest by

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.990
these kinds of measures of
getting rid of the overgrowth,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.180
are in prefrontal cortex.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.430
And we've talked about
that before.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.720
So many people are interested
always in thinking about

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.170
developmental issues and
the biology of them.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.970
And here's a kind of
a stunning finding.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.500
And we don't know exactly how
it would relate to humans.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.900
But I thought it would be
interesting to share with you

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.920
and think about this
just a little bit.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.920
So the title of the paper in
science was "Good Memories of

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.360
Bad Events in Infancy." So we
know from before, and just

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.040
common sense, that fear is
important for the survival.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.940
So we start at the amygdala,
which seems essential for

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.540
learning what's to be feared.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.720
Because what's to be feared is
what injures you, or worst

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.100
case, could kill you.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.670
So the amygdala is essential
for learned fear.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.110
And we know that one example, a
fear condition that depends

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.050
on the amygdala, would
be a neutral

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.220
stimulus like an odor--

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.650
odor that's not particularly
good or bad, just an odor--

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.420
and then a shock that makes
an aversive stimulus.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.640
So you pair them through
conditioning, odor, shock,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.240
odor, shock.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.530
So the odor predicts
the shock.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.640
Now, they looked at young rats
and looked at attachments.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.310
And here's what they find
kind of remarkably.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.250
Up to postnatal day nine for
these rats, if they were

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.920
exposed to the odors and the
shocks, here's what they do.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.300
They know through pairings
odor, shock, odor, shock,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.410
odor, shock, here
comes the odor.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.660
Here comes the shock.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.700
They still approach the odors.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.710
That's what's in this graph.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.780
Up to nine days, the
rats, the mice--

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.240
sorry--

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.410
are still approaching this odor
even though it will lead

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.950
to a shock.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.490
But on the 10th day,
just one day later,

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.710
it completely reverses.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.920
And they avoid the odors
that predict the

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.070
shock, a complete reversal.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.790
So they keep going to the
odors with the shock.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.610
And on the 10th today, the
pups stop going there.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.030
And what they also
find is this.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.280
If they look at metabolic
activity in the amygdala, for

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.890
the nine-day olds, it's the
same for the odor and the

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.490
shock, where a neutral order.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.970
It's not selective to
what's to be feared.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.270
And the 10-day old, here's a big
response in the amygdala

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.710
for the odor that predicts the
shock, for the fearful

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.710
learning, to know what's
scary, and

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.610
injurious and dangerous.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.090
So how do people think
about this?

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.100
Well, this is an animal
experiment up to nine days.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.060
We can't really know how
it relates to people.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.970
But the speculation was this.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.680
And maybe there's something
to it on a

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.990
different scale on people.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:57.210
Why would an animal approach
something injurious, up to the

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.330
amygdala seems to get more
mature, and then

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.560
avoid what's injurious.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.230
Why would that happen in such
a predictable evolutionary

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.700
determined way?

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.780
And the hypothesis is this.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.260
That if you're a very helpless
newborn, you have to go to

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.630
things no matter what.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.930
Because you're so dependent
on things in your

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.240
environment to survive.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.190
But at some moment you mature
enough that you

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.390
say no thank you.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.660
If it's going to be shocking
and painful, I'm

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.870
going to avoid it.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.220
You become kind of independent
in that sense, in

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.730
the concrete sense.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.290
And so the author said, well,
could it be helpful for

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.400
newborns to know, no matter
what, approach a caregiver,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.570
not respond to things that are
negative, because you need the

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.110
care, because you're
so dependent.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.530
And now this is super
speculatively.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.130
A thing that's been noted is
that even in families where

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.900
there's unfortunate tremendous
abuse for a young child, the

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.550
abuse victims so commonly
remain powerful

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.760
loyal to their parents.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.540
Is this kind of a mechanism that
mixes up attachment and

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.850
fear especially when you're
young and can't separate them

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.060
out so well?

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.840
So it's a huge leap from
the mice to the people.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.780
But it's a mechanism that we
can understand might be

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.920
involved in how attachment
and fear can have unusual

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.560
relationships with
one another.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.510
All right.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.010
You can't avoid reading in the
newspapers, or seeing on your

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.410
computer screen, discussions
about the deficit and older

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.200
people like me demanding a lot
of medical care that's paid

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.710
for by the wages you're going
to get in a couple years.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.960
I mean that's how
I look at it.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.060
So you are entering a world,
we're all entering a world,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.880
where the changing ages
demography of our society is

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.850
spectacular.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.730
Japan is ahead of us in
this a little bit.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.260
The rest of the world
is following.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.980
And China is going to
be unbelievable when

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.490
it happens on scale.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.000
But the United States right
now, right now.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.150
And here's why.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.640
For most of human history, the
average life expectancy was up

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.310
to 20 years old.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.390
That's why you had
to be an adult.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.550
Because at 20, who knows
how much time I have.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.430
I better do my adult things.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.620
Some people lived
for a long time.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.330
This is really interesting.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.390
It wasn't that everybody
perished by 30.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.690
Some people lived to
60, 70, 80, 90.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.970
But many people fell ill to
many diseases that are now

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.670
readily cured.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.704
So the average age was 20.

00:24:22.704 --> 00:24:26.680
In the 1800s, it became the
'30s, just a couple hundred

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.720
years ago in all of
human history.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.980
By 2000, the average person
in the US lived until 77.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.670
By 2010, 78.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:40.170
So we're having a spectacular
growth in the proportion of

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.580
humans in our society who are
living a long, long time,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.740
which is a wonderful thing.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.190
But it's radically changing the
world we live in and the

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.520
world for those people who
are older as well.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.340
So, for example, 100-year-old
people, there's 50,000 of them

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.770
in the US, which is triple what
there was a time ago.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.400
And it's expected to be a
million people in the US who

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.980
are 100 years and older by
2050, which is in your

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.680
lifetime, a million people
in the US alone

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.800
will be 100 or older.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.100
And maybe 50% of girls born in
2000 will live for a century.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.400
Spectacular changes are
occurring right this moment.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.680
The baby boom generation, huge
numbers of us are approaching

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.170
retirement and the kind of
medical support that gets

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.980
heavier when you get older on
average, huge numbers of us.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.700
How's it changing?

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.070
One way it's changing is that
families often have-- and you

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.555
might hear this-- an issue of
families feeling that they're

00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:38.030
a sandwich generation.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.360
They're taking care of their
children and the elderly.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.820
And you can bet if you have
parents who are living to 120,

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.600
you're doing that.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.490
Giant effects on education,
pension, work, financial

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.140
markets, I mean these are
epic societal effects.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.450
So you're hearing the discussion
now about how the

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.860
US is going to deal with this.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.920
So there used to be kind
of an old model.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.010
And even this is not that old.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.030
This is from the mid-1950s.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.900
Your job was to go to college,
have a career, have a mate,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.110
take care of a kid, retire
at 65, and put your

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.560
feet up on the desk.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.900
But all of a sudden, if
everybody's living--

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.030
not everybody, but huge numbers
of people are living--

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:19.800
until 70, 80, 90, 100, many in
pretty good health-- not

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.220
everybody we wish for-- but many
in pretty good health,

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.230
that's a fantastically
different thing.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.500
65 is no longer the retirement
moment, and you're

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.500
glad you made it.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.440
65 is something like the
halfway point of your

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.220
potential work life.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.070
20 to 60, 60 to 100, something
like this.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.560
It's an unbelievable change.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.450
You cannot overestimate how it's
changing the world around

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.030
you, and how it will affect the
economics and the politics

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.230
of the world that the rest of us
will be in for many years.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.070
There's about 10% of the
population over 65 now.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.100
In 20 years, one out of every
four people will be over 65 by

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.850
current estimates.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.580
So we're going to elect whatever
president we want.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.700
And older people go vote a lot
more than younger people.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.440
You can change that.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.730
But that's how it is.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.310
So let's talk about
adult development.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.090
I can tell you that if you
compare adult development,

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.600
very little is understood
from 20 to 80.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.970
Almost all the research is
taking something like college

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.270
students, and something
like 80-year-olds,

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.030
and comparing them.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.810
So pretty much minimal
information is available about

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.190
everything between 20 and 80.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.430
But we'll look at what we can.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.430
And one of the things we'll talk
about for a moment is the

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.220
two kinds of studies we could
look at for development.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.120
This could be about infants.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.780
But we're going to talk
about adults.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.810
Cross-sectional versus
longitudinal, so

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.620
cross-sectional is I look
at you as 20-year-olds.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.925
I look at some 80-year-olds in
the Boston community and

00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:44.760
compare them.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.340
That's very different than
looking at you at 20 and

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.260
seeing you at 80.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.790
Because that's much
more controlled.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.310
That's you with everything
that's special and particular

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.960
about you at 20 and 80.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.230
When you go get people who are
20-year-olds from one place

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:02.100
and 80-year-olds from another,
a cross-sectional , study,

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.840
that's going to have all
the differences that

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.850
go with those cohorts.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.160
So what do we see in these
kinds of things?

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.300
So here's some measures.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.340
You've seen this kind
of stuff before.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.085
For things like working memory,
speed of processing,

00:28:19.085 --> 00:28:20.380
and long-term memory.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.570
Here's people in their '20s,
people in their '80s, a ski

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.250
scope of decline.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.420
Here's things like knowledge
of vocabulary.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.000
And that stays more steady,
so the crystallized fluid

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.390
distinction you've already
heard about before.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.470
So what are the strengths and
limitations of cross-sectional

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.560
versus longitudinal studies.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.200
So for cross-sectional studies,
they're fast.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.760
If you're a scientist like a
graduate student who has to do

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.500
a Ph.D. thesis in a mere six or
seven years, you can go to

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.530
experiment with 20-year-olds
and 80-year-olds and have a

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.640
conclusion.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.930
If you're a graduate student
who would have to test this

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.960
class of 20 and come back to you
in 60 years from now and

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.540
see how you're doing, that's
going to be slow progress.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.970
So that's why an overwhelming
amount of evidence is

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.970
cross-sectional.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.810
The problem with it
is cohort effects.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.940
We discussed, for example, that
IQ scores go up year by

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.200
year throughout the world.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.290
So you're not really comparing
equal things in terms of

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.590
educational opportunities,
nutrition, exposure to

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.780
information on the internet.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.240
A 20-year-old and an 80-year-old
have lived through

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.390
different worlds.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.670
So it's all mixed up in
the measurements.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.480
Not just age, it's different
worlds that

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.660
people have lived in.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.060
Longitudinal studies
are painfully slow.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.920
They're more accurate, because
you're looking at change

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.570
within a person.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.570
You're holding all the world
things constant.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:39.930
You have one other weird
thing, which is you get

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:40.910
practice effects.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.700
If you test somebody in the same
test, if you're 60 years

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.540
apart, you don't get much.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.570
But if it's maybe three or four
years apart, you take a

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.080
test twice, you get
better at it.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.980
So that's a problem with
longitudinal affects when you

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.310
retest somebody.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.530
So there's been a few studies
that have looked at relatively

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.620
short-term longitudinal and
cross-sectional data.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.840
And here's a ski slope on
the values of fluid

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.110
intelligence things.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:06.260
And it's just made a bit milder
by a longitudinal

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.840
design, but not dramatically
different.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.500
So it's not the case of
longitudinal studies.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.550
People used to think oh, these
longitudinal studies are

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.530
overestimating that.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.420
Especially if you're older,
you like that thought.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.100
It's a messed up
study approach.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.130
But unfortunately,
cross-sectional ones just

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.170
diminish the difference
a little bit.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.170
So people have said,
though, there's

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.120
an interesting trade-off.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.860
What's the trade-off, then--

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.490
I'll ask you for a moment--

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:33.040
between most of you
are like 18 to 22.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.340
I'll bracket it 17 to 25.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.220
Is that fair?

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.250
What advantage do you have
versus somebody in their

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.980
mid-'50s like me?

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:51.120
And what disadvantage do you
have in some global sense?

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.770
Oh.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.110
That was painful.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.750
The answer was you guys
are physically able.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.190
All right.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.590
That would be true.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.340
There's not many Olympian
sprinters who

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.590
are in their mid-'50s.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.110
How about in terms of
cognitive things?

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.500
So we just said, for speed
of mental processing,

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.470
it's good to be 20.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.650
And then 30-year-olds
are a little slower.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.720
40-year-olds, a little slower.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.540
50, 60, 70, every decade a
little bit slower for speed of

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.960
mental processing.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.800
But there's one thing
that's an advantage

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.900
with time for cognition.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.066
What's the advantage?

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:30.404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:30.404 --> 00:31:30.850
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.836
AUDIENCE: Experience.

00:31:31.836 --> 00:31:32.960
PROFESSOR: Experience.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.320
Thank you.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.770
Oh yes.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.140
Yes.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.650
Over time, you learn stuff,
especially stuff that you're

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:40.630
exposed to a lot.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:44.120
So time is a trade-off
within adulthood.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.700
You lose some speeded
capacities.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.800
You gain some specific knowledge
or experience.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.830
So they looked at studies
like these, air traffic

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.420
controllers in Canada.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.350
And this is very relevant.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.360
Especially now, air traffic
controllers are in the news

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.420
more than they want to be.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:02.790
You've seen them?

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.030
Unfortunately, they're
napping.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.390
They're playing movies,
some of them.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.770
I'm sure it's a tiny minority.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.760
But it's worrisome if you're a
member of the flying public.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.620
So here's another question.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.880
At what age should you tell
somebody, well, I think we

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.980
don't need you to be an air
controller anymore, because

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.680
you're not with it enough
for us to feel safe.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.470
So people are probing
this all the time.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.920
The average retirement age in
the US is 55, in Canada, 65.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.860
Is one more correct
than the other?

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.870
And so here's what they found
when they looked at air

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.680
traffic controllers.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.950
Age influences processing
speed but not task

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.130
performance.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.470
So what we're thinking is older
people aren't better.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.130
But they're not worse.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.880
Maybe there's a trade-off
between speed and experience.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.930
And it kind of evens out until
some age where it will no

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.410
longer even out.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:51.420
118 pilots, 40 to 69, they
took place in flight

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.530
simulators and tested three
times across three years.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.910
It's a longitudinal design
and a flight simulator.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.720
The older pilots were worse the
first time they did it.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.150
Now some time is passing.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.910
But then they outperformed
the younger pilots in

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.350
years two and three.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.310
That is, once they had some
experience with the new

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.000
situation, they could apply,
presumably, their prior

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.510
experience.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.520
But the very first time they did
it when they have to use

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.320
their fluid intelligence to
figure out what's going on,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.250
they were worse.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:19.200
So you can see some trade-offs
between raw processing, speed,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.700
and flexibility that goes with
the young adulthood and some

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.970
degree of knowledge
and expertise

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:24.990
that's gained over time.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.180
There's trade-offs
on these things.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.180
How about in memory, declarative
memory that we

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.910
talked about, every
day memory.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.570
I'll show you in a moment.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:35.720
There's mild, steady decline
in healthy aging severe in

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.900
Alzheimer's.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.670
Implicit memory, we
talked about that.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.690
It can be more steady
across ages.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:44.340
But let me focus on explicit
memory, declarative memory.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.990
We're going to figure out why
the projector is washing these

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.710
things out so much.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.850
But here's a slide that
you don't have to see

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.010
very much to know.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.650
Long-term memory performance
is going down quite sharply

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.640
year by year as you get older.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.970
But here's something that was
a huge surprise from brain

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.200
imaging, a huge surprise.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.940
And the thing that if you didn't
have brain imaging, you

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.650
wouldn't even conceive that
it could have existed.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.310
So many studies have done
brain imaging as people

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.960
perform various kinds of tasks,
memory tasks in this

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.580
case, with young adults
and older adults.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:13.710
And

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.500
what they found, unexpectedly,
was this.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:22.710
Young adults would typically
activate one side of the

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:25.090
prefrontal cortex typically in
regards to whether it was

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.380
verbal or spatial.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.460
So here's young adults mostly
on one side, mostly on one

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:34.580
side, mostly on one side,
mostly on one side.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.940
Healthy older adults in good
health characteristically

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.630
turned on both sides of the
brain as they were performing

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.150
these memory tasks.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.870
So you wouldn't have known
that if you didn't have

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.260
imaging, because who could
have thought about that?

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.620
So then there was a little bit
of a debate in the field with

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.679
the fact that adults were
turning on both sides of their

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.200
hemispheres whereas adults
were just picking one

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.220
or just using one.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.450
Was that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.960
So people said, well,
it's a bad thing.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.860
Because maybe as you get
older, you lose your

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.550
specializations, and you're
using the wrong stuff.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.820
It's as if I need
my physics book.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.600
And I'm going to grab
my chemistry book.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.930
Well, just grab your
physics book.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.330
Just grab the right thing.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.770
Why are you getting other stuff
that's not relevant that

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.440
could mess you up and
slow you down?

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.360
So some people said, you're
sort of losing the

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.460
specializations of peak
young adulthood.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.110
You're leaking brain activity
in the wrong places.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.070
It's yet another sad sign
of getting older.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.390
Here's an alternative one.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.100
Well, you get older.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.220
But maybe you get some
compensatory mechanisms.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.070
You realize at some level in
your brain that you can't do

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.900
what you could when
you were 20.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.040
And you make up for that by
somehow using two sides of

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.790
your brain instead of one.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.300
So that would be a good thing.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.690
So how would you decide that?

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.270
How would you decide whether
using the two sides of your

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.400
brain when you're an older adult
is a helpful thing, part

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.920
of the solution to keeping your
cognition going, or is it

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.720
part of the problem of losing
long-term memory abilities as

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.790
you get older while
they're declining.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.640
How would you decide that?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.540
There's kind of an
easy answer.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:08.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.820
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.250
PROFESSOR: You what?

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.300
AUDIENCE: Like, split
their brains.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.670
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.490
It's a suggestion we should take
older people, split their

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.620
brains, and see how
they're doing.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.300
Well, older people,
their long-term

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.090
memory is not that bad.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.610
So here was the approach.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:28.470
It seems reasonable.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.000
They say amongst older people,
some people do better and

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.240
worse in terms of the memory.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.070
Does better memory go with using
two sides or one side?

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.660
And what was found, and
here's one example.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.330
Here's young people using one
side of their frontal cortex

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:43.930
as they perform a memory task.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.750
Here's older people whose
memory was not so good.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.510
Here's older people whose
memory was good.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.450
And here's a similar finding.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:54.620
So the suggestion was that older
people who used both

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.930
frontal cortices were actually
doing better.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.750
They were having less of an
effective age on cognition.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.710
So the answer seems to be,
it's a good thing.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.120
And if you're older, you somehow
compensate for some of

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.030
the decrease in long-term
ability by applying more

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.690
neural systems to support
your performance.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.580
Older adults are really
interested in this.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.190
You are not.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.270
In about 30 years,
you might be.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.410
But older adults are really
interested in what can I do to

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.340
keep myself going?

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.650
Because I'm going to live to be
80, 90, or 100 with just a

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.970
little bit of luck.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.160
How can I keep my quality
of life high in terms of

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.220
cognition and mental
abilities?

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.160
So one thing that people have
found is that, on average,

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:41.320
higher education is correlated
with-- and there's many

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.950
interpretations of this--

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.750
better cognitive abilities and
less likelihood of getting

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.450
Alzheimer's, or getting
Alzheimer's, if you're going

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.860
to get it, at an older age.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.940
So that's kind of interesting.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.150
It's good to go to college.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.910
It's good to keep being educated
in some sense.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.340
It doesn't have to be formal.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.450
But formal education correlates
with that.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.480
Now here was a surprise.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.360
And now you tell
me what it is.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.990
So how would that work?

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.860
How would sitting there and
listening to me really

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:09.850
carefully right now give you an
extra decade of cognitive

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.581
ability when you're 80?

00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:14.500
All right, now I've got
your attention.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.470
How would that work
biologically?

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.850
Is education kind of going in
your brain and saying, we're

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:19.720
knocking all these things in.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.490
And we're keeping them here.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.230
And we're not going to let
you have any injury when

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.000
you're 40 or 50.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.560
How does that work?

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.480
So I'm going to tell you one
more piece of information,

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:26.950
which is this.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.930
And you tell me what
you think.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.680
So the other thing that we know
is there's evidence that

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:37.020
once you get the diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, then the

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.385
more educated you are, the
faster you decline.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.430
And I don't think the story
is all done yet.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:47.730
Because people are
complicated.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.470
But this is the current
evidence.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.580
So how do you interpret that?

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.700
So here's the interpretation.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.650
The interpretation is more
education gives you more

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.190
mental tools, what people will
call cognitive reserve.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.840
You have more things going for
you like maybe the ability to

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.310
use two hemispheres.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:08.110
That will protect you as
something like some brain

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.780
injury happens over time, like
an Alzheimer's disease, or

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.770
other causes of slowed
or diminished

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.770
cognition in old age.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:15.600
That will help you.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.170
You have more tools with
which to keep operating

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.770
successfully.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.340
But once Alzheimer's disease
become severe enough in the

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.070
brain that those tools are no
longer available to you, then

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.680
the more educated you are,
the more you plummet.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.680
Because everything's done.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.250
So we now know something--
and I'll just say

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:32.680
a word about this--

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.630
Alzheimer's disease-- and
this is compelling

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.530
evidence for this--

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:40.540
starts in your brain
about 15 years

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.550
before you get the diagnosis.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.840
And it could be more
than that.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.690
That's how far we can track
it back by brain imaging.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:51.830
So if an adult is diagnosed
with Alzheimer's at 70,

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:57.330
somewhere around 55, something
has started that will

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:00.960
ultimately be injury enough
to lead to dementia and

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.610
Alzheimer's disease.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.520
And that's why there's such
a big emphasis on early

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.850
identification.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.540
Because it's very hard to
treat a brain that's

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.090
had a lot of injury.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.580
You want to catch the
people at 55 or 60.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.540
So we also know that lifelong
cognitively is good.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.490
Conscientious, we talked
about that.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.155
And here, again,
comes exercise.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.730
So they took a study.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.470
This is now a random assignment
study, finally a

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.760
full on experiment, where they
took sedentary people, people

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.880
who were not exercising over 60,
and assigned them to two

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.390
groups, an aerobic training
group who did walking and

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.085
swimming, so some really
exercise, and non-aerobic

00:40:37.085 --> 00:40:39.090
group who did toning
and stretching.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.750
So they thought they
were special.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.600
They were active.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.040
But they weren't doing
the aerobic exercise.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.640
And they didn't do it a
phenomenal amount of time, an

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.300
hour a day, a few times
a week for months.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.400
It's not a brutal exercise
schedule.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.570
What happens?

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.250
It's kind of amazing
what happened.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.760
These are healthy people
but not very active.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.620
What's shown here in the red
bars are the cognitive

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.500
performances after the
exercise of the

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.260
healthy older people.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.980
And blue bars are the people
who did the stretching and

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.540
toning, not the aerobic
exercise.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.730
So very substantial gains in
cognitive abilities from a few

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.220
months of moderate exercise.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.620
And in the brain, both by
functional MRI and by

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.410
structural MRI, in gray matter,
and white matter,

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:24.320
physically measurable changes
in the brain for the group

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.740
that did the aerobic exercise
a couple times a week for a

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.760
few months compared to
the group that did

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.000
the less active exercises.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.730
That's amazing.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.390
The brain changes.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.300
Cognition changes.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.720
Again, no pill you can pop.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.790
And you're making new neurons in
your dentate gyrus to boot.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.530
So all of us want
the easy out.

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.740
But exercise is the most
compelling story for keeping

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.060
your brain optimized
that we know.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.150
Now here's a remarkable thing.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.110
Exercise, we kind of get.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.290
Actually, if you think about
it, we don't know the

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.260
mechanism at all.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.080
I mean, you're running
around like this.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.530
Now how is that pushing up your
neurons in your brain?

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.770
But here's something
very psychological

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:07.990
that's kind of stunning.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.770
And at first, I almost didn't
believe it when I read it.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.825
But there's been a few
other studies that

00:42:10.825 --> 00:42:12.180
have supported this.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.950
We often think, well, exercise
is something real.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.590
Attitudes, even in a psychology
course, attitudes,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:19.160
they're just attitudes.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.180
So look at this.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.930
And then you can think
about this.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.750
So they looked in a longitudinal
study of over 400

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:27.480
in the Baltimore Longitudinal
Study of Aging.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.360
They started under 50.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.930
But they kept going with them.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.900
They gave them a questionnaire
on attitudes about aging.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.740
So they said, are older people,
for example, more

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.470
absent-minded or less
intelligent?

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.470
And some people say,
oh my gosh.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.040
Older people are very
absent-minded.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.710
They're very less intelligent.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:43.170
Other people think it's
just a milder think.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.980
People vary in their estimates
of how severe these changes

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.810
are in old age.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:50.250
Then they measured something
very concrete and real, the

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:54.210
number of cardiovascular events,
like stroke or heart

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:58.050
attack, over the
next 38 years.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.710
So this is a real physical
measurement.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.980
This isn't an attitude.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.170
How powerful is an attitude?

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.590
Well, it's kind of stunning,
unbelievably

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.490
powerful in some ways.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.710
We don't know if it's the
attitude or something

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:09.680
correlated.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.600
But here's the percent with
strokes or heart attacks.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.270
Here's the people who had
negative age stereotypes.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:21.890
And here's the people who had
positive age stereotypes.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.460
So one always has to be
worried about the

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.060
chicken and egg issue.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.840
Maybe if you had a lot of
strokes and heart attacks,

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.980
you're not so optimistic
about your old age.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.300
But they were measuring these
things at the beginning, they

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.170
were very similar.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:33.300
So they weren't starting
out with

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.600
different health problems.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.180
So something about attitudes
seems to chip in to the most

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.120
core aspects of physical
health.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.020
But none of us understand
the mechanism.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:42.360
Yes?

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.993
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't family
history have a

00:43:43.993 --> 00:43:45.610
lot to do with that?

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:46.970
PROFESSOR: So the question is
how about family history?

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.180
It could be mixed into that.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:48.930
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:49.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.901
That's a very good.

00:43:51.901 --> 00:43:54.400
Then it's not just
attitudes, right?

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.810
Or it could be not
attitudes it all.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.020
And here's the concept.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.980
That regardless of your age--
but age is one of the most

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.390
powerful pieces of the story--

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.790
when your time is limited,
people focus on social goals

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:13.130
related to emotional meaning and
emotional satisfaction and

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.150
less related to knowledge
acquisition.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:19.850
That depending on the moment of
your life on average, when

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.060
you're in adolescence, and
you're in college and graduate

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.730
school, and you're beginning
your residency, or becoming a

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:27.990
junior partner at a law firm,
you're at an age of huge

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.180
information acquisition.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.860
What you want to know is what
do I need to know to do

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.340
something important,
significant,

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.290
valuable in my life?

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.590
You're sitting here acquiring
knowledge.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.360
College is four years of
acquiring knowledge in terms

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.260
of classrooms and majors.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.540
You guys do other things too.

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:48.360
But the number one mission is
acquire that knowledge.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.090
Now when you get older, you
don't really want so much

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:53.010
information anymore.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.180
And maybe what you're much more
interested in is how you

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.940
regulate your feelings, how
positive can you make your

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.770
life, not by being adventurous,
taking risks, and

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.690
all this kind of stuff,
but by finding

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:04.810
a way towards happiness.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.060
And I'm going to show you
a bunch of research that

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.330
suggests that young adulthood
is full about acquisition of

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.910
information through adventure.

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:16.560
And old age, on average you're
focused to regulate your

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.730
emotions in positive ways.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:21.220
And so sometimes people
will call that wisdom.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.470
Although, you could just say
it's different things for

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.040
different ages are desirable.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.780
And part of the support came
from the following result,

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.810
which has been found many,
many, many times.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.290
But it was kind of stunning when
it was first reported.

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.170
So this is where people were
asked, how happy are you?

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:37.370
Are you satisfied
with your life?

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.700
So here's a younger adults,
18 to 50 basically.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.430
About half of them said they're
very satisfied.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:46.110
But it zooms up if
you're older.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.390
How many people are satisfied
with their standard of living?

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.500
40 if you're younger.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.990
60 if you're older.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:54.220
Frequency of depression,
for example, never.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.350
Let's pick often.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.785
It's higher for younger
people.

00:45:58.785 --> 00:46:01.570
They have more frequent thoughts
about suicide.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:05.700
By every measure you can make,
if we give you a questionnaire

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.080
like this, on average, for
20-year-olds or 30-year-olds,

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.500
you would report more
unhappiness than older people,

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.360
on average.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.560
Of course, it varies.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.790
But that's kind of a surprise
maybe or not.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:20.180
And everybody has found that.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.040
No, not a surprise?

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.080
AUDIENCE: I mean, just because
they report something, doesn't

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.656
mean that's the way it is.

00:46:26.656 --> 00:46:28.430
PROFESSOR: Ah well we'll come
back to this again.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.800
Yes.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.200
Just because you say
you're happier

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.620
doesn't mean you're happier.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.071
We don't have a better
way than that though.

00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:37.050
We can't say, oh, you
think you're happy.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.170
But you'd be so happy if
you were at Caltech.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.420
You'd be just so happy.

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.360
I'm a brain measurer.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.520
So I like objective measures.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.160
I think if a person tells
you they're happy,

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.365
they probably are.

00:46:50.365 --> 00:46:51.550
There are certain moments,
I know, when

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:52.260
people tell you that.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:52.770
Well, we'll see.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:53.310
Who knows?

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:53.990
I agree with you.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.140
It's a concern.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.460
So here's the thought, that
motivation and goals are set

00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.500
by temporal context.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.700
At times, they're perceived
as limited.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.160
And all this will come that the
older you get, the more

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.840
you focus on the positive
things in the world.

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.000
And what makes you happy is to
focus on positive things and

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.150
ignore the negative.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:14.250
So how true might this
be experimentally?

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.180
So they had students-- ah, this
is really washed out--

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.020
capture these special moments,
this same ad.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:24.160
And this one says, "Capture the
special moments." And this

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.630
one says, "Capture the
unexplored world."

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.550
So if you're an information
seeker, which is better? the

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.110
unexplored world or the special

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.680
moments, which is better?

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.580
The unexplored world, right?

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.450
You're a 20-year-old.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.530
Unexplored Is awesome.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.590
Young people prefer this ad.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:42.490
Older people prefer the
special moments.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.170
And by special moments, we mean
emotionally satisfying.

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.940
Right?

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.420
OK.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.410
Here's another one.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.110
They show you up pictures of
a positive and negative

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:52.200
expression.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:52.760
It flashes away.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.740
And there's a dot left.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.410
If the dot appears on the
right, you push your

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.070
right-hand button.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.160
If the dot appears on
the left, you push

00:47:59.160 --> 00:47:59.930
the left-hand button.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.460
It's simply pushing to a dot.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.960
But if the dot is in the place
where you just saw, either a

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.530
negative or a neutral face.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.110
And what they find is for
younger people, they're about

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.760
as fast whether the dot appears
where the neutral or

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.580
negative face was.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:12.810
They don't really care.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.910
For the older people, they're
much faster if the dot appears

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:17.980
where the positive face
had just been.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.550
As if their attention was locked
to the positive face.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.590
Oh, the dot appears there.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.170
I'm ready to go.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.000
Locked on the positive face
if the dot appears here.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:26.890
You go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.270
You shift your attention.

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.240
And that takes extra time.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.080
So you're locked to the positive
when you see a

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.800
positive and a negative face.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.390
Here's another one where you're
doing positive and

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:38.870
negative car options,
things that are good

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:40.480
or bad about a car.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.250
This line goes up.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:41.960
This line goes down.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.450
Younger people focus more on the
negative options relative

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.290
to older people who focus more
on the positive options.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.100
Here's another one.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.190
You show pictures of happy
scenes, or neutral scenes, are

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.950
negative scenes.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.620
This is a graveyard.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.180
Young people's memory for
positive, negative, and

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.800
neutral things, they remember
emotional things better.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.770
Let's go to the older people.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.420
Look at this line way up here.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.110
That's memory for the
positive scenes.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:05.630
And here's the negative
scenes.

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.610
Do you see the focus on the
positivity and the sort of

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.840
lack of interest in the
negative stuff?

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.060
For young people, equally
interesting if it's positive

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:14.620
or negative.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.760
For older people, much more
interesting, and sticking in

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.950
your memory if it's positive.

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:22.690
And not sticking in your memory
if it's negative.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.900
So one of the big questions
is, is this simply about

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.640
getting older?

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.460
And I'm going to ask you to
think back, if I can, to your

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:35.220
last days in high school, your
last days in high school.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.940
For those last days--

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.990
and I'm sure it will vary
depending on your experience

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:40.836
in different ways--

00:49:40.836 --> 00:49:43.670
were you primarily interested
in getting that last little

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:47.920
bit of information about
US history or calculus?

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.040
I mean, you might have been.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.560
That could have been the
critical bit of information

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.390
that will make college
work out.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:55.560
Or did you have a sudden--

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.050
and it's kind of embarrassing
when you're 16, 17, 18--

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.760
enhanced sense of nostalgia?

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.430
Oh, this is the last time the
three of us, or the six of us,

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.510
or the eight of us, or the two
of us will be together.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:08.510
Then we're spreading across
the world to go

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:10.750
to different colleges.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.400
Nobody had that feeling?

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:12.750
OK.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.260
It's kind of embarrassing
when you're 18.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.115
Because you're not supposed
to say that kind of stuff.

00:50:16.115 --> 00:50:18.830
And it will happen to you at the
end the college for most

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:19.550
of you most of the time.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.130
I remember senior year, it crept
up on us in college.

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.900
And we started college.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.360
Oh my gosh.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.330
This is the last year
we're together.

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:26.600
And it seemed very emotionally
important.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.990
So age or time.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.120
So is it simply age?

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:29.910
Or is it time?

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.400
So they did experiments where
they asked people, are you

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.720
focusing on adventure
and content?

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.210
Or are you focusing on emotion
and satisfaction?

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.260
When you're about to move from
one city to another, people

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.910
waned to spend time
with people they

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:41.860
really cared about.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.120
And they were not interested
in getting new information.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.550
Two more tragic studies, if
people are near death, and

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.890
they're asked this question,
of course time with people,

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.640
not acquiring information.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.620
But here's another one,
inner-city gangs study in Los

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:59.340
Angeles, inner-city gangs
involved in violence are much

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:03.600
more interested in time with
people than in information.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.300
And partly that goes with what
is viewed from the outside.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.610
Sometimes this kind of insane
loyalty that inner-city gang

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.720
members have for one another is
because they're so focused

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.450
given their situation on this
relations with the other

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:19.640
people in their group compared
to everything that's rational

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.330
about a safe growing up.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:26.810
And, tragically, you know if you
ask a member of inner-city

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:29.190
gangs how long they think
they'll live, they often tell

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.660
you not very long.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.130
I'm counting on not
living very long.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.580
So it's not whether you're
20, or 60, or 80.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.210
It's how long you sense
time is in front of

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:43.270
you, a temporal horizon.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:46.920
Here's one study that
I had a hand in.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.650
We took older and younger people
and put them inside an

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.120
MRI and show them positive,
neutral,

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:52.830
and negative pictures.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.530
Here's a couple different
points.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.730
When they said, how intense
is this picture?

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:57.730
Look at younger people.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.850
The positive, neutral, and the
negative are really intense.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:01.850
This goes down.

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.930
So the older people, as they see
the pictures, experienced

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:07.780
by their own report, the
negative pictures as being

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.020
less intense.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.470
They're sort of downplaying
the negative.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:14.510
And if we asked their memory,
here's younger people.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.250
Positive, and negative things,
neutral things, same for

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:17.950
positive and negative.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:21.610
Look at older people, much
more focused in memory,

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.520
retaining in memory
the positive and

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.200
not so much the negative.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.650
And if we look at their
amygdala, which we know is a

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:32.360
structure that's essential for
how emotion modulates the

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.320
formation of memory, here's
young people.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.520
Here's a positive picture.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.440
Here's a negative picture.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.140
Here's a neutral picture.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.610
So emotion counts.

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:42.520
Positive and negative count
about the same.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.710
Look at older people.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.900
Here's positive, and
here's negative.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.670
So this partly addresses the
question for some people.

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:52.790
Are older people pretending
they're positive?

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:53.940
Well, it doesn't
look like that.

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.620
This is their amygdala as
they're looking at it.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.520
I don't know if their
amygdala can pretend

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.300
to look at the positive.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.390
So here's the good
news for you.

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.620
What will happen as you get
older, on average, is that for

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.000
whatever reason it happens-- and
we don't really know why--

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.050
you will focus more and
more on the positive

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:11.310
things in your life.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:15.640
And you'll feel better
for that, on average.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.850
So that's the kind of
quiet satisfaction.

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.495
Now I'm focusing on
the positive.

00:53:20.495 --> 00:53:22.050
That's the zen satisfaction.

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:25.890
Let's talk about fantastic
satisfaction, reward system.

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:28.580
When you really want to do
something, because it's going

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.690
to feel so wonderful,
the reward system.

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.220
So let me tell you a little bit
about what we understand

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.550
about that.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:36.560
It involves dopamine as the
critical neurotransmitter.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.700
It starts in the ventral
tegmental

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.040
area of your brainstem.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.140
And that projects to something
called the nucleus accumbens,

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.620
an inferior portion of
the basal ganglia.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.330
And this is reward central.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:51.190
If you love something from
opera, to chocolate, to video

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:53.290
games, this turns on.

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:57.070
Every experiment that people
have ever done shows in humans

00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:00.310
if something really turns
you on, this area

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:02.180
really gets turned on.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.470
What's more powerful for us
than what we find deeply

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.280
emotionally rewarding?

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.890
This is that rewards system.

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.520
And the dopamine runs
from there.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.690
And look at how cells respond.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.490
I'm going to show you an example
from monkeys where we

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:17.900
can look at single cells.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.920
And then brain imaging,
back to people.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.020
So here's the experiment
with monkeys.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.600
And there's a message in this
that's both biologically true

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.500
and compelling about
human life.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.850
So what's biologically true in
science what's compelling

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:33.470
about life is a story.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.970
So here's the experiment.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:38.300
The monkey sits there and gets
various cues, different visual

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.090
things that tell them
what's coming up.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:42.420
Let's pretend this is a cue
that's something wonderful is

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.610
coming up, highly
desired food.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.380
So they're recording
electrically why

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.720
the animal sees this.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.490
There's waiting for what we call
the anticipation period.

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.080
And now here comes the reward.

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.700
And here's something sort of
deep, I think, about reward,

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.170
and learning, and people,
and things like this.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.440
So here's the neurons firing.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.840
This is the sum of the neurons
firing in the ventral

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.010
tegmental area.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.230
So right now they're
just sitting there.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:10.140
Oops, here comes the reward.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.610
And boom, dopamine
is released.

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.450
The dopaminergic cells are
firing like crazy.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:15.870
They're getting food
they really want.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.170
We're thrilled.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:20.150
We're hungry, and we're getting
something delicious.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.230
Not much more rewarding
can happen when

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:23.910
you're really hungry.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:28.110
Now they predict the arrival
with the cue that you saw, a

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.650
meaningless stimulus.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:32.330
And look what happens.

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:34.250
When do these neurons fire?

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:37.900
Not for the food arriving, but
for the visual signal that

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.060
predicts the food will come.

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:44.500
What's delicious for the brain
is the anticipation of

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.360
something that's rewarding.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.843
And this morning when I was
thinking about this lecture, I

00:55:47.843 --> 00:55:50.370
was thinking.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:51.370
You might say this.

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:52.765
Think about experiences
you've had that you've

00:55:52.765 --> 00:55:53.440
looked forward to.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.710
And almost the most delicious
part, you might say, is the

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:57.660
anticipation of something
delightful.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:02.600
Often the event itself is more
mixed and anticlimactic than

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.570
you would've thought.

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.050
Is that fair?

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.950
I think there's nothing better
like I'm anticipating

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:07.510
something wonderful.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:08.910
And the event can
be wonderful.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.810
But often it's a little
more complicated.

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:13.910
That anticipation is like
pure joy, because you're

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:18.510
dopaminergic system is
firing freely away.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.040
And it protests also.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.200
So you get the visual
signal that, oh, the

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.300
reward's coming up.

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.000
Here it is.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.730
Here comes the food.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:28.960
The food doesn't come.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.620
Look at the silence.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.960
These cells are protesting
because they didn't get what

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.160
they expected to get.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.270
So it's very compelling that the
reward in you occurs not

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:44.020
even so much for the reward
itself, but the anticipation

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.040
of the reward is where it's
biologically occurring when

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.120
you can anticipate and count
on it correctly.

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.240
So, in humans, it's harder to
deliver-- not impossible--

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.050
food in a scanner.

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:57.010
So a very simple thing is done
for a reward, which is

00:56:57.010 --> 00:56:58.350
offering people money.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.520
So in a given trial on a
scanner, you might see a

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.600
meaningless cue like this.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.320
But you learn that this box
predicts that at the end of

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.340
this trial--

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.430
you do many trials--

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:09.940
you're going to get $1.00.

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.770
Another one might be $0.10.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:13.090
Another one they might
take away $1.00.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:14.280
So this is like a
good one to get.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.945
I'm going to get $1
just sitting here.

00:57:15.945 --> 00:57:17.910
I'm going to get $1.

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:18.700
It's not huge.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.990
It's not the biggest reward
in the world.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.310
But it's something for
just laying in the

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:24.830
scanner doing nothing.

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:26.840
And here's what happens.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.740
Your nucleus accumbens gets
activated, where dopamine

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.480
flows from the ventral tegmental
area when you

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.890
anticipate a reward.

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:36.200
This is not when the
reward comes.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.250
This is when you're anticipating
the reward.

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:41.600
Here's another picture.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.560
It's most powerful
for when people

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.350
anticipate a gain, a reward.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:49.140
And it's less responsive when
people anticipate a loss.

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.880
So it's about gains.

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.970
Then the same system projects to
the inferior parts of your

00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:56.980
frontal lobe.

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.110
So now we're moving into
the neocortex.

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:01.920
And that part of the brain
seems to respond most

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.080
powerfully if you
get the reward.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.970
So this is really interesting,
a part of your brain that

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.960
responds to the anticipation,
the

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.510
dopaminergic reward system.

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:11.660
And then another part of their
brain that responds not

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.450
whether you anticipate it.

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:13.470
But sometimes they trick you.

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:14.470
They say we're going
to give you $1.

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.840
And then they go, oops.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.410
We're not giving it to you.

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:19.300
This part of the brain seems to
register the receipt of the

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:19.960
reward or not.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.710
So there's a separation of the
brain between the anticipation

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:23.700
of the reward and the response
to whether you get

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.950
the reward or not.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.920
Older people, when they look
at these kinds of similar

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:35.330
reward paradigms, they're less
responsive to potential loss

00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:36.880
but equally responsive
to potential

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.750
gain as young adults.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:42.060
So that's exactly responding to
positive things and showing

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:46.440
less of a response to potential
negative things.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.440
So let's switch to
adolescents.

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.480
We're going to focus on
adolescents now mostly for the

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.360
next 10 minutes.

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.910
You just got through that.

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:57.000
So let's reflect back for the
last couple of years.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.680
And they make the experiments
because they want to put

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.350
children into a little
bit more of a vivid.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:01.060
Here's pirates.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.430
Here's not much reward.

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:03.040
Here's some reward.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.300
Here's a lot of reward
in the scanner.

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:08.830
And your children are
adolescents or young adults.

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:10.340
And they look in the
nucleus accumbens.

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.470
This is that reward region.

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:13.720
And look who's firing
like crazy?

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:17.540
Adolescents, teenagers.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.840
But they're not firing like
crazy in the frontal cortex.

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.570
So this is very speculative.

00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:27.990
These are partly just
wide stories.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:30.000
But one hypothesis is this.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.120
And we're going to say in a
minute more about this.

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.000
Adolescence is a really
interesting period.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.790
Because it's not only when
you're deciding who you are in

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:40.800
the world in many ways
independently.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:44.640
It's also, worrisomely for
parents, grandparents,

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.180
cousins, siblings, the period
in life when people are most

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.730
likely to put themselves
at great risk.

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:56.430
And one version of that is that
the subcortical reward

00:59:56.430 --> 01:00:01.040
areas are developing way faster
than the cortical areas

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.970
that control and regulate
your behavior.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.200
This goes with the stereotype
which is probably as unfair as

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.146
any other stereotype of the
out of control teenager.

01:00:13.146 --> 01:00:15.810
But imagine if it were true
that your reward system is

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.510
very turned up.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:20.550
And your cortical control system
were not yet caught up

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.770
to the adult level.

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.730
Well, that would make you a
little bit more likely to do

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.620
adventuresome things.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.390
Because the reward
is powerful.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:30.340
And the control of your thoughts
about how to approach

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.330
or reject that reward
are less powerful.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.130
So here's some things
to think about.

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:41.000
And people worry about
for adolescents.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.970
40% of adult alcoholics report
having initial alcoholism

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:45.200
between 15 and 19.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.120
Between 16 and 20, both sexes
are twice as likely to be in

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.550
accidents than drivers between
20 and 50, twice the

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:52.920
accidental rate.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.270
Adolescents are more likely to
engage in impulsive sexual

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:57.280
behavior and multiple
partners.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.770
Annually, three million
adolescents contract a sexual

01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:00.680
transmitted disease.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.710
So lots of things that are risky
behaviors occur with

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:07.830
high frequency in a demonstrable
way, on average,

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.840
among adolescents.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.150
Young kids don't drive yet.

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:15.730
20-year-olds are a bit more
mature in their driving.

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:20.350
So part of this is, again,
attitudinal.

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:22.720
Here's a question that people
were asked about future

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.610
perspectives.

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.970
They were asked, I would rather
save my money for a

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:29.930
rainy day than spend it on
something fun right now.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.030
In your 20s, a little bit.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.700
That's growing.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.020
You'll keep the dollar.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.590
But the younger you are in your
teenage years, the more

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:44.080
like who wants to wait.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.620
Let's do it now.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:50.660
So moving from something fun
to something experimental,

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.910
let's put together a
couple last things.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.420
So here's a thing we did before
several times in this

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.800
class, creating false
memories.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.950
And you remember the way they
create false memories in the

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.870
laboratory is they pick a word
they don't present to you,

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:04.072
like sweet.

01:02:04.072 --> 01:02:06.960
Then they ask many students to
say what words go with that

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.360
word, like sour, or
candy, or sugar?

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.540
They present you this list.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.940
And then they test
you for this word

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.370
that was not presented.

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.890
And people often imagine
incorrectly that they heard or

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:18.750
saw this word.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:20.060
We've done that a
couple of times.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.700
It's a way to show
illusory memory.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.810
And the way we understand
it is basically this.

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:29.520
Your memory, your mind, mostly
thinks about the essence of

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.750
things, not the details
of things.

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:34.790
The essence of things was
everything is sweet.

01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:38.820
The details were the specific
words in the list.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:43.680
So let's look at older adults
versus younger adults,

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.450
80-year-olds versus 20-year-olds
and exactly this

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:46.310
experiment.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.280
Older adults have many
more false memories.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.110
And they perform less well.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:54.480
So to a scary extend, the
healthy 70-year-olds, here's

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.220
their real memories.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.460
Here's their false memories.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.640
It's dead even.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.610
Here's young people having lots
of false memories, but

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.380
not as many as older
people, and having

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.010
more correct memories.

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:07.310
So older adults have more
false memories, because

01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:09.780
they're encoding the
gist a lot, but

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.950
they're losing the specifics.

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:11.480
Does that make sense?

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.190
And you're really vulnerable
to false memories.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.930
Children, you might think,
well children,

01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:18.890
what do they know?

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:21.790
Children have less false
memories than you do.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:25.420
You would have less false
memories at age five than you

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.640
would right now, which
is kind of amazing.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.220
If you didn't do the experiment,
you'd imagine

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.880
children would be totally
confused.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.890
They'd get a big
list of words.

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:32.830
Was sweet on the list?

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:33.190
I don't know.

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:34.660
Yeah, sure.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.160
A five-year-old does better than
a seven, does better than

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.820
an 11-year-old, does better
than a 20-year-old.

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.200
Why?

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.970
Why does a five-year-old have
less false memories under the

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.310
circumstances?

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:51.370
Well, we understand that to be
the price of having a mind

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.180
that understands
a lot of gist.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.580
As you become older, you
understand what's important,

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:56.090
what counts.

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:57.540
It's not the little details.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.110
It's the big concepts.

01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:02.900
So here's an example of, for
example, how well people can

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.550
relate words across sentences.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.590
And that grows from
six to nine.

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:09.320
And that's what we want.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.620
You don't want to read
word, word, word.

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:15.640
You want to say, what's the
point of the sentence?

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.380
That process of saying, I don't
care about the detail.

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:23.600
I care about the concept, the
gist of the concept, it's like

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.220
the chess players.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.320
You shed the specific
details to gain the

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.050
overall knowledge advantage.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:32.130
But the five-year-old is not
making the big picture.

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.440
They're just getting
the little details.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.395
So they're less prone to
the illusory memories.

01:04:38.395 --> 01:04:39.310
We can't see that.

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.420
But this is just showing that
when it comes to organizing

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:46.650
memories, you see that develop
across a childhood.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:47.370
Last couple of things.

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:49.070
Because when I heard this a few
years ago at a conference,

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.540
I was so surprised by
these findings.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.160
And I've been around long enough
that i don't get as

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.000
surprised as often
as I used to.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.100
But it's kind of really
interesting.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.490
It's a total twist.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.700
And you can make a judgment
call about how

01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.280
to interpret it.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.060
But here's the experiments
and the data.

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.770
So, again, we have this picture
that everybody likes

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:06.290
because it fits with the
stereotype, which is the

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:07.600
teenager out of control.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.190
Their dopamine is going up.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:12.460
And they're saying, let's do a
lot of inappropriate things.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.810
Because it will be rewarding.

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:16.780
I know everybody's against it.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.740
So that's the stereotype.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.550
And probably there's something
true about that.

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:20.730
Literally, in the brain
imaging, it

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:23.010
looks somewhat true.

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:24.680
But let's think about
this for a moment.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.760
You're going to be
good at this.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.660
If line a--

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.960
these are lines-- is longer than
b, and line b is longer

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.100
than line c, is a
longer than c?

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:32.470
Yes.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.990
All right.

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:34.240
This is MIT.

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:40.120
Now answer this question
truly.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.530
Think about it for a moment.

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.040
Person a is a friend
or person b.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.070
So let's pretend you're person
b and your friend was a.

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:46.015
You're also a friend with c.

01:05:46.015 --> 01:05:49.410
Are a and c likely
to be friends?

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:50.450
Let's think about this.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:53.660
Is it mathematically transitive
like this one?

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.720
No.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.100
Let's think about
it for a moment.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:00.630
In your experience through life,
on average, are your

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.940
friends mostly kind of going
to like each other?

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:07.800
Kind of, not all the
time, but kind of?

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.500
Yeah, probably.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.670
Because if one person likes you,
and another person likes

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:12.620
you, you share interests.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.660
You share background to a
certain extent, in a loose

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.610
statistical way.

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:17.840
It's not definitive like this.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.250
So let's take a look at what
happens when you ask you two

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.890
questions to grades
one through four.

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:23.950
OK, these kids are just
making mistakes.

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:24.920
And they're getting smarter.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.120
But look at this one go
up just like that.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.050
So we can say this is a growth
in logical ability.

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:36.120
This is a growth in your
everyday sense that I hang out

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.540
with a certain kind of person.

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.130
Maybe they like football.

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.590
Maybe they like skating.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.750
Maybe they like psychology.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.520
but that's the group I tend
to hang out with.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.630
And, on average, if I have a
friend, it's because we share

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:52.370
some interests, or
style of being.

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:54.480
And if I have another friend,
we probably share that too.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:00.790
So more than chance, they
might like each other.

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:03.460
So this is this idea that you
can separate out what you

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.600
might call purely logical
analysis of things versus a

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.930
growth of social experience,
basically.

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:14.240
So the last three
slides or so.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.520
You remember this from a bit
back, from a prior example.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.000
We said there's a framing
heuristic.

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:22.550
People are risk averse
for gains.

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:24.370
But they're risk-taking
for losses.

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:25.750
If we said here's a program.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:26.810
We did this before.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:31.760
If Program A is adopted,
200 people are saved.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.760
Or here's 400 people will
die out of 600.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.630
That's the same statement.

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:39.400
But because this is stated
as a gain, people

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.520
usually like this.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.980
Because this is stated
as a loss, people

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.180
usually don't like this.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:47.750
Adults are risk averse for
gains, and they're risk-taking

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:48.295
for losses.

01:07:48.295 --> 01:07:50.570
If something looks like
a loss, roll the dice.

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:53.370
If something looks like it's
going to work out, go with it,

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:55.170
even though numerically,
these are identical.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.400
You can't see this.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.040
I can tell you.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.190
It's not present in

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.160
preschoolers or second graders.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.390
Preschoolers or second graders,
when you give them

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:11.960
these kinds of problems, they
don't show the asymmetry for

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.560
losses and gains.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.940
That's something that
happens over time.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.950
And it's not a logical one.

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:18.450
Logically, it should be that.

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:22.330
So in that weird sense, the
preschooler is more logical

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:25.979
than you and I, more logical
than you and I. Because

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:27.830
there's no reason to be
statistically different for

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:28.689
losses and gains.

01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:32.250
That's purely an attitudinal
emotional perspective.

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:33.680
First of all, you can hear
the information-seeking.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.460
Let's check it out.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:37.770
That's kind of interesting,
swimming with sharks.

01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:40.830
I can assure you 70-year-olds
are not going to go, hey, that

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:41.539
can be kind of interesting.

01:08:41.539 --> 01:08:42.370
They're going, no!

01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:42.840
Terrible idea!

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.770
Don't do it!

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:46.006
Yeah?

01:08:46.006 --> 01:08:48.880
AUDIENCE: Were they asked
in a group collectively?

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.359
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.540
You see some peer influence.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.310
Yeah.

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.290
And that doesn't happen with
adolescents, right?

01:08:58.890 --> 01:08:59.170
They do this.

01:08:59.170 --> 01:08:59.990
They go, oh my gosh.

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:01.550
These are these teenagers who
are going to go do all these

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.870
things, and get horrible sexual
diseases, and drive

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.149
while they are impaired.

01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:08.420
And that's just the beginning
of their weekend.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.370
Because they're not going to
follow all the advice that we

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:11.950
gave them for years, and years,
and years, and years,

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:13.510
at home and in school.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:15.170
So here's the flip on this.

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.430
And just think about
it for a moment.

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:19.100
It's complicated.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.350
Swimming with sharks, the adults
say, you don't have to

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.050
tell me any more.

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:24.300
It's a bad idea.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.160
The gist is sharks, bad.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.450
I don't even need to hear
the rest of the story.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:31.890
Adolescents start to
weigh the factors.

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:33.140
We'd be safer in a group.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.620
Is it dark or night outside?

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.370
How shallow is the water?

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.500
And you can say, well, it's
kind of ridiculous.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.120
But it's not totally
ridiculous.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.500
Because when we talk about
danger, those are some of the

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.109
things you might start
to think about.

01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:51.109
So by this analysis, having
unprotected sex.

01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:53.939
Adults, bad, bad, bad.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:54.510
OK?

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:56.280
I mean really bad.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.700
Adolescents, well, let's
think about this.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.350
What's the gain?

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:05.660
Well, we hear that sex is
highly pleasurable.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.000
What's the loss?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.120
All these things everybody's
telling us.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.030
What's the odds, purely
statistically, that for a

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:17.400
single, sexual experience, you
will have the pleasure of sex,

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.360
but you will end up with
a terrible disease?

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.135
What's the odds for
one outing?

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.230
What do you think?

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.080
Here's the complexity.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.450
Some people argue that
adolescents are actually more

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:34.310
accurate in their assessment
of risk, not

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:35.720
wise in their choice.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.490
Do you understand the point?

01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:40.280
They're actually doing the
calculations, whereas adults

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.170
just go, sharks bad.

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:45.690
Sexually transmitted
diseases, avoid.

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:48.450
You're not parsing through the
exact odds and circumstances,

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:51.070
the trade-offs between
exploration and pleasure and

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:52.720
responsibility and safety.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.280
You just have the gist,
the line, that's it.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.170
That's my wisdom that
I've gotten.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:57.900
Sharks, bad.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.720
Sexually transmitted
disease, bad.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.520
That's it.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.790
And these teenagers are kind
of curiously thinking about

01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:04.430
what are the factors.

01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:06.270
And you could say, it's
not the best analysis.

01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:08.960
But you could say it's
almost more rational.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.000
Just like the older adults will
make more gist errors in

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.600
memory, they will be more
emotional in their

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.130
avoidance of risk.

01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:19.550
So it's very complicated.

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:21.540
It's not just dopamine
flushing.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.950
It's also in the brain.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.840
It's also something about how
risk is perceived at different

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.820
ages and what information
is available to you.

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.220
All right.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.470
Thanks very much.
