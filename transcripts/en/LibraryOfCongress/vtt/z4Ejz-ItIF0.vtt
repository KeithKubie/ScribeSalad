Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:23.040

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.520
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Dooley: I want to welcome

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.120

like to introduce myself.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.650

the Library I want to note

Business Section here at the Library

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.740
that a program on, such as Dorie's,
on standing out in our profession

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.160
and in the workplace would
be an awesome program

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.240

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.150
[ Applause ]

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.790
&gt;&gt; Dorie Clark: Thank
you so much, Yvonne.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.640
All right, I'm used to having
clip-on mikes and being able

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.490
to wander around a little bit, so
I'm going to contain my impulses

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.550
and stand here in front of you

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.860
because they're recording
this session here,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.430
but thanks so much for coming out.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.680
Today, we're going to be talking
a little bit, as Yvonne indicated,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.910
about how to stand out at work.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.130
I mean the world that we live
in today is a lot like this.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.010
In fact, this was probably your
metro commute this morning.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.290
We live in a world where literally
in the past minute that Yvonne was

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.530
up on stage doing the
introduction, when I wrote Stand

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.680
Out the statistic then
it was 100 hours

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.140
of YouTube video was
uploaded every minute.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.390
That is now obsolete, its 300 hours

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.060
of YouTube video is
uploaded every single minute.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.950
We are in an era where even if
we wanted to, even if we tried

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.900
to consume all the information that
is out there it's a losing battle

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.630
and we're falling farther
and farther behind every day.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.700
We can't do it.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.100
And the problem with that
professionally for all of us is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.850
that it's not just us that is
feeling that burden, everyone is.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.640
The average professional gets
about 100 e-mails per day.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.330
This is a number that is increasing

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.680
at a compounded rate
of 15% per year.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.790
If it's not unsustainable now,
it is very rapidly becoming so.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.030
And with all of these obligations,
these meetings, these e-mails,

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.480
these things that we're supposed
to read, the tweets we're supposed

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.150
to respond to, what
gets left behind is

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.690
that other people are not
really able to tune in and pay

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.790
that close attention to
you and to who you are

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.250
and to what you're doing.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.810
Even your boss, even the people
who are theoretically responsible

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.440
for watching out for you and your
career arc oftentimes just don't

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.320
have the bandwidth to do it.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.750
And, consequently, unless we want

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.150
to live our professional lives
essentially buffeted by fate

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.300
and just ending up where we happen
to land, we need to somehow begin

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.000
to start taking control of
our brand, of our narrative,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.340
of how we are known by others

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.750
so that our true talents
can actually be heard

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.170
and understood and appreciated.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.750
Otherwise, if we don't do it,
frankly, no one else will.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.900
Now I fully recognize that
there are some challenges

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.590
and perhaps some resistance
to the phrase personal brand,

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.530
and so let me just rewind for a
minute and take a step back to talk

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.800
about where it comes from.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.450
This is actually the
genesis right here,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.510
this is a 1997 fast
company cover story.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.940
It was written by a guy named Tom
Peters, who was known in the 1980s

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.280
as one of the original
management gurus.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.720
He wrote a bestselling book
called In Search of Excellence

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.420
that was very popular in the '80s,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.320
it sold more than two
million copies.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.050
But 15 years after that
he wrote this cover story,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.350
The Brand Called You.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.360
And you'll note it
is not an accident

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.940
that it has the Tide
colors and logo.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.470
The idea, and some people loved
it and some people hated it,

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.620
was is it true, should
we think about it,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.140
that people have brands the way
that a detergent is a brand?

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.950
What are we to make of that?

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.750
And a lot of people get sort
of offended by that concept

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.160
because they say, well, you know
what, I'm a lot more than a soap

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.140
or a cereal or a detergent, I am
a complex and unique individual

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.780
and I don't want to have to resort
to selling myself in this way.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.520 position:56%
And so when they think if personal
brand this is what they think about.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.480
But I want to posit something
slightly different to you,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.130
which is that even though
personal brand is a charm

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:57.740
that was invented fairly recently,
you know, 19 years ago now,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.090
what that phrase is referring
to, what it is talking

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.970
about is something that has
existed not for 20 years,

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.280
but from the beginning of time.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.750
Personal brands is really just
a synonym for your reputation,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.590
that is what we are talking about.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.240
And if we frame it that
way it begins to put it

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.060
into a little bit more
contextual clarity.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.790
You wouldn't really hear
a professional say, well,

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.360
I don't care what my
reputation is or why do I have

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.760
to have a reputation, the way that
they might about a personal brand.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.270
Because when you get down
to it your reputation

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.020
in a lot of ways is all there is.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.150
How, if you lose a job how are
you going to find another one?

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.540 position:56%
If you want to move into a different
career, you want to get promoted,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.890
how are you going to make
sure that you're the person

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.720
that gets chosen for that?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.780
Ideally it's because you have a
reputation that speaks for you.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.250
Ideally it's that people think

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.510
of you the way you would
like to be thought of.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.250
You can't opt out of having a
reputation or personal brand.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.130
People think something about you.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.350
The question is what do
they think and does it match

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.410
up with what you would wish?

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:31.440
And so what I wanted to talk to
you about today is this process,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.980
which for me actually
was a very personal one.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.810
I started to think
about personal brand,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:45.240
to learn about personal brand
now fifteenish years ago.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.740 position:56%
I started my career as a newspaper
reporter, and I have this cover here

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.990
because this I saved probably
about 20 of these in my attic.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:00.860
This was the very first cover story
that I ever had for my newspaper.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.820
And at the time we, you know,
I was a Political Reporter,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.520
it was a newspaper that had
a little bit of politics,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.820
a little bit of everything.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:17.280 position:56%
In fact, you will note at the top
here we covered some truly important

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.580
issues here.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.850
I don't know if you could
see that, In Sync vs. Hanson,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:27.110
very critical at the time.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.680
[laughter] But I love
my job as a Reporter,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.930
but unfortunately I was part
of the first wave of layoffs.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.960
Now this today is not too unusual.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.370
Actually, literally, just two weeks
ago I looked up the statistic,

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.330
I needed it for a paper
I was writing.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.090
I looked up the statistic and would
you believe this is the number

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.750
from the American Society of
Newspaper Editors from 2000

00:10:52.750 --> 00:11:01.380
to last year, 42% of American
journalists lost their jobs.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.830
That's decimation of a profession.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:11.110
But I had the good fortune, you
could say, maybe the bad fortune

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.500
of being one of the earliest
people to be in that wave.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.900
I lost my job in 2001, and
I wanted to stay a reporter,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.080
but to be honest I couldn't,
there weren't any jobs available.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.360
And so I had to reinvent
myself, and I feel fortunate

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.830
that in the intervening
years I've been able

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.130
to do a lot of cool things.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.440
I went from reporting on
politics to working in politics,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.420
perhaps some of the people
here in the crowd do the same,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.200
but I was a Press Secretary
on a Gubernatorial Campaign,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.100
I was the Spokesperson on
a Presidential Campaign.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.720
You'll note I never moved to
Washington because we lost.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.000
[laughter] But, you know, I tried.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.870
I ran a nonprofit for
a couple of years.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.300
And eventually about a decade ago
I started doing what I'm doing now,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.670
consulting, writing and
speaking and teaching.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.870
But what I learned through
all of those reinventions was

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.270
that when I would talk to
people that I knew, you know,

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.930
I'd run into somebody that
I hadn't seen for awhile,

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:19.310 position:56%
and inevitably they'd be glad to
see me, they'd be happy to catch up,

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:26.370
but they would ask me about the job
that I had had like three jobs ago.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.830
They were not keeping
up with what I did.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.590
And it was pretty dramatic
at the time

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.290
because I was changing
careers pretty frequently.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.600
But something I realized is
that even if your changes

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.160
and transitions are less
dramatic, even if you've just been

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
at the same company but
you've been promoted

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.330
or you shifted functional roles
or even if you have stayed

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.900 position:56%
in the same position over the period

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.610
of a few years you have
been learning and growing.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.330
You have been experimenting
and doing new things.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.560
You've been gaining new skills.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.930
And the truth is other people
oftentimes are blind to that,

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.010
their perceptions of
us are stuck in time.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.890
They are fossilized in amber.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:20.770
And unless we somehow break
through and get them to notice

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.940
and to be aware of the changes
that we have been through

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.490 position:56%
and what we have been learning and
where we are going now they're going

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.020
to think of us in that old way and
it means that we will not be top

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.150
of mind for the kind of
opportunities that we want now.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.630
So how do we solve that puzzle?

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.560
How do we break through
that conundrum?

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.010
I'd like to talk to you today
about a three-step process,

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:54.310 position:56%
which I learned about in the course
of writing my book, Reinventing You,

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:59.370
which really sprung from
initially the idea came

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.010
from my own experiences
reinventing myself,

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.210
but in writing the book I
interviewed dozens and dozens

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.300
of successful professionals who
had made these transitions to try

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.520
to understand what made it work
for them, what enabled them

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.330
to be successful, so that
hopefully we could get some common

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:22.240
characteristics and begin to carve
out a bit of a roadmap for people.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.110
What I realized is that
fundamentally standing out at work,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.430
reinventing yourself to the
place that you want to go

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.390
so that you can have
the career that you want

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.460
to have is a three-step process.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.590
First, discovering
your brand because,

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.300 position:56%
as we said, no one is a tabula rasa.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.060
Second is creating your
brand, proactively setting

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.340
out what you want to be and
how you want to be known.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.900
And, third, living your brand,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.590
manifesting it on a
day-to-day basis.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.680
So let's start from the beginning,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.800
let's talk about how
we discover our brand.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.540
One of the things that I suggest

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.420
in Reinventing You is something
called the three-word exercise,

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.960
and the reason that I do this is
that what I discovered in talking

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.200
with many professionals
and interviewing a lot

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.280
of executive coaches, people that
work with the creme de la creme,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.000
you know, of course we
all have blind spots,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.930
of course there are things
that we don't really recognize

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.030
about ourselves, but
there's something

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.920
that is even a bit more
profound than that.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.650
Because the truth is by and large
we probably have a decent sense

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.760
of who we are, maybe how
we're seen by other people.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.980
There could be exceptions,
but we have an okay sense.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.240
But there's one piece that even
the smartest among us have real

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:01.110
difficulty with, and that is
knowing what it is about us

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:06.520
that is most unique or most
distinctive in the eyes

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.000
of other people because the truth
is we know ourselves too well.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.380 position:56%
Everything about us is normal to us.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.290
You could read a book a day,
you could blitz through a book

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:26.920
in an hour and you'd never know
that was abnormal until you talked

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.120 position:56%
to other people and they said, whoa,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.590
you read that fast,
that's incredible.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.030
And it's like it for almost
any other trait that we have.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:40.480
We don't know what is different
or unique or exceptional except

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.720
when other people shine a light
on it and point it out to us,

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.540
which means that oftentimes
we're really missing the boat

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.890
when it comes to understanding
our strengths.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.190
And so this activity that I
suggest, it takes two minutes,

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.730
it is not a hard thing
to ask other people.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.170
Basically, what it entails is
over the course of the next week

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.610
or so ask about let's say half a
dozen people, friends, colleagues,

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.340
people who know you decently well.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.640
I mean ask them this question,
if you had to describe me

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.860
in only three words
what would they be?

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.890
It's pretty simple, pretty fast,
it takes them a minute to answer,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.480
and they should in fact answer
off the top of their head.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.650 position:56%
But what becomes telling about it
is by the time you get to the third,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.130
the fourth, the fifth person
I guarantee you are going

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.940
to see patterns in what they are
saying and you'll begin to get more

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.520
of an understanding of
what other people see

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.160
as being uniquely different,
uniquely meaningful about you,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.930
begins to give you some clues about
strengths that you can leverage.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.790
But I also want to point out your
strengths are an important building

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:02.720
block, but it's not the whole game.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.590
This is a woman that I profile in
Reinventing You named Libby Wagner,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:13.670
and I loved telling Libby's story
in the book because oftentimes

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.200
when we hear reinvention
stories there's kind of a way

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.990
that they go typically in
the American psyche, right?

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.140
And the way that a story

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.240
about reinvention typically
goes is you have someone

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.920
who is this hard charging
professional, you know,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.170
they're a management
consultant, let's say,

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.940
and they really do some
soul-searching and they say,

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.160
all right, I'm going to do
what I am passionate about

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.980
and they go off and
they become a poet.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.980
And we tell the story, and we
say, oh, that's so amazing,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.300
they found what they
were meant to do,

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.010
they lived the dream
and we celebrate that.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.510
And that is worth celebrating,
that's a great thing,

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.550
we should all be doing things
we are passionate about.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:04.310
But what I liked about Libby's
story is that that story,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.130
the archetypal one,
it's not the only story.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:15.740
Libby was a poet, she had an MFA,
she was a University Professor,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.260 position:56%
she published three books of poetry.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.720
She was established,
she was successful.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.740
She decided to give it
all up, quit her job,

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.910
and she became a Management
Consultant.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:36.570 position:56%
[laughter] And to tell you the truth
that's actually even harder to do.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.630
We can understand why a Management
Consultant might want to be a poet,

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.440
but no one understood
why Libby wanted

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.660
to become a Management Consultant.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.230
But she was interested
in making change,

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.540
and she thought an organization
is a place you can really do it.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.830 position:56%
But she was worried, she thought
that no one would take her seriously

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.230
if they knew that she was a poet,

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.130
that that was her training
and her background.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.150
So her solution to it was
she didn't tell anyone,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.040
she literally kept it a secret

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.960
for the first few years
she was in business.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.900
She did not talk about
her background, at all,

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:23.190
and she told me she basically
lived in fear of discovery.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:28.000
But slowly over time she began to
realize that nobody cared too much,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.390
nobody was badgering her, asking,
well, where did you get your MBA?

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.350
What they cared about was results,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.210
and she was getting
results for people.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:44.950 position:56%
And a little more time passed and
she began to realize something else,

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.690
which is that even though it
was very true that the people

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.490
who had MBAs and had
traditional training had things

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.800
that Libby didn't, she
had things they didn't.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.430
She began to realize that if you
are a corporate CEO and, let's say,

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.810
you have some sensitive
communication that you want to get

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.520
across well, thoughtfully,
effectively to your staff,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.680
to your customers, to
your stakeholders, maybe,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.480
just maybe the person
you actually want to have

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.250
on your side is the person who has
spent a lifetime immersing herself

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.070
in language and who
has trained for years

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:32.650
to understand the nuance of words.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.320
And so she slowly began
to come out as a poet,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.850
she would tell a few people
at first and then a few more.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.810
Eventually, she started an
e-mail newsletter called The

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.110
Boardroom Poet.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:50.190
Eventually, she started to
have workshops about language

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.400
and literature and business
and how they all fit together,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.820
and she began to realize that what

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:01.270
in her mind had been
her biggest weakness,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.940
the thing she was most
afraid of having discovered,

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.240
the fact that she had trained

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.940
as a poet actually
could become a strength

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.200
and a competitive advantage.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.030
So when we're discovering
us, when we are thinking

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.790
about who we are now, what
our current brand is it pays

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:23.930
to understand our strengths,
but it also pays to think

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:29.750
about our weaknesses because those
may be like Libby our strengths

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.820
in disguise if we frame
it the right way and begin

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.390
to understand it in that light.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:41.790
But, of course, that's just the
first part, discovering our brand.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:46.700
What comes next is creating
it, proactively thinking

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.020
about who we want to be, how
we want to be known to others.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.680
And so I wanted to share
a few stories with you.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.440
This is a gentleman
named Michael Lecky.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:06.030
Michael is someone that I profiled
in my most recent book, Stand Out.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:10.410
And I was interested in
his story because in a lot

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.070
of ways it's a situation
that many of us face.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.910
Michael was an executive in
a large research company,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:23.200 position:56%
he was a Vice President of Human
Resources, and he had responsibility

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.510
for a lot of different things
related to talent development.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.590 position:56%
He began to become really
interested in coaching and training.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.160
Now this was something that was
kind of related to his job duties,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.830
but it wasn't part of his
official job description.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:45.360 position:56%
He was certainly not responsible
for getting good at coaching people,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.330
that was not really
something that he needed

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.820
to do, but it fascinated him.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.850
He was interested in it, he
wanted to learn more about it.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:24:00.830 position:56%
And so his company had hired an
outside consultant that they brought

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.890
in to help with coaching,
and Michael took his course,

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.510
thought it was really great.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:12.100
And so because he started with
a spark of interest he decided

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.380
to follow it up and
see where it led.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.700
So he reached out to the
consultant and he said, hey,

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.620
the next time you're offering this
could I help you, could I assist?

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.350
And he started in small
ways, you know,

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.210
you can start by helping people
set up or break down or clean up,

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.570
you can start by helping
people make handouts

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.270 position:56%
or lead discussion groups at tables.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:42.510
But he volunteered to assist,
and before too long he started

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.350
to make himself indispensable,
he was pretty helpful.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:50.580 position:56%
And so he began to co-lead the
seminars and over time he got better

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.590
and better, and he eventually
began leading them himself.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:25:01.290 position:56%
Now what happened inside his company
is that before too long he began

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:06.160
to really develop a reputation as
the person inside his organization

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.040
who knew about coaching
and training.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.110
He didn't start out that
way, he didn't start

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.850
out with any more knowledge than
anyone else, but he had an interest

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.960
and a willingness to learn.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.220
And what he told me when I
interviewed him for Stand Out is

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:29.100
that if you are humble and
recognize where you're coming from,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.150
you can't immediately start out
and say, oh, I'm the expert,

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.760
but if you're clear about what
you know and what you don't know

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.810
and you're willing to
share that knowledge

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.030
with others along the way
they're going to be appreciative

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:47.150
and they're going to start to
seek you out because you're going

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.380
to become a big fish
in a small pond.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.240
You don't have to know the most
about coaching and training

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.830
in the world, but if you
know more than the people

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.410
around you you make
yourself an invaluable

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.700
and indispensable resource.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.760
It doesn't take a lot to
develop and expert reputation,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.810
just a little focus, just a little
humility, just a little willingness

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:18.060
to tell other people and help
them along with you as you learn.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:22.310
One of the other pieces that
becomes critical as we think

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:28.170 position:56%
about how we get known for the brand
that we want, how to begin spreading

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.100
that inside and outside
our organizations,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.010
is the circle of people
that you have around you.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.190
This is a woman that I profile
in Stand Out named Cary Anderson.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.370
And I've known Cary
for a number of years,

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.550
and one day she told
me something that was

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.460
so unusual it just
captured my attention,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.880
and I thought I have
to tell this story.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.180
And here's what it was.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:01.520
A lot of people have mastermind
groups, you could call them,

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.380
personal Boards of Directors.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.700
This is a concept that goes
back 80 plus years to the world

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.500
of Napoleon Hill, you know,
little groups of people

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.830
that get together regularly to
hold each other accountable,

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.270
talk about their businesses,
et cetera.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.900 position:56%
That's, you know, it's a cool thing,
but it's not an uncommon thing.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.390
So Cary has a couple of those,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:29.420
but the part that was amazingly
uncommon is she told me

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:35.230
that one group that she's been
meeting with was formed in 1989

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:42.700
and the other in 1994 and they have
been meeting every single month

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:49.550
since then, now for more than
20 years and more than 25 years.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:54.000
she told me that the people in
these groups with her outside

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.270
of her immediate family are
the people that know her best

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.360
in the entire world
and that participation

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.500
in the group has become for
her the defining characteristic

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.620
of her professional life because
they are the people that know her

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.520
so well, when they give her
feedback, when they give her ideas,

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.190
when they push back
on her a little bit,

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:24.280
she knows that she can trust it
implicitly because they know her

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:30.350
so well and they have no agenda,
they have her best interests

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.980
at heart, which is something
that perhaps too often

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.570
in our modern life we lack.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:46.560
Now what Cary's story bring sup for
me is this, when I talk to groups

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.390
of professionals I'll ask
them sometimes, you know,

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.350
who do you spend time with?

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.570
Who are the people that
you surround yourself with,

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:59.880
the people that you have lunches
and meetings and coffee with?

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.500 position:56%
And oftentimes what I hear is, well,
it's the people who e-mailed me

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:11.790
and asked or it's the people
that I happen to sit next to,

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.960
it's the people that I happen
to be working on a project with.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:22.660
If our professional lives
are defined by the people

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:29.350
that we connect with, why so
often do we leave that to chance?

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.820
We need to start getting
deliberate about who we want

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.980
to surround ourselves with, who
we want to be learning from.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.940
And so I will challenge
you, as you go home today,

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:46.070
go back to your desks, to ask
yourself who are the people,

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:54.160 position:56%
the three or five or seven people in
your life that you respect the most,

00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:02.010
that you want most to learn from,
the people whose skills you wish

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:04.680
that you could be more like?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.340
How can you arrange it proactively

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.600
to spend more time
with those people?

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:17.330
We learn through osmosis,
we learn through presence.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:22.420
How can we change our behavior
just a little bit so that we can be

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.450
around the people who bring
out the best in ourselves?

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.410
Because the truth is
those are the people

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.390
who can become your
brand ambassadors,

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:37.300 position:56%
the people who can give you the
feedback you need to take your ideas

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.370
to the next level, and
the people who inside

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.180
and outside your organization
can represent you to other people

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:50.130
and help you get the opportunities
that are dearest to your goals.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:55.190
Now in this professional
world that we live

00:30:55.190 --> 00:31:00.970
in what we're fundamentally
known for is our ideas,

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.460
and this can be a little
bit tricky sometimes

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.310
because ideas are ineffable, right?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:12.600
How do we know if somebody's
ideas are good?

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.900
We have to share them.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:19.520
We have to find ways of expressing
them and we have to really think

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.590
about how we can start prompting
ourselves to think differently

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.930
so that the ideas that we generate
are not just the same thing

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.440
that everyone else is doing.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.350
You know, in a global networked
world the world doesn't need more

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:42.350
of the same, the world needs
people who are suggesting things

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:45.090
that other people haven't
seen or thought of yet.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.340
But the question is how do we
put ourselves into that state?

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.700
How do we make that
more likely to happen?

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.670
And so I wanted to share with
you a story about someone

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.210
who actually is a local,
at least originally.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.510
Her name is Rose Schuman
[Assumed Spelling] and she grew

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.000
up in the suburbs of Maryland.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.780
Now up until when she was about
18 years old she had a pretty

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.770
traditional upbringing
in suburban Maryland,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:18.030
but when she was 18 she took
a family trip to Nicaragua,

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.210
which is where her
stepmother was from,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.820 position:56%
to go visit the stepmother's family.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:28.320
And that was something that
changed the course of her life.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.340
It was shortly after the end
of the Contra War in Nicaragua,

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.770
and when she went there the
country was in disarray.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:41.840
There was one functioning
streetlight in the entire country.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:46.670
The systems, the institutions that
she had taken for granted growing

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.350
up 20 miles from here
were nowhere to be found.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.630
And that was when she decided
she wanted to devote her life

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.540
to development work,
and that's what she did.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.560
She went to school for
it and she graduated.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.810
Took a job with an NGO.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:10.650 position:56%
And so a few years later she found
herself one day walking around town,

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:14.830
wandering around, and she
was thinking about a puzzle,

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:19.890
a problem that had occupied
her for years and, in fact,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:24.230
it had occupied a lot of people
for years, which was the question

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.990
of how can we harness
the power of the internet

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.990
for the world's poorest people?

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:35.350
Now there had been a lot of
reasonably good solutions to that.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.780
Many of you may, for instance,

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.990
have heard of the one
laptop per child initiative,

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.360
pretty good idea, right?

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.790
Cheap laptops, give them
to people, it's great,

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.830
but that's not still
a perfect solution,

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:53.820
particularly if we're talking about
the poorest people in the world.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.170
Because the truth is the
laptops might be cheap,

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.610
but they're still a little
pricey, costs money to make them.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.930
If you're giving them to someone
the people who receive them have

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:09.480
to have a safe place
to store a laptop,

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.370
which is not necessarily true
for the world's poorest people.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.440
You have to assume if you give
them the laptop and want them

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.640
to access the internet
they have to be literate,

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.090
which we cannot always
take for granted

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.350
with the world's poorest people.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:31.690
And even more to the point they
have to be literate in a language

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:38.380
that is widespread on the internet,
and if we take that to the extreme

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:44.590
of the poorest one billion people
that is almost never the case.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:50.190
So how do you bring the power
of the internet to them?

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:56.220
Well, one day Rose was walking
around and she noticed something,

00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.470
she noticed something that she
had seen a million times before

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.870
and you probably have seen
a million times before,

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:10.000
maybe even this morning on your
commute, which is a call box

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.140
like you'd find at
a transit station.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.380
You push a button, talk to
somebody on the other end,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.690
they answer your question.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:22.300
And she realized if you
could put call boxes

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.670
in the world's poorest places
people wouldn't even need

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:31.390
to understand the concept of
the internet to take advantage

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.070
of the power of the internet.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:39.160
And so, thus, was launched
Question Box.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.830
She told me that she spent the
next four hours feverishly writing

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.160
in her journal coming up with
the idea, sketching it out,

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.400
and she spent the next decade of
her life working to implement it.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:59.530 position:56%
Today Question Box operates in India
and in many countries in Africa,

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:03.830
and it literally is a call box
that is placed in villages,

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:07.630
people can go up, push a button and
they are connected on the other end

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:12.320
of the line to a bilingual
operator in a centralized location

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.650
who will Google the answer to
whatever question they have.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.240
And, in fact, the recent
Ebola epidemic

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.270
in Liberia Question Box became a
critical tool for the people there

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:29.990
because most of the international
aid workers had been evacuated

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.080
and one of the few ways that people

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.700
in remote villages could get
accurate information about Ebola

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:41.440 position:56%
and preventing its spread was
through the use of the Question Box.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:47.320
I tell you this story because
when it comes to being known

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.150 position:56%
for our ideas, which is
fundamentally as a knowledge worker,

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:58.520
as a professional today, one of
the best things that we can do

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.730
for our brand, for our
reputation, so much of it starts

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:09.150
with doing what other people
are not, which is noticing.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:16.890
Instead of being glued with our
heads down we need to notice what's

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.220
around us and make connections.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:26.900
And one final thought on
creating ideas and connecting,

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.210
sometimes when I talk
about developing ideas,

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.580
being known for your ideas, I
hear from people and they say, oh,

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.860
that's great, that's
wonderful, but I can't do that,

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:42.050
I don't have any brilliant ideas,
maybe other people do, I don't.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:47.990
And that brings me
to Daniel Goleman.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:50.360
Some of you guys may
be familiar with him,

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.070
you're almost certainly
familiar with his work.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:57.990
Daniel Goleman is an Author, who is
the bestselling Author of the book,

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:03.280
Emotional Intelligence, which was
a bestseller literally for years,

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.410
spent years atop the New York
Times Bestseller List in the 1990s.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.430
The Harvard Business Review called
Emotional intelligence the most

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:16.850
important management
insight of the decade.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:21.530
Now emotional intelligence, of
course, you're probably familiar

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:28.720
with it, it is the idea
that IQ is not everything,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.560
it's not just about your
intellectual horsepower,

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.170
it's about how you
behave in the world,

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.480
how you relate to other people.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.310
That might, in fact,
be far more predictive

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:44.390
of your ultimate success
personally and professionally.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.010
Today that's well understood,
well accepted,

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.440
but when Daniel Goleman
wrote his book it was not IQ,

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.850
for the past 50 years had
been the be all and end all

00:38:55.850 --> 00:39:02.280 position:56%
of how people measured and predicted
one's success later in life.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.720
I didn't know a lot
about Daniel Goleman

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.400
when I started writing Stand
Out, but I was interested.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.430
I thought where this idea
has become so seminal,

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.180
where did it come from,
how did he develop it?

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.480 position:56%
And because I hadn't given it a lot
of thought, what I assumed, frankly,

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.380
was I assumed he was a researcher

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.520
and that he had written a
book about his research.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.880
But I looked into it
and I discovered

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.610
that was actually not true.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:37.020
Daniel Goleman was a reporter,
he was a science reporter,

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.930
and he read a journal
article about the study

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:45.290
that showed emotional
intelligence was so critical.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:49.850
And he said this is important.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:54.820
People need to know about this,
but if he had not popularized it,

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.850
if he had not taken
it and brought it

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:02.800
to the mainstream probably it would
have remained a relatively obscure

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:09.480
phenomenon that only a few
researchers really knew about.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.330
When I was writing Stand Out I
interviewed a couple of gentlemen

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:18.210
who are behind a biennial ranking

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:22.920
of the world's greatest management
thinkers, it's called Thinkers 50.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.940
And I asked them, you
know, what does make

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.750
for a great management thinker?

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.320
And they told me something
fascinating, their perspective,

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.480
they said, was that when
it comes to a truly great,

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:44.840
truly innovative business thinker
originality they said is overrated.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:51.010
Instead, some of the greatest
thinkers are synthesizers,

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:57.960 position:56%
they're people who spot great ideas,
underappreciated ideas that need

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.860
to be heard and they
help them become heard,

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.860
like Daniel Goleman did.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.750
If you don't feel like you have
any great earthshattering ideas,

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.050
that's okay.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:19.070 position:56%
What you need to have is the ability
to notice, like Rose Schuman did,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:24.820
the ability to talent spot,
not just people but ideas,

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.560
the way that Daniel Goleman did.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.190
If you find ideas that
deserve to be heard,

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:35.800
that deserve to have a
wider spread and you're able

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.840
to help get them heard that's one

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.200
of the most valuable functions
you can serve and it's one

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.950
of the best ways that you can make
a mark and become known inside

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:51.300
and outside your organization
for your ideas.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:56.680
Now, finally, it comes
to living your brand

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:01.400
because the truth is sometimes I'll
talk to people about their brands,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.630
about personal branding in general,
and they'll say, oh, yeah, yeah,

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:09.540
yeah, your personal brand,
that's like your elevator pitch.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:14.980
[laughter] And kind of, yeah,
your elevator pitch, you know,

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.010
what the short little thing
that you say about yourself,

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:19.310
that's a piece of it for sure.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.130
What do you say about
yourself when people say, so,

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.610
who are you, what do you do?

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.630
That's important, but the
truth is if we think about it,

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:31.430
if we think about how we
determine what we think

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.210
about other people
it's not just based

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:37.830
on what they tell us
about themselves, right?

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.570
That's the smallest piece of it.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.320
What we think about
other people comes

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.260
from how they are in the world.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.180
It's about how they act, what they
do, how they live their lives,

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:56.150
how they relate to others, how
they treat us, that's their brand.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.810
Yeah, it's a little bit what
they say, but by no means is

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.920
that the end of the story.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.990
And so the real challenge, the real
opportunity is how can we live our

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:12.440 position:56%
lives in such a way that our brand's
message, the message that we would

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.140
like to get across to other
people is unmistakable,

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:23.080
that it is transmitted so clearly
that other people cannot miss it.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.300
Let's talk about a few ways.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:31.740
One of them that I think is
especially important is the idea

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.990
of connecting with other people

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:39.780
because your brand never
happens in isolation.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.910
Ronald Burt is a Sociologist
at the University of Chicago

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.370
and he has studied what
is called network theory.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:52.150
And this is basically how do
you make yourself indispensable

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.680
in a network.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.620
And what he discovered, and I
think this is quite important,

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:03.600
is that the best way to make
yourself indispensable is

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.970
to become the red dot
in the middle rather

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.550
than a blue dot on the periphery.

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:15.050
And what this means basically
is that he discovered

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.850 position:56%
in every organization, literally, no
matter how hard they try to root it

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:23.640
out in every organization it's
human nature that siloes are going

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.410
to appear, certain people who
should be talking are not talking,

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:33.170
certain departments that
should be talking, not talking.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.420
Field offices and headquarters,
not talking.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:43.430
But if you, if you can be the
bridge to build those connections.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:46.140
Now another key piece,
especially in the internet era,

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.580
is sharing your knowledge
with other people.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:53.990
You can have the best
ideas in the world,

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:58.640
but if other people don't know you
have them then it's the ultimate

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.170
tree falling in the forest, right?

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.390
You're not going to
get credit for it

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:06.820
if other people don't know
it or haven't heard them.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:13.860
So how can you begin to get them
out of your brain and into a place

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.960
where other people can
actually be helped by them?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.450
Well, that is one of the
things that I learned

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:27.980
when I interviewed this gentleman,
his name is Robert Scoble,

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:35.220
and he is well-known in
the technology space,

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:40.270
he's sort of an influencer
in the startup world.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:46.750
and he told me a life
FAQ you could say to use

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:50.360
in Silicon Valley terminology,

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.740
a life FAQ that I think
might be useful

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.480
at least metaphorically
for all of us.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:02.270
Robert gets literally hundreds
and hundreds of e-mails a day,

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:07.630
sometimes close to a
thousand e-mails a day,

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.300
more than any human
being could respond to.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.910
And a lot of them are
pretty similar,

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:16.700
a lot of times people are asking
him questions and they want

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.550
to know advice about
different aspects of startups.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.800
And so what he started doing,

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.240
because he realized he couldn't
possibly respond individually

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.990
to all these people, he
started e-mailing them back

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:36.490
and he told them I would be glad

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.880
to answer your question,
but not on e-mail.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.770
And what he told them instead is he
asked them to post their question

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:52.180
on QUORA, which some of you guys
may have heard of, it's a question

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:57.470
and answer website, spelled QUORA.

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:02.390
People post questions online and
then other people answer them.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:08.920
And he said if you post your
question I will answer it there.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.890
And the reason, he told me,

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:18.510
is that if he e-mails one person
back he's helped one person,

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:25.690
it's great but it's not
scalable, it's not sustainable,

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:31.220
but if he answers the question
online with that one action,

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.610
that same action, he's
able to help five people

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:40.570
or 50 people or 500 people.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:48.950
We all have the same
24 hours in a day,

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:53.790
we all are being pulled
in a million directions.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:48:01.400
If we can begin to ask ourselves
how can we leverage our knowledge

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:07.710
further to share it with more
people, to make it accessible

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:15.580
and helpful to more people,
that's where we can begin

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.720
to have more of an impact.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.710
And over time people begin
to recognize the value

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:28.510
of your insights, they begin to
read those answers and say, wow,

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:32.330
that makes a lot of sense,
I like the way she thinks.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.860
It doesn't have to be
posting them on QUORA,

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.550 position:56%
it could be an internal social
network in your company or maybe you

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.040
like the logging or maybe
you like giving speeches

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.150
or maybe it's just speaking
out more in company meetings

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:48.710
so that other people hear
what's on your mind rather

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:50.580
than keeping it buttoned up.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:54.020
But he more we can begin
to share our ideas,

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:58.370
the more other people can benefit.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:04.570
When it comes to living your brand
I wanted to make sure to conclude

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:09.180
by talking about something
important, which is the question

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:14.610
of conformity versus authenticity.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:21.470
Now it's pretty clear from our
history culturally that we used

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:25.580 position:56%
to live in a world where
conformity was really what mattered.

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.680
Did you dress like other people?

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.390
You have the same credentials
as other people?

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:34.950
There was one right path
and you needed to adhere

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.820
to that right path
in order to succeed.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:45.940
But in the past 20 or so years in
a lot of ways things have changed.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.990
Some, you might argue,
are negative changes.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:56.600
You might say, well, there's more
job insecurity or people have

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.290
to carve their own
paths more these days.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.500
People aren't working for the
same company their whole lives,

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.300
there's more uncertainty.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.400
But, of course, as
with Libby Wagner,

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.500
where your weakness may actually
be a strength, there's another side

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:18.110
to it, there's a lot more
opportunity for change,

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.480
for growth, for innovation.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:24.550
But there's also something
powerful that's emerged,

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:31.760
which is that in a world where
there's an infinitude of choices,

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:37.330
of information, of resources, of
people competing for the same jobs,

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:40.580
I can tell you what
has become a commodity.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:45.870
What has become a commodity
is yes men.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:50.750
What has become a commodity
is people who think the same,

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:56.260
do the same things, and
contribute more of the same

00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.180
because there's plenty of that.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:04.370
In order to be successful
today what companies need,

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:09.180
what the world needs, is different
thinking, people who can see

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.770
around corners, people
who can see what's next.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:20.320
People who like Rose Schuman can
make connections between things

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.580
that may not have been
brought together before,

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:27.830
but when you finally see it
it makes sense and it opens

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.110
up a new way of doing business.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.430
People who can tap
into new audiences

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:36.530
and new constituencies
and new ways of being.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:42.480
That is what is in short supply,
and if we can be the person

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.930
that contributes that, that
makes us indispensable.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:54.250
There's some research that was done
by the Center for Talent Innovation

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:59.330
in New York City, and it is
kind of fascinating actually.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:01.320
And I especially wanted
to throw this in here

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:07.310
because this section is
cosponsored by The Library

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:09.320
of Congress LGBT organization,

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.490
but I think that it
actually applies to everyone.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:16.050
What they discovered,
interestingly enough,

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:20.610
when they did a large-scale
study is that it turns out,

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:28.600 position:56%
they surveyed LGBT employees and
they asked them do you feel isolated

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:32.960
at work, do you feel
stalled in your career?

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.990 position:56%
And you might think that openly gay
employees would maybe be feeling the

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:43.500
brunt of this, that
they had taken a risk,

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.170
that they might be
paying a penalty for it.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:50.310
I mean, after all, that's why
people stay in the closet, right,

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:56.460
is because they feel that there's
a risk and a penalty to being out.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:04.120
It turns out, ironically, that
out employees were far happier

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:09.000
and more successful than
their closeted brethren.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.910
Now I'm putting a big
asterisk on this because,

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:17.900
of course unfortunately, we
still live in a country in which

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:23.500
in many states people can still
be fired legally for being out.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:28.240
But in situations where that
is not the case, where state

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.230
or a company has an
antidiscrimination policy,

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.990
these are pretty stark numbers.

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:40.560
If you are out you
are less isolated.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.180
If you are out you are more likely
to be successful in your career.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.910
Why? How could that be?

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.570
Well, it turns out that
what they discovered is

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:57.880
that when people are holding
back a fundamental element

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:06.600 position:56%
of who they are it occupies so much
of their psyche it's actually harder

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:10.850
for them to concentrate on
other elements of their job,

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:15.520
like building positive, open
connections with their coworkers.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.130
People feel like they don't
really fully know you,

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.870
there's a little bit of a distance.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:25.520
And so it's harder to
connect and break through.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.840
Now that's a piece
about LGBT employees,

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:35.180
but let me tell you how
it applies to everyone.

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:39.780
Deloitte University and
the Leadership Center

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.210
for Inclusion did an
interesting study along

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:47.100
with Professor Kenji Yoshino
of New York University,

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.630
and it's on a subject
called covering.

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:54.140
This is based on work that
originated in the 1950s

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:57.240
with a famous Sociologist
named Erving Goffman,

00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.850
and they've expanded
it and updated it.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:05.350
And basically what covering is
if you think about the LGBT case,

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:09.860
when you're closeted you are
totally saying, you know,

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:13.780
you're totally not telling
anyone about your identity,

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.230
but covering would be maybe
a less extreme example.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.700
People might know that you're gay,

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:25.940
but you are minimizing their
exposure to that identity,

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.180
so maybe everybody else has
a picture of their partner

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.350
on their desk but you don't
or everybody else talks

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:35.230
about what they did with
their spouse over the weekend

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:38.410
and you don't, you say I and not we

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:41.110
or whatever it is,
that would be covering.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.790
But that's not just a gay thing.

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:49.450
What the Deloitte and NYU
research discovered is

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:55.680
that in the modern workplace
almost everyone covers

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.470
in one way or another.

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:04.630 position:56%
They found examples of
African-American or Latino employees

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:08.650
that felt a need to play
down their cultural identity

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:10.370
in order to fit in.

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:15.340
They found examples of women
who were just a little careful

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:19.410
about talking about their
families or their kids at work

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.810
because they worried they
might not be perceived

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:26.430
as a really serious worker if
they were also seen as a mom.

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:31.900
And perhaps shockingly but
not really if you think

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:39.710
about it the study showed
that 46% of white men,

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:46.960
46% of straight white men reported
covering in one fashion or another.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.010
When I first gave a talk, in
fact, about this a gentleman came

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:58.260
up to me afterwards and he said
what you talked about, that's me.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.200
He said about 10 years
ago I got divorced

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:06.100
and I became a single father
responsible for my kids,

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:11.910
I never told my coworkers because
I didn't want them to think

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:13.770
that I would be distracted.

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:18.120
It could be health issues, it
could be mental health issues,

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:24.110
it could be almost anything, but
in our workforce even though we are

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:29.070
in an era now where what we need
more than ever is difference

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:36.860 position:56%
and individuality and being real too
often we find ourselves in a place

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:41.930
where we're just a little bit
hesitant to go that final mile

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:49.540
and really be that real because
we think that we need in some ways

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:57.020
to still hew to that man in
the gray flannel suit ideal.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:04.190
What the Deloitte and NYU study
revealed is that covering,

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:08.930 position:56%
no matter who is doing it, if you're
gay, if you're African-American

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:14.070
or Hispanic, if you're a woman,
if you are a straight white man,

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:19.380
when you are covering you
are less effective at work.

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:23.060
You're not able to really
form the relationships,

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:27.620
the honest relationships with
your colleagues that you need

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:33.910
to be successful, you're not really
able to bring your best ideas

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:40.110 position:56%
to the table because we become so
concerned about managing perceptions

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:46.110
and managing our identity rather
than our jobs and really being able

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:50.410
to be fully present to excel there.

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:59.220 position:56%
and so what I want to leave you with
is as we think about how to stand

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.870
out at work, this process

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:08.450 position:56%
of understanding what our current
brand is, creating the future vision

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:10.420
that we want and moving
towards that,

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:16.600
and then finally living it out,
every day taking those steps,

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:23.700
we need to not be afraid to
bring our whole selves to work.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:29.620
the more we do that the more we
empower other people to do it,

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:33.680
and the more we can create the
kind of culture that is beneficial,

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:38.370
not just for us but for
making the entire workplace,

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:42.410
the entire company, the
entire culture better.

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:46.160
What we need more of is
people willing to stand out

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:52.440
and to be authentic, and it
starts with us and the decisions

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:56.840
that we make, that's how
we can stand out at work.

00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:01.630
So I'm thrilled to be here,
and I think we have time

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.620
for questions - is that true?

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:08.470
For anybody who needs to leave
early I'll just mention if you want

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:14.140
to stay in touch or get a free
resource, a 42-page workbook

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.860
that I've developed from
Stand Out you can get it

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.780
on my website at dorieclark.com.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:22.660
But thank you so much, and I'm
going to hand it over to Yvonne

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:28.050 position:56%
to do questions and we can chit-chat
and bond as much as you'd like.

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:30.510
Thank you very much, everyone.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:35.070
[ Applause ]

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:36.370
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Dooley: We're
right at one-thirty,

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:39.550
but I'm sure we can take a
few questions if you would

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:44.020
like to stay back and go
ahead and ask Dorie that.

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.510
&gt;&gt; Dorie Clark: Thank you.

01:00:46.510 --> 01:01:40.060
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.360
Yes, great question.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.660
Thank you.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.210
And it's one that certainly
has been bubbling

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:47.830
up over the last few years
because, you're right,

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:52.680
in many ways it is a
power struggle, right?

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.870
Whose brand is more
powerful, the company's brand

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:58.630
or the individual's brand?

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:03.670
And if the individual's brand
is stronger will recruiters come

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:06.910
to them, will they get
offers from other places?

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:11.110
Yes, that's actually true,
the company is correct.

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:19.750 position:56%
But, that being said, would a star
performer want to work for a company

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:24.520
that deliberately suppressed
them and kept them down?

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.880
Probably not.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.690 position:56%
And so it's kind of a balancing
act, and I think that companies have

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:35.590
to make a decision do they
want to be the kind of entity

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:41.720
that is a strong brand that
only attracts B players,

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.330
where they are always
bigger than their employees

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:49.630
and that is how they keep
it, or are they strong enough

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:56.680 position:56%
and expansive enough that they are
willing to take in a star performer,

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:02.760
an A player that, in fact, could
attract more business to them

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:07.240
because people say, oh, wow, so and
so is on your team, that's amazing,

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.270
I want to work with them and so,
therefore, I want to work with you.

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:15.140
I think, I mean it's
a legitimate concern,

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.070
if someone really is
a star performer,

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.830
if they can literally write their
own ticket could they be poached?

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:24.360
Sure. But I think that we also
need to start thinking, you know,

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.670
I mean companies like
sports teams sort of need

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.540
to choose their strategy, right?

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.840
But I think more and more people
need to adapt to the reality

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.050
that Reid Hoffman talked
about in his book,

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:37.930
which actually originally sprung

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:40.580
from an HBR article
called The Alliance.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:46.430 position:56%
And the idea is that we need to
become a little bit more comfortable

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:50.120
with the idea that
taking a job may become

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.970
in certain circumstances a sort
of tour of duty, like you would do

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:58.010
in the military for instance, you
know, you sign on for two years

01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:01.570
or five years or whatever it is
with an understanding that, okay,

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:05.490
it's a fixed period of time,
but can we both benefit

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.390 position:56%
from having you here for five years?

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:09.190
Actually, yes, even if
you leave at the end

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.020
of five years it will have been
good for both of us to have

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.100
that mutually beneficial
association.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.970
So I think it's a tricky
situation and companies really need

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:24.160
to ask themselves what kind of an
environment they want to create.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.280
So thank you for raising that.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.490
Yes, other thoughts, questions,
stories about standing out?

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.790
Yes, sir?

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:32.090
&gt;&gt; So when it comes to standing

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:35.030
out in the workplace how
do you recommend navigating

01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:36.730
generational shifts?

01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:41.890
Because where you have management
Gen Xers or Baby Boomers it's sort

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:45.380
of that got to work 18 hours
and put everything into it,

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.830
where with Millennials it may
be I'm going to work 18 hours

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:52.420
but I may do two hours from a
Starbucks and three from a bar,

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.000
and it's not that, you know,
it's just different work habits.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.700
And so how do you advise navigating
that because I see that with a lot

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.300
of my friends who are in
that Millennial category?

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:07.980
&gt;&gt; Dorie Clark: Yes, yes, and
questions about flexibility

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.760
and telecommuting and
things like that.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:15.640
I mean you're absolutely right that
for a long time the model has been

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.340
that the ability to have

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.790
that flexibility is a
privilege, not a right.

01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:27.380
You have to ask your employer,
well, can I please on Friday work

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:31.340
from home, or things like
that, and it's something

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.180
that you earn over time, et cetera.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.350
And so if people are coming in,
let's say if Millennials are coming

01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.880
in fresh from college and they
did all their homework assignments

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.370 position:56%
at the Starbucks and, well, why
can't they do it for work, you know,

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:49.040
isn't it about getting it done?

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.300
Why does it matter where they were
when they actually accomplished it

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.710
or wrote the memo or
whatever they needed to do?

01:05:55.710 --> 01:06:00.450
It can create misunderstandings
or different expectations.

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:08.380
I'm a fan, personally, my personal
bias is toward maximal freedom

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.720
and flexibility, but as with a lot

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.540
of things the progress
comes in fits and starts.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.440
One of the things that I thought
was actually most interesting,

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.600
a few years ago when I
was researching Stand Out,

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.360 position:56%
when I was first coming up with what
are the ideas that I wanted to write

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.000
about and explore further one of
the things that I actually thought

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.100
about including at the time was a
concept, you guys may have heard

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.370
about or been familiar
with, pioneered at Best Buy

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:42.720
in Minnesota called ROW,
Results Only Work environment.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:49.220 position:56%
This was a very innovative idea much
talked about in management circles

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.310
that for several years
was the law of the land

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:54.550
at Best Buy Corporate Headquarters,

01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:58.380
which was extreme freedom
and flexibility.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:03.880
There were no set work hours, you
know, flexible vacation policies,

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.120
and it was considered a real model

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.010
for an innovative workplace
in the future.

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:16.160
And it operated for a few years
and then they shut it down.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.100 position:56%
We look at Marissa Mayer, famously,
ending the policies at Yahoo saying,

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.720
nope, sorry, you guys
come back on in here.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.580
And so we're still, there's
no cultural consensus,

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:34.960
you see different managers kind
of pulling in different directions

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.840
and so there's a lot of tension.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.860 position:56%
How does this apply to standing out,

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.390
how does this apply to
your personal brand?

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:49.490
Well, I would say we, of
course, as individual performers,

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:53.070
if I'm working in a company
you always want to try to be

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:55.880
as keenly attuned as
possible to your boss

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.770
and your boss' expectations,
that's just a reality

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.070
that you have to deal with.

01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:04.370 position:56%
This is the person who is primarily
responsible for your future at least

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:06.420
in the context of that company.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:10.740
So to a certain extent they set
the parameters of what you can do.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:16.830 position:56%
However, my addendum to that is that
even if you are having to play along

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:19.620
with rules that are not
your preferred rules,

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:24.050
that is why I would encourage
everyone in the workforce

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:26.260
but perhaps particularly
younger workers

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.950
to not put all their
eggs in that basket.

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:32.320
If you devote 100% of your
life and your attention

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.340
to pleasing your boss that's
great and it works pretty well

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:41.210 position:56%
if they're always your boss and you
always want to work at that company,

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:44.740
but that may not be what you want.

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:49.360
If I was advising somebody who
is 24 years old I would say plan

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.750
for maximal options for yourself

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:57.380
and what gives you options is
building a brand simultaneously

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.480
outside your company,
build a network,

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.390
join professional associations,
don't just join become an officer

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:08.060
at professional associations,
start to get known, start blogging.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.310
You know, if you're allowed by
your employer start blogging

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:15.680
about your field, create a Twitter
account and start following people

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.320 position:56%
and building discussions and sharing

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.430
and curating ideas
about your industry.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:26.850
The more well-known you are outside
your company the more respect you

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:31.520
get inside your company because
they know you have someplace to go

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.610
if you ever want to, and that
kind of freedom, you know,

01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:36.870
we were talking earlier
about the power balance

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:40.800
of whose brand is bigger,
yours or your company's.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:47.500
And so if you can maximize your
brand it actually helps your

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.180
company, too, I mean
hopefully they see it that way

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:57.100
that the rising brand tide lifts
all boats, but it gives you options

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.720
and power if the tide turns

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.920
and something bad happens
at your company.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.900
You never want to be in a position
where you do not have a plan B

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:10.310
and a brand, a strong brand always
gives you a plan B. So I want

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:13.130
to be respectful of folks' time.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.310
If people want to come talk to
me afterwards please come on up.

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:17.880
It's wonderful talking with you.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.510
Thank you for your questions
and have a great day.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:25.040
