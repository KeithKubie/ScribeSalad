because at its heart it says there might
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.580
because at its heart it says there might
be conjectures out there about numbers

it might be true that every even number
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.759
it might be true that every even number
is the sum of two primes but maybe

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
is the sum of two primes but maybe
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460

within the axiomatic system we have for
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.709

the real worry is what if there's a true

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
the real worry is what if there's a true
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180

is a big kind of revelation for
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.060
is a big kind of revelation for

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.349
my colleague in Oxford Andrew Wiles
found the proof but I think we all have

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
found the proof but I think we all have
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.090

this kind of feeling like well surely

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
this kind of feeling like well surely

every true statement has a proof but

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
every true statement has a proof but
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399
every true statement has a proof but
girdle shows that actually there's a gap

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
girdle shows that actually there's a gap
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.430

between truth and proof

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440
between truth and proof
 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.710

I wrote it down here because it'sit's

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720
I wrote it down here because it'sit's
 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.750

quite cute so it's one of these cards

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760
quite cute so it's one of these cards
 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.400
quite cute so it's one of these cards
the statement on the other side of this

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410
the statement on the other side of this
 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.870
the statement on the other side of this
card is false

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880
card is false
 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.180
card is false
so let's suppose that's true so it means

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190
so let's suppose that's true so it means
 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.320
so let's suppose that's true so it means
that the explained one on the other side

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330
that the explained one on the other side
 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.510
that the explained one on the other side
of the card is false so we turn it over

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520
of the card is false so we turn it over
 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.490
of the card is false so we turn it over
and then it says the statement on the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
and then it says the statement on the
 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.700
and then it says the statement on the
other side of this card is true

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710
other side of this card is true
 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.890
other side of this card is true
well that's meant to be false so it

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900
well that's meant to be false so it
 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.540
well that's meant to be false so it
means the one on the other side is also

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550
means the one on the other side is also
 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.000
means the one on the other side is also
false oh but we suppose that that was

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010
false oh but we suppose that that was
 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.280
false oh but we suppose that that was
true so that's false so the other side

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
true so that's false so the other side
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.230
true so that's false so the other side
is true which means that and you get

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240
is true which means that and you get
 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.030
is true which means that and you get
into this kind of infinite loop verbal

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040
into this kind of infinite loop verbal
 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.100
into this kind of infinite loop verbal
paradoxes are fine because you don't

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110
paradoxes are fine because you don't
 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.340
paradoxes are fine because you don't
expect every verbal sentence to have a

expect every verbal sentence to have a
 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.740
expect every verbal sentence to have a
truth value to it but then when I went

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750
truth value to it but then when I went
 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.870
truth value to it but then when I went
up to university I realized that

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880
up to university I realized that
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.270
up to university I realized that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500
when I took this course on mathematical
 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.650
when I took this course on mathematical
logic and we learned about girdle's

undermine our belief that all true

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760
undermine our belief that all true
 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.100

there was a feeling like we should be

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730
there was a feeling like we should be
 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.150
there was a feeling like we should be
able to prove that mathematics is

contradictions this have been kind of

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
contradictions this have been kind of
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.490

Russell had come up with people might

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340
Russell had come up with people might
 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.370
Russell had come up with people might
have come across this idea of the set of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380
have come across this idea of the set of
 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.070
have come across this idea of the set of
all sets that don't contain themselves

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080
all sets that don't contain themselves
 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.500

two different ways so that less than 20
 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.360
two different ways so that less than 20
words so then you define the following

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
words so then you define the following
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.490
words so then you define the following
number then the smallest number which

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500
number then the smallest number which
 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.610

just defined that number in less than 20

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709
just defined that number in less than 20
 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.100
just defined that number in less than 20
words and you go well that's a bit

words and you go well that's a bit
 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.410

challenge to mathematics at the turn of
the 20th century and David Hilbert one

the 20th century and David Hilbert one
 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.090
the 20th century and David Hilbert one
of his big problems that he challenged

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100
of his big problems that he challenged
 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.190

the second one was to prove that

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090
the second one was to prove that
 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.080
the second one was to prove that
mathematics was in fact consistent and

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090
mathematics was in fact consistent and
 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.729
mathematics was in fact consistent and
included in that was that every true

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739
included in that was that every true
 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.650
included in that was that every true
statement should be provable but what a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660
statement should be provable but what a
 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.479

how does mathematics work we set down

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050
how does mathematics work we set down
 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.470
how does mathematics work we set down
things we called axioms which are the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480
things we called axioms which are the
 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.660
things we called axioms which are the
kind of things we believe are the way

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670
kind of things we believe are the way

kind of things we believe are the way
numbers geometry works so for example if

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
numbers geometry works so for example if
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.539
numbers geometry works so for example if
I take six and I add seven to that I

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
I take six and I add seven to that I
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.949
I take six and I add seven to that I
don't think it's going to be different

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959
don't think it's going to be different
 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.560
don't think it's going to be different
from taking seven and adding things to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570
from taking seven and adding things to
 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.150
from taking seven and adding things to
that that seems so blindingly obvious

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160
that that seems so blindingly obvious
 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.939
that that seems so blindingly obvious
and that's one of the axioms of the way

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949
and that's one of the axioms of the way
 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.980
and that's one of the axioms of the way
numbers work so maybe somewhere out

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
numbers work so maybe somewhere out
 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.750
numbers work so maybe somewhere out
there that posed wrong but I don't

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760
there that posed wrong but I don't
 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.490
there that posed wrong but I don't
really care I'm interested in a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500
really care I'm interested in a
 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.800
really care I'm interested in a
mathematics where that is true of all

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810
mathematics where that is true of all
 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.230
mathematics where that is true of all
numbers and I have rules which allow me

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240
numbers and I have rules which allow me
 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.930
numbers and I have rules which allow me
to make deductions from those axioms and

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
to make deductions from those axioms and
 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.330
to make deductions from those axioms and
that's how mathematics works each time

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340
that's how mathematics works each time
 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.040
that's how mathematics works each time
we make these logical deductions we

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050
we make these logical deductions we
 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.770
we make these logical deductions we
expand the conclusions from these axioms

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780
expand the conclusions from these axioms
 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.170
expand the conclusions from these axioms
we can add new axioms if we feel like

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180
we can add new axioms if we feel like
 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.790
we can add new axioms if we feel like
you know what we haven't actually

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800
you know what we haven't actually
 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.740
you know what we haven't actually
captured the whole of mathematics and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750
captured the whole of mathematics and
 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.650
captured the whole of mathematics and
that was somehow the the mission was we

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660
that was somehow the the mission was we
 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.870
that was somehow the the mission was we
want to have a set of axioms which are

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880
want to have a set of axioms which are
 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.629
want to have a set of axioms which are
strong enough and that we believe are

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639
strong enough and that we believe are
 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.750
strong enough and that we believe are
basic about numbers from which we can

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760
basic about numbers from which we can
 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.300
basic about numbers from which we can
deduce all through statements that we

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310
deduce all through statements that we
 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.340
deduce all through statements that we
will have a proof and so there was a

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350
will have a proof and so there was a
 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.469
will have a proof and so there was a
feeling like well yeah well maybe we

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479
feeling like well yeah well maybe we
 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.180
feeling like well yeah well maybe we
haven't got all of the axioms and if we

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190
haven't got all of the axioms and if we
 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.589
haven't got all of the axioms and if we
got a true statement which can't be

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599
got a true statement which can't be
 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.870
got a true statement which can't be
proved we could add that as a new axiom

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880
proved we could add that as a new axiom
 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.360
proved we could add that as a new axiom
and it will expand what we can prove

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
and it will expand what we can prove
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.100
and it will expand what we can prove
within mathematics so this is very

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110
within mathematics so this is very
 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.960
within mathematics so this is very
important for girdle because we are

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970
important for girdle because we are
 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.390
important for girdle because we are
trying to prove that there will be a set

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400
trying to prove that there will be a set
 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.879
trying to prove that there will be a set
of axioms from which we can deduce all

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889
of axioms from which we can deduce all
 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.719
of axioms from which we can deduce all
truths of mathematics

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729
truths of mathematics
 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.909
truths of mathematics
good or did something very clever

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919
good or did something very clever
 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.329
good or did something very clever
because he cooked up a way of allowing

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339
because he cooked up a way of allowing
 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.299
because he cooked up a way of allowing
mathematics to talk about itself so what

00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:38.309
mathematics to talk about itself so what
 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.129
mathematics to talk about itself so what
he produced was the thing we now called

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139
he produced was the thing we now called
 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.639
he produced was the thing we now called
the girdle coding so he showed that any

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:43.649
the girdle coding so he showed that any
 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.279
the girdle coding so he showed that any
statement about numbers has its own

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289
statement about numbers has its own
 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.949
statement about numbers has its own
particular code number in fact use prime

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:48.959
particular code number in fact use prime
 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:51.169
particular code number in fact use prime
numbers in order to make this coding so

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:51.179
numbers in order to make this coding so
 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.419
numbers in order to make this coding so
every statement amount mathematics could

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:53.429
every statement amount mathematics could
 

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:55.969
every statement amount mathematics could
be turned into a number so for example

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979
be turned into a number so for example
 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.279
be turned into a number so for example
the axioms of mathematics from which we

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289
the axioms of mathematics from which we
 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.109
the axioms of mathematics from which we
are trying to make all of our deductions

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:00.119
are trying to make all of our deductions
 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.019
are trying to make all of our deductions
they would have code numbers and true

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029
they would have code numbers and true
 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.939
they would have code numbers and true
statements about mathematics so for

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949
statements about mathematics so for
 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.799
statements about mathematics so for
example fermat's last theorem for

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:06.809
example fermat's last theorem for
 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:09.339
example fermat's last theorem for
example will have a code number also

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349
example will have a code number also
 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.439
example will have a code number also
false statements like 17 is an even

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449
false statements like 17 is an even
 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.409
false statements like 17 is an even
number will have a code number this is

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419
number will have a code number this is
 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.059
number will have a code number this is
what these criminals look like okay

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069
what these criminals look like okay
 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:19.549
what these criminals look like okay
there are obviously whoppers the apps

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:19.559
there are obviously whoppers the apps
 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.739
there are obviously whoppers the apps
they're absolutely huge but it's a

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:21.749
they're absolutely huge but it's a
 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.249
they're absolutely huge but it's a
unique coding so every code number can

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259
unique coding so every code number can
 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.409
unique coding so every code number can
be worked backwards into a statement not

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419
be worked backwards into a statement not
 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.869
be worked backwards into a statement not
every number will have a meaningful

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:29.879
every number will have a meaningful
 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.969
every number will have a meaningful
mathematical statement but it's more

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979
mathematical statement but it's more
 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.350
mathematical statement but it's more
interesting the other way every

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360
interesting the other way every
 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.909
interesting the other way every
mathematical statement will have a

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919
mathematical statement will have a
 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.850
mathematical statement will have a
unique number associated with it how

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
unique number associated with it how
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.159

most even a computer has a zero isn't
 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.339
most even a computer has a zero isn't
very good so if I'm typing away and I

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349
very good so if I'm typing away and I
 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.559

write the name girdle that be changed

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569
write the name girdle that be changed
 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.709
write the name girdle that be changed
into ASCII code it will have a number

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:47.719
into ASCII code it will have a number
 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.209
into ASCII code it will have a number
associated with it so good will cook

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219

this up but why is that useful because

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139
this up but why is that useful because
 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.469
this up but why is that useful because
you can now actually talk about proof in

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479
you can now actually talk about proof in
 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.689
you can now actually talk about proof in
mathematics using these numbers so you

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699
mathematics using these numbers so you
 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.669
mathematics using these numbers so you
can start to talk about mathematics

00:06:58.669 --> 00:06:58.679
can start to talk about mathematics
 

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:01.609
can start to talk about mathematics
using mathematics so for example you

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:01.619
using mathematics so for example you
 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:04.009
using mathematics so for example you
might want to know well is this

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:04.019
might want to know well is this
 

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:07.009
might want to know well is this
particular statement provable from the

particular statement provable from the
axioms that I'm going to completely

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:09.989
axioms that I'm going to completely
 

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:12.099
axioms that I'm going to completely
simplify this but it'll give you the

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:12.109
simplify this but it'll give you the
 

00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:15.019
simplify this but it'll give you the
feel for it essentially it's a bit like

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029
feel for it essentially it's a bit like
 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:18.109
feel for it essentially it's a bit like
saying any statement whose a code number

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:18.119
saying any statement whose a code number
 

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:20.569
saying any statement whose a code number
is divisible by the code number of the

axioms will be provable from the axioms

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789
axioms will be provable from the axioms
 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.269
axioms will be provable from the axioms
that's an incredible simplification but

00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:26.279
that's an incredible simplification but
 

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.279
that's an incredible simplification but
it's good because it means now we can

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289
it's good because it means now we can
 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:30.979
it's good because it means now we can
talk about proof within opening up

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:30.989
talk about proof within opening up
 

00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:33.169
talk about proof within opening up
mathematically to say that something is

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:33.179
mathematically to say that something is
 

00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:36.169
mathematically to say that something is
provable is to say for example that it's

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:36.179
provable is to say for example that it's
 

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:38.449
provable is to say for example that it's
code number must be divisible by the

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:38.459
code number must be divisible by the
 

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.269
code number must be divisible by the
axioms

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:40.279
axioms
 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:43.989
axioms
so now girdle challenges you with the

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:43.999
so now girdle challenges you with the
 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:47.369
so now girdle challenges you with the
following statement this statement

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:47.379
following statement this statement
 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:51.579
following statement this statement
cannot be proved from the axioms that we

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:51.589
cannot be proved from the axioms that we
 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:54.099
cannot be proved from the axioms that we
have for our system of mathematics so

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:54.109
have for our system of mathematics so
 

00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:56.589
have for our system of mathematics so
this is actually something that has a

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599
this is actually something that has a
 

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:59.379
this is actually something that has a
code number we can talk about proof

00:07:59.379 --> 00:07:59.389
code number we can talk about proof
 

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:01.569
code number we can talk about proof
using numbers so so this will be a

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:01.579
using numbers so so this will be a
 

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:03.579
using numbers so so this will be a
statement that can be changed into a

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:03.589
statement that can be changed into a
 

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.439
statement that can be changed into a
mathematical equation now this means

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:05.449
mathematical equation now this means
 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:07.689
mathematical equation now this means
because it's an equation in mathematics

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:07.699
because it's an equation in mathematics
 

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.069
because it's an equation in mathematics
it's either true or its false so let's

00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:12.079
it's either true or its false so let's
 

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:15.429
it's either true or its false so let's
start by saying that the statement is

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:15.439
start by saying that the statement is
 

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:18.179
start by saying that the statement is
false that means that this statement is

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:18.189
false that means that this statement is
 

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:21.249
false that means that this statement is
provable from the axioms is true but a

00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:21.259
provable from the axioms is true but a
 

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:24.909
provable from the axioms is true but a
provable statement must be true so now

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919
provable statement must be true so now
 

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:26.889
provable statement must be true so now
we've started with something which we

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:26.899
we've started with something which we
 

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.719
we've started with something which we
assumed was false and now we've deduced

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:28.729
assumed was false and now we've deduced
 

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:30.549
assumed was false and now we've deduced
that it's true so we've got a

00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:30.559
that it's true so we've got a
 

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:32.290
that it's true so we've got a
contradiction and we're assuming that

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:32.300
contradiction and we're assuming that
 

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.779
contradiction and we're assuming that
mathematics is consistent so we can't

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:34.789
mathematics is consistent so we can't
 

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.179
mathematics is consistent so we can't
have contradictions this is important so

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:37.189
have contradictions this is important so
 

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:40.480
have contradictions this is important so
that means it can't be false this means

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.490
that means it can't be false this means
 

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.999
that means it can't be false this means
it must be true because a mathematical

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:43.009
it must be true because a mathematical
 

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:45.069
it must be true because a mathematical
statement is either true or false it's

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:45.079
statement is either true or false it's
 

00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:47.530
statement is either true or false it's
not like these linguistic paradoxes

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:47.540
not like these linguistic paradoxes
 

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.929
not like these linguistic paradoxes
which just don't have a truth value it

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:49.939
which just don't have a truth value it
 

00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:51.519
which just don't have a truth value it
is an equation of mathematics it's

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:51.529
is an equation of mathematics it's
 

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:53.410
is an equation of mathematics it's
either true or is false we've just shown

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:53.420
either true or is false we've just shown
 

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.939
either true or is false we've just shown
if it's false but that leads to a

00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:54.949
if it's false but that leads to a
 

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:56.740
if it's false but that leads to a
contradiction this means that this

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:56.750
contradiction this means that this
 

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.009
contradiction this means that this
statement must be true ah great we've

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:00.019
statement must be true ah great we've
 

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:02.759
statement must be true ah great we've
got a true statement but let's now

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:02.769
got a true statement but let's now
 

00:09:02.769 --> 00:09:05.290
got a true statement but let's now
reinterpret what it says it says this

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:05.300
reinterpret what it says it says this
 

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.480
reinterpret what it says it says this
statement cannot be proved from the

axioms we have now got a true statement

which cannot be proved true from the

which cannot be proved true from the
axioms of mathematics and that's exactly

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240
axioms of mathematics and that's exactly
 

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.090
axioms of mathematics and that's exactly
what girdle wanted he's now got a

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.100
what girdle wanted he's now got a
 

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.639
what girdle wanted he's now got a
statement of mathematics which is true

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:21.649
statement of mathematics which is true
 

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:23.920
statement of mathematics which is true
but cannot be proved and you go well

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:23.930
but cannot be proved and you go well
 

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.619
but cannot be proved and you go well
hold on how do we actually prove that

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:26.629
hold on how do we actually prove that
 

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:28.509
hold on how do we actually prove that
was true we just proved it's true and

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519
was true we just proved it's true and
 

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:30.699
was true we just proved it's true and
it's very important to articulate what

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:30.709
it's very important to articulate what
 

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:32.799
it's very important to articulate what
we have done is within a system of

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:32.809
we have done is within a system of
 

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:36.519
we have done is within a system of
mathematics with certain axioms we found

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:36.529
mathematics with certain axioms we found
 

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:38.259
mathematics with certain axioms we found
a true statement within there which

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:38.269
a true statement within there which
 

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:40.629
a true statement within there which
can't be true proved true within that

00:09:40.629 --> 00:09:40.639
can't be true proved true within that
 

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:43.299
can't be true proved true within that
system we've proved it's true by working

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:43.309
system we've proved it's true by working
 

00:09:43.309 --> 00:09:45.129
system we've proved it's true by working
outside the system and looking in

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:45.139
outside the system and looking in
 

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:47.619
outside the system and looking in
because we can now add that as an axiom

00:09:47.619 --> 00:09:47.629
because we can now add that as an axiom
 

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.449
because we can now add that as an axiom
it's a true statement so it won't make

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:49.459
it's a true statement so it won't make
 

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:51.179
it's a true statement so it won't make
something which is consistent

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:51.189
something which is consistent
 

00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:52.360
something which is consistent
inconsistent

inconsistent
 

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.280
inconsistent
so we could add that as an axiom and you

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.290
so we could add that as an axiom and you
 

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.139
so we could add that as an axiom and you
say well now we've got to prove because

00:09:56.139 --> 00:09:56.149
say well now we've got to prove because
 

00:09:56.149 --> 00:09:57.999
say well now we've got to prove because
it's just an axiom it's one of these

00:09:57.999 --> 00:09:58.009
it's just an axiom it's one of these
 

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:59.769
it's just an axiom it's one of these

kind of infinite regresses girdle says
that's not going to help you because I

that's not going to help you because I

another statement which is true but
 

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.369
another statement which is true but
unprovable so it's a sort of infinite

00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:09.379
unprovable so it's a sort of infinite
 

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:11.379
unprovable so it's a sort of infinite

infinitely many Prime's you say suppose
there are finitely many Prime's then you

there are finitely many Prime's then you
 

00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:26.619
there are finitely many Prime's then you
prove that there's some prime is missing

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:26.629
prove that there's some prime is missing

from that list and you say well I'll add

from that list and you say well I'll add
 

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:30.519
from that list and you say well I'll add
those and you CLE just keeps playing the

those and you CLE just keeps playing the

expand your mathematics to add that as
 

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.299
expand your mathematics to add that as
an axiom but that won't help because we

an axiom but that won't help because we
 

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.860

Riemann hypothesis we might be having
 

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.490
Riemann hypothesis we might be having
trouble proving it but just because we

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:00.500
trouble proving it but just because we
 

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.710
trouble proving it but just because we
haven't expanded the axioms of

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720
haven't expanded the axioms of
 

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.499
haven't expanded the axioms of

now there are some sentences like

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:08.790
now there are some sentences like
 

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.660

Riemann which are intriguing because it
 

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.570
Riemann which are intriguing because it
Riemann turns out to be a mathematical

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:14.580
Riemann turns out to be a mathematical
 

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.090
Riemann turns out to be a mathematical
statement which doesn't have a proof we

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100
statement which doesn't have a proof we
 

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.010
statement which doesn't have a proof we
could prove that that it doesn't have a

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.020
could prove that that it doesn't have a
 

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.670
could prove that that it doesn't have a
proof weirdly this would prove that the

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680
proof weirdly this would prove that the
 

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.060
proof weirdly this would prove that the
Riemann hypothesis must be true

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.070
Riemann hypothesis must be true
 

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.670
Riemann hypothesis must be true
now you go all out of why because if the

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680
now you go all out of why because if the
 

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.579
now you go all out of why because if the
Riemann hypothesis is false this means

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:31.589
Riemann hypothesis is false this means
 

00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:34.160
Riemann hypothesis is false this means
that there's a zero off the line this

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.170
that there's a zero off the line this
 

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.840
that there's a zero off the line this
means there's actually a constructive

process if it's false it will find the
 

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.290

reason why it's false so if it's false

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300
reason why it's false so if it's false
 

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.160
reason why it's false so if it's false
it must be provably false so if we find

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.170
it must be provably false so if we find
 

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.470
it must be provably false so if we find
that riemann is actually undecidable

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480
that riemann is actually undecidable
 

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.449
that riemann is actually undecidable

cannot be proved from the axioms of
 

00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:54.769
cannot be proved from the axioms of
mathematics there's no way it can be

mathematics there's no way it can be
 

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:58.010
mathematics there's no way it can be
false because that will be provable so

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.020
false because that will be provable so
 

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.170
false because that will be provable so
it must be true so this is a really

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180
it must be true so this is a really
 

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.850
it must be true so this is a really
weird way that you might prove Riemann

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860
weird way that you might prove Riemann
 

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.980
weird way that you might prove Riemann
hypothesis is to prove that is actually
