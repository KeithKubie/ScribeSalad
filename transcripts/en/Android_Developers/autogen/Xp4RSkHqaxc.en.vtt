and so what we've been doing is

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010
and so what we've been doing is
 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.860
and so what we've been doing is
investing more and more into the

more we start improving the consistency

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349

more we start improving the consistency
and I think what you were saying which i

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060
and I think what you were saying which i
 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.430

think is fair is that we still got work

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440
think is fair is that we still got work
 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.240
think is fair is that we still got work
to do to make it more consistent and so

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250
to do to make it more consistent and so
 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.170
to do to make it more consistent and so
we're definitely investing there the

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180
we're definitely investing there the
 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.629
we're definitely investing there the

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.250
thus will be unable to be accessed by
the regular assistant I don't think we

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.260
the regular assistant I don't think we
 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.220
the regular assistant I don't think we
just removed call log access as far as I

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230
just removed call log access as far as I
 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.760
just removed call log access as far as I
know we haven't we haven't pushed any

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770
know we haven't we haven't pushed any
 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.420
know we haven't we haven't pushed any
functionality to only the assistant or

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430
functionality to only the assistant or
 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.800
functionality to only the assistant or
whoever the default voice interaction

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.810
whoever the default voice interaction
 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.560
whoever the default voice interaction
service is well in addition to

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570
service is well in addition to
 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.050
service is well in addition to
permissions there's also the voice

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060
permissions there's also the voice
 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.210
permissions there's also the voice
interaction service which gets callbacks

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.220
interaction service which gets callbacks
 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.440
interaction service which gets callbacks
and you only get that if you're the

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.450
and you only get that if you're the
 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.510
and you only get that if you're the
default voice assistant yeah that's been

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520
default voice assistant yeah that's been
 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.430
default voice assistant yeah that's been
the design since the beginning of that

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440
the design since the beginning of that
 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.920
the design since the beginning of that
is that you pick one pick one assistant

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:50.930
is that you pick one pick one assistant
 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.620
is that you pick one pick one assistant
on your device and there's only one and

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:53.630
on your device and there's only one and
 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.700
on your device and there's only one and
there's a lot of reasons for that you

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:54.710
there's a lot of reasons for that you
 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.830
there's a lot of reasons for that you
know like the always always on hot work

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840
know like the always always on hot work
 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.800
know like the always always on hot work
detection you know like is barely works

00:07:59.800 --> 00:07:59.810
detection you know like is barely works
 

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.350
detection you know like is barely works
for one I mean barely as far as like

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360
for one I mean barely as far as like
 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.390
for one I mean barely as far as like
being able to customize it and stuff I

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400
being able to customize it and stuff I
 

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.620
being able to customize it and stuff I
don't mean it doesn't what doesn't

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:05.630
don't mean it doesn't what doesn't
 

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.680
don't mean it doesn't what doesn't
really means

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:08.690
 
 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.879
 
and there's you know and there's like

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:10.889
and there's you know and there's like
 

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:12.320
and there's you know and there's like
you know the gesture to bring up the

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:12.330
you know the gesture to bring up the
 

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.060
you know the gesture to bring up the
assistant is tied to that and so if you

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.070
assistant is tied to that and so if you
 

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.620
assistant is tied to that and so if you
have multiple ones you know like it

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:15.630
have multiple ones you know like it
 

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.330
have multiple ones you know like it
doesn't it's not clear what should

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340
doesn't it's not clear what should
 

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.530
doesn't it's not clear what should
happen in that case and there's a lot of

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:18.540
happen in that case and there's a lot of
 

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.700
happen in that case and there's a lot of
resources associated with it because

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:19.710
resources associated with it because
 

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.170
resources associated with it because
those things need to always be running

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180
those things need to always be running
 

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.490
those things need to always be running
like part of the expectation is you're

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500
like part of the expectation is you're
 

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.810
like part of the expectation is you're
always reading star always listening to

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:23.820
always reading star always listening to
 

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.730
always reading star always listening to
the microphone and so so it was a very

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740
the microphone and so so it was a very
 

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.260
the microphone and so so it was a very
conscious decision that you can have one

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.270
conscious decision that you can have one
 

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.600
conscious decision that you can have one
assistant on your device and we and I

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:29.610
assistant on your device and we and I
 

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.189
assistant on your device and we and I
mean that hasn't changed in queue that's

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199
mean that hasn't changed in queue that's
 

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.040
mean that hasn't changed in queue that's
been always the case work and yeah I

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.050
been always the case work and yeah I
 

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.990
been always the case work and yeah I
don't we have no Haven plans to change

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000
don't we have no Haven plans to change
 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.519
don't we have no Haven plans to change
that but there you can have one

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:37.529
that but there you can have one
 

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:39.170
that but there you can have one
assistant and you can change it for

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180
assistant and you can change it for
 

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.839
assistant and you can change it for
people who don't know all right

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:41.849
people who don't know all right
 

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:44.810
people who don't know all right

flutter you should be able you know the
 

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.300
flutter you should be able you know the
toolkit and Android should look familiar

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:19.310
toolkit and Android should look familiar
 

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.830
toolkit and Android should look familiar
to you too so you can move between them

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:20.840
to you too so you can move between them
 

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.390
to you too so you can move between them
and that's something we've done a

viewpoint of futures more about the
 

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.700
viewpoint of futures more about the
things we're doing with them but I can't

yeah outside again so hi hi so in past
two years we had bwa and we had amp and

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800
two years we had bwa and we had amp and
 

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.829
two years we had bwa and we had amp and
we had instant ab but I feel like they

00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839
we had instant ab but I feel like they
 

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:58.730
we had instant ab but I feel like they
they are competing each other so I had

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740
they are competing each other so I had
 

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.980
they are competing each other so I had
the opportunity to do amp and instant

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:00.990
the opportunity to do amp and instant
 

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.889
the opportunity to do amp and instant
app at the same time and when we

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899
app at the same time and when we
 

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:06.560
app at the same time and when we
released a production the analytics got

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:06.570
released a production the analytics got
 

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.190
released a production the analytics got
skewed because when we have instant app

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:10.200
skewed because when we have instant app
 

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.829
skewed because when we have instant app
the traffic's cannot reroute to the apps

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839
the traffic's cannot reroute to the apps
 

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:15.769
the traffic's cannot reroute to the apps
and our sales going to shift from the

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779
and our sales going to shift from the
 

00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:17.900
and our sales going to shift from the
web sales to the app sales so my

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:17.910
web sales to the app sales so my
 

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.940
web sales to the app sales so my
question is so when when you guys

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:19.950
question is so when when you guys
 

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.460
question is so when when you guys
release the product what's what's the

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:22.470
release the product what's what's the
 

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.440
release the product what's what's the
thinking behind it like the drill using

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.450
thinking behind it like the drill using
 

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.329
thinking behind it like the drill using
two products that compete directly with

00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339
two products that compete directly with
 

00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:29.300
two products that compete directly with
each other and the second question is

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:29.310
each other and the second question is
 

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.790
each other and the second question is
what do you expect from us as the

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800
what do you expect from us as the
 

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.410
what do you expect from us as the
implementer of your products so a couple

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420
implementer of your products so a couple
 

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.819
implementer of your products so a couple
of questions there first is analytics

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:37.829
of questions there first is analytics
 

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:40.880
of questions there first is analytics
obviously you know the web analytics

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:40.890
obviously you know the web analytics
 

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.530
obviously you know the web analytics
space is pretty complex especially when

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540
space is pretty complex especially when
 

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.240
space is pretty complex especially when
you're doing SEO and things like that so

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.250
you're doing SEO and things like that so
 

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.740
you're doing SEO and things like that so

we've been working with a lot of early
 

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.120
we've been working with a lot of early
access partners to try to close those

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.130
access partners to try to close those
 

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.500
access partners to try to close those
gaps because the way people think about

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:48.510
gaps because the way people think about
 

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.269
gaps because the way people think about
mobile app analytics is actually quite

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279
mobile app analytics is actually quite
 

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:51.290
mobile app analytics is actually quite
different than the way they think about

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300
different than the way they think about
 

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.410
different than the way they think about
mobile web analytics so we're continuing

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420
mobile web analytics so we're continuing
 

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.610
mobile web analytics so we're continuing
to improve there you should see some

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620
to improve there you should see some
 

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.139
to improve there you should see some
computed improvements in the pub site

00:15:57.139 --> 00:15:57.149
computed improvements in the pub site
 

00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:59.960
computed improvements in the pub site
particularly the other is around how you

00:15:59.960 --> 00:15:59.970
particularly the other is around how you
 

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.370
particularly the other is around how you
think about maybe I miss a third

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380
think about maybe I miss a third
 

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.500
think about maybe I miss a third
question but how you think about

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:02.510
question but how you think about
 

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.280
question but how you think about
selecting between these various

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:04.290
selecting between these various
 

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.380
selecting between these various
technologies at the end of the day the

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:06.390
technologies at the end of the day the
 

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.150
technologies at the end of the day the
way we think about it is that we want

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160
way we think about it is that we want
 

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.040
way we think about it is that we want
developers to have the flexibility to

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.050
developers to have the flexibility to
 

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.260
developers to have the flexibility to
choose the right technology for them and

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:12.270
choose the right technology for them and
 

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.720
choose the right technology for them and
for developers a perfect example of this

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:14.730
for developers a perfect example of this
 

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.220
for developers a perfect example of this
is for games where there is no real

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:16.230
is for games where there is no real
 

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.490

developer yeah but my concern is most of

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.130
developer yeah but my concern is most of
 

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.380
developer yeah but my concern is most of
the time when we are working like

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:49.390
the time when we are working like
 

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.760
the time when we are working like
Android team is working in web team

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:50.770
Android team is working in web team
 

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.110
Android team is working in web team
means working they might be working on

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120
means working they might be working on
 

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.940
means working they might be working on
new feature and they might be working on

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:53.950
new feature and they might be working on
 

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.800
new feature and they might be working on
new feature it wasn't until the release

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:55.810
new feature it wasn't until the release
 

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.140

we knew like our sales gonna hinder each

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:58.150
we knew like our sales gonna hinder each
 

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.880
we knew like our sales gonna hinder each
other so we are in a competition with

00:16:59.880 --> 00:16:59.890
other so we are in a competition with
 

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.070
other so we are in a competition with
each other because of the two two new

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:02.080
each other because of the two two new
 

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.540
each other because of the two two new
products release it's a fair question I

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:06.550
products release it's a fair question I
 

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.860
products release it's a fair question I
think one of the things to think about

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:07.870
think one of the things to think about
 

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.570
think one of the things to think about
is there's a technology choice in terms

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:09.580
is there's a technology choice in terms
 

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.670
is there's a technology choice in terms
of what what things you want but there's

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.680
of what what things you want but there's
 

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.290
of what what things you want but there's
also a distribution choice and the

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:13.300
also a distribution choice and the
 

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.880
also a distribution choice and the
different the different technologies

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:14.890
different the different technologies
 

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.650
different the different technologies
lend themselves to the distribution

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:16.660
lend themselves to the distribution
 

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.270
lend themselves to the distribution
method that your business is using so

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280
method that your business is using so
 

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.040
method that your business is using so
that's why for game developers who are

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.050
that's why for game developers who are
 

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.540
that's why for game developers who are
used to a dish of distribution model

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:21.550
used to a dish of distribution model
 

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.130
used to a dish of distribution model
that comes from an app store instant

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:23.140
that comes from an app store instant
 

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.660
that comes from an app store instant

the first one is is it planned or is it
 

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.670
the first one is is it planned or is it
possible to have one module using

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:17.680
possible to have one module using
 

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.550
possible to have one module using
flutter so we can migrate some views in

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:20.560
flutter so we can migrate some views in
 

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.920
flutter so we can migrate some views in
it and maybe share it with our us

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:22.930
it and maybe share it with our us
 

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.410
it and maybe share it with our us
colleagues and the second question is

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:25.420
colleagues and the second question is
 

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.960
colleagues and the second question is
that I like flutter but is it possible

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:27.970
that I like flutter but is it possible
 

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.330
that I like flutter but is it possible
to make flutter with Catlin

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340
 
 

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:38.180

the first question the first question
 

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.580
the first question the first question
was can you use flutter and just part of

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:46.590
was can you use flutter and just part of
 

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.680
was can you use flutter and just part of
your app they said in a module and they

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:48.690
your app they said in a module and they
 

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.120
your app they said in a module and they
can work on iOS and then the second

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.130
can work on iOS and then the second
 

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.670
can work on iOS and then the second
question is you like flutter everybody

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:52.680
question is you like flutter everybody
 

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.530
question is you like flutter everybody
can use it with Coughlin somebody said

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:54.540
can use it with Coughlin somebody said
 

00:18:54.540 --> 00:19:00.110
can use it with Coughlin somebody said
that should be called flutter so let's

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120
that should be called flutter so let's
 

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.990
that should be called flutter so let's
see so so flutter is its own thing and

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000
see so so flutter is its own thing and
 

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.280
see so so flutter is its own thing and
it's good you know I was actually really

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.290
it's good you know I was actually really
 

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.510
it's good you know I was actually really
impressed with the keynote like how many

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520
impressed with the keynote like how many
 

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.130
impressed with the keynote like how many
people cheered and so it's getting

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140
people cheered and so it's getting
 

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.450
people cheered and so it's getting
popular which I think it's great and

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460
popular which I think it's great and
 

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.370
popular which I think it's great and
from my perspective on Android it's also

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380
from my perspective on Android it's also
 

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.590
from my perspective on Android it's also
because the more options there are for

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600
because the more options there are for
 

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.940
because the more options there are for
developers to write apps it's really

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:13.950
developers to write apps it's really
 

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.930
developers to write apps it's really
good and you know where we as a team are

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:17.940
good and you know where we as a team are
 

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.420
good and you know where we as a team are
investing in terms of toolkits is

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:20.430
investing in terms of toolkits is
 

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.370
investing in terms of toolkits is
jetpack compose which i mentioned

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380
jetpack compose which i mentioned
 

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.220
jetpack compose which i mentioned
earlier and we we that's very much

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.230
earlier and we we that's very much
 

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.950
earlier and we we that's very much
column based obviously and also it's

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960
column based obviously and also it's
 

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.620
column based obviously and also it's
designed to allow you to use it in parts

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:30.630
designed to allow you to use it in parts
 

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.450
designed to allow you to use it in parts
of your apps or all of your app and so

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460
of your apps or all of your app and so
 

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.770
of your apps or all of your app and so
you can phase it in and so we really

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780
you can phase it in and so we really
 

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.330
you can phase it in and so we really
thought about that sort of backward

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340
thought about that sort of backward
 

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:40.400
thought about that sort of backward
compatibility and also you know being

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.410
compatibility and also you know being
 

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.680
compatibility and also you know being
language consistent with Kotlin but that

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:42.690
language consistent with Kotlin but that
 

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.970
language consistent with Kotlin but that
said you know just as I mentioned

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980
said you know just as I mentioned
 

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.560
said you know just as I mentioned
earlier there's you know flutter has

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:45.570
earlier there's you know flutter has
 

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.060
earlier there's you know flutter has
some really nice aspects to it like it's

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.070
some really nice aspects to it like it's
 

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.590
some really nice aspects to it like it's
widget API is really nice how it's done

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600
widget API is really nice how it's done
 

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.150
widget API is really nice how it's done
material and so we worked very closely

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160
material and so we worked very closely
 

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.340
material and so we worked very closely
and so jetpack compose should look you

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:52.350
and so jetpack compose should look you
 

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.460
and so jetpack compose should look you
know somewhat familiar to you and so we

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:55.470
know somewhat familiar to you and so we
 

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.630
know somewhat familiar to you and so we
kind of try to share some of the best

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640
kind of try to share some of the best
 

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.950
kind of try to share some of the best
practices and and idioms in some ways

00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960
practices and and idioms in some ways
 

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.500
practices and and idioms in some ways
yeah so that's kind of my indirect way

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:03.510
yeah so that's kind of my indirect way
 

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.610
yeah so that's kind of my indirect way

how to improve all of our documentation
 

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.790

I would love feedback about what's

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:17.180
I would love feedback about what's
 

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.320
I would love feedback about what's
working and also what we can do better

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:20.330
 
 

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.810
 
Thanks I actually I would add to part of

the stuff that I eat and and team were

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:24.620
the stuff that I eat and and team were
 

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.140
the stuff that I eat and and team were
working on whether that was the

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.150
working on whether that was the
 

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.970
working on whether that was the
opinionated guide right and it's trying

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:27.980
opinionated guide right and it's trying
 

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.440
opinionated guide right and it's trying
to address that it's not just the

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:29.450
to address that it's not just the
 

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.300
to address that it's not just the
libraries but it's also how do you put

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:31.310
libraries but it's also how do you put
 

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.740
libraries but it's also how do you put
these things together in architecture

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:32.750
these things together in architecture
 

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.720
these things together in architecture
application appropriately so hopefully

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:34.730
application appropriately so hopefully
 

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.010

we're getting better at that I would

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.020
we're getting better at that I would
 

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.850
we're getting better at that I would
argue that we're not done like you're

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:39.860
argue that we're not done like you're
 

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.530
argue that we're not done like you're
trying our best is also a little bit

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:41.540
trying our best is also a little bit
 

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.900
trying our best is also a little bit
challenging because like you know your

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:43.910
challenging because like you know your
 

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.300
challenging because like you know your
use case the best so it's very hard to

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:46.310
use case the best so it's very hard to
 

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.490
use case the best so it's very hard to
give like super generic advice so if

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:48.500
give like super generic advice so if
 

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.020
give like super generic advice so if
we're really trying to learn this I

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.030
we're really trying to learn this I
 

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.430
we're really trying to learn this I
caught the last two three years I think

community now we moved compost to the
 

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.150
community now we moved compost to the
open source we got a lot more code

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.160
open source we got a lot more code
 

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.550

you know what I've noticed like in the

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.110
you know what I've noticed like in the
 

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.470
you know what I've noticed like in the
last sort of decade the way this goes is

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480
last sort of decade the way this goes is
 

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.940
last sort of decade the way this goes is
really it's actually the supply chain

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:06.950
really it's actually the supply chain
 

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.260
really it's actually the supply chain
that comes up with some technology

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:08.270
that comes up with some technology
 

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.360
that comes up with some technology
whether it's like a fingerprint sensor

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:10.370
whether it's like a fingerprint sensor
 

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.240
whether it's like a fingerprint sensor
or you know folded bendable displays

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.250
or you know folded bendable displays
 

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.830
or you know folded bendable displays
flexible displays and and the supply

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840
flexible displays and and the supply
 

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.870
flexible displays and and the supply
chain puts it out there and then the

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880
chain puts it out there and then the
 

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.310
chain puts it out there and then the
device makers so look at it like ooh

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320
device makers so look at it like ooh
 

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.140
device makers so look at it like ooh
what could we do there and then we get

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.150
what could we do there and then we get
 

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.430
what could we do there and then we get
involved and we're like oh let's think

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440
involved and we're like oh let's think
 

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.560
involved and we're like oh let's think
how the software works and so that's

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:26.570
how the software works and so that's
 

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.670
how the software works and so that's
that's kind of a pretty consistent

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:27.680
that's kind of a pretty consistent
 

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.200
that's kind of a pretty consistent
pattern what we've seen so like I you

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.210
pattern what we've seen so like I you
 

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.970
pattern what we've seen so like I you
know we would have seen flexible

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:30.980
know we would have seen flexible
 

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.950
know we would have seen flexible
displays a couple of years ago from the

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960
displays a couple of years ago from the
 

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.010
displays a couple of years ago from the
display manufacturers and then you know

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:36.020
display manufacturers and then you know
 

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.660
display manufacturers and then you know
a year or two later we would see device

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:37.670
a year or two later we would see device
 

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.190
a year or two later we would see device
makers trying things out and then we

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200
makers trying things out and then we
 

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.260
makers trying things out and then we
would get involved but you know I

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:41.270
would get involved but you know I
 

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.610
would get involved but you know I
actually pretty excited about the

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:42.620
actually pretty excited about the
 

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.730
actually pretty excited about the
foldables I think you know you know

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:45.740
foldables I think you know you know
 

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.960
foldables I think you know you know
we've been talking a lot about you know

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:46.970
we've been talking a lot about you know
 

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.910
we've been talking a lot about you know
phones folding into tablets and I think

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:48.920
phones folding into tablets and I think
 

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.060
phones folding into tablets and I think
that's you know roughly inform factors

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:52.070
that's you know roughly inform factors
 

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.160
that's you know roughly inform factors
but I actually think there's a lot more

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.170
but I actually think there's a lot more
 

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.770
but I actually think there's a lot more
ideas still to come that'll be quite

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:56.780
ideas still to come that'll be quite
 

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.990
ideas still to come that'll be quite
surprising that I'm pretty excited about

00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000
surprising that I'm pretty excited about
 

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.040
surprising that I'm pretty excited about
and so yeah I'm just thinking like this

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.050
and so yeah I'm just thinking like this
 

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.150
and so yeah I'm just thinking like this
time next year they'll they actually

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:04.160
time next year they'll they actually
 

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.830
time next year they'll they actually
quite a few cool things to talk about in

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840
quite a few cool things to talk about in
 

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.110
quite a few cool things to talk about in
that space yeah anyone else one that and

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120
that space yeah anyone else one that and
 

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.610
that space yeah anyone else one that and
then eventually marketing people get

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:12.620
then eventually marketing people get
 

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.870
then eventually marketing people get
involved and they say you know what how

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880
involved and they say you know what how
 

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.160
involved and they say you know what how
about not bendy phones

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:15.170
about not bendy phones
 

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.670
about not bendy phones
how about foldables better yeah all

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:18.680
how about foldables better yeah all
 

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.150
how about foldables better yeah all
right

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:19.160
right
 

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.780
right
yes right oh hi yeah I was I'm currently

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:22.790
yes right oh hi yeah I was I'm currently
 

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.640
yes right oh hi yeah I was I'm currently
working on a native calling app and I

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:24.650
working on a native calling app and I
 

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.930
working on a native calling app and I
was wondering if there's an API

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:25.940
was wondering if there's an API
 

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.630
was wondering if there's an API
available to access the voicemail system

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640
available to access the voicemail system
 

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.340
available to access the voicemail system
kind of like the for the video the

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:30.350
kind of like the for the video the
 

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.530
kind of like the for the video the
visual voicemail so that I can pull

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:32.540
visual voicemail so that I can pull
 

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:40.440
visual voicemail so that I can pull
voice mail or email audio data no thanks

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:40.450
voice mail or email audio data no thanks
 

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.820
voice mail or email audio data no thanks
I'm not most of the visual voicemail

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:42.830
I'm not most of the visual voicemail
 

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.680
I'm not most of the visual voicemail
services use IMAP so if you get a

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:44.690
services use IMAP so if you get a
 

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.470
services use IMAP so if you get a
regular IMAP client in theory you can

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480
regular IMAP client in theory you can
 

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.060
regular IMAP client in theory you can
talk to them but I'm not fully sure what

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.070
talk to them but I'm not fully sure what
 

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.560
talk to them but I'm not fully sure what
the credentials are I'm sure carriers

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:50.570
the credentials are I'm sure carriers
 

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.860
the credentials are I'm sure carriers
have yeah but it's an IMAP client as a

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:53.870
have yeah but it's an IMAP client as a
 

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.410
have yeah but it's an IMAP client as a
choice okay so there's no telephony API

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:56.420
choice okay so there's no telephony API
 

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.020
choice okay so there's no telephony API
for that No

00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.030
for that No
 

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.029
for that No
not that I'm aware of because it's also

00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039
not that I'm aware of because it's also
 

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:03.220
not that I'm aware of because it's also
like because it's a pretty rich client

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:03.230
like because it's a pretty rich client
 

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.419
like because it's a pretty rich client
you wouldn't want to bake it into the

00:26:04.419 --> 00:26:04.429
you wouldn't want to bake it into the
 

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.039
you wouldn't want to bake it into the
framework because it changes a lot and I

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:06.049
framework because it changes a lot and I
 

00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:07.060
framework because it changes a lot and I
know that different visual voicemail

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:07.070
know that different visual voicemail
 

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.919
know that different visual voicemail
services have different quirks and stuff

00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:08.929
services have different quirks and stuff
 

00:26:08.929 --> 00:26:14.560
services have different quirks and stuff
so okay thank you thanks hi hello there

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:14.570
so okay thank you thanks hi hello there

is this a dead platform should we be

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.190
is this a dead platform should we be
 

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:33.700
is this a dead platform should we be
worried no but where is the where team

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:33.710
worried no but where is the where team

a sandbox at i/o no it's something we're
continuing to invest in we're really

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840
continuing to invest in we're really
 

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.159
continuing to invest in we're really
excited by wearables actually and what

00:26:57.159 --> 00:26:57.169
excited by wearables actually and what
 

00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:58.899
excited by wearables actually and what
could I say you know we've actually

00:26:58.899 --> 00:26:58.909
could I say you know we've actually
 

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:01.980
could I say you know we've actually
hired more people and we're investing

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:01.990
hired more people and we're investing
 

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:07.360
hired more people and we're investing
thank you thanks thank so hello I've

thank you thanks thank so hello I've
noticed that IO and in increased effort

00:27:10.899 --> 00:27:10.909
noticed that IO and in increased effort
 

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:14.049
noticed that IO and in increased effort
on diversity and inclusion and many

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:14.059
on diversity and inclusion and many
 

00:27:14.059 --> 00:27:15.879
on diversity and inclusion and many
talks about it and I want to know if

00:27:15.879 --> 00:27:15.889
talks about it and I want to know if
 

00:27:15.889 --> 00:27:17.710
talks about it and I want to know if
there's anything you're doing for just

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720
there's anything you're doing for just
 

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.750
there's anything you're doing for just
to increase diversity inclusion in the

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760
to increase diversity inclusion in the
 

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.519
to increase diversity inclusion in the
Android platform or even just amongst

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:21.529
Android platform or even just amongst
 

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:26.970
Android platform or even just amongst
your own teams that's a great question

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:26.980
your own teams that's a great question
 

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.649
your own teams that's a great question
you know so I've been spending a lot of

00:27:32.649 --> 00:27:32.659
you know so I've been spending a lot of
 

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:36.399
you know so I've been spending a lot of
time in the medical industry lately in

00:27:36.399 --> 00:27:36.409
time in the medical industry lately in
 

00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:38.710
time in the medical industry lately in
hospitals and the striking thing that I

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720
hospitals and the striking thing that I
 

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.139
hospitals and the striking thing that I
noticed is that you know when you know

00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:41.149
noticed is that you know when you know
 

00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:42.820
noticed is that you know when you know
when doctors do rounds and they and

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:42.830
when doctors do rounds and they and
 

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.769
when doctors do rounds and they and
whatnot striking striking thing I notice

00:27:44.769 --> 00:27:44.779
whatnot striking striking thing I notice
 

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:48.370
whatnot striking striking thing I notice
is how balanced and in fact female heavy

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:48.380
is how balanced and in fact female heavy
 

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.440
is how balanced and in fact female heavy
just give one angle of diversity it is

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:50.450
just give one angle of diversity it is
 

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.509
just give one angle of diversity it is
and then I come back you know these

00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519
and then I come back you know these
 

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:55.450

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039
how operating systems you know
 

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:06.259
how operating systems you know
traditionally have worked it's like

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:06.269
traditionally have worked it's like
 

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:08.779
traditionally have worked it's like
greatly restrict applications and it's

00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:08.789
greatly restrict applications and it's
 

00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:10.970
greatly restrict applications and it's
very important for us to like we have

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980
very important for us to like we have
 

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.889
very important for us to like we have
this balance between freedom of

00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899
this balance between freedom of
 

00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:15.740
this balance between freedom of
developers how open of an ecosystem we

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:15.750
developers how open of an ecosystem we
 

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.629
developers how open of an ecosystem we
can have and what the user experience is

00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639
can have and what the user experience is
 

00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:19.399
can have and what the user experience is
and so things like application

00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:19.409
and so things like application
 

00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:22.190
and so things like application
sandboxing allow us to do things like by

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200
sandboxing allow us to do things like by
 

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.799
sandboxing allow us to do things like by
having restrictions in the platform we

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:24.809
having restrictions in the platform we
 

00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:27.110
having restrictions in the platform we
can have a more open ecosystem instead

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120
can have a more open ecosystem instead
 

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.120
can have a more open ecosystem instead
of having something like where someone

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.130
of having something like where someone
 

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.279
of having something like where someone
is sitting there approving every single

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:31.289
is sitting there approving every single
 

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:32.060
is sitting there approving every single
application

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.070
application
 

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.850
application
you know like with arbitrary rules about

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860
you know like with arbitrary rules about
 

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.960
you know like with arbitrary rules about
whether couldn't be installed we can

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:35.970
whether couldn't be installed we can
 

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.879
whether couldn't be installed we can
have a more open store we can have you

00:31:37.879 --> 00:31:37.889
have a more open store we can have you
 

00:31:37.889 --> 00:31:39.200
have a more open store we can have you
know side loading of applications and

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.210
know side loading of applications and
 

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.509
know side loading of applications and
that kind of stuff and we are always

00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519
that kind of stuff and we are always
 

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:43.129
that kind of stuff and we are always
having to kind of find the balance

00:31:43.129 --> 00:31:43.139
having to kind of find the balance
 

00:31:43.139 --> 00:31:45.110
having to kind of find the balance
between these things so as our ecosystem

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120
between these things so as our ecosystem
 

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.169
between these things so as our ecosystem
grows and changes problems come up where

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179
grows and changes problems come up where
 

00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:50.029
grows and changes problems come up where
we have issues especially around user

00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039
we have issues especially around user
 

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:52.639
we have issues especially around user
experience so for a good example of this

00:31:52.639 --> 00:31:52.649
experience so for a good example of this
 

00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:55.759
experience so for a good example of this
is the is background restrictions we're

00:31:55.759 --> 00:31:55.769
is the is background restrictions we're
 

00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:58.159
is the is background restrictions we're
finding that's increasingly battery life

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:58.169
finding that's increasingly battery life
 

00:31:58.169 --> 00:31:59.600
finding that's increasingly battery life
on the devices gate was getting bad

00:31:59.600 --> 00:31:59.610
on the devices gate was getting bad
 

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.940
on the devices gate was getting bad
because applications had total freedom

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:01.950
because applications had total freedom
 

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.350
because applications had total freedom
to do stuff in the background and you

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360
to do stuff in the background and you
 

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.970
to do stuff in the background and you
give them freedom to do stuff and

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980
give them freedom to do stuff and
 

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.680
give them freedom to do stuff and
they're gonna do it and every operative

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:06.690
they're gonna do it and every operative
 

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.120
they're gonna do it and every operative
L per is thinking like well this is

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.130
L per is thinking like well this is
 

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.190
L per is thinking like well this is
important for my application so I should

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200
important for my application so I should
 

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.870
important for my application so I should
do it and you put everything together

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880
do it and you put everything together
 

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.350
do it and you put everything together
and you know things get bad for the user

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360
and you know things get bad for the user
 

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.460
and you know things get bad for the user
so as we see these problems and this

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:16.470
so as we see these problems and this
 

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.440
so as we see these problems and this
becomes a problem for everyone because

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:18.450
becomes a problem for everyone because
 

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.480
becomes a problem for everyone because
if users aren't happy with Android then

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:20.490
if users aren't happy with Android then
 

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.340
if users aren't happy with Android then
they're gonna leave Android they're

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.350
they're gonna leave Android they're
 

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.840
they're gonna leave Android they're
gonna be you know not use their devices

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:23.850
gonna be you know not use their devices
 

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.610
gonna be you know not use their devices
as much so we kind of need to addresses

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620
as much so we kind of need to addresses
 

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.950
as much so we kind of need to addresses
in the platform so that's why we do

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960
in the platform so that's why we do
 

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.570
in the platform so that's why we do
these kind of things very like say okay

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580
these kind of things very like say okay
 

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.180
these kind of things very like say okay
we can't let applications run this

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:32.190
we can't let applications run this
 

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:33.500
we can't let applications run this
freely anymore we need to have some

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:33.510
freely anymore we need to have some
 

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.180
freely anymore we need to have some
controls in the platform to lock that

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:35.190
controls in the platform to lock that
 

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.980
controls in the platform to lock that
down ultimately it's fair for everyone

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:36.990
down ultimately it's fair for everyone
 

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.870
down ultimately it's fair for everyone
but it does cause a lot of pain and it

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880
but it does cause a lot of pain and it
 

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.930
but it does cause a lot of pain and it
does cause some restrictions on what

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940
does cause some restrictions on what
 

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.060
does cause some restrictions on what
developers can do but we try hard to

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:44.070
developers can do but we try hard to
 

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.940
developers can do but we try hard to
like still have as much freedom as we

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:46.950
like still have as much freedom as we
 

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:47.720
like still have as much freedom as we
can

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:47.730
can
 

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:52.070
can
we we care deeply about compatibility

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080
we we care deeply about compatibility
 

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.529
we we care deeply about compatibility
and I mean I think the soul of the

00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539
and I mean I think the soul of the
 

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.870
and I mean I think the soul of the
platform is we love developers if you

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880
platform is we love developers if you
 

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.279
platform is we love developers if you
take if you forget everything else from

00:32:58.279 --> 00:32:58.289
take if you forget everything else from
 

00:32:58.289 --> 00:33:01.159
take if you forget everything else from
this IO just remember that like we love

00:33:01.159 --> 00:33:01.169
this IO just remember that like we love
 

00:33:01.169 --> 00:33:03.740
this IO just remember that like we love
developers and we really want to make it

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:03.750
developers and we really want to make it
 

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.529
developers and we really want to make it
as friendly a platform as possible Dave

00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539
as friendly a platform as possible Dave
 

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:07.970
as friendly a platform as possible Dave
actually talked about compatibility in

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:07.980
actually talked about compatibility in
 

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.120
actually talked about compatibility in
the dev summit keynote back in 2015

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.130
the dev summit keynote back in 2015
 

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.680
the dev summit keynote back in 2015
I remember that far back it's a

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:12.690
I remember that far back it's a
 

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.690
I remember that far back it's a
fundamental philosophy for us that we

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700
fundamental philosophy for us that we
 

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.399
fundamental philosophy for us that we
really want to as much as possible

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:16.409
really want to as much as possible
 

00:33:16.409 --> 00:33:19.279
really want to as much as possible
minimize change and yes this year there

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:19.289
minimize change and yes this year there
 

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:20.779
minimize change and yes this year there
is some change we actually had a great

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:20.789
is some change we actually had a great
 

00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:22.430
is some change we actually had a great
conversation with our developer advisory

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440
conversation with our developer advisory
 

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.750
conversation with our developer advisory
board and they said look you guys are so

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760
board and they said look you guys are so
 

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.909
board and they said look you guys are so
careful if occasionally you need to make

00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919
careful if occasionally you need to make
 

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:29.149
careful if occasionally you need to make
changes just do a couple things one tell

00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159
changes just do a couple things one tell
 

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:30.860
changes just do a couple things one tell
me about it as early as possible give me

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:30.870
me about it as early as possible give me
 

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.230
me about it as early as possible give me
notice to tell me all the technical

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240
notice to tell me all the technical
 

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.149
notice to tell me all the technical
information up front so I can prepare

00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159
information up front so I can prepare
 

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:38.000
information up front so I can prepare
and three tell me why you're doing it

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.010
and three tell me why you're doing it
 

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.039
and three tell me why you're doing it
and be really careful do it as little as

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:40.049
and be really careful do it as little as
 

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:41.720
and be really careful do it as little as
possible and that's what we've tried to

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:41.730
possible and that's what we've tried to
 

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.850
possible and that's what we've tried to
do but I think the big fear I've heard

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860
do but I think the big fear I've heard
 

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.710
do but I think the big fear I've heard
from people with this IO is a few people

have said how you guys changing are you

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:47.730
have said how you guys changing are you
 

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.250

gonna start breaking us all the time and
 

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.980
gonna start breaking us all the time and
the answer is no we have not changed our

crops platform so I was wondering if you

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560
crops platform so I was wondering if you
 

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.290
crops platform so I was wondering if you
could provide some guidance on like how

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300
could provide some guidance on like how
 

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.200
could provide some guidance on like how
to decide as a developer which framework

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:18.210
to decide as a developer which framework
 

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:26.990

so I was talking about the flutter

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420
so I was talking about the flutter
 

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.260
so I was talking about the flutter
developers earlier at the sandbox and I

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:57.270
developers earlier at the sandbox and I
 

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.870
developers earlier at the sandbox and I
was it was difficult to get anything out

00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880
was it was difficult to get anything out
 

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.090
was it was difficult to get anything out
of them as far as why not flutter like

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:02.100
of them as far as why not flutter like
 

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.600

anything that like you get out of
writing natively that is significantly

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:13.190
writing natively that is significantly
 

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.640

like sometimes I run into the choice

00:37:15.529 --> 00:37:15.539
like sometimes I run into the choice
 

00:37:15.539 --> 00:37:17.920
like sometimes I run into the choice
where I need to choose between

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:17.930
where I need to choose between
 

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:24.069
where I need to choose between
supporting an older API version and and

trying to make what I do compatible with
 

00:37:26.849 --> 00:37:31.549
trying to make what I do compatible with
those older older versions versus just

those older older versions versus just
 

00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:35.079
those older older versions versus just
stopping and just drawing the line and

stopping and just drawing the line and
 

00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:39.099

supporting only like newer versions but

00:37:39.099 --> 00:37:39.109
supporting only like newer versions but
 

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:41.930
supporting only like newer versions but
due to that amount of fragmentation I

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940
due to that amount of fragmentation I
 

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.239
due to that amount of fragmentation I
only get like a chunk of the users where

only get like a chunk of the users where
 

00:37:44.249 --> 00:37:47.120

I would get to the other choice yeah I

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:47.130
I would get to the other choice yeah I
 

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.249
I would get to the other choice yeah I
think there's a couple of things were

00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:13.739
of Android just runs on top with a
 

00:38:13.739 --> 00:38:15.769
of Android just runs on top with a
minimal work and you can see some

00:38:15.769 --> 00:38:15.779
minimal work and you can see some
 

00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:17.299
minimal work and you can see some
progress on that so you know with the

00:38:17.299 --> 00:38:17.309
progress on that so you know with the
 

00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:20.209
progress on that so you know with the
beta this year we have what was the

00:38:20.209 --> 00:38:20.219
beta this year we have what was the
 

00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:21.849
beta this year we have what was the
numbers like 23 devices I think

00:38:21.849 --> 00:38:21.859
numbers like 23 devices I think
 

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:24.229
numbers like 23 devices I think
including all the pixels that are

00:38:24.229 --> 00:38:24.239
including all the pixels that are
 

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:26.599
including all the pixels that are
running on the beta of Q and that's and

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:26.609
running on the beta of Q and that's and
 

00:38:26.609 --> 00:38:29.180
running on the beta of Q and that's and
that's like four times more than four

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:29.190
that's like four times more than four
 

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.789
that's like four times more than four
times more and sorry so that's that's

00:38:31.789 --> 00:38:31.799
times more and sorry so that's that's
 

00:38:31.799 --> 00:38:33.229
times more and sorry so that's that's
double what it was last year which is at

00:38:33.229 --> 00:38:33.239
double what it was last year which is at
 

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:36.140
double what it was last year which is at
doubled the year before and then on top

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:36.150
doubled the year before and then on top
 

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.640
doubled the year before and then on top
of that if you look at PI there's four

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:37.650
of that if you look at PI there's four
 

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.680
of that if you look at PI there's four
times as many devices on PI now than

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:39.690
times as many devices on PI now than
 

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.359
times as many devices on PI now than
there was Oreo at the same time last

00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:41.369
there was Oreo at the same time last
 

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:43.819
there was Oreo at the same time last
year and then the other interesting stat

00:38:43.819 --> 00:38:43.829
year and then the other interesting stat
 

00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:46.370
year and then the other interesting stat
is there's 40 percent more devices on PI

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380
is there's 40 percent more devices on PI
 

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.759
is there's 40 percent more devices on PI
than there where devices on o at the

00:38:49.759 --> 00:38:49.769
than there where devices on o at the
 

00:38:49.769 --> 00:38:51.589
than there where devices on o at the
same time and the reason and that's a

00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599
same time and the reason and that's a
 

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.449
same time and the reason and that's a
direct example of why trebles helping

00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:53.459
direct example of why trebles helping
 

00:38:53.459 --> 00:38:55.849
direct example of why trebles helping
it's much easier to do this and so we're

00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859
it's much easier to do this and so we're
 

00:38:55.859 --> 00:38:57.459
it's much easier to do this and so we're
we're just putting a lot of effort into

00:38:57.459 --> 00:38:57.469
we're just putting a lot of effort into
 

00:38:57.469 --> 00:38:59.900
we're just putting a lot of effort into
into that area and we do a lot of

00:38:59.900 --> 00:38:59.910
into that area and we do a lot of
 

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.099
into that area and we do a lot of
programs we work with the silicon

00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:01.109
programs we work with the silicon
 

00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:03.109
programs we work with the silicon
vendors and so that we give them a

00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119
vendors and so that we give them a
 

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:05.630
vendors and so that we give them a
standard build of Android and so that

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640
standard build of Android and so that
 

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.509
standard build of Android and so that
helps reduce version fragmentation but

00:39:08.509 --> 00:39:08.519
helps reduce version fragmentation but
 

00:39:08.519 --> 00:39:09.680
helps reduce version fragmentation but
it's an ongoing thing it looks like

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:09.690
it's an ongoing thing it looks like
 

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.910
it's an ongoing thing it looks like
it'll keep getting better but it takes a

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920
it'll keep getting better but it takes a
 

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.319
it'll keep getting better but it takes a
lot of work I mentioned earlier about

00:39:12.319 --> 00:39:12.329
lot of work I mentioned earlier about
 

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:14.599
lot of work I mentioned earlier about
main lines for consistency so we can

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:14.609
main lines for consistency so we can
 

00:39:14.609 --> 00:39:16.400
main lines for consistency so we can
have more consistent modules and then on

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:16.410
have more consistent modules and then on
 

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.049
have more consistent modules and then on
top of that jetpack if you think of that

00:39:18.049 --> 00:39:18.059
top of that jetpack if you think of that
 

00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:20.089
top of that jetpack if you think of that
as a veneer on top we do a lot of the

00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099
as a veneer on top we do a lot of the
 

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:21.709
as a veneer on top we do a lot of the
work like camera X to try to abstract

00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:21.719
work like camera X to try to abstract
 

00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:23.150
work like camera X to try to abstract
you I think I come Rex works from

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160
you I think I come Rex works from
 

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.810
you I think I come Rex works from
lollipop

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820
lollipop
 

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.240
lollipop
we try to abstract you from a lot of the

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:26.250
we try to abstract you from a lot of the
 

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.940
we try to abstract you from a lot of the
complexity and the quirks that went

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:28.950
complexity and the quirks that went
 

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.400
complexity and the quirks that went
across those different API versions so

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:31.410
across those different API versions so
 

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.260
across those different API versions so
we're doing multiple things and I think

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.270
we're doing multiple things and I think
 

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.490
we're doing multiple things and I think
as I said probably on the first question

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500
as I said probably on the first question
 

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.780
as I said probably on the first question
is you know this is clearly more work

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:35.790
is you know this is clearly more work
 

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.580
is you know this is clearly more work
for us to do but it's something we we

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:37.590
for us to do but it's something we we
 

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.460
for us to do but it's something we we
care about and they're investing in this

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:40.470
care about and they're investing in this
 

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.590
care about and they're investing in this
is like a major focus area for us so

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:42.600
is like a major focus area for us so
 

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.780
is like a major focus area for us so
like if you try to use more JPEG

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:44.790
like if you try to use more JPEG
 

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.100
like if you try to use more JPEG
libraries like all these background

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.110
libraries like all these background
 

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.890
libraries like all these background
restrictions work major tries to hide

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900
restrictions work major tries to hide
 

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.660
restrictions work major tries to hide
the problems from you that so you don't

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:50.670
the problems from you that so you don't
 

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.970
the problems from you that so you don't
need to deal with the api's and when we

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980
need to deal with the api's and when we
 

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.010
need to deal with the api's and when we
create a compatibility library we try to

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020
create a compatibility library we try to
 

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.860
create a compatibility library we try to
implement it even in the older versions

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:57.870
implement it even in the older versions
 

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.650
implement it even in the older versions
even if we don't have the api's and so

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:00.660
even if we don't have the api's and so
 

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.630
even if we don't have the api's and so
the more you can use JPEG in your

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640
the more you can use JPEG in your
 

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.150
the more you can use JPEG in your
libraries the less you care about

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160
libraries the less you care about
 

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.870
libraries the less you care about
fragmentation great thank you thank you

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880
fragmentation great thank you thank you
 

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.730
fragmentation great thank you thank you
unfortunately we ran out of time I had

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:10.740
unfortunately we ran out of time I had
 

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.260
unfortunately we ran out of time I had
one really quick question that I wanted

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:12.270
one really quick question that I wanted
 

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.250
one really quick question that I wanted
to ask Arash

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260
to ask Arash
 

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.140
to ask Arash
and then we're gonna wrap it up when

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.150
and then we're gonna wrap it up when
 

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.900
and then we're gonna wrap it up when
will Google Play in-app update api's be

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:17.910
will Google Play in-app update api's be
 

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:22.180
will Google Play in-app update api's be
available for developers to use now so

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:22.190
available for developers to use now so
 

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.020
available for developers to use now so
