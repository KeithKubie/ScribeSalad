00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.740
Earth observation satellites orbit between
111 miles and 1,243 miles above the surface...

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.260
so HOW THE HECK can they spot the car in my
driveway?!

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.520
Hey y'all, Trace here for your Weekly DNews
Space Update!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.690
There's this amazing political commitment
called the International Charter on Space

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.400
and Major Disasters.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.590
The Charter was created after the UNISPACE
III conference in 1999 as a framework for

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.980
sharing of satellite data amongst member states
in the case of disaster.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.069
Pretty much all of the satellite operating
countries are members.

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:43.100
China activated The Charter after the Malaysian
Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.479
Once activated, member agencies determine
which satellites can be tasked with shooting

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.370
pictures of the area of interest, usually
a location of a tsunami, earthquake and so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.370
on.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.690
This is the first time the Charter's been
activated to hunt track down a missing airliner!

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
Conspiracy theorists assume spy satellites
can zoom in and read over your shoulder, but

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.059
the Earth is real big y'all.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.170
Anyone who's used Google Earth knows this,
you can spend days on there.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.170
But how does a thing 1200 miles a way make
out a tiny airplane, or a car in my driveway?

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.700
Back in the day, the recently de-classified
Gambit and Hexagon American spy satellites

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.140
used large format film dropped from space
and developed on the ground.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.140
The chemical process of film is SUPER clear,
but limited to the number of rolls of film

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140
blasted off with the satellite.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.869
Digital camera technology exists in part BECAUSE
of the space program's want for digital images.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.460
Three companies GeoEye, DigitalGlobe and Spot
Image employ about a dozen satellites just

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.670
for ground imaging.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.119
Governments, agencies and private companies
have their own camera-equipped satellites,

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.859
but the specs are a secret.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:51.549
The GeoEye-1 says they can capture 700-million
pixels-per-second with a black and white resolution

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.960
of 16 inches per pixel.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.509
The most famous, Earth-imaging satellites
are the Keyhole series.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.390
They're probably the best, and some version
has been orbiting for more than three decades.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.990
The KH satellite is basically a giant orbiting
lens.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.730
They're like the Hubble Telescope, but instead
of pointing at far-away galaxies, they're

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.700
pointing at terrorists, enemies of the state,
and that little red book you're reading in

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700
the park.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.920
HowStuffWorks says the KH series can use it's
camera to see things as small as FIVE INCHES

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.390
per pixel, so they can't tell WHAT book you're
reading, but they can see the book.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.080
When it comes to spotting VERY specific things,
things get tough.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.090
The lenses and digital cameras inside the
satellites have to point at the right place

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.090
at the right time.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.069
So if you're worried someone is spying on
you, don't be.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.069
The resources are hard enough to task already.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.150
Not to mention, all this doesn't mean JACK
SQUAT without some SERIOUS data analysis.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.480
There are whole industries built around the
analysis of the images and data from space.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.090
Think about it: 700 megapixels every second
is a lot of visual information, and computers

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.120
aren't great at picking out visual details.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.790
With regard to the Malaysia airline, NASA
is looking through the archives of their satellite

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.659
data to see if any equipment was over the
area at relevant time.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.990
China's satellites spotted some debris on
Sunday, but small pieces of debris in a constantly

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.349
moving ocean are difficult to identify.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.720
So far no one has found anything.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.090
The Internet has been a game changer for this
type of human-centric analysis.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.860
DigitalGlobe has made it's entire library
of relevant photos available to help search

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.400
for the missing airplane, and over a hundred
thousand people are helping out.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.400
That's better than a super computer any day.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.150
Are spy satellites nothing to worry about,
or am I underestimating the power of spy agencies?

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.489
