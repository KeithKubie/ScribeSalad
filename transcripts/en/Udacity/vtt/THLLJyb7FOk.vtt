00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.200
A computer game is like any
other creative endeavor,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.180
it takes a lot of effort and it's hard
to know exactly when you're finished.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.210
You may have heard of the 80/20 rule for
software development,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.960
that 80% of the effort goes to
completing the last 20% of the features.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.200
That's true for games too, to an extent,
but there's another factor.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.360
Good games have more than just lots of
features, they also need good gameplay.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.980
While Future Creep blows a lot of
development schedules, with games,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.190
it's less a matter of
adding features and

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.030
more about making sure the features
are tuned so the game is actually fun.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.980
In a way, it's like painting or writing.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.800
You're always tempted to
tweak some character stat or

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.740
rearrange those two sentences.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.650
Does this change make things clearer?

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.520
Do I need to rethink how
I present this piece?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.800
Games aren't like other software.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.710
They're not necessarily function driven,
right?

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.490
They're meant to entertain and
engage and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.520
these are fundamentally
subjective goals.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.720
So, you may find yourself near the end
of a game project, making less and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.990
less progress towards the finish line.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.340
Don't be surprised and
don't let it discourage you.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.070
You're doing what every creative
person on the planet does,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.490
which is second guess yourself and
tweak and edit and revisit and change.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.280
And just like those creative people,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.450
you're going to eventually decide you're
satisfied with the final product.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.830
And after all that work,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.850
there's nothing quite like the feeling
of actually releasing your game.
