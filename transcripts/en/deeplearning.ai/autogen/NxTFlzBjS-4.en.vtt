this goes on so let's take this first

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
this goes on so let's take this first
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.450
this goes on so let's take this first
equation here and understand what v100

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
equation here and understand what v100
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.070
equation here and understand what v100
really is so V 100 is going to be let me

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
really is so V 100 is going to be let me
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140
really is so V 100 is going to be let me
reverse these two terms so it's going to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
reverse these two terms so it's going to
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.149
reverse these two terms so it's going to
be 0.1 times theta 100 plus 0.9 times

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
be 0.1 times theta 100 plus 0.9 times
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.100
be 0.1 times theta 100 plus 0.9 times
whatever the value was on the previous

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
whatever the value was on the previous
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.100
whatever the value was on the previous
day now for what is V 99 well we just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
day now for what is V 99 well we just
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.969
day now for what is V 99 well we just
plug it in from this equation so this is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
plug it in from this equation so this is
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.499
plug it in from this equation so this is
just going to be 0.1 times theta 99 and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
just going to be 0.1 times theta 99 and
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.899
just going to be 0.1 times theta 99 and
again up reverse on these two terms

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
again up reverse on these two terms
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.300
again up reverse on these two terms
alright plus 0.9 times V 98 but then

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
alright plus 0.9 times V 98 but then
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460
alright plus 0.9 times V 98 but then
what is V 98 well you just get back from

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
what is V 98 well you just get back from
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.770
what is V 98 well you just get back from
here so you can just plug in here 0.1

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
here so you can just plug in here 0.1
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.800
here so you can just plug in here 0.1
times K 298 plus 0.9 times B 97 and so

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
times K 298 plus 0.9 times B 97 and so
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749
times K 298 plus 0.9 times B 97 and so
on and if you multiply all of these

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
on and if you multiply all of these
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.139
on and if you multiply all of these
terms out you can show that V 100 is 0.1

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
terms out you can show that V 100 is 0.1
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.770
terms out you can show that V 100 is 0.1
times theta 100 plus now let's look at

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
times theta 100 plus now let's look at
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.580
times theta 100 plus now let's look at
professional on theta 99 is going to be

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590
professional on theta 99 is going to be
 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.469
professional on theta 99 is going to be
0.1 times 0.9 times theta 99 now let's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479
0.1 times 0.9 times theta 99 now let's
 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.020
0.1 times 0.9 times theta 99 now let's
look at the coefficient on

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
look at the coefficient on
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.559
look at the coefficient on
ninety-eight there's a 0.1 here times

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569
ninety-eight there's a 0.1 here times
 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.710
ninety-eight there's a 0.1 here times
0.9 times 0.9 so if you expand out the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720
0.9 times 0.9 so if you expand out the
 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.420
0.9 times 0.9 so if you expand out the
algebra this becomes 0.1 times 0.9

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430
algebra this becomes 0.1 times 0.9
 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.340
algebra this becomes 0.1 times 0.9
squared times theta 98 and if you keep

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350
squared times theta 98 and if you keep
 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.990
squared times theta 98 and if you keep
expanding this out you find that this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000
expanding this out you find that this
 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.370
expanding this out you find that this
becomes 0.1 times 0.9 cubed theta 97

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380
becomes 0.1 times 0.9 cubed theta 97
 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.660
becomes 0.1 times 0.9 cubed theta 97
plus 0.1 times 0.9 to the fourth times

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670
plus 0.1 times 0.9 to the fourth times
 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.370
plus 0.1 times 0.9 to the fourth times
theta 96 plus dot dot dot so this is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
theta 96 plus dot dot dot so this is
 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.710
theta 96 plus dot dot dot so this is
really a weighted sum does a weighted

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720
really a weighted sum does a weighted
 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.560
really a weighted sum does a weighted
average of theta 100 which is the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
average of theta 100 which is the
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.509
average of theta 100 which is the
current day's temperature we're looking

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519
current day's temperature we're looking
 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.430
current day's temperature we're looking
for a perspective of V 100 which you

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440
for a perspective of V 100 which you
 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.050
for a perspective of V 100 which you
calculate on the 100th day of the year

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
calculate on the 100th day of the year
 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.160
calculate on the 100th day of the year
but those are some of you know theta 180

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170
but those are some of you know theta 180
 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.830
but those are some of you know theta 180
99 1398 397 beta 96 and so on so one way

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
99 1398 397 beta 96 and so on so one way
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.130
99 1398 397 beta 96 and so on so one way
to draw this in pictures would be if um

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140
to draw this in pictures would be if um
 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.320
to draw this in pictures would be if um
let's say we have some number of days of

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
let's say we have some number of days of
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.229
let's say we have some number of days of
temperature so this is Theta and this is

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239
temperature so this is Theta and this is
 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.110
temperature so this is Theta and this is
T right so theta 100 would be some value

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120
T right so theta 100 would be some value
 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.140
T right so theta 100 would be some value
then say 299 where some value of theta

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150
then say 299 where some value of theta
 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.350
then say 299 where some value of theta
98 so these are you know so this is T

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360
98 so these are you know so this is T
 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.410
98 so these are you know so this is T
equals 100 99 98 and so on right so you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420
equals 100 99 98 and so on right so you
 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.479
equals 100 99 98 and so on right so you
have some number of days of temperature

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489
have some number of days of temperature
 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.740
have some number of days of temperature
and what we have is then an

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750
and what we have is then an
 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.180
and what we have is then an
exponentially decaying function so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190
exponentially decaying function so
 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.100
exponentially decaying function so
starting from zero point one to zero

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110
starting from zero point one to zero
 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.199
starting from zero point one to zero
point nine times 0.1 to 0.9 squared

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209
point nine times 0.1 to 0.9 squared
 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.590
point nine times 0.1 to 0.9 squared
times zero point one two and so on so

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600
times zero point one two and so on so
 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.030
times zero point one two and so on so
you have this exponentially decaying

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040
you have this exponentially decaying
 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.960
you have this exponentially decaying
function and the way you compute the 100

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970
function and the way you compute the 100
 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.930
function and the way you compute the 100
is you take the element wise product

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940
is you take the element wise product
 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.479
is you take the element wise product
between these two functions and sum it

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489
between these two functions and sum it
 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.460
between these two functions and sum it
up so you take this value theta one

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470
up so you take this value theta one
 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.190
up so you take this value theta one
hundred times zero point one times this

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200
hundred times zero point one times this
 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.840
hundred times zero point one times this
value of theta

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850
value of theta
 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.110
value of theta
99 times zero point one times zero point

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120
99 times zero point one times zero point
 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.140
99 times zero point one times zero point
nine that's the second term and so on so

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150
nine that's the second term and so on so
 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.750
nine that's the second term and so on so
it's really taking the daily temperature

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760
it's really taking the daily temperature
 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.410
it's really taking the daily temperature
multiplying with this explanation

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420
multiplying with this explanation
 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.750
multiplying with this explanation
decaying function and then summing it up

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760
decaying function and then summing it up
 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.370

based on the latest value that you got

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:26.629
based on the latest value that you got
 

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:28.749
based on the latest value that you got
and it's really this reason the

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759
and it's really this reason the
 

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.639
and it's really this reason the
efficiency it just takes you know one

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:30.649
efficiency it just takes you know one
 

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.939
efficiency it just takes you know one
line of code basically and just storage

00:08:33.939 --> 00:08:33.949
line of code basically and just storage
 

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:36.100
line of code basically and just storage
a memory for a single real number to

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.110
a memory for a single real number to
 

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.569
a memory for a single real number to
compute this exponentially weighted

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:37.579
compute this exponentially weighted
 

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:39.939
compute this exponentially weighted
average there's really not the best way

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:39.949
average there's really not the best way
 

00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:41.980
average there's really not the best way
but not the most accurate way to compute

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:41.990
but not the most accurate way to compute
 

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.990
but not the most accurate way to compute
an average if you were to compute a

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000
an average if you were to compute a
 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.540
an average if you were to compute a
moving window where you explicitly sum

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:46.550
moving window where you explicitly sum
 

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.150
moving window where you explicitly sum
over the last 10 days a lot of 30 days

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160
over the last 10 days a lot of 30 days
 

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.680
over the last 10 days a lot of 30 days
temperature and just divide by ten or

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:50.690
temperature and just divide by ten or
 

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.420
temperature and just divide by ten or
divide by 50 that usually gives you a

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:52.430
divide by 50 that usually gives you a
 

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.460
divide by 50 that usually gives you a
better estimate but a disadvantage of

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:54.470
better estimate but a disadvantage of
 

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.619
better estimate but a disadvantage of
that of explicitly keeping all the

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:56.629
that of explicitly keeping all the
 

00:08:56.629 --> 00:08:58.119
that of explicitly keeping all the
temperatures around in some of the last

00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:58.129
temperatures around in some of the last
 

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:00.369
temperatures around in some of the last
10 days is requires more memory and it's

00:09:00.369 --> 00:09:00.379
10 days is requires more memory and it's
 

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:02.259
10 days is requires more memory and it's
just more complicated implementing this

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:02.269
just more complicated implementing this
 

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:04.600
just more complicated implementing this
computationally more expensive so for

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.610
computationally more expensive so for
 

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.030
computationally more expensive so for
things we'll see some examples in next

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040
things we'll see some examples in next
 

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.850
things we'll see some examples in next
few videos where you need to compute

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:09.860
few videos where you need to compute
 

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.579
few videos where you need to compute
averages of a lot of variables this is a

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:12.589
averages of a lot of variables this is a
 

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:14.829
averages of a lot of variables this is a
very efficient way to do so both from a

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839
very efficient way to do so both from a
 

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:16.809
very efficient way to do so both from a
computation and memory efficiency point

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:16.819
computation and memory efficiency point
 

00:09:16.819 --> 00:09:18.850
computation and memory efficiency point
of view which is why it's used a lot in

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:18.860
of view which is why it's used a lot in
 

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.160
of view which is why it's used a lot in
machine learning not to mention that is

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:21.170
machine learning not to mention that is
 

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.960
machine learning not to mention that is
just one line of code which is maybe

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:22.970
just one line of code which is maybe
 

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.179
just one line of code which is maybe
another advantage so now you know how to

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:25.189
another advantage so now you know how to
 

00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:27.150
another advantage so now you know how to
implement exponentially weighted

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160
implement exponentially weighted
 

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.650
implement exponentially weighted
averages there's one more technical

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:29.660
averages there's one more technical
 

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.090
averages there's one more technical
detail that's what if you're doing about

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:31.100
detail that's what if you're doing about
 

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.759
detail that's what if you're doing about
bias correction let's see that in the

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:33.769
bias correction let's see that in the
 

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:35.590
bias correction let's see that in the
next video and then after that you

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600
next video and then after that you
 

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.749
next video and then after that you
really use this to build a better

00:09:37.749 --> 00:09:37.759
really use this to build a better
 

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:39.550
really use this to build a better
optimization algorithm than the

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.209
