00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:02.675
- [Instructor] A group of
friends wondered how much faster

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:05.179
they could snap their fingers on one hand

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:06.545
versus the other hand.

00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:08.855
Very important question in life.

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:11.802
Each person snapped their
fingers with their dominant hand

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.046
for 10 seconds

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.435
and their non-dominant
hand for 10 seconds.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.209
Where, if you're right-handed,

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:18.683
right hand would be your dominant hand.

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:19.551
If you're left-handed,

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.559
left hand would be your dominant hand.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.174
Each participant flipped
a coin to determine

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:26.639
which hand they would use first,

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.697
because if you always used
your dominant hand first,

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:30.457
maybe you're tired by
the time you're doing

00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:32.351
your non-dominant hand or
there's something else.

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:35.682
So here it's random
which one you use first.

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:37.465
Here are the data for how many snaps

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:39.616
they performed with each hand,

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:43.542
the difference for each
participant, and summary statistics.

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.350
And this is actually real data

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.391
from the Khan Academy Content Team,

00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:49.285
and so you see, for each
of the participants,

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:50.425
for Jeff right over here,

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.260
he was able to do 44 snaps in 10 seconds

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.598
on his dominant hand, which is impressive,

00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:57.108
more than I think I could do,

00:00:57.108 --> 00:01:00.460
and he was even able to do
35 on his non-dominant hand,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.568
and so the difference here,

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:05.702
the dominant hand minus
the non-dominant was nine,

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:09.904
and then they tabulated this
data for all five members.

00:01:09.904 --> 00:01:14.348
Now they also calculated
summary statistics for them,

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:17.116
but this is the really
interesting thing right over here.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:18.720
This is the difference
between the dominant

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.593
and the non-dominant hand,

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:23.084
and so what they did
here, the mean difference,

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:26.027
what they did is they took
this row right over here

00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:30.194
and they calculated the mean,
which they got to be 6.8,

00:01:31.127 --> 00:01:34.223
and then they calculated
the standard deviation

00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:36.467
of these differences right over here,

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:40.076
which they got to be approximately 1.64,

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.909
and then we are asked:

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:48.158
Create and interpret a
95% confidence interval

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:51.522
for mean difference in number of snaps

00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:53.286
for these participants.

00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:54.274
So pause this video.

00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:55.769
See if you can make some headway here.

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:58.307
See if you can think about
how to approach this.

00:01:58.307 --> 00:02:00.120
So what's interesting here is,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.509
we're not trying to construct
a confidence interval

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.704
for just the mean number of
snaps for the dominant hand

00:02:05.704 --> 00:02:08.313
or the mean number of snaps
for the non-dominant hand,

00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:10.989
we're constructing a
95% confidence interval

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.984
for a mean difference.

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:14.682
Now you might say, wait, wait, wait,

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:16.520
I have two different samples here

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.429
and then this third data
is somehow constructed

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:21.690
from these other two,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.523
but one way to think about it,

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:24.828
this is matched pairs design.

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:27.425
So in a matched pair
design, what you do is,

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:30.244
for each participant, for
each member in your sample,

00:02:30.244 --> 00:02:32.805
you will make them do the
control and the treatment.

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:34.426
So for example, you could do the control

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:37.350
as how many they can do in the
dominant hand in 10 seconds,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.905
and the treatment is how many they can do

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:40.201
in the non-dominant hand,

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.100
and in matched pairs design,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.013
you're really concerned
about the difference,

00:02:45.013 --> 00:02:46.705
and so you can really view this as,

00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:49.281
is you just have one sample size of five

00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:51.609
for which you are
calculating the difference

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.378
for each member of that sample

00:02:53.378 --> 00:02:57.170
and the standard deviation
across that entire sample.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.501
Now before we calculate
the confidence interval,

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:02.612
let's just remind ourselves
some of our conditions

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:04.710
that we like to think about
when we are constructing

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.359
confidence intervals.

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:07.620
The first condition we think about

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.287
is whether our sample is random.

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:13.891
Now if we were trying to
make some type of judgment

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.751
about all human beings and
their snapping ability,

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:18.974
this would not be a random sample.

00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:21.183
These people all work at Khan Academy.

00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:23.275
Maybe somehow, in our interview process,

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:26.170
we select for people who
snap particularly well,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.950
but whatever inferences we make,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.481
we can say, hey, this is
roughly true about this group

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:31.765
of friends.

00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:35.597
Now the next condition
we wanna think about is

00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:37.541
the normal condition.

00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.149
Now there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.342
If we had sample size of 30 or larger,

00:03:42.342 --> 00:03:43.853
the central limit theorem says,

00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:47.992
okay, the sampling distribution
would be roughly normal,

00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:50.316
the sampling distribution
of the sample means,

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:53.443
but obviously, our sample size
is much smaller than that.

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:54.488
One way to think about it.

00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:56.081
We could just plot our data points

00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.671
and see whether they seem
to be skewed in any way,

00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:02.470
and if we just do a little
dot plot right over here,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.808
we could say.

00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:07.975
Let's see, make this, zero,
one, two, three, four, five,

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:11.500
six, seven, eight, and nine.

00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:16.924
So we have one data point
where the difference was nine,

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:19.339
one data point where
the difference is five,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.427
one data point where
the difference is eight,

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:25.225
one data point where
the difference is six,

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:28.633
and another data point
where the difference is six,

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:32.046
and so this doesn't look
massively skewed in any way.

00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:33.830
Our mean difference was right over here.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.365
It's about 6.8.

00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:37.520
It looks roughly symmetric.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.021
So we can feel okay about
this normal distribution.

00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.674
This isn't the best study
that one could conduct.

00:04:44.674 --> 00:04:46.359
This is obviously a small sample size.

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:48.825
It's not random of the entire population,

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:50.336
but maybe we could go with it.

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:52.747
Also, when you think about
biological processes,

00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:54.430
like how well someone snaps,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.305
which is a product of a
lot of things happening

00:04:56.305 --> 00:04:57.567
in the human body,

00:04:57.567 --> 00:04:59.643
and it's the sum of many many processes.

00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:01.168
Those things also tend to have

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.539
a roughly normal distribution,

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.434
but I won't go into too much depth there,

00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:06.080
but all of these things, once again,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.544
this isn't a super robust study,

00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:09.704
but this is a fun thing for friends to do

00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:11.541
if they have nothing else to do.

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:12.453
All right.

00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:14.293
Now the third one is independence.

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.870
And this one actually we
can feel pretty good about,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.867
because Jeff's difference right over here

00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:21.043
really shouldn't impact
David's difference,

00:05:21.043 --> 00:05:22.774
or David's difference
really shouldn't impact

00:05:22.774 --> 00:05:23.781
Kim's difference,

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.298
especially if they're
not observing each other.

00:05:25.298 --> 00:05:26.782
And let's just say for sake of argument

00:05:26.782 --> 00:05:30.200
that they did it all
independently in a closed room

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.736
with an independent observer,

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.121
so they weren't trying to get competitive

00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:34.242
or something like that,

00:05:34.242 --> 00:05:35.173
but needless to say,

00:05:35.173 --> 00:05:36.740
this isn't a super robust study,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.385
but we can still calculate
a 95% confidence interval.

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:41.606
So how do we do that?

00:05:41.606 --> 00:05:43.650
Well, we've done this so many times,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.400
our confidence interval
would be our sample mean,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.534
so it would be the mean of our difference,

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:53.071
the mean of our difference plus or minus,

00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:55.646
Now we don't know the
population standard deviation,

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:58.201
so we're going to use our
sample standard deviation

00:05:58.201 --> 00:06:00.552
and if you're using a
sample standard deviation

00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:03.799
and this confidence interval
is all about the mean,

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:05.924
and so our critical
value here is going to be

00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:08.893
based on a t-table on a t-statistic,

00:06:08.893 --> 00:06:10.186
and they're going to multiply that

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:14.884
times the sample standard
deviation of the differences,

00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:18.501
divided by the square
root of our sample size,

00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.371
divided by the square root of five.

00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:22.197
Now we know most of this data here,

00:06:22.197 --> 00:06:23.917
and let me just write it down over here.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:28.262
We know the mean, the sample
mean right over here, 6.8.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:32.030
So it's going to be 6.8 plus or minus,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.894
and now what will be
our critical value here?

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:40.165
Well, we wanna have a
95% confidence interval

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:42.383
and what's our degrees of freedom?

00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:44.333
Well, it's one less than our sample size,

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.681
so our degrees of freedom right
over here is equal to four.

00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:51.096
And so we're ready to use a t-table.

00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:53.410
So this is a truncated
t-table that I could fit

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.889
on my screen here,

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.070
and so there's a couple
of ways to think about it.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.660
Here they actually give
us the confidence level,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.381
and the reason why that
corresponds to a tail probability

00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:06.381
of 0.025 is that if
you take the middle 95%

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:09.379
of a distribution,

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.650
you're going to have 2.5% on either end.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.890
That's going to be your tail probability,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.704
so that's all that's going on over there.

00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:19.771
So we're going to be in
this column right over here

00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:23.680
and which degrees of freedom do we use?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.885
Well, it's gonna be
four degrees of freedom.

00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:25.982
Our sample size is five.

00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:27.688
Five minus one is four,

00:07:27.688 --> 00:07:32.282
so this is going to be
our critical value, 2.776.

00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:35.532
So we have 2.776 as our critical value,

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:42.533
and then times our sample
standard deviation.

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:44.243
Well, the sample standard deviation

00:07:44.243 --> 00:07:48.816
for our difference is
right over here, is 1.64,

00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:51.340
and then we're going to divide that

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.490
by the square root of our sample size.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.304
So the square root of our sample size,

00:07:56.304 --> 00:07:57.935
where I already wrote a five in there.

00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:59.766
Sometimes I just write an N there,

00:07:59.766 --> 00:08:02.092
and so, what is this going to be equal to?

00:08:02.092 --> 00:08:03.894
First, let's just calculate
just the margin of error

00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:04.727
right over here,

00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:07.977
so this is going to be 2.776 times 1.64

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:17.556
divided by the square root of five,

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:24.100
and we get a margin of error
of approximately 2.036,

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.672
so this is going to be
6.8 plus or minus 2.036.

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.375
It's approximately equal to that,

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.189
where this is our margin of error,

00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:37.739
and if we actually wanted
to write out the interval,

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:40.622
we could just take 6.8 minus
this, and 6.8 plus that,

00:08:40.622 --> 00:08:42.580
so let's do that again
with the calculator.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.663
So 6.8 minus 2.036 is equal to 4.764.

00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:57.364
So our confidence interval
starts at 4.764, approximately,

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.807
and it goes to, let's see.

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:01.486
I can actually do this one in my head,

00:09:01.486 --> 00:09:04.089
if I add 2.036 to 6.8,

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:06.256
that is going to be 8.836.

00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:12.565
Now how would we interpret
this confidence interval

00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:13.723
right over here?

00:09:13.723 --> 00:09:17.810
One way to interpret it is to
say that we are 95% confident

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.501
that this interval captures
the true mean difference

00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:24.326
in snaps for these friends.

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:27.646
We could also say that there
appears to be a difference

00:09:27.646 --> 00:09:30.194
in the mean number of snaps,

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:32.948
since zero is not
captured in this interval,

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:36.026
and since the entire
interval is above zero,

00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:38.595
Zero is not captured
here and it's above zero,

00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:40.544
it seems that this group right over here,

00:09:40.544 --> 00:09:42.347
this group of friends at Khan Academy,

00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:45.209
can snap faster with their dominant hands.
