00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.780
I'm getting a couple of wood 2x4s ready because
my 4 foot magnifying lens needs a sturdy frame.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.980
I hacked this out of an old TV in a previous
video, but it's too flimsy to use on it's

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.550
own. We need something that's super cheap
to make, but sturdy and easy to use, and I've

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.630
got an idea that just might work.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.210
Measuring the sides of the lens seems like
a good place to start, so let's do that and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.530
then mark the wood for custom cutting. It's
best to use as little wood as possible so

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.410
I'm gonna use this table saw to rip these
studs in two. This shouldn't compromise the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.250
integrity of the frame at all, and it will
cut the weight in half! These 2x4's are now

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.309
2x2's, and we'll need to cut a groove right
down the middle. Once I've got the center

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.440
lined up, I'll lower the blade down to about
3/4" and get the saw spinning. As the beam

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.399
glides over the blade, I'm happy to see that
it cuts a clean 3/16" groove. This is the

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.819
groove that our lens will fit into and sliding
the pieces into place proves that the cuts

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:20.759
were good. The edges match up and the frame
looks functional, but before we secure it,

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.979
we'll need to drill some holes right in the
center to accommodate this 3" bolt. I've added

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.509
a rubber washer to the bolt and pushed it
through the hole, then when this piece goes

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.599
back in place we can still access the threads.
Oops, I almost forgot. I wanted to add a more

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.910
finished look to this frame, so I'll add a
1/2" chamfer bit to my router, and trim the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.099
outer edges. I built this router right into
my workbench so I'd have a lot of room for

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:47.110
bigger projects. Look for how to build this router table in a different project. These simple

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.200
cuts are quickly giving the frame a more professional
look. Ok, those are done so now I can retract

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.060
my router bit and lay these support blocks
down. The lens goes overtop, and these blocks

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.000
are helping prevent the lens from warping.
When we've got one of the corners lined up,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.670
we can drill a pilot hole, and add a 3" wood
screw. That's holding well, so let's repeat

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.200
that on the other 3 corners. Drilling these
holes first, helps prevent the wood from splitting

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.450
when the screws go in. The Scorcher lens is
framed, and we can put that off to the side

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.310
and get to work on making a collapsable "A"-frame.
This time we'll need to cut two 5' lengths

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.530
of 2x4 and rip them into 2x2's the same as
the others. I wanna make a hinged frame,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.380
but before we do let's router these edges
as well, and save some of the saw dust for

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.750
a future charcoal making project. Alright,
my table is clean again, and I'm gonna

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.550
try an idea for a modified hinge with these
eye-screws. These screws were 6 for a buck,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.640
and we'll only need 4. Holes are drilled in
the center of the the chamfered edge, and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.110
then these screws are tightened to where they
line up nicely with each other. They stay

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.300
together closed, and fully open, so I'm hopeful
this is gonna work. It's time to join the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.670
"A"-frame with the Scorcher lens. A washer
and nut go on the bolt, and now I'm cutting

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.470
this barbed sprinkler line coupling to act
as a spacer. The barb is on, with a washer

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.640
on either end, and the eye-screws are added
next, followed by washer, barb, washer, and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.010
secured in place with a wing nut. Everything
is duplicated on the other side, and these

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.350
frame legs pivot just the way I was hoping.
Next we'll need to measure the distance between

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.030
the legs and cut 4 more pieces of wood to
act as support braces. When those are roughed

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.280
in place, let's measure about 10" from the
Scorcher frame and make some marks.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.660
When we've drilled the holes and added the screws, the frame is pretty

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.840
much done. The Scorcher lens rotates a full
360 degrees and seems relatively sturdy. One

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.930
more thing I wanna try is adding an adjustable
tensioner, so I'm cutting a scrap piece of

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.590
1/8" hardboard into a strip about 2" wide
and 18" long. Then I'll adjust the saw to

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.400
cut a groove in the center stopping about
1-1/2" from the ends. A hole is drilled in

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.990
the frame 10" from the top and the band is
connected to the frame with a 3" bolt and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.500
some wide metal washers. A wing nut will hold
that together loosely, then this other end

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.270
of the strap connects to the side of the pivoting
frame about 5" from the fulcrum. Oops, that's

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.690
a little too tight, so I'll back it off a
touch, and give it a test. I can still rotate

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.450
the lens nearly 360 degrees, but now I have
the benefit of being able to position, and

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.010
tighten this securely at any angle I want.
The frame looks great and totally exceeds

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.859
my expectations for functionality and practical
use. The best part is we made the whole thing

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.620
custom for about $8! That's it for now. If
you liked this project, perhaps you'll like

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.510
