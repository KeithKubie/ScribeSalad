NOW I HAVE TO SAY, WE'RE STILL
TRYING TO WRAP OUR

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.939 line:91%
HEADS AROUND THE HORRIBLE EVENT
THAT HAPPENED ON THURSDAY IN

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:08.040 align:start position:0% line:85%
OREGON.

00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:10.743 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S TOUGH TO TALK ABOUT, BUT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:14.714 align:start position:0% line:91%
TOUGHEST FOR AMERICANS TO TALK
ABOUT IS THE ISSUE OF GUNS.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:18.151 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO, WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT
IN A SEGMENT WE'RE CALLING,

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:26.692 align:start position:0% line:91%
"AMERICA'S CONVERSATION ABOUT
NOT TALKING ABOUT GUNS."

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:28.861 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, STEP ONE IN NOT TALKING
ABOUT GUNS IS CALLED

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:32.598 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXHAUSTMENT.

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.502 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS STEP BEGINS BY OVERWHELMING
US WITH NUMBERS.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.105 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE 45th SCHOOL
SHOOTING AT AN AMERICAN SCHOOL

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:40.273 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS YEAR.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:43.843 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT MARKS 142 SIMILAR SCHOOL
SHOOTINGS SINCE SANDY HOOK.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:48.347 line:91%
&gt;&gt; 294 MASS SHOOTINGS THIS YEAR
ALONE, NEARLY A THOUSAND SINCE

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.515 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THE DATABASE WAS CREATED.

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:52.418 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; 380 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN MASS
SHOOTINGS THIS YEAR ALONE.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.254 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THESE FIGURES DON'T INCLUDE
EVERYDAY INCIDENTS OF GUN

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:59.125 align:start position:0% line:91%
VIOLENCE WHICH THIS YEAR HAVE
RESULTED IN 10,000 PEOPLE LOSING

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.893 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEIR LIVES.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.496 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT IS A LOT
OF NUMBERS.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.199 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU SEE, BY OVERWHELMING US WITH
NUMBERS, YOU DO TWO THINGS:

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.735 line:91%
FIRST, YOU MAKE US TIRED. AND
SECOND, YOU MAKE US FEEL LIKE

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:12.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE THAT
CONVERSATION.

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:13.239 align:start position:0% line:91%
"ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
GUNS?

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.073 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S EXCITING!"

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.575 align:start position:0% line:91%
"NO, WE'RE JUST TALKING
ABOUT NUMBERS.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.644 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S EXHAUSTING."

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:21.781 line:91%
SO, YOU GIVE US EXHAUSTION AND
EXCITEMENT AT THE SAME TIME.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:26.853 line:91%
HENCE THE TERM "EXHAUSTMENT."
OKAY? THAT'S THE FIRST ONE.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.989 size:75% position:38% line:85%
STEP TWO, THE SHIFTEROO.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:33.292 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL
TERM.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.295 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S WHEN YOU MIX A SHIFT WITH A
SWITCHEROO.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:41.167 line:91%
&gt;&gt; GUN CONTROL ONLY WORKS FOR
NORMAL, LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.535 size:88% position:44% line:85%
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR CRAZIES.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:45.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO: GUNS,
NO GUNS, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.140 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE
MENTALLY ILL.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.609 line:91%
&gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF TINKERING WITH
THE SECOND AMENDMENT, I NEVER

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:53.045 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEAR ANYBODY SAY LET'S TINKER
WITH THE FIRST.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:56.482 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  TINKER WITH THE
FIRST?

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:00.153 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WE'RE NOT ALPINE TOYMAKERS.

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.889 line:91%
YOU THINK WE'RE GUYS WITH CURLY
MUSTACHES TRYING TO FIX A BROKEN

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:07.026 align:start position:0% line:91%
JACK-IN-THE-BOX? WHAT IS THIS
"TINKER WITH THE FIRST"?

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.794 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT DID YOU SEE HOW THEY DID
THAT?

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.363 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE SHIFT --
YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT GUN

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.266 align:start position:0% line:91%
VIOLENCE AND YOU MAKE IT ABOUT
MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.269 line:91%
IT'S NOT UNIMPORTANT TO TALK
ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS, BUT IT'S

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.803 align:start position:0% line:85%
STILL A SHIFT.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:20.973 line:91%
THEN THE SWITCHEROO -- YOU SWAP
OUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT FOR THE

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:25.511 align:start position:0% line:91%
FIRST AMENDMENT. AND EVERBODY IS
LIKE "WHAT THE [BLEEP]?"

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:29.148 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE SHIFTEROO IS [BLEEP]IN'
BRILLIANT, YOU GUYS.

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:33.219 line:91%
AND WE'RE STILL NOT HAVING THAT
HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:36.556 line:91%
NOW, THE THIRD STEP COMES AFTER
THE PRESIDENT MAKES HIS SOMBER

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.125 align:start position:0% line:91%
PLEA TO AMERICA, WHICH,
UNFORTUNATELY, HE DOES ALL TOO

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.626 align:start position:0% line:85%
OFTEN.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.462 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE FINALLY
GOING TO HAVE THE HONEST

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:44.297 align:start position:0% line:85%
CONVERSATION.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.298 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT NOT SO FAST!

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.599 size:75% position:38% line:85%
HERE COMES NUMBER THREE,

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:51.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE [BLEEP]EROO. RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:56.676 line:91%
THIS IS WHEN HATERS [BLEEP] ALL
OVER THE PRESIDENT FOR DARING TO

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.411 align:start position:0% line:85%
START THE CONVERSATION.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.046 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE'S DISTRACTING
ATTENTION FROM 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.180 align:start position:0% line:85%
HIS OTHER PROBLEMS.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.182 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL IT WOULD BE NICE IF HE
SHOWED EQUAL PASSION ABOUT

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:08.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF SIX AND
A HALF YEARS OF POLICY 

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:08.988 line:85%
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:13.893 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY HASN'T HE SPOKEN OUT
ABOUT CHICAGO?

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:17.763 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IF
WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM, 

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:28.507 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU TALK ABOUT THAT [BLEEP]IN'
PROBLEM, RIGHT?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.244 align:start position:0% line:91%
A CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS
INCLUDES GUNS.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.012 align:start position:0% line:91%
A CONVERSATION ABOUT PUTIN
INCLUDES PUTIN.

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:34.880 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A
TOASTMASTER TO KNOW THESE RULES

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:39.285 line:85%
OF CONVERSATIONAL ENGAGEMENT.

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:41.354 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEN COMES STEP FOUR.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:46.259 line:91%
HORRIBLE SUGGESTIONS -- WHICH,
INCIDENTALLY, IS THE NAME OF MY

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.661 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEW COLOGNE, AVAILABLE AT
SPENCER GIFTS AND OTHER FINE

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:51.030 align:start position:0% line:85%
STORES.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:53.432 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
IRONICALLY, IT WAS A HORRIBLE

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:57.436 align:start position:0% line:91%
SUGGESTION THAT MADE ME NAME IT
"HORRIBLE SUGGESTION."

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.772 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, THIS HORRIBLE SUGGESTIONS
TACTIC WORKS BECAUSE THE

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:04.477 line:91%
STUPIDITY COMING OUT OF PEOPLE'S
MOUTHS IS SO JAW-DROPPING THAT

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.514 line:91%
YOUR MOUTH STAYS OPEN IN HORROR,
THUS PREVENTING YOU FROM HAVING

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:10.182 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE CONVERSATION.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:12.918 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HAVE FORMER DETECTIVES LIKE
BO DIETL AND MARK FURMAN ON

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:15.988 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERY CAMPUS AND EVERY SCHOOL
AND YOUR SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:17.923 align:start position:0% line:91%
SAFER INSTEAD OF THESE GUN-FREE
ZONES.

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:19.725 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GET RID OF THESE GUN-FREE
ZONES.

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.862 line:91%
&gt;&gt; GUN-FREE ZONES ARE CRIMINAL
PROTECTION AREAS, AND THAT'S

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:26.132 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT WE USUALLY SEE.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:30.469 align:start position:0% line:85%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.104 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  MORE GUNS IS YOUR
ANSWER?!

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.939 align:start position:0% line:85%
AGH! BAH!

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:36.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
HEAD HURTS.

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:39.345 line:91%
JUST TO BE CLEAR, THEY'RE SAYING
THAT IN PLACES WITH FEWER GUNS,

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:41.814 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ODDS OF GETTING SHOT
INCREASE, WHICH I GUESS IS JUST

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:44.283 line:91%
LIKE HOW THE ODDS OF GETTING
ATTACKED BY A SHARK INCREASE IN

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:53.659 align:start position:0% line:85%
PLACES WITH NO SHARKS.

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:57.863 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT SHARK WAS IN HER LIVING
ROOM --

00:04:57.896 --> 00:05:02.468 size:88% position:44% line:85%
NORMALLY, A SHARK-FREE ZONE!

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.737 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOBODY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT
COMING!

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.740 line:91%
AND HAD ALL THE PEOPLE IN THAT
HOUSE BEEN PACKING THEIR OWN

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:12.945 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHARKS, THAT SHARK WOULD HAVE
GONE NEXT DOOR!

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:14.480 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT!

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:15.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S WHAT WOULD

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.952 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAVE HAPPENED!

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:22.688 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I KNOW WE'VE JUST CREATED A
HORRIBLE SCENARIO FOR THE

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:26.058 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEIGHBORS, BUT WE'RE JUST
TALKING ABOUT THIS SHARK-FREE

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:27.226 align:start position:0% line:85%
ZONE.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.696 line:91%
BUT THE HORRIBLE SUGGESTIONS
STEP DOESN'T JUST END WITH THE

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:31.730 align:start position:0% line:85%
MEDIA.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE ALSO HAVE TO HEAR FROM A
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.369 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY SAD TO SEE, BUT I
RESIST THE NOTION -- AND I HAD

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:40.139 line:91%
THIS CHALLENGE AS GOVERNOR,
BECAUSE WE HAD -- LOOK, STUFF

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:41.640 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAPPENS.

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:45.378 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
&gt;&gt; Larry:  "STUFF HAPPENS,"

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0% line:85%
JEB?

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:49.682 line:91%
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT OR JUST LOOKING TO SET

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:53.152 line:85%
UP A T-SHIRT STAND AT THE BEACH?

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T GET IT!

00:05:55.053 --> 00:05:58.657 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
HOW COULD YOU SAY SOME [BLEEP]
LIKE THAT?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY, THAT'S
NOT FAIR.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.029 align:start position:0% line:91%
"STUFF HAPPENS" MAY HAVE BEEN
TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:05.631 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S LET HIM FINISH.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:06.765 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ...LOOK, STUFF HAPPENS.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.235 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE'S ALWAYS A CRISIS, AND THE
IMPULSE IS ALWAYS TO DO

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.870 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMETHING, AND IT'S NOT
NECESSARILY

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.204 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:13.839 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW, JEB EXCLAMATION
POINT.

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:18.611 line:91%
I'M GOING TO SAY TO YOU WHAT
YOUR DAD'S BEEN SAYING TO YOUR

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:23.983 align:start position:0% line:91%
BROTHER FOR YEARS -- "I'M
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU."

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.952 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
LET ME REVIEW.

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:28.387 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THESE

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.056 line:91%
STEPS -- THE EXHAUSTMENT, THE
SHIFTEROO, THE [BLEEP]EROO, THE

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
HORRIBLE SUGGESTIONS --
OUR BRAINS ARE ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.429 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND FINALLY, THIS IS HOW THE
DOOR ON THE CONVERSATION IS

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:37.563 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHUT.

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:41.167 align:start position:0% line:91%
BY STEP FIVE --
TOO SOON.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.402 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ARGUMENT THAT IT'S
DISRESPECTFUL TO TALK ABOUT HOW

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:45.638 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO FIND SOLUTIONS SO CLOSE TO A
TRAGEDY.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.373 align:start position:0% line:91%
"WHY DO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
THIS NOW?

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:48.441 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT JUST HAPPENED.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.143 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAN'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT THIS
LATER?"

00:06:51.176 --> 00:06:54.246 line:91%
ALL I KNOW IS, IF WE NEVER HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION AND WE KEEP

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.583 line:91%
THINKING IT'S "TOO SOON," WE'LL
STAY IN A CONSTANT STATE OF 

00:06:57.616 --> 00:06:58.616 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOO LATE.
