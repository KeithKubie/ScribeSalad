Speaker 1:          00:00          Wait, wait, wait. Don't let me just hit record. Okay. And now, what were you saying spontaneously a moment ago? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today bliss. And in our last segment we met a guy who dreamt of a perfect world where words can never muck things up. Got a little carried away. So let's forget about Drey. Forget about him. Now we're going to look for perfection right here in the physical world. Okay, so, so, so this story, and we're going to do it with the perfect person Latif Nasser, it begins with a, with a birthday present. It's February 9th, 1886 miles outside the tiny town of Jericho, Vermont. And we're on a farm, a family farm, a the Bentley family farm, and the scrawny 15 year old kid named Wilson gets a microscope from his mother. So it's February and it's Vermont. And so naturally, the first thing this kid does is he grabs a handful of snow, picks out a single flake and he puts it under the microscope. And what he sees

Speaker 2:          01:03          is, is, is the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. It is ethereal and, and, and perfect. He, he calls them masterpieces as, as if they're these, you know, great works of art because him that in his 15 year old diary, looking back, he talked about that moment and what he was thinking when he, when he sort of first saw it and, but obviously, you know, within minutes or maybe even seconds, these masterpieces just disappeared

Speaker 1:          01:32          without leaving any evidence that they, that they ever existed. They just sort of evaporate. Huh. And as he remembers it, he, he sort of decides then in there that he's going to dedicate his whole life to, to documenting these masterpieces. Otherwise no one will ever know they even existed. He's going to spend his whole life documenting snowflakes. Yeah. It's a good life jet and it pays well. Right. That's exactly what his father said. His father thought he was, you know, he was just lazy and didn't want to do the farming chores as far as his milk, the goats. And he goes, now the beauty, the beauty. Right, right. And apparently he was a real, he was really good at digging potatoes, but he just sort of was so busy futzing around with his microscope that he, you know, I don't like this kid. I don't like them to friends.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Your work ethic, it does so fucked up his neck. So he takes his microscope and he moves it to this unheated woodshed behind the house. Um, and he starts sketching these snowflakes, right? And while he's sketching, he can't even breathe because he was worried that his breath would melt his specimen. So he's sort of holding his breath and, and, and drawing these, you know, these extremely complex crystals that can take you maybe, you know, maybe an hour to draw, but, but depending on the temperature of the humidity, the size of the crystal he had at most, he had five minutes at the end of that, he, he looks at the mall and, and he's not satisfied. He just felt like he wasn't doing it justice. You know what he calls these miracles of beauty. So Bentley persuades his mother who persuaded his father to buy him a camera. Why is that great? Wait, wait, wait. 1880. We're in February, 1880. I have, we entered into, in the era of picture taking, just, just barely, and for a farming family, this was like a lot of money, but they buy it for him and he gets it. Any sort of Jerry rigs to the microscope. And at age 19, Wilson Bentley is the first person ever in history to photograph a snowflake. Okay. I'm going to cue the snowflake celebrations are secure, right.

Speaker 3:          03:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:43          from then on, basically for the next 46 winters until he died, every, every snowfall, every blizzard is a Bentley would stand in the doorway of his little shack, uh, holding out a wooden tray, uh, with, with thick mittens. Cause you would wear these, they're almost like oven mitts to, to, to make sure that his, none of his body heat would kind of leak out and inadvertently melt any of the snow. So He'd sort of stand there and sort of give it a once over with his eye. If nothing was promising. He, he basically had a, a Turkey feather and he would sort of just wipe it clean with this Turkey feather until he did find something you liked. And then he would, he would take this tiny little wooden rod and he would just certain really delicately tap the center of the crystal and like really, really, really gently lifted off and then transfer it onto the, onto a glass slide so that he could put it under the microscope and he could photograph it. Over the course of his life. He'd basically photographed about 5,000 snow crystals for his whole life. He was just a farmer doing this kind of as a hobby. Uh, but he sold copies of these photos for 5 cents a pop to places like Harvard and the British Museum and the US weather bureau, research journals, magazines like nature and national geographic. And I mean, you've already seen the photos like you, you've gotten them on a Christmas card, they're on your like ugly Christmas sweater in your closet somewhere. Um, remember throwing a shirt with them on right now. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Um, they're, they're, they're, they're everywhere.

Speaker 2:          05:13          They're beautiful, symmetrical, really clean. And Complex. A lot of the greatest scientists who ever lived like Descartes and Kepler and Hook, they all tried to sketch and draw and kind of capture the essence of snowflakes, but none of them could do it as well as this one obsessive loaner from Jericho, Vermont, whose photos were perceived to be kind of more faithful to nature than, than, than anybody else's. But that was until, um, this

Speaker 1:          05:42          other guy came on the scene, this German guy Q, the other guy. Germanic theme music. Yes. Hey, yes. See she got through, he was a German meteorologist named Gustaf Hellman who stuff? Hell man. Not of the mayonnaise fame. I don't believe, I haven't even thought of that actually. Like it's a helmet. Is this, is he a contemporary of Bentley? Yeah, he is. And he's working on his own book about weather and so he hires a kind of a micro photographer who's another German guy named Richard Newhouse when Mike is a very teeny photographer who he kept on his desk. Yeah, he's a microscopic himself and he just takes normal size photographs. Anyhow, he hires this guy and they take a bunch of photos using basically similar technology camera and a microscope essentially. But what they find is totally different. They do not find the, the, the elegance and metrical ideal snow crystals that Bentley found.

Speaker 1:          06:47          The crystals they found were like flawed, lopsided, usually like broken. And the way I think of it, it was like a Martian who had only ever seen like glossy fashion magazines had just been given some like random family photo album and it was like, Oh wow, this is, they're not so pretty. Like these are kind of ugly, you know, these humans, humans are not all symmetrical. These Germans day, they basically called them out. They, they basically stopped. Bentley was a fraud. There was a particular way that Bentley prepared his photographs. What he would do is he would use a, a pen knife to scrape the negative around the snow crystal, which is what gave it that kind of Nice black background because he thought it would kind of put it in maybe starker relief. Um, and, and the German guys said that's it's, it's misleading that it kind of mutilates the snowflakes, um, away.

Speaker 1:          07:42          So he's photographing these snowflakes and then significantly messing with the photograph. Exactly right. Exactly right. So here's a quote from the photographer who said, quote, in many images, Bentley did not limit himself to improving the outlines. He let his knife play deep inside the heart of the crystals so that fully arbitrary figures emerged. So He's, Oh, I don't know. That doesn't seem so no longer a candidate, is it? Well, that's, that's the question. So then, but then, so they basically lob this, and this is kind of going into these journals, but Bentley basically launches a counter attack.

Speaker 1:          08:21          And what he says is that in fact those guys are wrong, that not correcting your photographs was an, he used this word like perverts to him. Why wouldn't you remove specks of dust or other imperfections? Why, why photograph of a broken snowflake when you can photograph a complete one? So this is a quote from Bentley. He said, a true scientist wishes above all to have his photographs as true to nature as possible. And if retouching will help in this respect than it is fully justified. So he thought his retouched snowflakes were truer than the normal ones. Yeah, yeah, exactly. The scientist is supposed to be kind of this very experienced, almost like a sage who is seen every different variation on a snowflake, but can sort of bring that all together in one drawing, one sketch, one photograph, and that's the true snowflake. So if I brought him a slightly gloppy snowflake and said, look, this is what fell on my nose and this is a true snowflake because it actually fell from the sky and it's, you know, it was an an enhanced, yeah, he would say that.

Speaker 1:          09:31          He would say, Robert, you're, you're an amateur. Like this is, this is not good work. You know, this is an aberration. This is an abnormality. Why would you choose to kind of highlight an abnormality as opposed to kind of this, this true ideal snowflake, you know, and does that one exist? I mean, that's the key question for me. Like does the ideal snowflake exist in nature? You think there are such things I exquisitely beautiful. I would like to think that there are no, so I think if my facts are right, the world's snowflake expert is actually in, in Pasadena, California.

Speaker 4:          10:07          All right. Check, check, check, check, check in. Can Sunny Southern California. Yeah, I'm wearing a tee shirt. I have sunscreen lathered and I am going to talk to the world authority on snow. How are you? His name is Ken Lee Breck. He's a professor of physics at cal tech. He is in a way, he's like the modern day Wilson Bentley because he takes a ton of of snowflake pictures taken about 10,000 now and uh, and he actually makes snowflakes. Oh yeah. Artificially. Okay. Wow. So this is a giant tank. This is a nitrogen here. Nevermind that. And to get to your question about the ideal snowflake, a few things. So number one, they're a bajillion different kinds, dendritic crystal stellar Denverites needles and columns and hollow columns and, and a sector plates. That's one thing. The second thing is that snowflakes are never static. They're never one thing. So at every single moment as it falls to the earth, it's either growing or shrinking.

Speaker 4:          11:17          Depending on the kind of trajectory through the different pockets of weather as it's moving down. So there is no real platonic ideal form of a snowflake because it's, it's, it's so influx. I mean, there's no such thing as a perfect snowflake, but that doesn't stop Kenley Brag from, from looking, you know, I tried up in Tahoe and Japan, Vermont, Michigan travels all over the world looking for Bentley's perfect flakes. Alaska. I've been to Alaska, Sweden, but my favorite spot is northern Ontario, a little town called Cochran population 5,487. So where do you go and do you just, just anywhere. They're just falling all over the place. Mostly it's the, it's the, uh, parking lot of my, my, my hotel. He says there's a lot of waiting involved. You'd only really snow as well about once a week. Even then things have to be goldilocks perfect. If the clouds are too high, then they evaporate a little on the way down.

Speaker 4:          12:11          They look for pretty, or if the clouds are too light or too heavy, that's bad too. And a lot of times the temperature is wrong if you want those Christmas card supermodels, snowflakes, uh, eat. But you need to have exactly minus 15 that's five degrees Fahrenheit. You need to have high humidity, not so much wind so that they'll putter down slowly and have more time to grow. But every once in awhile, I mean when the conditions are right, yeah, you've got side all hopeful and dissipating and it's like, oh crap, there's nothing garbage out here. So you're back. Go back inside and read some more email and you'll come back a half an hour later, nope, still lousy and you half hour later, nope, still allows it and you know, you do this for hours and then all of a sudden they'll get really good. And then, and then just out there and frantically trying to collect as many as I can.

Speaker 4:          12:59          Well one of the things I like to think about this is, you know, here I am with my little piece of cardboard in the middle of a continent. It is snowing all the time. And so I am catching some incredibly small number of these things. For a brief period and getting some really cool pictures. And so you kind of wonder what the, what else is out there and what are you missing? I mean, imagine just all the beautiful little works of art that are just falling down totally unnoticed and then they just disappear. I mean, stuff that is far prettier than, you know, the pictures I have, cause they're out there, you know, they're out there statistically they're out there. And so, you know, there's just an awful lot of really gorgeous things such, it just started. Like you say, they're just totally a femoral and you'll never see them and they're falling constantly. So you sort of want to just stop the world and you know, go look at them.

Speaker 7:          14:43          The radio lab, this is Steve Strogatz bliss is the taste of HACCP. Pastrami at Deli in the lower east side of New York City. We live, we're five hours away from New York and don't get there very often. So I spend a lot of time in between visits, thinking about that first taste, hot pastrami. So for me, that's plus I get to think about some kind of almost unattainable perfection, except that it is attainable. I just show up in there it is. This is Mary Roach and I'm in Oakland, California. And I have a list of lists. My list list number one, uh, laughing uncontrollably. Number two, zero gravity that were for the first 10 seconds in a hot hot pack. Number nine, a raw waster, very fresh that no larger than infants ear
