on this a while back so you might think

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
on this a while back so you might think
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.819
on this a while back so you might think
well what is the optimal relationship

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
well what is the optimal relationship
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.710
well what is the optimal relationship
look like in terms of positive a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
look like in terms of positive a
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.800
look like in terms of positive a
negative emotion you might say well

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
negative emotion you might say well
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.260
negative emotion you might say well
utopia nothing but positive interactions

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
utopia nothing but positive interactions
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.200
utopia nothing but positive interactions
it's like no now Jen you get people to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
it's like no now Jen you get people to
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.080
it's like no now Jen you get people to
code the interactions they have with

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
code the interactions they have with
 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.399
code the interactions they have with
their partner during the day you know

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
their partner during the day you know
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.440
their partner during the day you know
you sample it you say with that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
you sample it you say with that
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090
you sample it you say with that
interaction positive or negative and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
interaction positive or negative and
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950
interaction positive or negative and
then what you're trying to do is predict

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
then what you're trying to do is predict
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.499
then what you're trying to do is predict
the longevity of the relationship okay

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
the longevity of the relationship okay
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.229
the longevity of the relationship okay
so here's the data if it falls under

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
so here's the data if it falls under
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.420
so here's the data if it falls under
five positive interactions - one

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
five positive interactions - one
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.000
five positive interactions - one
negative interaction the relationship

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
negative interaction the relationship
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.309
negative interaction the relationship

that's easy to understand if it exceeds

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
that's easy to understand if it exceeds
 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.720
that's easy to understand if it exceeds
11 positive to one negative the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
11 positive to one negative the
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.009
11 positive to one negative the
relationship doesn't last

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019

punctuated by a good fight and that
because that means you respect them

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
because that means you respect them
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270
because that means you respect them
means you have something to offer each

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280
means you have something to offer each
 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.650
means you have something to offer each
other and it means that you're both

other and it means that you're both
 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.839
other and it means that you're both
growing and so you don't want the fight

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
growing and so you don't want the fight
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.149
growing and so you don't want the fight
to be too dramatic because well then you

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159
to be too dramatic because well then you
 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.220

exactly what they're told to deliver but

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
exactly what they're told to deliver but
 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.979
exactly what they're told to deliver but
