Hello, I'm Craig and this is
Crash Course Government and Politics.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.480
And today we're gonna talk about, well, mostly history.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.060
Wait Stan, this isn't Crash Course History. This must be
some kind of exception, like the Mongols. [Mongoltage]

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.140
Apparently we're not stepping on anybody's toes by
talking about the history of American political parties,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.580
as long as we stay away from history in general.
Thank goodness, we wouldn't want to start a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.180
Crash Course interdisciplinary feud. Just kidding, I'm
totally feuding with that Phil guy over at Astronomy.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:37.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.600
Political historians like to divide America
into eras according to which parties were

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.190
active at the time. These are called party
systems, and there have been 5 or 6 of them

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.660
depending on who you ask. I want to say there
were 6, but that's just me. And some political

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.040
scientists and historians. But mainly me, because I'm
the important one here, and not Phil from Astronomy.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.260
There were no parties during the first elections
under the new Constitution in 1788, partly

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.070
because the framers were afraid of parties,
which Madison called factions, and partly

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.030
because there was universal agreement that
the first president of the US should be George

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.100
Washington. And so he was. It was only after
he retired after his second term that voters

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.170
started to break into political factions and
vote based on their ideological leanings.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.219
Although, to call these factions parties is
a bit of a stretch.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.260
Anyway, the first party system, which probably
started in the 1796 election included the Federalists,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.159
who supported Washington's Vice-President
John Adams, and the Democratic-Republicans

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.829
who supported Thomas Jefferson. So, the Federalist
political party was different than the group

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.709
that worked to get the Constitution ratified,
even though they were also called Federalists.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.299
And Alexander Hamilton was prominent in both
groups. What the two parties believed isn't

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.979
so important for this series. We talked about
it in Crash Course US History, but overall

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.599
the Federalists were supported by North-Eastern
business elites, especially merchants who

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:47.489
wanted closer ties with England, and those
who generally wanted a stronger national government.

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.239
The Democratic-Republicans were more skeptical
of national power, and, when push came to

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.049
shove, favored the more revolutionary French.
Ultimately, the Democratic-Republicans were

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.709
way more successful. They were dominant in
the presidential contests of the time, as

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:05.559
Jefferson in 1800 and 1804, Madison in 1808
and 1816, and Monroe in 1820 and 1824 were

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.190
all Democratic-Republicans. Monroe's elections
kind of don't count though, as the Federalists

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.920
weren't really a factor in national politics
after 1815.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.740
In fact, the period between 1815 and 1824
is sometimes called "The Era of Good Feelings".

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.519
And that's how I like to refer to lunch every
day. I just got back from a 45-minute Era

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.280
of Good Feelings. Mmm, it was a burrito bowl.
Yummy.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.340
Sadly, the Era of Good Feelings came to an
end with the election of 1824, which saw John

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.329
Quincy Adams defeat Andrew Jackson in a bitter
election that ended up being decided in the

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.140
House of Representatives. Jackson, ever the gracious
loser, decried the election as a "corrupt bargain,"

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.780
and rode this angry sentiment to victory in the
1828 election. Jackson was a divisive figure

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.980
in a lot of ways, especially if you like the Supreme Court
or Native Americans but, from our perspective, he's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.500
really useful, because his election helped to launch the 
second party system. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.460
The new party, called the Whigs, started out
as an anti-Jackson party. They claimed Jackson

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.760
was a tyrant, and they might have had a point.
The second Party System brought innovations

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.969
to the political process, mostly in the party
that opposed the Whigs. The Democratic-Republicans

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.730
re-branded themselves as the "Democrats".
These Democrats, especially under the leadership

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.709
of Jackson's Vice President, and future magnificently
bewhiskered President, Martin Van Buren, introduced

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.579
some of the features of politics that we still
see today. They established a central party

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.129
committee, state party organizations, and
party newspapers. Okay so we don't have party

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.480
newspapers anymore, because we don't really
have newspapers anymore. The Democrats also

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.040
established state and national conventions
for nominating candidates. Before this, all

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.430
candidates had been chosen by caucuses of
party leaders, which is less, well, democratic.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.950
The Whigs were generally less successful in
national elections, but they introduced flair

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.430
into politics in the campaign of 1840. And
we could all use a little more flair.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.950
This was the first time a Whig candidate,
William Henry Harrison, won the presidency.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.030
And he introduced a great deal of political
theater into running for office. The Whigs

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.749
held parades featuring a rolling model of
a log cabin that Harrison supposedly grew

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.920
up in (he didn't) and copious amounts of hard
cider for supporters. It also featured a giant

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.159
ball covered in campaign slogans that supposedly
spawned the phrase "keep the ball rolling",

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.969
and gave us the first campaign slogan with
both rhyming and alliteration, "Tippecanoe

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.329
and Tyler, too". So catchy it's still used
to this day. I put it in my wedding vows,

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.139
"Do you take this woman? I do... and Tippecanoe
and Tyler, too."

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.760
This came from Harrison's supposed status
as the hero of the battle of Tippecanoe, which

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.689
introduced another aspect into American politics --
the idea that successful candidates for president

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.600
should, if at all possible, be war heroes.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.750
Eventually, the issue of slavery pretty much
destroyed the Whig party, and the election

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.050
of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 ushered in the
third party system. Lincoln ran and won as

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.800
a Republican, and after 1860, the US basically
settled into a two-party system with all elections

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.750
basically between Democrats and Republicans.
But over the years, the compositions of these

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.970
parties, who supports each party, and what
the party stands for changed enough that we

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.300
think of those shifts as creating new party
systems.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.760
So the Republican party was originally a conglomeration
of reformers who coalesced around being against

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.419
slavery. Republicans have always been pro-business
and have tried to associate themselves with

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.650
liberty. In fact, one of their earliest rallying
cries was "Free soil, free labor, free men."

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.930
As viewers of the Crash Course US History
video on Reconstruction know, it was a pretty

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.810
pivotal and divisive time in American history.
In terms of political parties though, this

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.849
was when the Southern states all tilted towards
the Democratic party, largely because Republicans

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.509
were (correctly) seen as being responsible
for ending slavery.

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.080
Democrats during the third party system were
a bit of an odd mix. Their strength came from

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.870
white, largely racist Southerners and working
class immigrants in the north, many of whom

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.320
gravitated to the Democrats because the Republicans
tended not to like immigrants or alcohol, and many

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.800
Republican reforms in this era were designed to keep
middle-class Protestant business elites in power.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.050
Another reason for Democrats' success in recruiting
immigrant votes was that this was the era of political

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.319
machines, which traded political appointments
for support to win elections and maintain power.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.250
The most famous of these machines tended to
be in big cities with large immigrant populations

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.910
like Boston and New York, and they were mostly
Democratic, although there were Republican

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.180
political machines too, mostly in the Midwest.
The supposed Democratic abuses of machines

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.229
brought about electoral reforms like voter
registration, secret ballots, requiring that

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.199
voters be alive, and other good government
reforms that had the effect of reducing the

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.979
number of voters and making elections a lot
less fun.

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.759
The third party system lasted from roughly
1860 to 1896, when another pivotal election

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.599
brought about a change in the composition
of one of the parties, in this case, the Democrats.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.060
Some time in the 1880s, and certainly by 1892,
a new party The People's Party, or Populists,

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.770
began to form in the south and the western
parts of the US. They had a number of concerns,

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.400
mainly about regulation of farm prices and
railroad shipping rates, but also things like

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.580
supporting a national income tax and a general
mistrust of bankers and plutocrats.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.000
(Those are the Democrats that live on Pluto, but
according to Phil, no one lives on Pluto. Whatever Phil!)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.889
They won a few congressional elections, but
eventually merged with the Democrats when

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.150
they nominated the Democrat William Jennings
Bryan to be their presidential candidate in

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.430
1896. Adding certain elements of populism
shored up Democratic support in the South

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.199
and the Midwest, but for many Americans their
ideas were too radical and the Democrats were

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.779
unable to elect any presidential candidates between
1896 and 1932, with one exception: Woodrow Wilson.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.380
Good ol' Woodrow only made it in because the
Republican vote in 1912 was spilt between the establishment

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.560
candidate Taft and former president Theodore
Roosevelt, who started his own progressive party.

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.050
The rise and fall of the Populists show us
something important about third parties in

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.509
American politics. The first thing is that
they never win, largely because the way American

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.430
elections are structured, but this doesn't
mean that they don't matter. Third parties

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.210
can shift the terms of political debate. Without
a Socialist party (and there was one, believe

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.360
it or not) issues of workers' rights wouldn't
have been nearly as prevalent in the early

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.200
part of the 20th century. (Eagle was in the shot, I didn't
want it to be. Didn't want to influence political debate.)

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.100
Often, third party ideas get incorporated
into the platforms of one of the other parties.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.750
This happened with the Populists, as their
plans for graduated national income tax and

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.620
direct election of senators were eventually incorporated
into the constitution in the 16th and 17th amendments.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.840
After the election of 1932 when Franklin Roosevelt
became president and the Great Depression

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:35.939
had kind of discredited Republican economic
policies, the Democrats were dominant in both

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:39.449
Houses of Congress as well. Thanks to these
advantages, the Democratic party saw another

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:44.480
shift in its composition and priorities. One so big that
we say that the new fifth party system was the result.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.039
The Democrats' New Deal policy brought more
groups into the party's fold. Support for

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:52.439
organized labor, especially the Wagner Act,
attracted union workers. The idea that government

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:56.169
could work to alleviate poverty through research
and planning attracted some Socialists and

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:00.360
many upper middle class intellectuals, including
a large percentage of the American Jewish

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.629
community. Southern farmers, always a backbone
of the Democrats, were attracted by New Deal

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:08.689
farm policies. New Deal support for jobs and
FDR's repeal of prohibition helped bring urban

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:12.069
immigrants, especially Catholics, into the
Democrats camp. The Democrats acknowledgment

00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:16.090
that African Americans were suffering especially
hard from the depression helped shift African

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.870
American support away from the party of Lincoln.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.719
This was a major re-alignment, as black people,
when they could vote in America, had until

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:24.280
the New Deal voted overwhelmingly for Republicans.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.389
And even though New Deal programs did very
little for black people (the programs were

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:31.110
often quite discriminatory), the impression
that the Democrats and FDR were champions

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.180
of the poor helped convince many African Americans
to vote Democrat, and they remain one of the

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.640
most consistent groups in terms of their party
affiliation.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.450
The coalition of groups that make up the Democratic
party, sometimes called the New Deal coalition

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.060
(also my band name in high school), had been
pretty stable for quite some time, as has

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.310
the coalition that makes up the Republican
party. This is why some people suggest that

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.350
there've only been five party systems, with
the fifth beginning roughly in 1932 and continuing

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:58.920
to the present. I disagree! As do other historians
and political scientists. My people, my posse.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.210
I bet they all have beards too.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.970
Us six-system-ers argue for a further realignment
of support after 1968 and consider the current

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.640
political climate to be a sixth party system.
The main shift here, and in terms of Congress

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.210
it has been really huge, is that the South,
which used to be solidly Democratic, is now

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.830
pretty unshakably Republican.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.190
Most historians will tell you that this has
largely to do with race, and the Democrats'

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.390
support of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965
Voting Rights Act, and we don't have time

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.670
to go into just how true that is. What we
can say is that for whatever reason, the Republican

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.690
party now draws a lot of support from White,
middle, and lower-middle class voters, especially

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.920
in the South and Midwest, and that these were
groups that used to vote for Democrats.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.140
A major part of this realignment is white
working class men who generally used to be

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.850
reliable union democrats, but are now just
as likely to vote republican. The democrats

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.260
have maintained their support among liberal
intellectuals, members of minority groups,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.660
and to a lesser degree women, but their coalition
is much less powerful than it used to be.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.660
We could say a lot more about political parties
in America and how they might be changing

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.480
as we speak, but as I promised this episode
has been about history and how we got to where

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.220
we are. If you're going to take away anything,
it should be that political parties change

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.690
over time both in terms of their policies
and the groups that support them. And that

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.960
it's often historical contingencies that cause
these shifts. And although we pretty much

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.560
always had a two party system, third parties
are still valuable even though they never

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.040
win because they help frame issues and move
the terms of political debate and even of policy.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.280
It's like me. I've never won an internet
award, but I made up the word "Doobly-doo," so...

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.600
