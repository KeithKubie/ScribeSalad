00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.580
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.680
<v 1>joining me today is an evolutionary psychologist and author and associate</v>

3
00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:12.610
professor at the University of New Mexico.
Jeffrey Miller.

4
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:16.510
Welcome to the Rubin report to Dave.
Great to be here.
Good to be with you,

5
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:18.160
my friend.
Uh,
you know,

6
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:21.940
I realized I've had evolutionary biologists on the show.

7
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:26.560
I've had Bret Weinstein and Richard Dawkins.
I've had psychologists on the show,

8
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:30.640
Jordan Peterson.
I've never had an evolutionary psychologist.

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.840
<v 2>Never.
No.
For many of us,</v>

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.390
how many of how many are there were almost extinct.
Um,

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.990
the big international conference we get maybe 300 people versus like a big

12
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:45.710
neuroscience conference will be 30,000.
That's gotta be a tough crowd.

13
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.900
It's a tough crowd.
Um,
we get a lot of flack from all directions,

14
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.200
but I would,
I wouldn't want to do anything else.
It's an,

15
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.200
it's an awesome field and,
um,

16
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.370
I can't imagine anything more fun than studying human nature for a living.

17
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.850
<v 1>Yeah.
And you're studying and I've written about so many incredible topics.</v>

18
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:06.260
I normally,
I always am proud,

19
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.350
I pride myself on the fact that I usually don't have to look at my notes when

20
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:10.071
interviewing somebody.

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:13.640
But you've hit so many things that every now and again I am going to be glancing

22
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:14.960
down cause I don't want to miss anything here.

23
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.860
But usually the way I like to start these is just finding out a little bit of

24
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:19.671
someone's history,

25
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:23.690
what sort of brought them to the place of expertise that gets them in that
chair.

26
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.620
So just tell me a little bit about,
uh,
you know,
growing up education,

27
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.660
that sort of thing.
What,
what made you interested in all this?

28
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.130
<v 2>Oh,
I was born and raised in Cincinnati,
Ohio.</v>

29
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.290
Went to Undergrad at Columbia University.

30
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:39.000
I studied psychology and biology and just anything that grabbed my interest.

31
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.530
So I kind of started out in neuroscience and I thought the brain's fascinating.

32
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.990
And then I kind of drifted into cognitive psychology,

33
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:50.640
which is studying human learning and memory and perception and how we categorize

34
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.720
stuff.
And then I got really bored with that,
but I thought,

35
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.310
I don't know.
I'll go,
I'll go ph,
do a phd in that.
Anyway,

36
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.940
so I went to Stanford,
started doing cognitive psychology,

37
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.860
but when I was there,
I met a,
these two brilliant,
um,

38
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.340
postdocs who were working with my advisor lead a cause muddies and John

39
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:16.050
[inaudible] who had just come from Harvard and they basically invented the field

40
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:20.340
of evolutionary psychology right there at Stanford in front of my nose.
Hmm.

41
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.390
From the ground up.
And they were like,
we're going to take evolutionary biology,

42
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.020
anthropology,
cognitive psychology,

43
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:32.580
merge them all together and make this new science of human nature.

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.200
So let's slow down for a second.
So how,

45
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.930
what does that say that this is look like?

46
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.840
What does that even mean when they're talking about this?

47
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.580
How do you take these things that are thought of as their own institutions and,

48
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.570
and you know,
put them into one box?
It's basically like the,

49
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.030
the key insight is if you want to understand human nature,

50
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.090
whether it's anything human sexuality or emotions or how we relate to other

51
00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.580
people or other groups,
you can always ask the question,
where did we come from?

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.740
What challenges that our ancestors face in terms of surviving and reproducing

53
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:10.720
and raising kids?
And what exact structure did those challenges have?

54
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:15.340
Like what was ancestral life like?
We don't know every,
every detail,

55
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.480
but we do know a lot from anthropologists who had studied hunter gatherers.

56
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.230
We know a lot from primatologist who have studied,
um,

57
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.010
chimps and Bonobos and gorillas and orangutans.

58
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.580
And you can kind of triangulate on a picture of prehistoric life and figure out,

59
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.220
yeah.
Like why do we fear certain things,

60
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:38.710
snakes and spiders and bears and whatever.
Well,

61
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.230
it's because there were certain selection pressures.

62
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.390
Like if you don't fear those things,
you die.

63
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.110
Why do we look for certain things in mates when we're choosing sexual partners?

64
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.780
Well,
if you don't look for those things,

65
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.350
then you have bad relationships and bad kids,
et cetera.

66
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.770
So it's a way of looking at the past to inform our understanding of the present.

67
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.190
Um,
and that's not what most of psychology does.

68
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:07.180
So it's quite a novel kind of approach.
But I think we've got,

69
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.970
we've gotten enormous leverage out of it.

70
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.470
<v 1>Was there pushback from people within each discipline going,
Whoa,</v>

71
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.110
we've got all the answers right here.

72
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:18.090
Why do we want to put these things together?

73
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:22.140
Cause I would imagine there's always a certain inherent competition amongst all

74
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:22.974
of these different disease.

75
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.160
<v 2>Yeah.
The evolution biologists kind of hate it.</v>

76
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.451
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:29.870
Because that was to be my next question since I know there are a couple of those

78
00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:30.510
guys,
they're

79
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.920
<v 2>happy to go,
here's how other animals evolve.
They're happy to go.</v>

80
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.910
Here is how the human body evolved.
Here's how the human immune system involved.

81
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.900
But once you got above the neck,
then they're like,

82
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.580
you're just going to make trouble for us in biology because that's where things

83
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:52.581
got politically controversial is when you start explaining human behavior or

84
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:57.420
individual differences are sex differences or human emotions and stuff like

85
00:04:57.421 --> 00:04:59.970
that.
So the violence just don't like it.

86
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:02.520
The anthropologists had a lot of the same issues.

87
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.120
Like we've spent the last century trying to get anthropology kind of away from

88
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:10.470
biology in a way.

89
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.870
So please don't drag us kicking and screaming back into that.
Yeah.

90
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.410
That swamp of controversy.
Um,

91
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.680
but we just kind of plowed ahead.
And,
um,

92
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.900
and I think it's been a big success story and in the sciences in the last 30

93
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:28.650
years.

94
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.240
So what were the things that were intriguing to you that had sort of board you

95
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.410
from the other discipline?
More that

96
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.710
I think that the fact that sexuality is central to evolutionary biology and

97
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:45.960
evolutionary psychology,
you know,

98
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:50.490
it's how how we get our genes in the next generation is choosing mates and

99
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:52.800
having babies and raising,
raising kids.

100
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.800
And if you ignore that you ignore,

101
00:05:55.801 --> 00:06:00.650
I think one of the core driving forces in human nature and human culture.

102
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.730
Now,
most of psychology kind of ignores,
uh,

103
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.620
may choice and sexuality and reproduction,
um,

104
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.810
except insofar as it's kind of like seen as politically relevant.

105
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.580
So like you'll get a little bit on while their sexual discrimination against

106
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:20.960
certain kinds of groups,

107
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:24.690
which is important to address like gay and lesbian rights and,

108
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.960
and so forth.
Um,
but they don't really see it as central to,

109
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.990
um,
who we are into what motivates us.

110
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.110
<v 1>So do you see it as,
as the real pillar of what's motivating us?</v>

111
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.260
Like if we were sort of looking at this in concentric circles?

112
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.050
I think it depends.
Yeah.

113
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.800
<v 2>Where you're at in life.
I think for young single people,</v>

114
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.640
what we call mating effort,
like the attempt to attract other people,

115
00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:54.600
whatever your sexual orientation,
that drives an awful lot of behavior,

116
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.620
how you dress,
what I ideas you adopt,
um,

117
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.040
why you bothered to learn things,
why you bother to get credentials.

118
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.590
I think a lot of that is driven by meeting effort,

119
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.750
but then if you settle down and you're in a longterm monogamous relationship,

120
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.730
you don't kind of need to do that stuff.

121
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.670
<v 1>But that's exactly when people get lazy.</v>

122
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.630
<v 2>That's where people let themselves go.
Right?
Um,</v>

123
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.870
they don't say in shape,
they dress more sloppily.

124
00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:25.950
They kind of don't bother reading like serious nonfiction anymore.

125
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.350
Um,
why?

126
00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:33.351
Because a lot of that sort of creative display has already accomplished.

127
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:34.890
It's its purpose.

128
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.550
<v 1>So in that way,
that's not a real conflict with evolutionary biology,
right?</v>

129
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.180
Because you want to look your best to get the best mate and all that.

130
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.980
So in that way you guys are on the same track.
So where does that,

131
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.240
where does that DV,

132
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.523
<v 2>well,</v>

133
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.260
so when biologists talk about courtship displays and here's the bowerbird

134
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.740
building its power and we talk about like ideological displays and here's people

135
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.010
showing off their virtues through virtue signaling,

136
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.960
the biologists know exactly what we're talking about and we know exactly what

137
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:07.220
they're talking about.
It's just

138
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.590
often they don't want to get in the trouble that that follows if they kind of

139
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:13.970
make these analogies

140
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.050
<v 1>two clearly.
Have you had any of these conversations with Bret Weinstein?</v>

141
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.340
Not Directly.
No.
I think I'm going to have to facilitate that one probably.

142
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.200
That'd be a lot of fun.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we'll do that for sure.
So it's interesting.

143
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:27.711
Okay,
so let's,

144
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:31.790
let's focus on the sexuality parties for a little bit because it seems like so

145
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:36.791
many things that we used to be able to talk about we suddenly can't talk about

146
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:42.110
or that academics are self selecting out of and things of that nature.
Now,

147
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.460
I said to you right before we started,

148
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.860
you're one of the few people I see on Twitter and I'm like,

149
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.190
oh he kind of gets what Twitter is cause you put out some smart stuff.

150
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:51.500
You're kind of funny on there at the right time,

151
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:55.830
you know when to go with snark and all of those things and that to me the only

152
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.070
way

153
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 2>that you would be able to have any of these conversations online.</v>

154
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.080
I think social media is actually really good for addressing some of these very

155
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:08.280
tricky issues like human sexuality and how it's playing out in the modern world

156
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.490
as long as you do it with humor and self deprecation and a little bit of

157
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.420
absurdity,
which is what I try to do in my Twitter game,
right?

158
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.760
Because if you approach it like well here's the next paper on like sex

159
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.840
differences or the next paper on how courtship works or oh awesome.

160
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:29.370
A new virtue signaling paper.

161
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.950
People will quickly tune out on the last off often think,
well,

162
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:37.470
you're just kind of being doctrinaire here.

163
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.240
But the thing you quickly realize if you study evolution at all,

164
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:47.241
his evolution is a very weird process that often produces completely absurd

165
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:51.690
results,
right?
You Watch any David Attenborough natural history,

166
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.400
you know,
documentary and it's like these animals are insane.

167
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.490
What they're doing is crazy and humans are no different.
Yeah.

168
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.640
And if you don't have a sense of that absurdity,

169
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.250
then it's very easy to get terribly,

170
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:10.251
terribly serious and censorious and ideological and that really kept the hides a

171
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:15.450
lot doesn't,
it's going on.
That doesn't really help anybody.
Yeah.
All right.

172
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:18.210
So let's,
let's pause on sexuality for a second.

173
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.180
I don't want to get off that topic so to speak,
but um,

174
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.450
let's just do the two minute,
uh,
Twitter portion of the show.

175
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:30.010
Is there a evolutionary explanation to the way we're behaving with each other?

176
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.780
Is there a psychological explanation to the way we act one way on this medium

177
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.640
and another way on another medium and,

178
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.420
and how that has evolved because of communication?

179
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.660
It's a great question.
And I think honestly,

180
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.690
social media blindsided everybody.

181
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.690
I don't know anybody in the 90s in psychology or any behavioral science who's

182
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.150
going,
here's what the Internet is going to turn into,
right?

183
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.150
It'll become this massive global system of very rapid fire,

184
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:11.790
interactive,
snarky virtue signaling that drives everyone not signed yet.

185
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:15.350
We can't give it up.
Yeah,
I know.
Villain k Dick probably wouldn't thought that.

186
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.840
Maybe nobody else.
Yeah.
Okay.
Dick,
maybe William Gibson,

187
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.110
a few other folks kind of add the insight.

188
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:27.111
But honestly nobody was derived and kind of from first principles.

189
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:27.661
Well,

190
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:32.661
we are a social primate and we love to gossip and we love to show off our,

191
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.080
you know,
our,
our virtues and our intelligence to each other.

192
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:41.250
And therefore obviously there'll be this thing called Facebook and Twitter and

193
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:43.350
whatever,
and it will

194
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.090
play out in this way and moreover it will revolutionize politics or culture in

195
00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:53.830
some way.
No,
nobody thought that.

196
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.490
So we can come up with post-talk reasons why that might've played out that way.

197
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.930
Um,
but I went on,

198
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.800
only do that with a very high degree of humility.
Like,

199
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.130
I don't know.
I don't know.
Now that we're here,

200
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.190
you can kind of a little bit make sense of it that well.

201
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:22.060
So it looks like you can see the evolution,
um,
Twitter,
you know what I mean?

202
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:25.570
Where you now see people,
I'd like to include myself in that,

203
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:30.280
where they're trying to clean it up a little bit is like we all did this unknown

204
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:34.570
thing of snark and everyone was trying to destroy each other and one up each

205
00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:37.390
other in virtue signal about the things we care about and all that.

206
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.720
And it's like now I'm seeing a growing group of people that are like,
Whoa,

207
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:45.721
how do we deal with reality in the confines of social media?

208
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.340
But when the Charlie and honestly and without just wrecking everything and that

209
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:56.341
almost strikes me as a evolutionary function and its evolution is happening so

210
00:12:56.561 --> 00:13:00.880
fast and on such a huge scale,
I mean,
who could have predicted that?

211
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.880
Like the more amateurish looking a visual mean is the better it would spread.

212
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.260
Uh,
that's completely bizarre.
Um,

213
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.390
or the fact that I can get more engagement if I do a really surreal poll on

214
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:20.590
Twitter about something where all four categories are just completely insane.

215
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.910
Like people are more into that than they are.

216
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.130
Like even my snarky comment about political issue x or y.

217
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.280
So what does that tell you about the psychological state of how we interact with

218
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:35.470
these things?
They like the main ones really interesting.

219
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:39.070
It's not the sleigh he produced thing,
you know,

220
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:42.960
really sharp looking images that go viral.
It's,
you know,

221
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.310
a frog on up black and white idiotic thing or crudely drawn yes.

222
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.660
Or that tree or whatever.
Like there's something really there to that.

223
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.160
The about how we react to images to this.

224
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.900
Also something kind of charming about the artlessness and amateurish quality.

225
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.900
It's almost like if I'm kind of fascinated by standup comedy and the Standup

226
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.570
Comedians who are overly slick or never that funny and the ones who are a little

227
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:13.090
bit Shambala like Steven,
right back in the 80s,

228
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.000
hilarious.
And he looks,

229
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:21.310
he looks like he's always on the edge of complete failure or a psychotic break.

230
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.470
And yet that's what makes it work.
Or I guess Seinfeld's,
you know,

231
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:31.120
in the 90s,
um,
to show was also kind of has this artless quality.

232
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.040
Yeah.
All right,
so let's jump back.

233
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.930
So now it's getting harder and harder to talk about these things.

234
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:40.570
There's a set of people that think we're all exactly the same and then at the

235
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:43.120
same time they're obsessed with all of our differences.
I mean,

236
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.290
this is what seemingly is the most potent idea of the day right now.

237
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.220
Um,
what are,
what are the things that you're thinking about in realm of sexuality

238
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.420
<v 1>right now that are intrigued?</v>

239
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.543
<v 2>I'm thinking,</v>

240
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.810
I'm especially concerned about the fact that nobody seems to know what a

241
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:01.820
successful longterm relationship is.

242
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:06.230
Seriously gonna look like in the early to mid 21st century.

243
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.450
That we don't really have a script for that we've kind of inherited,

244
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.170
you know,
the script of monogamous lifelong marriage,

245
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.210
but nobody really believes that that is going to kind of solve all of our

246
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:24.650
problems.
And people don't enter enter into that very early in life.

247
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:27.440
They spend their teens and twenties doing casual dating.

248
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.290
What is that like?

249
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.030
Nobody quite understands what the rules are,
the ethics of that are,

250
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.540
and that at a certain point you kind of get tired of that and you find a partner

251
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:40.070
and you kind of settled down and go,
okay,

252
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:43.160
we're going to buy into the wedding industry now and do the wedding thing and

253
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.750
the ring and bottle.

254
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.560
But there are all these subcultures in America and around the world that are

255
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:52.490
exploring all different aspects,

256
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.520
sexuality and kind of how to incorporate new insights into relationships.

257
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.150
Things like,
um,

258
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:05.230
BDSM or kink or polyamory and open relationships or the whole red pill

259
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.070
manosphere subculture.
Um,
and then on the other side of the quotas,

260
00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:14.960
does that have to do with sexuality?
Well,
it's a certain way of,

261
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.650
of men and women interacting,
right?

262
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.630
The sort of red pill vision of Male,

263
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:24.950
female dynamics is that there's a really deep sexual polarity,

264
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.350
masculine and feminine.
And if you don't understand that polarity,

265
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.140
your relationships,
if they're heterosexual,

266
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:38.170
are gonna fail and burnout and not be satisfying to either person.

267
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.890
So there's much subcultures.
They're all,
uh,

268
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.610
exploring different parts of human nature,
human sexuality,

269
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:49.670
different possible ways to run a relationship.

270
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.690
And I think they all have valuable lessons that we can kind of learn and

271
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:54.524
incorporate.

272
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.820
Like even if your vanilla and monogamous and straight and you,

273
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.770
you don't believe all the crazy manosphere stuff,

274
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.200
there's still important lessons there.

275
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.130
And that's kind of my interest now is sort of going around and,

276
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:15.210
and being eclectic and gathering those up and figuring out what,

277
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.160
which of those might be useful.
Do people

278
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.150
<v 1>stay in those scenes for,
for a lifetime.
So I,</v>

279
00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:27.090
you know,
I could see where somebody,

280
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.640
you'd be in a whatever your thing is and I'm not passing judgment on Ebay,

281
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.511
whatever your thing is,

282
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:36.450
you do it for awhile and then eventually I guess it sort of is the venue sort of

283
00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:38.980
get tired of it.
So you move on to something more traditional.

284
00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:43.480
Like is that just part of our psychology?
Like nothing kind of lasts forever.

285
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.740
<v 2>Some people do that.
Certainly there's a,</v>

286
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.870
there's a life profile kind of openness and experimentation where you try a

287
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:56.871
bunch of stuff in your teens and 20s on a lot of it deviates markedly from the

288
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:58.550
traditional culture you,

289
00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.680
you grow up in and a lot of that um,

290
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.600
hurts and it doesn't work and it's heartbreaking.

291
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:09.720
And then a lot of people kind of drift back into the mainstream.

292
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.620
On the other hand,
you got people who marry young and they try the,

293
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.930
the standard vanilla monogamy thing and to their thirties,
forties,

294
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.640
50s and then go,
this is not working.
I need something different,

295
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.230
better,
more open,
whatever.
And I think,

296
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.010
um,
it can go either way.
You know,

297
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:36.210
the psychological research on all these subcultures is lacking.

298
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.350
We don't know even which lasts longer.

299
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.630
A monogamous relationship or an open relationship.
Everybody,
we don't know.

300
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.800
There's not good data on that.
Huh?
There's lots of anecdotes.

301
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.490
There's examples on both sides,
but I think it's

302
00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.320
almost scientific misconduct not to ask those questions and instead to ask like,

303
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.820
let's do,
you know,
study on which alcoholism treatment works.

304
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:10.821
Let's do the 5000th study on that before we do the first study on what kind of

305
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:14.430
relationships last longest.

306
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.680
<v 1>So basically because you think if we could address some of those issues first,</v>

307
00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:21.170
perhaps the studies that we're focusing on unrelated out as well as him in the

308
00:19:21.171 --> 00:19:22.004
rest.
Yeah,

309
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.030
<v 2>relationship satisfaction is really,
really important to people.
Um,</v>

310
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.160
but it's one of the things that's,

311
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.430
it's not entirely taboo to study it,

312
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:35.330
but it's pretty hard to get federal research funding to look at something that's

313
00:19:35.331 --> 00:19:38.900
kind of a cornerstone of American wellbeing.

314
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.440
<v 1>So when that New York Times article came out about Jordan Peterson and they said</v>

315
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:48.030
he was forward forced monogamy,
which in effect just means marriage.

316
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:51.150
And if you use the couple of times in the times before just to me marriage,

317
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.710
but everyone thought that man he wanted Jimmy didn't change to be dragged around

318
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:57.280
by their husbands.
The,

319
00:19:57.281 --> 00:20:00.810
the argument that people that are for enforcement I,

320
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.470
we are married basically make is that this is the best way to build a sort of

321
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:07.800
functioning healthy society and that you can reproduce and have other

322
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:09.330
generations and all of those things.

323
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.680
You just think we don't have enough information basically or enough,
um,

324
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.390
all well enough study on the information to know if that really is the best way

325
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:19.224
to build a

326
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.390
<v 2>human society.
Right?
We don't know.
There's,</v>

327
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.690
there's good reasons to think that um,

328
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.860
monogamous marriage has been important and every major civilization.

329
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.540
Like it's kind of the most common way to arrange pair bonding.

330
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.423
Um,

331
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.730
and I'm sure Jordan Peterson has read the same articles I've assigned even in my

332
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:42.690
polyamory class.

333
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.710
That's about here are the benefits of monogamous marriage and there are many

334
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:47.544
benefits of it.

335
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.600
The question is once you have contraception,

336
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.060
once you have safer sex and STI testing,
once you have paternity testing,

337
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.410
once you have a lot of other,
um,
technologies,
right,
the console,

338
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.950
some of the same issues that monogamy used to solve,

339
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.650
then what is monogamy still optimal probably is for a lot of people.

340
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.950
Probably is for love.

341
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.370
<v 1>How much of it do you think just comes down to how you're wired?</v>

342
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.880
<v 2>I think there's a lot of that.
Some people are just wired to go,
man,</v>

343
00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:21.960
I just want a pair bond.

344
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.990
I want my mate and I want to keep it simple and that's good enough for me and I

345
00:21:28.381 --> 00:21:33.381
will get a lot of companion at love and attachment and it'll last a long time.

346
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.320
A lot of people are very happy with that and that's great.

347
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.860
But a lot of people either want more sexual novelty and variety or they have a

348
00:21:43.021 --> 00:21:47.190
higher tolerance for sexual jealousy,
um,

349
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.290
or they just kind of get bored and longterm relationships.

350
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:58.160
And I think those people should not be prescribing like rampant polyamory for

351
00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:00.720
the Naga musts,

352
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.100
but the monogamous shouldn't necessarily be prescribing like our way is the only

353
00:22:05.101 --> 00:22:06.180
way for everybody else.

354
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.980
<v 1>So I wonder how this is all related to the gay community because I don't know,</v>

355
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.980
dare I mentioned the name Milo,
but when I had my low on my show years ago,

356
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:18.990
really before he was Milan,
so to speak,
um,
we got in,

357
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.110
we had about a half hour chat on this where me as the married gay liberal and

358
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:27.340
him as the unmarried gay conservative,
which is already sort of a flip on things.

359
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:32.610
His argument was that he wasn't really for gay marriage because he felt that by

360
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:34.020
being the outsider,

361
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:39.030
the gays have come up with art and creativity and music and comedy and all of

362
00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:45.130
the that incredible like just gestalt of it all that made this incredible

363
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:47.950
community,
like a diverse community in the right sense of diversity.

364
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.390
And my argument was,
well,

365
00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:54.100
you've got to at least give people the opportunity to be equal under the law so

366
00:22:54.101 --> 00:22:55.420
that they at least have a choice.

367
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:58.450
I'm not denying that the gay community has come up with all sorts of incredible

368
00:22:58.451 --> 00:22:59.260
stuff.
Yeah.

369
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.830
But like you gotta make them equal and then let them go either way on that.
Okay.

370
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.770
Yeah.
Do you think there is legitimacy to that?
And do you,

371
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.830
have you done or have you seen any studies on what the effects of the marriage

372
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:12.340
on the gay community have been?

373
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.430
<v 2>I haven't seen a whole lot,
but I guess it might be too soon.
I mean,</v>

374
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.600
my understanding,
some of this comes from Dan Dan's habits,
right?

375
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.310
Is that a lot of gay couples have a kind of monogamish relationship where it's

376
00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:28.620
like we're pair bonded,
we love each other,

377
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:33.890
but there's also a negotiated agreement that we can have outside lovers once in

378
00:23:34.141 --> 00:23:39.100
a while under certain conditions that we kind of mutually agree to see.

379
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:39.830
It's funny,
I hear

380
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.770
<v 1>that all the time and I don't know,
advocate couples that I know that are,</v>

381
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.430
that are married or you know,
really yeah.
Together.

382
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.760
<v 2>I don't know ones that are like that or at least that I know that they are like</v>

383
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:52.750
that.
Let's put it that way.
But I know that this is,
uh,

384
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.050
something that's tossed out there so we can go with this for so,

385
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.060
but I'm sure there's variety and I'm sure that there's also kind of social

386
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.880
assortment,
right?
So that the more monogamous gay,

387
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:11.360
lesbian couples will kind of be more comfortable with each other and they might

388
00:24:11.361 --> 00:24:15.650
know those crazy monogamish folks down the road,
but,

389
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.600
um,
or you just don't know your friends that well.
I mean,
anything's possible.

390
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:24.740
Yeah.
Yeah.
And honestly,
it's not that different from like the way,
um,

391
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.320
even heterosexual relationships work in a lot of Europe where a lot of those are

392
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:34.490
tacitly monogamish and there's a sort of understanding that,

393
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.163
um,

394
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.030
monogamy doesn't necessarily mean sexual exclusivity for either partner.

395
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.770
Um,
America is extremely puritanical and kind of rigid about that.

396
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.530
And we think,
um,

397
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:54.490
anything that happens outside the pair bond is almost by definition unethical.

398
00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:57.860
Um,

399
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.860
and there is research on sort of anti polyamory stigma where people actually are

400
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:08.390
more prejudiced against people in open relationships.

401
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:11.960
Then they are against almost any other group.
Um,

402
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.690
in terms of orientation or race or religion or,
or anything.
Um,

403
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.610
that might be gradually changing,
but I think it's a,

404
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.580
it's a huge social problem,

405
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:25.430
especially among Gen z and younger millennials.

406
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.300
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

407
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:30.570
<v 2>yeah.</v>
