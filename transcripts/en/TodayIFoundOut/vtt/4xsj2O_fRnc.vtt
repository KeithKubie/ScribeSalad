00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.420
Aluminium is literally one of the most common
elements on Earth.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.410
So how did it come to be that aluminium cost
more than gold?

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.490
Was it similar to how the relatively common
and easily acquired mined diamond came to

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.950
be seen as valuable in the last century due
to strict control of supply to consumers and

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.060
some of the best marketing the world has ever
seen?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.849
The simple answer is that although aluminium
makes up about 8% of the Earth’s crust,

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.400
it has never been known to occur in its metallic
form anywhere on Earth.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.510
Instead, aluminium appears mainly as a chemical
compound across the globe, for example inside

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.540
potassium aluminium sulfate.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.870
Before aluminium was discovered, or even theorised,
so called “alum compounds”, like potassium

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.620
aluminium sulfate, have been used extensively
since antiquity for everything from leather

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.620
tanning to fire-proofing.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.110
In fact, potassium aluminium sulfate (colloquially
known as potassium alum) is still used today

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.510
in things like aftershave and baking powder
and most awesomely of all, in its crystal

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.940
state it can be used as a “deodorant rock”
that you rub on yourself to eliminate body

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.940
odour.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.630
Now, at first glance it would seem like these
chemical compounds are referred to as “alum”

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.860
because they contain aluminium, but this isn’t
the case.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.720
The word “Alum” is the colloquial name
given to a wide range of compounds that don’t

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.270
necessarily include aluminum, for example
chromium potassium sulfate which is commonly

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.920
shortened to chrome alum.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.950
The word aluminum itself is a derivative of
the the word “alum”, not the other way

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.950
around.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.330
It is commonly held that aluminum wasn’t
theorised to exist until around 1807 when

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.121
a chemist, Sir Humphrey Davy, argued that
alum was the salt of a yet undiscovered metal,

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.220
a metal Davy wanted to call “alumium”.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.110
However, there’s some debate amongst the
scientific community about whether Davy was

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.410
truly the first person to make this leap,
because 30 years prior in 1778, the French

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.970
chemist, Antoine Lavoisier, posited in his
landmark book “Elements of Chemistry”

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.289
that what he called “argilla” (aluminium
oxide) could exist as a solid metal in theory,

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.020
but that the technology of the day couldn’t
separate the strongly bound oxygen atoms.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.890
In fact, argilla is tentatively listed as
an actual element in Lavoiser’s original

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.450
draft of his table of elements.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.759
Aluminium as we know it today was first created
in a lab by Hans Christian Oersted by heating

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.291
aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam
in 1825.

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.580
In honor of Davy’s work which had inspired
Oersted’s experiment in the first place,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.730
this new metal was dubbed “aluminium”.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.590
The flecks of metal that Oersted produced
using this method were so small and impure

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.390
that a proper analysis of the metal was impossible.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.170
Two years later, Friedrich Wöhler entered
the aluminum manufacturing scene and developed

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.750
a new way of isolating aluminium in its powdered
form by improving upon Oersted’s original

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.750
experiment.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.390
Even then it took another 18 years for enough
of the metal to be produced for scientists

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.650
to properly study its properties, and it wasn’t
until 1845 that aluminium’s remarkable lightness

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.790
was noted.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.960
Nine years later, in 1854, Henri Sainte-Claire
Deville developed a way of producing the metal

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.530
on a much larger scale with the use of sodium,
allowing, for the first time in history, kilograms

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.420
of the metal to be produced at a time.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.010
For comparisons sake, it had taken Wöhler
years to produce the same amount of aluminium

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.730
Deville could produce in a single day.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.250
A year later, in 1855, 12 small ingots of
aluminium were displayed at the “Exposition

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.580
Universelle” a huge French exhibition organised
at the bequest of French emperor Napoleon

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.580
III.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.150
Almost immediately after the exhibition, demand
for this magical metal sky-rocketed.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.080
Its shininess combined with its almost ghostly
lightness compared to other metals made it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.460
an ideal metal for jewellery and it wasn’t
long until the French elite were wearing broaches

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.760
and buttons made of the aluminium.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.920
This passing fancy that the upper echelons
of society had with aluminum infuriated Deville

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.460
to no end because he felt that the metal had
significant practical applications to benefit

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.569
the masses, not just to be used as a curiosity
to be flaunted by the elite.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.290
One person who shared Deville’s vision was
Emperor Napoleon III himself who granted Deville

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.819
a virtually unlimited budget to study and
produce the metal long before the exhibition.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.069
Napoleon had hoped that this new metal could
be used to produce lightweight weapons and

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.200
armor for his army.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.530
Although a few helmets were produced, the
sheer cost of refining the metal shelved the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.530
plan indefinitely.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.970
Frustrated, Napoleon III had his supply of
aluminium melted down and pressed into cutlery.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.610
As the oft-repeated story goes, Napoleon III
was rumoured to have eaten off of the aluminium

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.490
plates while his guests had to make do with
ones made of gold.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.440
Whether that story is true or not, at this
point aluminium really was harder to get hold

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.370
of than gold and the price reflected that,
despite its prevalence in the Earth compared

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.370
to gold.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.560
All of that changed in 1886 when it was discovered
(twice) that you could easily obtain oodles

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.430
of aluminum using electrolysis.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.900
The discovery was made by Paul Lois Toussaint
Héroult and Charles Martin Hall at almost

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.370
the same time in both France and America,
totally independent from one another.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.710
For this reason, the process (which is still
used today) is referred to as the Héroult/Hall

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.710
process in honor of both of them.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.020
Two years after this, it was discovered by
Karl Bayer that aluminium oxide could be made

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.880
very cheaply from bauxite.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.230
As a result of both of these things, the price
of aluminium plummeted by 80% overnight.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.270
In a few short years, aluminium went from
being literally the most expensive metal on

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.870
Earth to the cheapest.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.140
For reference, in 1852 (before the Héroult/Hall
process), aluminium sold for upwards of $1,200

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.710
per kilo.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:23.100
By the start of the 20th century, that same
amount of aluminium cost under a dollar.
