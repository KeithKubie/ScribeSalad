00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.690
so our brains are built out of neurons

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700
so our brains are built out of neurons
 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.289
so our brains are built out of neurons
and those neurons are fundamentally

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299
and those neurons are fundamentally
 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.339
and those neurons are fundamentally
similar to the very first evolve neurons

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
similar to the very first evolve neurons
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.240
similar to the very first evolve neurons
in jellyfish-like or coral like animals

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
in jellyfish-like or coral like animals
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.800

that first emerged about 600 million

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810
that first emerged about 600 million
 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.130
that first emerged about 600 million
years ago and it turns out that neurons

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
years ago and it turns out that neurons
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.070
years ago and it turns out that neurons
are not that efficient at all they

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080
are not that efficient at all they
 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.109
are not that efficient at all they
signal probabilistically they're

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
signal probabilistically they're
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.049
signal probabilistically they're
unreliable they leak signals to their

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059
unreliable they leak signals to their
 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.330
unreliable they leak signals to their
neighbors and uh they're slow so then

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
neighbors and uh they're slow so then
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.220
neighbors and uh they're slow so then
the question becomes well we're really

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
the question becomes well we're really
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.790
the question becomes well we're really
clever

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
clever
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.959
clever
we humans uh how do we build clever us

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
we humans uh how do we build clever us
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.910
we humans uh how do we build clever us
out of such crummy parts and the answer

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
out of such crummy parts and the answer
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.810
out of such crummy parts and the answer
is that in order to build clever us we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
is that in order to build clever us we
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.400
is that in order to build clever us we
need huge brains we need an

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
need huge brains we need an
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.680
need huge brains we need an
extraordinarily large number of neurons

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
extraordinarily large number of neurons
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.709
extraordinarily large number of neurons
and to have massive interconnection

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
and to have massive interconnection
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.800
and to have massive interconnection
between those neurons so we have

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810
between those neurons so we have
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960
between those neurons so we have
something on the order of 500 billion

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
something on the order of 500 billion
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600
something on the order of 500 billion

its neighbors now this turns out

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
its neighbors now this turns out
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.800
its neighbors now this turns out
actually to be really crucial to our

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810
actually to be really crucial to our
 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.450
actually to be really crucial to our
humanity because our adult human brain

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
humanity because our adult human brain
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060
humanity because our adult human brain
is 1,200 cubic centimeters in volume

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
is 1,200 cubic centimeters in volume
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.969
is 1,200 cubic centimeters in volume
that's about three fold larger than an

brain of volume 400 cubic centimeters
and it turns out as women well know that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
and it turns out as women well know that
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550
and it turns out as women well know that
that barely fits through the birth canal

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
that barely fits through the birth canal
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.160
that barely fits through the birth canal
as it is it turns out that death during

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
as it is it turns out that death during
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.210
as it is it turns out that death during
childbirth is a uniquely human

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220
childbirth is a uniquely human
 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.649
childbirth is a uniquely human
phenomenon you don't see it in other

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
phenomenon you don't see it in other
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859
phenomenon you don't see it in other
animals so you've got a newborn with a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
animals so you've got a newborn with a
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.340
animals so you've got a newborn with a
400cc brain an adult with a 1200 cc

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
400cc brain an adult with a 1200 cc
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740
400cc brain an adult with a 1200 cc
brain well it turns out that if you look

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
brain well it turns out that if you look
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.120
brain well it turns out that if you look
at the development of the brain

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
at the development of the brain
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.030
at the development of the brain
postnatally there's furious brain

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
postnatally there's furious brain
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.639
postnatally there's furious brain
development from birth to age 5 and then

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
development from birth to age 5 and then
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.619
development from birth to age 5 and then
much slower brain development from about

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
much slower brain development from about
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.690
much slower brain development from about
age 5 to 20 and the brain isn't mature

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
age 5 to 20 and the brain isn't mature
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190
age 5 to 20 and the brain isn't mature
until about age 2

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
until about age 2
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.530
until about age 2
what does this mean it means that humans

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
what does this mean it means that humans
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.210
what does this mean it means that humans
have by far the longest childhood of any

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
have by far the longest childhood of any
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.350
have by far the longest childhood of any
animal now what are the sequelae of that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
animal now what are the sequelae of that
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.160
animal now what are the sequelae of that
well what it means is that on a Ranga

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
well what it means is that on a Ranga
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.740
well what it means is that on a Ranga
town mom can take care of her offspring

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
town mom can take care of her offspring
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.670
town mom can take care of her offspring
without any paternal contribution at all

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
without any paternal contribution at all
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.009
without any paternal contribution at all
just fine but it turns out if you look

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019
just fine but it turns out if you look
 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.570
just fine but it turns out if you look
at humans in hunter-gatherer societies

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580
at humans in hunter-gatherer societies
 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.809
at humans in hunter-gatherer societies
which is what we were up until the last

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819
which is what we were up until the last
 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.289
which is what we were up until the last

motherhood is not a very viable endeavor

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519
motherhood is not a very viable endeavor
 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.720
motherhood is not a very viable endeavor
so single moms aren't very effective at

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
so single moms aren't very effective at
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.220
so single moms aren't very effective at
keeping their children alive in

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
keeping their children alive in
 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.039
keeping their children alive in
hunter-gatherer societies so that's why

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049
hunter-gatherer societies so that's why
 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.670
hunter-gatherer societies so that's why
we have cross culturally marriage or

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680
we have cross culturally marriage or
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.949
we have cross culturally marriage or
marriage like institutions there isn't a

marriage like institutions there isn't a
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.699
marriage like institutions there isn't a
single culture that has ever been found

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.160
single culture that has ever been found
that doesn't have something like

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.050
marriage the details of the rules can
vary but we all have it why do we have

this when 90% of mammalian species are
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.410
this when 90% of mammalian species are
promiscuous we're both male and female

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420
promiscuous we're both male and female
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.740
promiscuous we're both male and female
have many sexual partners within a given

reproductive cycle we're paternity is
 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.559
reproductive cycle we're paternity is
not well established and where the male

does not contribute in any way to the
 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.699
does not contribute in any way to the
rearing of offspring why are we so

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709
rearing of offspring why are we so
 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.170
rearing of offspring why are we so
aberrant it's because our neurons are

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
aberrant it's because our neurons are
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.420
aberrant it's because our neurons are
lousy processors so we need big fat

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
lousy processors so we need big fat
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.240

brains to make clever us by putting many
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.180
brains to make clever us by putting many
of these lousy processors together we

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
of these lousy processors together we
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.460
of these lousy processors together we
can only get four hundred cc's worth of

can only get four hundred cc's worth of
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.530
can only get four hundred cc's worth of
these neurons through the birth canal so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540
these neurons through the birth canal so
 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.559
these neurons through the birth canal so
we have to have very long postnatal

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569
we have to have very long postnatal
 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.520
we have to have very long postnatal
maturation along childhood and

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530
maturation along childhood and
 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.789
maturation along childhood and
consequently that's what creates love

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799
consequently that's what creates love
 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.360
consequently that's what creates love
that's what creates our cross-cultural

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370
that's what creates our cross-cultural
 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.059
that's what creates our cross-cultural
human mating system it comes from the

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069
human mating system it comes from the
 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.930
human mating system it comes from the
fact that neurons are lousy processors

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
fact that neurons are lousy processors
 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.000
