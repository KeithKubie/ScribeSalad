00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:09.780
AMANDA LEICHT MOORE:
So welcome, folks,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.750
to G. University
Counsel's fireside chat

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.175
on inclusive products.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.630
I'm Amanda Leicht Moore, and
I'm one of the PM leads on Maps.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.900
And so with that, I'd like
to introduce our moderator,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.120
Brandi [INAUDIBLE], who has been
at Google for about nine years,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.190
works on our executive
summits team.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.160
And I'll hand it over to
Brandi to introduce our panel.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.140
BRANDI: Thank you, guys,
for joining us today.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
I also want to introduce
two Googlers who

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.240
are joining us via Hangout.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.090
In New York, we have Dan
Pritchett, an engineering

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.480
director on the GO team.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.380
If you can wave, Dan.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.280
And we have in the Seattle area
Caleb Davis, a program manager

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.050
also on the GO team.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.550
And I want to let
everyone know who

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.380
is watching via live stream,
we have a Dory up that should

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.930
be presenting shortly.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.145
And Maurice--

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:01.960
MAURICE TURNER: Brandi.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.100
BRANDI: Maurice and I have
been friends for over 20 years.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.620
He has quite an
impressive resume.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.650
He has his Bachelor of
Arts in political science

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.920
from Cal State, Fullerton,
a Master of Arts

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.040
in public administration from
the University of Southern

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.480
California.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.170
And that is in emerging
communication technologies,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.420
privacy, and civic engagement.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.950
And he has a
graduate certificate

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.240
in cybersecurity strategy
from Georgetown University.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.360
He's currently a Senate fellow
for the Republican Homeland

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.730
Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.030
supporting cybersecurity.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.520
It goes without saying that
I've been in awe of Maurice

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.770
for the last 20 years.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.320
He's worked across many
government agencies.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.890
And he's managed to navigate
some complex bureaucracies

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.950
to raise awareness around
racist and offensive place

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.720
names in the United States.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.180
His work is literally
changing the map.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.450
And it's amazing
to me that he is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.960
working to dismantle structural
racism in the United States.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.981
So please join me in welcoming
Maurice Turner to Google.

00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:13.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.700
MAURICE TURNER: Thank you.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.020
BRANDI: So I'm personally
very interested in hearing

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.097
your process that
got you here today.

00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:24.430
And I know that there's people
who are here and watching

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.513
via live stream that also
would like to understand

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:30.130
the process that you developed
and took to change those place

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.460
names, so they could potentially
follow in your footsteps.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.460
But first, I would like
to ask you to take us back

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.970
to that day in 2015 when you
and your lovely wife [? Preet ?]

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.570
were hiking in
Shenandoah National Park.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.260
What happened?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.170
MAURICE TURNER: Well, excellent.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.669
Thank you.

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.960
I appreciate the time that
you all are offering me

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.480
so I can share my story.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.490
We'll start a little
bit earlier than 2015.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.640
I grew up in Southern
California and recently moved

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.900
to the DC area.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.430
And so I decided that
I needed to get out,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.790
see what's going on in
Virginia, since that

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.290
was going to be my new home.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.460
And that started with a hike--

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.770
so getting out enjoying nature.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.850
I came from Southern California.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.850
These whole things called
seasons, which kind of

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.225
dictate what you
can do and where

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:16.000
you can do it were new to me.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.260
So summertime was around.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.520
This is July 2015.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.030
I would go for a hike,
take some photos,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.360
come back home, load them up
in my computer, and open a map.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.090
And that's where I
see that I just was.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.030
There's a stream there
called Negro Run.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.550
And when I first saw it
come up on Google Maps,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.280
I thought that has to be a typo.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.780
There's no way that
there's actually

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.850
a place called Negro Run.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.700
And it kind of sat
with me a little bit.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.860
And as I was
thinking about it, I

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.590
was considering, OK, well,
it's obviously not a typo.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.162
There's some history that
I need to learn about.

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:55.870
So over the course of
the following weeks

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.720
and a couple of months,
I began to learn

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.850
more about the history
of Shenandoah National

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.290
Park and its own struggles with
segregation and desegregation

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.120
in the '30s and '40s.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.970
And I just had this
feeling in my stomach

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.720
that it just-- it
didn't sit well with me,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.720
that that was a name
that was still there.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.640
And so I thought, I
need to change that.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.370
That's something that I
don't want to be around

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.560
when I go out to enjoy nature.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.210
So I started that process of
basically just shooting off

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.899
emails as far as I
could to whoever I

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:30.065
could think of that might
actually have some powers.

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:34.100
So I sent emails off to the
park superintendent, the region

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.360
director, the director of
the national park system,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.850
the Secretary of the Department
of Interior, just anyone

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.558
that I could think of
that might actually

00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:45.665
have some power to help
make this change come about.

00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:47.810
BRANDI: Wow.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.880
So when you were
doing this research,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.850
you used Google Maps to identify
the place that you were at.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.250
And then you named a couple
of different agencies.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.204
In your process of
discovery this place name,

00:04:58.204 --> 00:05:00.120
what did you learn about
other offensive place

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.020
names in the US?

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.820
MAURICE TURNER: Well, I learned
that they're everywhere.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.250
They are literally
racist place names

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.340
all over the country
in every state

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.210
that we have in our country.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.920
And so it was just
really shocking to me

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.470
that we could have names
like this that would reflect

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.720
a time in history
that wasn't inclusive,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.780
that didn't respect the
diversity that we now

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.880
have in our country.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.580
And thankfully, the
government agency

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.100
that's in charge of
recognizing these names

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.120
is very well documented.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.100
They've been around since 1890.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.880
And so as you can
see, there are cards--

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.080
name cards.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.580
And one of the
things that I learned

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.080
was that Negro Run was
actually a compromised name.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.040
That was a name that was
applied in the early '60s.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.900
It used to be called Nigger
Run, which is something that I

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.060
had to come to terms with.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.500
It's not a word that I
like to use or a word

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.910
that I like to hear.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.860
But I recognize that
our words have power.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.170
And there is a certain
power in using that word,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.260
either toward people
or around people,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.180
because it's meant to hurt.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.450
It's meant to inflict
a level of pain

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.160
upon people that
are being referred

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.410
to in a derogatory sense.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.500
And that helped push me toward
going through the effort

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.450
and following up over
the months, which

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.500
ended up being over a year,
to get the name changed.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.660
Interesting little
note of history--

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.910
1933, as we saw
on that name card,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.760
the name was actually
changed to Nigger Run.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.670
I believe that there is a
correlation between the timing

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:44.240
of that change being 1933,
because in 1932, the Shenandoah

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.650
National Park was actually
supposed to have a concession

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.960
facilities built in an area of
the park that was desegregated

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.860
and meant to serve
only colored people,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.760
as they referred to at the time.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.120
So in my mind, the only
reason that the name

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.000
could have been changed from
its original name, Tims River,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.220
to something that is
so blatantly offensive

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.190
is that there were a
dedicated group of people

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.426
who lived nearby that felt so
strongly that the named needed

00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:11.050
to change that they
actually petitioned

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.350
the federal government and
proposed to have this change.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.230
And then that committee, the
Domestic Names Committee,

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.570
actually agreed to
change the name.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.910
BRANDI: What was the process
like to actually find

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.930
this documentation?

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.822
Was it relatively easy to
uncover these documents?

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.530
MAURICE TURNER: The
information is there,

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.890
but it's not easy to get to.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.000
So obviously, you
need to know that it's

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.150
the Department of the
Interior that is then

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.340
over the US
Geological Survey that

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.730
is in over the Board of
Geographic Names, which

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.950
is the home of the
Domestic Names Committee.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.440
So you have to go through
several layers of bureaucracy

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.050
to actually find out who is
responsible for the names

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.570
and where that
information is kept.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.680
So it took some digging.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.910
It took some research.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.900
Thankfully, we're living in a
time where a lot of information

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.750
is available online, if we're
willing to search for it.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.040
So I was able to find it.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.500
And they were very diligent
in their recordkeeping.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.810
And so that's how I was
able to find that name card

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.770
and find those board minutes,
where they actually captured

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.680
some of their conversations
they had at board meetings

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.689
to make some of
these name changes.

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:18.230
BRANDI: Can you tell us a little
bit about this documentation

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.512
right here?

00:08:19.512 --> 00:08:23.220
MAURICE TURNER: Certainly,
in the early '60s,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.760
then Secretary of the Department
of Interior Udall sent out

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.590
a memo saying that, as part of
the rise of the Civil Rights

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.490
Movement at the time, it
became clear that there were

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.250
certain names and
certain words that

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.400
were universally derogatory.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.490
And so he directed
the names committee

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.460
to make a system wide
change, so to change

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.240
every instance of nigger
to negro, which in his mind

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.620
was a more appropriate
name to use,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.820
which here we are
these years later,

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.859
that is still as offensive
as I'm sure it was then.

00:09:01.859 --> 00:09:04.400
But that was the compromise that
he was able to come up with.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.170
That was the direction
that he gave.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.940
And so there was
a sweeping change.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.960
There is only one other instance
of a sweeping change like this.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.860
And that happened 1974,
where the name Jap

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:21.740
was replaced at a system
level with the name Japanese.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.477
So of all of the
derogatory names

00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:26.060
you can come up with
in your mind that

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.880
would disparage someone's race,
ethnicity, cultural background,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.130
there's only two
that this committee

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.150
view as being derogatory.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.810
There's only those two
words that they will refuse

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.990
to approve in a name change.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.910
What I'd say is most frustrating
about this whole process is

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.372
that the committee recognizes
that those two words are so

00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:49.580
bad, they're not going to
approve any new names using

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.080
those words.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.320
But there is no process in
place to go back and change

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.340
all of the other--

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.160
over 1,000 racist place names
that we have in the country.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.810
BRANDI: And you
said the last time

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.120
there was a sweeping
change was in the '70s?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.430
MAURICE TURNER: 1974.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.291
BRANDI: Wow.

00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:05.790
Wow.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.120
So maybe this answer is
obvious, but why did you

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.110
take on this mission beyond
just changing the place

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.774
name that you discovered?

00:10:15.774 --> 00:10:17.820
MAURICE TURNER:
As I said earlier,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.810
it literally sat in my stomach.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.430
And it's been sitting there and
bothering me and motivating me

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.890
for almost two years
now, that this is just

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.660
something that needs to change.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.870
As we've talked about, we've
known each other for 20 years.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.020
And the reason that
we know each other

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.080
is very memorable in that
we would go on these field

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.910
studies, these field trips
through our high school biology

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.410
class.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.840
And it was such a strong,
positive experience

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.870
to go out in nature, meet new
people who then become friends,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.620
experience all the variety
that we have in our country

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.090
in a natural way.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.960
And I think, what
would have changed

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.190
in my life experience had we
been out in Yosemite National

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.725
Park and I'd come
across a Negro Run?

00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:03.600
How would I have been
able to cope with that?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.300
How would my
teachers, my friends,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.420
my family been able to
explain to me at a young age

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.385
why that name exists
and why it exists

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:16.617
in such an official capacity?

00:11:16.617 --> 00:11:19.200
BRANDI: I'm guessing there's a
lot of people who are inspired.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.366
They're going to want to
help you with this mission.

00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:25.210
And I know that Dan and
Caleb, who are joining us,

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.900
were on the receiving end
of a lot of documentation

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.680
from you and of your story.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.080
I was hoping that
Dan and Caleb, you

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.480
can help us understand
the documentation

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.970
that Maurice provided
for you guys to help

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.252
you make this change on Maps.

00:11:42.252 --> 00:11:44.640
CALEB DAVIS: Sure.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.110
Most of it really boils down to
the offices reports from GNIS.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.330
And those reports are
really what we need in order

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.560
to make changes on the map.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.020
We need official government
resources, in most cases,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.360
in order to make changes.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.150
So luckily, Maurice had
done all of this legwork.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.000
We went through an amazing
amount of effort, not only

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.265
to change the name, but he
had also tracked down all

00:12:14.265 --> 00:12:16.500
of this information.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.250
He forwarded it to Dan.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.915
Dan forwarded it to the
[INAUDIBLE] data escalations

00:12:21.915 --> 00:12:24.790
team, which is a
team I'm part of.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:30.730
We're kind of like the last line
of defense for GO data problems

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.040
on Maps.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.670
And we were able to quickly make
change with the internal tools

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.882
that we have.

00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:38.670
BRANDI: And can you
help us understand

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.361
why the change was
made so swiftly--

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.860
the documentation that Maurice
provided, either the quantity

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.265
or the way that it
was presented to you?

00:12:47.265 --> 00:12:50.550
CALEB DAVIS: Well, we
are an escalations team.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.030
And we really do
care about things

00:12:55.030 --> 00:13:00.910
that are offensive that have
potential PR implications.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.370
That's really kind of our
purpose, is to do these fixes.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.190
And certainly, this
when it came in

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.460
fell very high in
our priority list.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:17.570
And luckily, the folks
that Dan works with that

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.700
maintain the GO pipeline have
built the pipeline in a way

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.520
that those changes can propagate
to Google Maps very quickly.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.690
So we just-- our end really
isn't rocket science.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.326
It's really just [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:30.326 --> 00:13:34.620
It's doing the hard work of
going in the tools of making

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.930
these changes.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.170
And we were able to do that.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:45.000
We take a lot of these
written reports internally

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.520
and basically take
action on them.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.000
Usually, they're not as
gratifying to work on

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.170
as a report like this one.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.519
But this is pretty
much what we do.

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:01.310
BRANDI: And, Dan, can
you talk a little bit

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.670
about how you
reacted when you saw

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.998
Maurice's story on the
black Googler network Alias?

00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:11.800
DAN PRITCHETT: Well, sure.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.140
I saw your email.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.120
And this seemed like
such an obvious thing

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.040
that we needed to take care of.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.480
And to reinforce what
Caleb said that Maurice

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.240
had done the critical work us.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.490
One of the things that--

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.060
we try to make the map
factually accurate.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.580
And unfortunately,
sometimes we have

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.290
these of situations, where
the facts aren't facts

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.710
that we like.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.610
By Maurice having this name
change in place, to me,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.405
it was something
that I saw, it's

00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:45.690
like-- well, I saw your email.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.315
And I was like, well,
this is something

00:14:47.315 --> 00:14:49.509
that I deal with working
with Caleb and his team

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:51.550
all the time in terms of
dealing with these kinds

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.350
of escalations.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.650
So just let me pick this
up and get that over there.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.730
And it clearly was one
that we wanted to treat

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.631
with a fair amount of urgency.

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.820
BRANDI: And what
are these reports

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.990
that are in the deck that
are on display right now?

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.796
Can you help us understand
what these represent?

00:15:06.796 --> 00:15:11.242
DAN PRITCHETT: Caleb,
you want to take that?

00:15:11.242 --> 00:15:13.230
CALEB DAVIS: Sure.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.870
So these are basically
the official citations

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:23.535
from GNIS that more
or less give us

00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:34.085
the information about what
is considered basically

00:15:34.085 --> 00:15:35.960
the official government name.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.830
And in this particular
case, because Maurice

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.700
was able to petition the US
Board on Geographic Names

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.660
to have the name changed
back to Tims River,

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.480
we were able to
use that resource.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.850
We're basically
allowed to do that.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:58.780
There are a lot of
implications for us as far as

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.070
what resources we can use.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.460
So we really do have to limit
it to a fairly small number

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.350
of things, like official
government resources

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.590
and resources that
are explicitly

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.340
approved by our P counsel.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:19.860
And this particular report,
it has a very good description

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:26.850
of the location of the
river, when this was defined.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.750
There's a series of
identifications for it.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:35.166
But that's pretty much all there
is to it for the GNIS report.

00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:39.880
BRANDI: So I imagine there
would be a lot of changes

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.800
that are happening constantly.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.774
How would we scale
something like this?

00:16:45.774 --> 00:16:48.640
DAN PRITCHETT: So
the good news is

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.250
that a major priority
for Google, Google

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.250
Maps product, and actually
has been through all of 2016

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:02.860
as well, is to allow users to
provide us with information

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:08.380
about the map, to tell us about
things that are wrong that we

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.300
have factually incorrect.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.000
So the one thing that
I'm looking forward to

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.599
is being able to continue
to get these reports in.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:20.590
We have both a combination of
algorithms as well as people,

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:22.300
both users and
operators, that can

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.189
help us make decisions
on these edits

00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:25.980
as to whether we should
accept them or not.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.230
Now, it is a little challenging
for things like rivers.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.580
We don't have river
names that is a feature

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.870
that we support just yet.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.310
But our goal is to
continue to open up

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.220
more and more of the things
that can be edited on the map,

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.550
so that individual users
can actually tell us

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:47.322
about things that are wrong.

00:17:47.322 --> 00:17:49.920
BRANDI: And you said that
one of your first things you

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.420
did when you came
back from the park

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.530
was to go onto Google Maps.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.860
Did you start the process
of reporting this initially

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.990
on Maps?

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.540
MAURICE TURNER: You know,
I don't think that I did.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.300
I try to be pretty
well-documented.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.440
And I don't have
that in my notes.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.390
I know that it's kind
of come full circle.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.160
And that's been the
most fulfilling part

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.290
of this whole process that
I've been involved with,

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.080
in that I first saw the
name on Google Maps.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.330
And you go through
an 18-month period

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.990
of figuring out who to talk
to, following up, following up,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.520
waiting, being
patient, having to go

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.410
through the bureaucratic steps.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.820
And then it truly was that
I was very happy when I saw

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.400
the board approved the name.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.680
But I was the most
satisfied when

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.880
I saw the update
happen on Google Maps.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.160
It was just that recognition
that in modern day,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.050
it's not the paper map,
it's the digital map.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.010
That's what people see.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.175
There are more
people seeing maps,

00:18:46.175 --> 00:18:48.300
because they have smartphones,
they have computers.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.150
They simply have more
access to the information.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.264
And that information
is, quite frankly,

00:18:53.264 --> 00:18:54.930
for most people are
going to be digital.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.667
So it may take 5, 10
years for paper maps

00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:00.750
in the area to be updated.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.080
It may take another 10 or 20
years for books to be updated.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.580
It might even take
a full generation

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.040
before the people who
live in that area change

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.220
the name they use colloquially.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.620
But for Google Maps, it
happened in 24 hours.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.750
And the impact of
that has the potential

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.430
to reach millions of people.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.500
And so that's probably
the most proud

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.860
that I am of this whole process,
is that so many more people

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.250
have access to this new name.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.010
And it gives so much more
weight to the power that we all

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.800
have to be able to change
names, to change things

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.381
that we see as being wrong, and
standing up and saying, hey,

00:19:35.381 --> 00:19:37.380
this is absolutely not
right, this is offensive,

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.820
this is derogatory.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.320
Maybe not to me
personally, but it's

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.420
derogatory to
someone that I know

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.704
or someone that I could
know or just in general.

00:19:44.704 --> 00:19:46.620
So there is that ability
to change it and have

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.790
it reach all those people.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.435
It's just-- it's
pretty incredible.

00:19:51.435 --> 00:19:54.620
BRANDI: So what are
you doing to change

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.630
place names beyond Google Maps?

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.240
MAURICE TURNER: Well, I'm just
here in my personal capacity.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.500
I'm not here representing
where I work or my fellowship.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.410
And in my role
personally, the way

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.510
that I see it is
just to show people

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.450
that there is a way to
make this change happen.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.960
There are over 1,400
racist place names.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.590
There are places like
Dead Negro Hollow

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.340
in Tennessee, Dago Springs,
Chinaman's Hat, Squaw Tit

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:23.840
Summit.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.060
And just there are so many
names that are out there.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.770
So I would just say that
if you come across a name

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.050
when you're out walking
around and enjoying nature

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.866
and you think that that
name needs to be changed,

00:20:36.866 --> 00:20:38.240
there is a process
to go through.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.040
The change can happen.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.630
But the only way the
change can happen

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.390
is if someone submits
a proposal and says,

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.390
hey, there's something
wrong with this name,

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.040
here's a better idea.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.200
Please go ahead and at
least have the discussion

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.270
with the local
community to come up

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.920
with a better name,
something that's

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.030
more reflective of the
community as it is today,

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.790
not as it was in the past,
where derogatory names were

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.635
more acceptable.

00:21:02.635 --> 00:21:04.010
BRANDI: I imagine
there are going

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.301
to be a lot of people who
have some passion around this

00:21:06.301 --> 00:21:08.150
and would like to help.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.080
What would you suggest
their first steps be?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.420
Or how can they help you?

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.740
And what are your next
steps going to be?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.980
MAURICE TURNER: Well,
this was a big next step--

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.820
was just coming out
and sharing my story.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.200
So I appreciate you inviting
me to the Google Campus

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.770
and for all of you coming
out and all of you,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.900
wherever you are
in your offices,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.820
hearing firsthand
what I went through.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.702
I just ask that you find a
name that you find offensive

00:21:34.702 --> 00:21:36.410
and you take the 5 or
10 minutes to learn

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.170
a little bit about the name and
propose a better alternative.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.560
So that way, the
process can start.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.510
And I'm hoping that once
that decision is made,

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.070
there'll be another
quick turnaround.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.740
So the Google Maps team can
make that change digital

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.980
and reach more people.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.780
So if you're interested, feel
free to contact me via email.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.800
There's a very long
spreadsheet that I have.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.330
I'm more than happy to share
with anyone who would like.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.996
But there are plenty
of names out there.

00:22:03.996 --> 00:22:05.930
Just next time you're
out walking around,

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.430
everything has a name.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.620
And some of those names
aren't appropriate anymore.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.190
And we know the
power of language

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.890
and we know how we can hurt.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.500
But we also know
how it can help.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.166
So let's try to come
up with some better

00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:20.150
names for these places
that need to be changed.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.250
BRANDI: And you're going to
be running in the Shenandoah

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.650
National Park Half Marathon,
right, to raise awareness?

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.840
MAURICE TURNER: I am.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.634
So over Labor Day, I'm
going to be out running--

00:22:29.634 --> 00:22:30.800
not my favorite thing to do.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.930
But I figure it's a good way
to get out and enjoy the park.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.800
And I want to go see
that new Tims River.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.039
BRANDI: Awesome.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:38.705
Congratulations.

00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:40.406
MAURICE TURNER: Thank you.

00:22:40.406 --> 00:22:42.320
BRANDI: So now,
we'd like to open

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.660
the session to either live
Q&amp;A or the Dory questions.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.730
Does anybody in the room
have any pressing questions

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:50.230
for Maurice?

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.717
How about-- oh.

00:22:53.717 --> 00:22:54.425
AUDIENCE: I have.

00:22:54.425 --> 00:22:56.180
In the intro that
you gave, I think

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.610
you said that one
of Maurice's goals

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.280
was to dismantle
structural racism.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.160
BRANDI: That was my
take on what he's doing.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.456
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:23:04.456 --> 00:23:06.080
So I wanted to ask
you more about that,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.840
if that's one of your goals.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.459
Is this just one
piece of that goal?

00:23:10.459 --> 00:23:11.750
MAURICE TURNER: It's one piece.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.630
I'm definitely a
process-oriented person.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:20.060
I have a professional
career in government.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.810
And so I like those
details just to be perfect,

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.562
because I know that that's where
a lot of the challenge lies.

00:23:26.562 --> 00:23:29.020
There are lots of big problems
that we all need to work on.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.570
And those can sometimes
be intimidating.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.280
So I like to look at
the details and say, OK,

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.238
what's something that I
can do as an individual

00:23:34.238 --> 00:23:41.600
to have an impact on,
because the racism is

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.730
out there everywhere.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.850
And so I believe that
it's up to everyone

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.600
to take the opportunity to
find a little piece of it,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.110
wherever they happen to be,
and take that on as a challenge

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.200
to get rid of it.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.550
So for me, it was Negro
Run in Shenandoah National

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.050
Park in Virginia.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.740
And I think that if I can go
out and get one little creek

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.230
or river renamed, that
anyone else can go do it.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.740
And the cumulative
effect of that is you

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.130
would then have
over 1,400 pieces

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:18.240
of institutionalized
racism gone.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.781
The challenge-- and I'm sure
that folks in the GO team

00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:22.530
understand-- is that
there is this balance

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:27.149
between factual accuracy
and historical records.

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:29.190
So I think it's important
to recognize that there

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.300
is history behind these names.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.930
Places change names over
the course of history.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.360
And it's not
necessary that a place

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.029
keep its name the entire time.

00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:39.570
But there needs to
be a record of it.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.580
And I think, at least
when we're talking

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.190
about place names recognized
by the federal government,

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.900
there's good
recordkeeping, so I'm not

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.030
afraid to go out
and ask for a place

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.690
to have a new name that's more
reflective of the community

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.060
that exists today.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.460
So that's my contribution to it.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:00.530
I can't take on all of it
and fix racism in America.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.800
But I took on a
racist name of a river

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.480
in a national park in Virginia.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.000
So that way, tomorrow, 10 years
from now, 100 years from now,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.600
no one else has to see that and
have that negative experience.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.010
They can go to
that national park

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.117
and have a positive experience.

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:20.019
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:20.518
Thanks.

00:25:24.499 --> 00:25:27.040
BRANDI: Maurice, thank you so
much for coming to Google today

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.300
and sharing your story with us.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:28.610
It was my honor.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.500
MAURICE TURNER: My
pleasure, absolutely.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.160
BRANDI: Thank you.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.880
MAURICE TURNER: Thank you,
Brandi, appreciate it.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.050
BRANDI: Thank you guys.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.700
[APPLAUSE]
