00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.510
Before we finish this lesson,
I wanted to summarize things and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
tell you how this all fits in
to machine learning for trading.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.460
The first thing to point out here is
that bagging and boosting are just

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.460
methods for taking existing learners and
essentially wrapping them in this

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.460
meta algorithm that converts your
existing learner into an ensemble.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.640
And you should use the same
API to call your ensemble

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.390
that you would have earlier been
using to call an individual learner.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.650
So externally, to whatever part of
your program is calling the learner,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.385
it doesn't know that underneath there
you're doing boosting or bagging.

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:45.690
Your resulting learner is also likely
to lower error and reduced overfitage.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.020
So to summarize, boosting and
bagging are not new algorithms in and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.340
of themselves.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.455
They're meta algorithms that
let you wrap your underlying

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:57.330
learning algorithms into
something that's better.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.180
Okay, that's it for this lesson.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.620
I will see you again soon.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.120
Bye bye.
