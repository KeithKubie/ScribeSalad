Reflexes are unlearned, automatic responses that occur when particular stimuli

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:10.255
are presented. It happens naturally, requires no learning history. So for

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:13.541
example if I were to put lemon juice in your mouth, you would automatically

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:18.333
salivate. So let's take a look at some examples. If I were to put a sour candy

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:23.877
in your mouth, you would automatically salivate to that particular stimulus,

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:30.886
the sour candy. Another example of a reflex is the eye blink. If you go to the

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:34.119
eye doctor and they test for glaucoma, they're going to put a puff of air in

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:37.670
your eye, and you are automatically going to blink to that particular stimulus,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.569
the puff of air. That's another example of a reflex.
