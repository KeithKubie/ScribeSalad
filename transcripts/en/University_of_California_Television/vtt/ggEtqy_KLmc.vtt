00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.270
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.403
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:14.024
(retro electronic music)

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.940
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.270
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.180
of International Studies.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.450
Our guest today is Susumu Shimazono,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.780
who is professor in the
Department of Religious Studies

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.850
at the University of Tokyo.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.850
He is the author of From
Salvation to Spirituality:

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.280
Popular Movements in Modern Japans.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.690
And he is the 2010 Forster Lecture

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.770
on the UC Berkeley campus.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.796
Professor, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:10.630
- Thank you.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.720
- Where you born and raised?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.283
- I was born in Tokyo in 1948.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.653
And I was raised there.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.443
But I moved to another
local city named Kanazawa.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.120
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.270
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.290
- Oh yes, my father

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.363
was a psychiatrist and also
a university professor.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.850
And he believed that science

00:01:48.153 --> 00:01:49.053
to help people.

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:59.438
Thank you for pronouncing
my name (chuckles)

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.487
which might be difficult
to pronounce for the,

00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:06.150
but what does it mean, Susumu?

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.453
That means progress.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.970
So (chuckles) this I think reflects

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:17.850
the mentality of the
after-war period of Japan.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.430
So my parents wanted me to

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.010
make Japan intellectually
progress. (chuckles)

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.740
- I see, and you ultimately wound up

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.193
doing religious studies.

00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:37.940
Was there something in your background

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.600
that pointed in that direction?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.433
- Mm-hm.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.163
As you may know,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.300
in Japan religion is
very complex. (chuckles)

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.112
My parents were married in 1945

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.433
before the war ended.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.373
But the ceremony was in Shinto.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.980
But my mother was educated
in Catholic schools

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.640
from elementary school

00:03:18.543 --> 00:03:20.380
up to the university.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.180
And my family belongs
to a Buddhist temple.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.420
So we die,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.193
and we make ceremony in Buddhism.

00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:35.240
And my, as I said, my father

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.960
has some faith in modern
science and technology.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.150
So (chuckles), it's been complex.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.960
- That's so interesting,
because one of the themes,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.120
and we'll talk about
this later in your book,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.120
in fact, you had an
essay on the relation of

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.571
spiritual, the new religions in Japan

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:03.101
to psychology and psychotherapy.

00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:06.410
And there's an important connection there.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.142
- Yes, yes, I think so.

00:04:08.142 --> 00:04:11.860
So my father believed

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.160
that he's helping people.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.360
And the medical doctor

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.490
is a profession which is
special, you know. (chuckles)

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.143
So I think there is
something close to religion.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.977
- In that.
- Yes.

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:39.290
- What were you trained as

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.290
in your college studies, and how did it

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.333
point the path toward religious studies?

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.303
- So when I entered the university,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.440
I took the course for medicine.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.753
So first I intended to
be a medical doctor.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.170
And I chose the medicine because

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.390
it is about religion.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.000
Interacting with, ah no, no,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.823
it is about human beings.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.650
In medicine, doctors will

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.893
interact with people.

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:27.633
And I like that.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.123
But when I started to study medicine,

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.210
I thought it not be like that.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.210
The contemporary medicine
is more scientific,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.690
and they are looking at body

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.650
as like things, (chuckles)

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.800
not the human beings.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.890
- The spirit.
- Spirit, maybe.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.430
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.430
So I was disappointed, and I changed

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.883
my field from medicine to religion.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.990
- And how are you trained?

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.943
Are you trained as a sociologist?

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.823
Or as an anthropologist, or what?

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.383
- I was in the University of Tokyo.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.460
The faculty of letters,
there's a department

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.563
of religious studies, mm-hm.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.680
I think in Japan there
is religious studies

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.493
is very big, you know.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.520
And they deal with Buddhism,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.903
Shinto, Christianity,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.993
and folk religion.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.033
Very mixed.

00:06:55.597 --> 00:06:59.260
And I liked the professors. (chuckles)

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So my parents was very much disappointed

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.600
that I changed my mind.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.960
- They wanted you to be a doctor.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.560
- Yes.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.350
And they didn't like to say that

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.597
their son is studying religion. (chuckles)

00:07:16.597 --> 00:07:20.590
- (laughing) But as a scientist, right?

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.243
You are a social scientist
studying religion.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.620
- So there are two big,
sort of big schools

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.840
in Japanese religious studies.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.820
In Kyoto, the religious studies is

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.150
more oriented to philosophy.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.563
And in the University of
Tokyo where I studied,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.210
religious studies is more
oriented to social sciences.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.210
But I think religious studies
is not science, I think.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.223
And literature, art,

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.583
philosophy, thought;

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.543
I was also interested in that.

00:08:11.877 --> 00:08:15.410
- And what did you do
your dissertation on?

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.530
- My first, oh...

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.061
My BA thesis is of Sigmund Freud,

00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:26.511
(chuckles) the psychoanalyst.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.083
And then for the MA thesis,

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.120
I studied Japanese folklorist,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.233
folkloric studies.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.833
- And let me ask you then now,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.460
before we talk about
your work and your ideas,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.460
what are the skills required, you think,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:57.170
to study religion in
a nuanced, subtle way.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.760
- So this is a problem
that in religious studies,

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.930
there is no definite, clear methodology.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.030
If you want to study classical texts,

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.113
you must learn languages.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.623
This is a very important
areas of religious studies.

00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:31.051
There are other ways.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.990
And first I didn't know
what kind of methodologies

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.533
I can learn.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.510
And later I

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.090
started the...

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.783
what is called field work.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.150
So I walked around

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.070
the city and meet people

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.023
and interviewed.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.770
- It would seem that in religious studies,

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.770
because of the way
secularists dismiss religion,

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.630
that if you're gonna do the
kind of work you do well,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.520
you really have to be respectful

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.890
of the people you're studying.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.370
That is, really come to understand

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.360
what you call the magical
religious elements

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.554
of their belief system.

00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:41.523
Is that hard to do?

00:10:41.523 --> 00:10:44.170
Or do you learn to do that,
let me put it that way?

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:49.170
- So I think what motivate us

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.063
is the interest in other people.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.690
So to understand how they think,

00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:04.514
and curiosity.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.470
So I think this is a bit
similar to anthropology,

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.730
and also the psychiatry.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.630
So difference is very important,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.940
and from understanding
the different people

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.880
to know ourselves, who we are.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.640
So this is, I think, a basic methodology.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.640
- And what is very clear
in the New Age religions

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.110
in Japan, which we'll
talk about in a minute,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:41.100
is that these individuals are

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.180
struggling to come

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.360
to a way to deal with
the modern environment.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.720
- Right, right.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.997
So many Japanese would say that

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.770
they are not related to religion,

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.600
they don't like religion.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.433
But I think

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.620
when they say that, the common religion

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.153
is technology-defined.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.600
So in fact, they interested in religious

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.883
or spiritual matters very much.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.223
Myself too.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.123
- Yeah, and do you,

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:28.614
looking at yourself as a scholar,

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:31.900
do these kinds of studies require

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.000
that you have a certain
kind of temperament?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.580
Tell us a little about yourself

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.293
as you do this work.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.293
- Yes.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.390
When I was a student,

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.563
it was a complicated time.

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:58.563
It was around 1970.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.730
In Japan too, there was demonstrations

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.500
against the Vietnam War

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.500
and the university administration.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.093
And I was involved in it.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.690
And I was also very much confused.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:28.680
I insisted that I'm on
the side of justice.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.423
But when looking back,
reflecting on myself,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.173
I didn't have any, you know,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.923
important experiences, any
firm sense of, you know,

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.700
principles, ethics.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.700
So I want to think by myself

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.220
on these issues,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.350
but not from only the classical texts

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.350
or big thinkers, but
from the ordinary people

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.233
who we can learn respect.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.750
- So in a way it's sort
of answering questions

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.350
for yourself, about questions of ethics,

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.990
principles, how to deal with the world;

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.961
and looking at your contemporaries

00:14:30.961 --> 00:14:34.970
in contexts that one
might normally not look

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.600
if you were a secularist.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.833
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.560
You did some of the early work

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.560
on the Aum Shinrikyo,
which was a religious

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.573
New Age group that became much more,

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:53.030
and in the end wound up
being a terrorist group.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.923
Talk a little about how you,

00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:58.000
as just an example of how you

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.404
came to understand that group overtime.

00:15:01.404 --> 00:15:02.237
- Okay.

00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:07.170
So first I studied
folklore and folklorist.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.037
But then I realized that

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.790
folklore is interesting, but they are

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.300
already outmoded, obsolete.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.460
- Outmoded, yeah.
(chuckles)

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.760
- They would disappear soon.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.430
So I wanted to study things

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.870
which are living, which are reactive,

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.303
and which will affect our future.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.163
And then I chose what
we call new religions.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.020
And the term new religions

00:15:55.095 --> 00:15:58.160
may be a little bit different

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.703
in the nuance of the term here.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.450
In Japan, the Shinto and Buddhism

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.670
are main religions, but they're mixed.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.350
So when the new groups appear,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.650
it is not important whether
they are Buddhism or Shinto,

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.650
but they're different from the traditional

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.310
established (mumbles) groups,

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.350
and we call them altogether new religions.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.350
And the main new religion started

00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:38.623
in the early 19th century.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.520
I first studied

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.493
those older new religions.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.117
I liked the founders, foundresses.

00:16:55.316 --> 00:16:57.067
There are not educated people,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.020
but they are very creative.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.973
They have the deep spiritual senses.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.700
And I worked with

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.630
the teachers, you know,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.070
priests of these groups.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:26.070
And I can respect them.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.323
So my first study of new
religions are very sympathetic.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.690
But later I learned that

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.370
new religions altogether

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.730
are not good, (chuckles)

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.220
only not good.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.720
But they--
- They're complicated.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.000
- Complicated, they may have bad defects.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.850
And recently...

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.320
Many people who are
involved in new religions

00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:13.053
lose many things.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.370
- Lose?
- Many things.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.203
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.570
They are for the poor heart.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.800
Their relationships are destroyed.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.263
So I became more and more critical.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.630
And then what we call new new religions,

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.623
the groups which are more violent,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.800
which are more aggressive,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.113
they became more powerful.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.403
And then that incident occurred,

00:18:52.521 --> 00:18:54.233
the terrorist attack of
Aum Shinrikyo in 1995.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.920
- This was the sarin gas released

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.053
in the Tokyo subway by Aum Shinrikyo.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.873
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:09.440
- And at the time, the school of religions

00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:13.890
were very much accused
because they didn't warn

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.293
against the dangers of these groups.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.493
So it was a hard time for me too.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.240
- To deal with the subject matter.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.780
I mean, it raised real questions about

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.960
your responsibilities as a researcher.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.700
- Right, right.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.700
Now let's understand the new,

00:19:39.143 --> 00:19:42.330
when you talk about
religion, whether old or new,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.930
help us understand what
you mean by religion.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:46.763
- Oh, yes.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.220
It is very difficult, it isn't a topic

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.433
which is discussed very often.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.763
Maybe since the, about 1990.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.910
Many people now realized
that the term religion

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.840
is not easy to use.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.167
It is used in such a complicated way.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.603
We cannot use the word safely.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.303
If I talk about religion,

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.730
you might think about
it in a different way.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.593
So the communication's not easy.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.350
And now I am working that

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.600
how the term religion

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.460
is translated in Japan.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.717
The religion is the Western word,

00:20:41.717 --> 00:20:45.203
and when it was translated into Japan,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.733
there were many difficulties.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.530
(chuckles)
- Such as, yeah.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.580
- Yeah, such as, yes,

00:20:54.536 --> 00:20:58.861
for example, Confucianism is
very influential in Japan,

00:20:58.861 --> 00:21:00.373
(mumbles) religion.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.320
Many discussions.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.673
- Is it a religion, is that the question?

00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:13.210
- If you take the term broadly,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.830
it is religion.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.500
But I must explain

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.050
in what sense first is use religion.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.760
Yes, so...

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.210
- You say in your book that

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.160
beings, power or experience
that cannot be confirmed

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.400
by the five senses;
something that gives meaning,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.270
strongly influences a
person and continuously

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.510
lead their thoughts and actions.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.320
- Mm-hm, yes.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.660
So...

00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:53.464
(chuckles)

00:21:53.464 --> 00:21:55.853
- Okay, and religion,

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.393
in the whole theory of modernization,

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.050
was something that was very,

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.590
the study was influenced by Weber.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.350
And Weber thought that
the magical religious

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.470
elements would disappear, but part of

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.730
the implications of what
you're writing about

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.660
is that it doesn't disappear,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.400
it's sublimated in a way.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.850
and old questions arise anew.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.230
And this was something
that the secular world

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.683
discovered in the 1970s,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.980
therefore the search for new religions

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.683
became a global phenomena.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.810
- So in, around 1970,

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.373
when I was a student,

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.520
many political movements there were,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.260
but they were not religious.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.450
For example, in Paris

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.653
there was a student revolution,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.663
but it is influenced by Marxism,

00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:06.200
or socialist kind of ideology.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.373
It was secularist.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.280
In Czechoslovakia there was a

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.963
new socialist movement with a human face,

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.963
but it was still socialist.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.600
And in China, Maoist movement.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.723
But in the '80s,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.780
many of the new political movements

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.840
were motivated

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.230
somewhat by religions.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.150
It is your area, really. (chuckles)

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.600
After the Iranian revolution,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.350
in Philippines, for
example, the democratization

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.050
was much helped by Catholic organizations.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.420
And popular movements

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.240
helped by religions organizations.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.970
So why

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.970
this happen?

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.470
I think the secularization

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.530
proceed to some point,

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.290
to a certain point,

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.560
because science, if you learn science

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.110
and modern technology, it can help you.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.600
But there is a limit when you know

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.120
that human beings cannot live

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.120
only by secular knowledge.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.247
And so there is a turn.

00:24:46.642 --> 00:24:49.289
What they call desecularization

00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:51.456
or re-sy-co-la-ri-za-tion.

00:24:52.627 --> 00:24:56.090
And I think this is, there's a spread

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.620
since the 1970s.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.000
- And what people are looking for

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.053
answers to questions,

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.760
and you suggest that a lot of this occurs

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.950
as they confront the
realities of human existence:

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.243
suffering, disease, illness;

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:19.980
and then the whole
momentum of modern life.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:26.180
People are left with a
sense of uncertainty,

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.616
and they're looking for answers.

00:25:28.616 --> 00:25:30.570
- Right, right.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.863
So good example is the medicine.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.403
Around 1970,

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.433
in the West, they started
the hospice movement.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.430
Medicine has long helped people

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.663
to be cured, to be freed from diseases.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.780
But they better lead to

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.812
how to live to die.

00:26:07.812 --> 00:26:08.903
(chuckles) So,

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.110
but people who are, you know,

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:20.110
who have a very severe disease

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.593
of course are very conscious
about his own death;

00:26:25.593 --> 00:26:26.760
his own death.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.110
And those who cure them

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.020
must be aware that.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.810
So suddenly they realize that,

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:39.810
but in medical department

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.053
in universities, they
don't teach about that.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:49.410
So this is a new way
that modern institutions

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.490
have to learn about the
limit of secular knowledge,

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.353
the limit of modern
science, modern rationalism;

00:27:00.437 --> 00:27:05.437
and to learn from the old
wisdoms of human beings.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.580
- Interestingly enough,
one of the first people

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.980
we interviewed in the early
'80s was Norman Cousins

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.590
who was an American
writer who began writing

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.760
and influencing medical
education in the country

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.940
by arguing that there
were alternative issues.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.592
You even have an essay in your book

00:27:25.592 --> 00:27:27.940
on alternative sources of knowledge.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.750
And so this is a much
larger phenomena globally

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.440
than just kinda just
new religions in Japan.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.460
I mean, it's a kind of global search

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.210
by humanity for answers in a world

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.860
that seems inadequate because
it's become so secular

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.630
and so dismissive of religion.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:57.630
- Yes, so Japan is an interesting example

00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:00.390
that they started modernization

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.710
earlier than other

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.573
countries in Asia, in Africa;

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.730
maybe in other parts of the world.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.520
- This is the Meiji Restoration.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.823
- Yes, yes, in the middle 19th century.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.370
So we were very eager to

00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:25.666
learn from the West.

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:28.310
But there have been always

00:28:30.786 --> 00:28:32.260
some sense of difference.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:38.100
And we did not agree

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:41.053
with the principles,

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:47.860
with the basic way of behavior,

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.673
which I learned from the West.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.220
And so there are many attempts to

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.100
adapting the Western way

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.990
but in our own way also.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.137
So new religions are,

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:14.870
in a sense, one example.

00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:19.060
And there are, for
example, the alternative

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.980
agricultural movements,
alternative medicine.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.900
There are many alternative things.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.610
- You discuss one
religion where the founder

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.610
of the religion was
really somebody interested

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.290
in soils and fertilizer and microbiology.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.590
And talk a little about that,

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.270
what was the name of the religion,

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:45.270
but it evolved into a,

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.910
almost a kind of psychotherapy,

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:53.310
but also a religion, but
also a movement about

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.020
what you should eat.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.083
- Yes, yes.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.933
Interestingly, Shinto,

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.697
rather than Buddhism, has
influenced that kind of movements,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.823
alternative knowledge movements,

00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:17.033
I said in my book.

00:30:19.104 --> 00:30:21.650
Oomoto-kyo is an important example.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:28.570
This is very well known and studied

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:33.193
because it had a very
strong political impact.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.083
But it has many other aspects.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:43.310
This religion was very much

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.780
involving, for example, arts.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.660
Most of the followers practiced

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.060
some arts, for example,

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.940
poems, making short poems,

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.853
Japanese poems,

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.630
or writing calligraphies

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:11.453
from arrangements, tea
ceremony, like that.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.493
And in arts and also the

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.873
life technologies, so how to live,

00:31:25.209 --> 00:31:30.209
aating, growing the crops.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.750
They wanted to invent

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.893
their own ways, uh-huh.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.613
And it has influenced in the West.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.215
This is not the influence from Oomoto,

00:31:51.215 --> 00:31:53.680
there is another important movement

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.803
named microbiotics.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.060
This was...

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.160
transplanted from Japan to the West.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.643
And now I think in the West,
this is a bigger movement.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:14.990
- And let's kind of help people understand

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:19.070
the common elements in these movements.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.900
And you compare these new religions

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.150
to what you call salvation movements.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.930
So explain to us what salvation
religions movements are

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:35.413
and how they differ from
the New Age religions.

00:32:35.413 --> 00:32:36.246
- Okay.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.393
So...

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.513
Modern people, for modern people,

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:56.110
when they learned modern science,

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:58.110
still they say

00:33:01.564 --> 00:33:03.563
there is something unique to religion.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:10.723
And...

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.740
So, because

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.610
this will help people to be independent,

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.883
to think by themselves.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:33.710
And if you, for example, face

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.583
the god above,

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.033
you'll be alone,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:43.370
and you will

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.580
situate yourself in a fundamental way.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.393
This is the fundamental self recognition.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.000
And in what religions this,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.410
what kind of religions this happens?

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.620
I think this is salvation religion.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.490
Salvation religion regards

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.453
human suffering's very important,

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.803
also the limits of humanity;

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.363
for example, we must,

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.453
we cannot escape from hurting us,

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.803
violence, for example.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.680
And we also cannot escape from

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.520
the death itself.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.613
So there is an important limit.

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:44.763
We cannot...

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.810
escape from them.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.823
But if you have faith,

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.883
you can overcome that limit.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.180
This is the basic

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.913
very powerful, you know,

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.130
source of the idea

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.983
which motivated human beings.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.920
And Christianity's a very good example,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.373
and Buddhism too, Islam too.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.943
So still they are spreading in the world.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.373
They are helping people to,

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.363
to be,

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.813
confirm that you are yourself.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.573
And new religions in Japan,

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.530
I think they are, in their own way,

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.490
salvation religions.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.937
But I think now, we are

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.290
more and more conscious that

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.830
salvation religions have

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.000
their own limit too.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.330
- And the important
point that you emphasize

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.880
in the book with
salvation religion is that

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.300
the turning, the catharsis
comes through faith,

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.610
but from an outside power.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:24.510
There is a god or an entity

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:29.510
that confirms the salvation.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.490
And it is most likely in other world,

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:37.598
not in this world that
that salvation comes.

00:36:37.598 --> 00:36:38.515
- Yes, yes.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.430
- And so, but the difference
with the new religions

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:43.920
are telling us something else.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.070
They are putting the burden more

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.630
on the individual, and as I understand it,

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.883
the salvation is in this world.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:00.120
- Yes, I am influence by Max Weber.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.150
And in his book,

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.380
he said that

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.380
this worldliness and the...

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.430
As a worldliness or the

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.510
limit of realizing this worldliness;

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.610
this concept, the concept of world

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.013
is very important in his work.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:38.970
What I found is that

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.170
traditional salvation religion

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:49.623
has much emphasis on
the other worldliness.

00:37:49.623 --> 00:37:54.623
But immortality, there are new type of

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.870
salvation religions which
emphasize this worldliness.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:04.663
The salvation occurs within this world.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.680
This is especially
conspicuous in the East Asia.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:16.530
And this trend from the other
worldly salvation religions

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.270
to this worldly salvation religion,

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:27.230
if they continue this
way, what comes next?

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.940
I think New Age, which
is called in the West,

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.953
is something here.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.640
- What, you know, as I listen
to you and I read the book,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.420
there is a point at which it's very clear

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.553
you're addressing a global phenomena.

00:38:46.766 --> 00:38:49.997
And that it, in a way, it touches on

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:55.463
all kinds of movements we
see in the world today.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.050
In California, for example,
the whole thing about

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:04.050
proper eating and how the
proper diet can change you,

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:09.410
to all, you know, many kinds of (mumbles).

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.680
So the question is when is it religious,

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.780
when are these things religious?

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:18.730
Where does, what elements

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:22.710
in these common phenomenas
make them religion?

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:27.710
Because if you're changing
a diet in the United States,

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.260
you're not doing it for religious reasons,

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.963
at least many people are not.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.340
- So there is not one

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.290
common element which

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.763
defines religion; there are many ways.

00:39:50.383 --> 00:39:52.340
So the term religion

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:59.430
is not the word which catches the essence,

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:04.360
the gathering of many elements.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.360
But anyway, for modern people,

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:14.450
the sense of their limit

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:18.320
over a scientific knowledge

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.910
and the limit of the
method of modern science,

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.033
what is called reductionism;

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.940
knowing things in parts,

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.793
but not as a whole.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.003
If you study diseases,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.700
modern scientific medicine

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.160
studies the parts of your body,

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.790
not the person as a whole:

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.293
mind, body, spirit.

00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:00.250
But we need to

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.970
acquire that kind of sense.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.650
So this is, I think, a new

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:15.610
global awareness that we need

00:41:15.751 --> 00:41:19.780
a different way of grasping

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.733
the world, and this is a basis which,

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:37.450
you know, there are many
different, what do you call it,

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:41.220
new spirituality movements,
new spirituality cultures

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.433
importing from different sources.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.280
And many things are very
much commercialized.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280
But still there are many common elements,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.243
and I think they can be
called religious too.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.870
- Now you make an important
point in your book

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:08.470
about beginning with the Meiji Restoration

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.640
that there was as social basis

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.640
for the new religions and
their evolution overtime.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.750
One element you identify is essentially

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.580
these religions emerged from the masses

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.993
as opposed from the elites.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.860
Tell us about that and other elements

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:34.740
that tell us the social
basis of this phenomena that

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.740
you're describing throughout
the period of modernization.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.080
- So if you, this is
(laughing) very big topic.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.780
- Yeah. (chuckles)

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.610
Well what we're doing is
we're interesting people

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.585
so they go buy your book.

00:42:51.585 --> 00:42:53.913
- Thank you for your careful review,

00:42:53.913 --> 00:42:55.390
I'm very grateful.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:59.773
If you look back the whole
history of religions,

00:43:01.433 --> 00:43:04.603
and especially the salvation religions,

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.673
in the age, what we call Middle Ages,

00:43:17.009 --> 00:43:20.259
some people have the major initiatives,

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.603
and other people just,

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.493
you know, following.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.870
Of course, they were just not obeying

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.340
but they have their own way.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.720
But it was not expressed.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.360
But in the process of modernization,

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.360
people have their own, you know,

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:54.653
way of expressing themselves
and organizing themselves.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:00.610
So this is different in Europe and the US.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.700
In Europe, the church structure

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.193
has a still strong power.

00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:09.050
So popular religious movements

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.403
are not welcome speakers.

00:44:11.905 --> 00:44:14.840
But here in the United
States, there are many sects,

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.020
many religions movements,

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.800
and it represents the power of the people.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.530
So religion has been changing that

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.650
the initiative moved from the elite

00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:30.413
to the popular elements.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.930
- You say in your book,
the new movements are

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.210
a reflection of radical individualism

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:40.210
that is necessitated by the affluence

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:45.210
and information-oriented
nature of contemporary society.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.773
- Yes.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.393
But so,

00:44:53.862 --> 00:44:55.537
in the case of Japan,

00:44:55.537 --> 00:44:59.880
in the 19th century and until about 1970,

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.030
popular religious movements

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.240
are very much com-mu-lar.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:12.240
They like to form the local community,

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.423
local congregational community.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.433
There are local leaders.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.393
Many of them are housewives.

00:45:23.929 --> 00:45:26.877
They are very powerful people.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.190
They may not be

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.593
educated in the higher education.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:42.480
But they have their own

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.393
very powerful personal experience,

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.053
they have their own source of wisdom.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:57.520
But after the 1970s, that kind of,

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.310
it was not easy to form

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:03.890
that kind of community

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:06.453
in their localities.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:12.243
And when they gather,

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:17.003
for example, there is an, you know,

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.480
screen, TV screen, and
they watch (chuckles)

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.023
the same TV screen, but
they don't talk each other.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.870
So this is a new way,

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:35.930
and they don't know how to interact

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.693
for the very important

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.943
existential things.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.350
This is related to what is called New Age

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:54.953
in the United States.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.250
- So you're suggesting that the weakness

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:03.120
of these new religions, in addition to

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.080
their veering off course
and becoming extremists,

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.840
as we talked about earlier,

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.840
is that they may not be creating
an institutional structure

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:14.420
for social cohesion.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.223
So the burden of everything, of changing,

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.663
finding catharsis,
falls on the individual.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:24.900
- Yes.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.570
So salvation religions

00:47:30.939 --> 00:47:34.890
were so influential in human history

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.973
because they are the way,

00:47:38.865 --> 00:47:41.813
they taught the way to form community.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:50.143
But recently, salvation religions

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:57.460
sometimes help individuals

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.250
to feel that you are yourself,

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.090
but they do not help

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:10.590
construct stable community

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:14.160
which can convey the traditions.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.560
So this is a difficult time.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.560
So the dangerous elements
of salvation religions,

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.640
for example, excluding the other people.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.210
- That is, people who have not been saved

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.216
are outsiders, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:34.216 --> 00:48:36.220
And the auth-it-ar-ian element.

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:41.080
This was in some groups,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.310
this became, this is becoming

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.940
very much to, you know,

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:54.593
to be warned against, yes.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.330
- What are the political implications

00:48:58.330 --> 00:48:59.700
of New Age religions?

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.060
I would imagine it varies
country by country.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.570
In the United States,
religious fundamentalism

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.590
has become important
in electoral politics.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.280
It's linked to the anti-abortion movement.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.770
What is the story in Japan,

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:20.993
and then what do you think
the global implications are?

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.690
- Yes, I didn't discuss

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:29.963
about this in this book.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:39.080
But the religions which are

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.910
politically influential
in contemporary world

00:49:43.944 --> 00:49:45.570
are not only salvation religions.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.830
In Japan, the state Shinto

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.760
is very important.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.400
It doesn't teach individuals

00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:00.680
to be independent and to learn about

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.600
how to be saved.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:08.070
But it gives people the
sense that they are powerful

00:50:11.494 --> 00:50:13.553
and they can be united,

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.283
and sometimes they, it can be aggressive.

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:24.730
In India, so what is
called Hindu nationalism,

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:26.543
is very powerful.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:32.623
In Japan, there was always

00:50:32.623 --> 00:50:34.943
the religious power,

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.070
which are different from
salvation religions.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.690
Buddhism and Shinto, Confucian

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:47.690
type of religious ideology.

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:51.233
And I think in contemporary Japan,

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:54.713
this kind of nationalist religious

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:05.110
ideology, this is also
to be carefully examined.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.300
- When, are there factors

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:13.750
that you can identify in
the case of Aum Shinrikyo

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.410
where they go off the road, so to speak.

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.853
In other words, is it that the,

00:51:21.552 --> 00:51:26.552
is it the mixing of it with
authoritarian leadership,

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.448
or is the, it seems to have become

00:51:30.448 --> 00:51:32.623
a moneymaking entity?

00:51:33.963 --> 00:51:36.089
Is it that the market intruded?

00:51:36.089 --> 00:51:40.640
What makes New Age religions go astray?

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.333
- In my, you know,

00:51:53.587 --> 00:51:56.360
theoretical scheme, Aum Shinrikyo

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:05.269
is not close to New Age, New Age type

00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:08.373
of religious phenomena.

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.923
It is more a communal.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.763
It is not very individualistic.

00:52:27.567 --> 00:52:29.650
It denied family, family.

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:35.089
- It denied family.
- Family, yes.

00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:36.150
So this is very much against

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:37.883
traditional Japanese morality.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.773
So...

00:52:47.786 --> 00:52:50.770
The loss of the sense of the
continuity from the past,

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:51.973
this was very strong.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:56.563
And I think,

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.883
this is why the younger people,

00:53:05.009 --> 00:53:08.350
and especially educated people,

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:10.950
were attracted by this group.

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.793
And this became very dangerous.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.520
- To what extent, when you
examine these religions,

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.130
have they been influenced by a sense

00:53:27.062 --> 00:53:30.750
of the apocalyptic that might come

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.910
from the fact that Japan was a victim

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.740
of the use of the first atomic bomb?

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.223
Does that enter into this at all,

00:53:41.155 --> 00:53:46.155
or are these New Age religions
not relating to that at all?

00:53:46.324 --> 00:53:49.157
(Susumu chuckles)

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.400
- The Aum Shinrikyo

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.527
used many (chuckles)

00:53:58.527 --> 00:54:00.940
different ideas, for example, Nostradamus

00:54:04.322 --> 00:54:07.155
was used by them very effectively.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.840
And Christian apocalyptic ideas

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.473
was employed by them.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:15.700
Some Buddhist

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.453
prophetic elements was also used.

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:31.563
So...

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:39.290
very new, but they inherited

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.040
many things from the popular

00:54:46.047 --> 00:54:48.050
religions movements in Japan.

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:52.920
And this was not very much
emphasized by our scholarship

00:54:53.781 --> 00:54:56.323
but from the magistration on,

00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:00.340
there are many religious movements,

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.793
popular religious movements;

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.170
the scholars emphasized
they were oppressed

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:09.500
by the totalist government.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.730
But popular movements helped

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:18.900
to make the totalian, you know,

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.623
social system in the 1930s.

00:55:29.403 --> 00:55:32.313
So there was always the danger.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:42.090
So it was so rapid in the,

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:46.040
the group started in the mid 1980s,

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.663
and the mid '90s,

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:55.290
only after 10 years after they started

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.627
they caused such a big--

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.706
(voices interposing)
- Yes, yes, the incident.

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.833
It was difficult to prognose.

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:16.760
But there was always that kind of element.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.900
Popular religious movements can become

00:56:22.765 --> 00:56:24.430
the dangerous element, yes.

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:27.393
- One final question, a brief answer,

00:56:29.108 --> 00:56:31.168
for our audience out there,

00:56:31.168 --> 00:56:35.520
is there one point of departure when they

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.080
confront new religions,
say, in the United States

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.070
or else where?

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:43.730
One idea that you would
like to leave them with

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:46.491
as a result of your studies to,

00:56:46.491 --> 00:56:48.670
because you started by
saying you were interested

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.390
in understanding people and why they

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.865
were returning to this
religious phenomena.

00:56:54.865 --> 00:56:58.773
Is there one insight that
stands out in your work?

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:01.303
- Yes.

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:04.450
So...

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.820
Human beings, (chuckles)

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.920
I'm saying us, two big
things right now. (chuckles)

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.573
Human beings are weak.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.393
You cannot control yourself.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.130
We must help each other.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:30.330
And when we help each other,

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:32.083
and when we overcome the violence,

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:38.110
we need something beyond us.

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:43.030
So religion

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.483
is so essential for human beings.

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:49.890
But it can be also

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:54.373
the dividing, aggressive forces.

00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.790
So what make you strong

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.360
may make you dangerous.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.600
So this kind of a paradox

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.943
we must face, and you know,

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.693
we must deal with our reason.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.020
- On that note, let me
show your book again

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:23.070
because I think it's very lucid

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:26.800
and people will find it instructive,

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.340
