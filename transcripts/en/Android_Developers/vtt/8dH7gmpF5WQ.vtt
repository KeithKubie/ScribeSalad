MINDY BROOKS: We are
here today to talk

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.990
about improving digital
well-being, Google's approach,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.370
and tips for developers.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.440
My name is Mindy Brooks, and
I am a UX lead here at Google.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.780
I focus on kids and
family as well as

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.150
the UX lead for Google Play.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.340
With me today are
three of my colleagues,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.530
Safia, Maggie, and Rose, all
focusing on digital well-being.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.280
And we're here to share our
insights and tips for you

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.490
today.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.670
So let's dive right in.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.240
Today's conversation will be
focused on three major areas,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.710
first of which is insights
into digital well-being,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.260
what we've learned
from talking to users

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.390
around the world about
digital well-being,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.930
and their thoughts
and opinions there,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.160
our products and features
that we've launched,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.670
as well as our ongoing
commitment in this space.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.070
And the third is our
tips for developers,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.530
some takeaways for you today.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.630
So how do people feel about
their digital well-being?

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.850
As a UX lead here
at Google, I can

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.850
say that we are committed
to talking to our users

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.980
around the world
to understand what

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.700
they're thinking and feeling.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.610
In fact, this past year alone,
we spoke to 95,000 people

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.630
to understand, what does
digital well-being mean for you?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.350
And what we learned is it's
highly nuanced and highly

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.280
personal.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.390
What it means for me might not
mean what it means for you.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
But there is one thing
people can agree on--

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.920
that kids' digital well-being
remains a top concern.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.960
And we hear that globally.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.110
While parents and adults
see the many benefits

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.820
of technology for kids--

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.100
education, connection,
security-- they also

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.390
have a lot of concerns.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.890
In fact, 84% of
parents globally report

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.510
that kids' tech usage remains
a top parenting concern.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.710
Concerns around inappropriate
content, online safety,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.169
bullying, and even
social skill development

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.930
are themes we hear
around the globe.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.140
And much of that
concern is because kids

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.000
are getting devices
earlier than ever before.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.860
How many of you have ever seen
a young child with a device?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.070
How many of you have
noticed that kid

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.670
might be better at using
that device than yourself?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.320
That's for me, for sure.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.090
It's quite amazing to watch.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.420
So parents are really
starting to wrestle with,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.990
how do we help kids
develop healthy tech habits

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.280
and balance as they grow?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.340
So one stat that's
very interesting

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.500
is that we know
kids in the US are

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.830
getting their first smartphone
at the age of eight.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.420
And they're just starting
earlier and earlier.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.860
So how do parents help
develop healthy boundaries

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.930
and balance for children?

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.460
But as you can imagine, kids
don't live in isolation,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.480
and in fact are learning
about how to use technology

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.230
from observing families and
parents' dynamic with tech

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.580
and the rules in the household.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.490
And so this heavily influences
how kids develop and grow.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.370
So this year, we really
set out to understand,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.790
what does digital well-being
mean in the family context?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.030
And if we understand
the family context,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.680
can it help us
inform how we create

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.520
more products for people?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.700
So we did research
in 11 countries

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.290
with 16,000 parents,
teens, and kids.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.170
And what we learned
across the globe

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.330
is that families live
in a state of paradox

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.730
with digital well-being
and technology.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.800
On one hand, it brings
families together.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.950
On the other hand,
it drives them apart.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.460
And we often hear a phenomenon
called alone together.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.190
You're all in the same
room, on the same devices,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.190
but we're not talking or
connecting with each other.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.130
On one hand, it
relaxes and destresses

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.100
after a very long day
of work or school.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.920
And on the other hand,
it causes stress.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.380
On one hand, it promotes
child development

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.850
through education
and information.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.730
And on the other hand,
it can potentially

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.740
hinder child development.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.130
On one hand, parents
think kids overuse tech.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.800
And on the other hand, parents
can't manage it themselves.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.030
Parents will promote usage
for education and learning,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.490
and on the other hand,
they're discouraging usage.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.000
"Go outside" is things
we commonly hear.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.870
So families are living in this
state of paradox and tension

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.500
on a daily basis.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.950
So these themes emerged
from the research

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.450
of family connection, of
stress, of child well-being,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.670
of overuse, and a balance.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.760
And so taking these five
things into consideration,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.350
we really wanted
to think about what

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.230
we could build for our users
to help address these needs.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.690
But I want to point
out one thing.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.440
It's not just adults or
parents that we've heard from.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.500
We hear a lot from kids
and teenagers, too.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.440
And they frequently
point out that adults

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.620
aren't the best at modeling
balance and well-being

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.460
for them.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.100
We hear stories of texting
at the dinner table

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.610
while the kid has to have
their phone put away,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.220
or texting while driving,
or being distracted

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.060
and the kid having to repeat
their questions over and over.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.340
And for kids, and teenagers
particularly, they

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.738
say it's hypocritical.

00:05:29.738 --> 00:05:31.780
So this is something that
we take very seriously.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.580
How do we help all
of our users start

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.150
to understand what their digital
well-being means for them?

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.050
So with that, I will
pass it to Safia

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.825
to tell you a little bit more
about what we've learned here.

00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:46.160
SAFIA BAIG: Thanks, Mindy.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.240
Hi, I'm Safia.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.060
I'm a UX researcher on Android.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.520
When we talk to adults
about their smartphones,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.500
in particular, they tell us that
notifications can distract them

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.030
and even cause stress.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.830
We talked to people
about notifications

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.200
and how they manage
their attention.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.090
And they tell us
they're afraid to miss

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.790
important notifications,
and they're so

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.820
inundated with
notifications, but only some

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.980
are actually important.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.290
In one of our studies,
a research participant

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.890
said, "Notifications make
us attached to our phones.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.960
It's horrible."

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.280
But notifications are just one
element of digital well-being

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.000
on smartphones.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Across studies, we
started to hear a growing

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.530
resentment towards phones.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.030
For example, someone said,
"It's almost inhumane

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.530
to always have a
phone in my hands."

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.960
And someone else said, "I
look at this thing more

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.420
than anything else in my day,
even more than my girlfriend."

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.910
Than we were in Japan
doing some research,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.830
and we talked to
feature phone users.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.340
So they were actively
avoiding using a smartphone,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.380
and they were happy.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.660
A feature phone user said,
"Other people on smartphones

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.820
are on social networks,
and they feel the need

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.100
to be connected ALL the time.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.240
I don't want to live like that.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.130
I have a clear rhythm in life.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.650
I have self-control.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.130
I have time for other things."

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.280
And they really inspired
us to think about JOMO,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.030
or the Joy Of Missing Out.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.580
And the joy comes from feeling
like you're in control,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.800
and you're not really missing
out on anything at all.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.850
So we decided to dig deeper into
the experience of connection

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.770
and disconnection.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.840
We went out and talked to
people about their smartphones.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.710
And they repeatedly tell us
just how useful and essential

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.990
their phones are.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.110
People rely on their phones
for communication, navigation.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.230
Phones can be our alarm
clock, our camera,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.550
even the way that
we pay for things.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.700
And this alone may seem
obvious, but it's actually

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.450
the implications of this that
are important to think about.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.352
If someone does want to
disconnect from the phone,

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.310
it's very difficult to
do so because they still

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.890
need these things.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.200
So if phones are so
useful and essential,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.520
where does the
resentment come from?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.030
Well, we learned that it's
unintentional behaviors

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.740
that bring about these
feelings of guilt.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.050
So what does that mean?

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.780
It might be intentionally
using your phone for something,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.280
and then getting
distracted and then

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.970
using it for something else.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.320
For example, someone said, "I
check my phone to see the time

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.960
and then get sucked right in."

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.940
Or it could be spending
longer than you

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.650
intended on the device.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.080
Someone else said, "I
spent an hour and a half

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.490
on a social media app.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.365
I was appalled with myself."

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.020
And people tell us
about how they've

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.810
noticed their own behaviors on
their phone evolve over time.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.540
For example, we've
heard about feeling

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.612
"phantom cues," feeling like the
phone is buzzing when it's not.

00:08:57.612 --> 00:08:59.320
Or they notice that
they might repeatedly

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.213
refresh an app just hoping
for new content to appear.

00:09:04.213 --> 00:09:05.880
And people say that
they're afraid to be

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.760
away from their phone in case
somebody needs to reach them,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.590
or they get a message, and
they need to reply quickly.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.230
So it can be very difficult
to put the phone down,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.470
to disconnect from it.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.480
As people are more
and more connected,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.350
there's this desire to
disconnect, or to at least

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.500
use the phone in a
more intentional way.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.200
So what has Google
done to support

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.880
people's intentional
relationship

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.950
with their technology?

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.510
Last year, we
stood on this stage

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.360
and announced our commitment
to digital well-being, which

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.730
is really rooted in our
belief that technology

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.540
should improve lives and
not distract from them.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.850
We launched tools to give
people greater control

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.130
over how they use their
devices and technology.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.160
One of those tools
is Family Link.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.120
So, for parents, you can monitor
and keep an eye on screen time,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.950
setting daily
limits and bedtimes.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.990
You can manage the
content that your child

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.550
sees, remotely approving
downloads and blocking apps.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.370
And you can keep
an eye on location,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.460
remotely lock the device,
and for all those times

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.040
that your child loses their
phone in the couch cushions,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.135
you can ring the device.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.930
YouTube launched Take a Break.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.330
So if you want to be
reminded to take breaks

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.820
while watching videos, YouTube
will send you a reminder.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.050
Gmail launched Snooze.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.540
So if you want to put
emails off for a later time,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.950
you can do that.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.200
And they launched-high
priority notifications,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.080
so you only get notified when
there's an important email

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.010
in your inbox.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.800
And we've seen that
high-priority notifications

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.890
have eliminated 97%
of notifications

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.160
on average, while still
keeping users up-to-date

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.470
when they get an important
email from the people that

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.040
matter most.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.600
On Android, we launched digital
well-being tools, including

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.480
the dashboard, which shows you
how you're using your device;

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.140
app timers, which let
you put limits on apps;

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.780
and Wind Down to
help you disconnect

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.970
from the device at night.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.940
And in one study, we've
seen that app timers helped

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.670
users stick to their
goal 96% of the time,

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:32.320
and Wind Down reduced
nightly use by 27%.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.970
So we're starting to see
the impact of our features,

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.860
but we know that
there's more to do.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.070
I'm going to pass
it over to Maggie.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.810
MAGGIE STANPHILL: Thank you.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.210
In my role, I look across
Google's digital well-being

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.090
initiatives to
align our strategy

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.400
and ensure that we have
a point of view that

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.320
shares a user's point of view.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.100
And what we heard this year
is that many people have

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.170
digital well-being
on their minds,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.910
and it's become
even more important

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.260
for people and their
families around the world.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.510
As you heard from
both Mindy and Safia,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.600
we know that helping parents
is critical to this initiative.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.950
So with our launches of
Family Link for mobile as well

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.490
as on ChromeOS devices,
we've brought the support

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.270
to our global users.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.520
And in the past 12 months,
we've seen one in three people

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.780
actively take steps to make a
change with their relationship

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.920
with tech.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.960
And the interesting thing
is that these people

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.320
have taken steps that I
have certainly taken myself,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.350
things like deleting apps
I'm not actively using,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.230
or reducing the number
of notifications,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.670
and finally sometimes leaving
that phone in a different room

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.030
in order to not be interrupted.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.250
And the good news
is that 80% of them

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.150
have reported a positive impact
to their overall well-being.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.670
This is really,
really hopeful news,

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.310
but we know that we can do
even more together, which

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.360
is exactly why we're here with
you, our developer community.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.510
You can help us really
scale this together.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.210
Another resource
that we've leveraged

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.800
is drawing upon the
expertise of others.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.750
So we've assembled a bunch
of experts in various fields,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.080
ranging from neuroscience,
to behavioral science,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.250
to psychology and parenting,
and we're employing their best

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.520
practices in a lot of our work.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.060
For me, as a user
experience practitioner,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.400
I love to think about the user.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.800
It's a great way to
ground us in empathy.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.020
And so with the many--

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.440
in fact, 95,000-- people
we listened to this year,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.170
I thought I would share with
you a little bit about how

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.574
they're feeling about this
topic in their own words.

00:13:49.574 --> 00:13:50.241
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:52.726
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:58.200
- Oof.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.520
- I feel like I should
be controlling it.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.115
- My biggest issue with it
is knowing when to stop.

00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:06.940
- It just tends to
capture me away from what

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.940
I should be focusing on.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.330
- I think you have to say
that you control the phone.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.860
It doesn't control you.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.520
- Technology is-- not so much
that it's a necessary evil,

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.010
it's a necessary good
that could go either way.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.080
You know, the jury's out.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.772
It's up to us as to what
we do with the technology.

00:14:29.607 --> 00:14:30.190
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.610
MAGGIE STANPHILL: So you
heard from our wise users.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.360
The jury is out to us, up
to us to really determine

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.560
what's next.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.870
And with that, we're
going to introduce

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.730
some of our awesome
features which

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.820
built in a lot of the insights
we learned from our users

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.560
through these many studies.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.240
And with that, I'll
hand it over to Rose

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.702
to share some of these updates.

00:14:49.702 --> 00:14:50.660
ROSE LA PRAIRIE: Great.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.470
Thank you.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.100
MAGGIE STANPHILL: Yep.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.230
ROSE LA PRAIRIE: Hi, I'm
Rose, product manager

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.580
for digital well-being.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.490
And as we've heard from
Safia, and Mindy, and Maggie,

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.950
we have been making
a lot of progress.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.840
We're encouraged to
see the data, which

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.810
shows our users are really
changing their behaviors

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.720
and meeting their goals,
but also, our research

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.010
tells us there's
more work to do.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.310
So we're excited to announce
some new features which

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.650
continue to build on what
we announced last year.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.320
First, as we heard,
notifications

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.480
can be a source of stress.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.640
So there's a whole
bunch of stuff

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.600
that my phone will tell me
that's really useful, but not

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.780
all of it is useful right now.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.780
For example, this morning
I was working out.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.350
And before anyone
thinks I'm a hero,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.830
I'm on London time, so I'm
basically in the afternoon

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.060
right now.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.510
And I'm sitting in a plank,
and I'm watching the timer,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.090
hoping that timer's
going to go down quickly,

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.900
and I get the
notification that says,

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.070
hey, the daily
crossword's ready.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:56.070
And I love my crosswords, but
right then, I didn't need that.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.610
So in Android Q, what
we're introducing

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.150
is priority notifications.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.500
And what this does is creates
two types of notifications.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.040
There's priority,
and there's gentle.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.010
And only the priority
notifications

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.140
will make noise or
vibrate and interrupt you.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.290
So, in my example,
that crossword

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.720
notification, that can
be gentle and something

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.420
I come back to later as
opposed to interrupting me

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.072
right now in the moment.

00:16:24.072 --> 00:16:25.530
And we've learned
from the research

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.660
that it's the
unintentional moments that

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.780
can lead to feelings
of regret and guilt.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.820
So there are important
moments in your day

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.280
when your phone should
reflect the intention of what

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.900
you're trying to do.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.403
With Wind Down, we
do that at night,

00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:41.070
so that when the
user's trying to sleep,

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.680
Wind Down serves as a
reminder that that's

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.910
what you're trying to do.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.690
But imagine I'm at
work or at school,

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.470
and I want to be productive.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.040
There's a lot of
stuff on my phone

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.660
that can help me be productive.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.640
If I'm at work,
I'm getting emails.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.350
I'm looking up where
my next meeting is.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.550
I'm getting pings.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.688
There's a multitude of things.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.480
But there's some stuff
that would be better

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.140
to wait until when I
don't need to focus.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.410
So we're introducing
focus mode, which

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.500
will let you pause distracting
apps with a single tap

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.359
to get work done.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.510
When the app is paused, the
notifications are paused,

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.619
and you can't open the app.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.950
So, for example, when
preparing for this speech

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.599
or trying to do work at work,
you can turn on focus mode

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:30.600
to pause the apps that actually
you don't need at that moment.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.480
And we've seen
that our app timers

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.760
are effective for
helping users be

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.410
more mindful of
the apps they maybe

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.750
want to use at different times.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.970
But we've heard a lot
of feedback from people

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.770
all around the
world that it's not

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.310
just apps that distract
them, it's also websites.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.250
So, for example, one that
I can personally relate to,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.050
that feeling of,
oh, I'll just go

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.850
and maybe do some
online shopping

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.020
or scroll these news sites.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.020
And so what we're
doing in Android Q

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.730
is we're introducing
the ability for you

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.790
to see your data
from Chrome and also

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.045
to set timers on not just
apps, but also websites.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.030
But changing habits is hard.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.310
I always remind
myself of this when

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.480
it feels like work is hard.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.120
And what we've
heard from users is

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.240
that they want more positive
encouragement and motivation

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.380
to stick to their goals.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.080
So you'll start to
see more of this,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.630
starting first with the
ability to set a screen time

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.763
goal with helpful
nudges to stay on track.

00:18:33.763 --> 00:18:35.930
And as Maggie mentioned,
we're doing this partnering

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.630
with many experts to
understand more how do

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.310
we think about user behavior.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.110
And in addition to
these new features,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.390
we're also making a
number of improvements

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.010
to existing features
to make sure

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.050
that they continue to
be effective and help

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.880
users achieve what
they want to achieve.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.030
So, for example,
we're making it easier

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.640
to see how you're doing
with your app timers,

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.120
and we're introducing a
daily schedule for Wind Down

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.645
because as much as we
might hear from the experts

00:19:03.645 --> 00:19:05.020
that it's really
important you go

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.610
to sleep at the exact
same time every night,

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.880
we know that that doesn't
always fit in your life.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.780
And we know from our research,
and we heard from Mindy,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.450
that parents are concerned
about the amount of time

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.370
that their kids are
spending on technology,

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.510
and they're actively
looking for support.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.480
So we're adding more
features to Family Link

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.120
to help parents set the
digital ground rules

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.140
and find the right balance
of technology for their kids.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.110
As one example, we're
introducing app-specific time

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.840
limits so that parents
can say, instead of

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.740
just I don't want you
used to your phone,

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.760
but I have this limit
for a specific app, which

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.022
great if you use it this amount,
but beyond that, we'll shut it

00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:46.230
down for the rest of the day.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.640
And we're also introducing
the ability for parents

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.110
to grant kids more screen time.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.560
So imagine your kid
reaches their screen time

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.670
limit for the day but has a
little more homework to do

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.050
or something else.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.450
Parents can grant
bonus time to the kids.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.520
And we'll also introduce
the ability for a kid

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.680
to request bonus time, which
a parent can say yes or no to.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.320
But it's not just parents
who have the ability

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.630
to help others disconnect.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.570
We all have the ability to
help each other disconnect.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.800
And so Google-- or
not Google, sorry.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.930
Gmail just recently
launched the ability

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.400
to schedule send emails as
part of their 15th anniversary.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.850
So, as an example, Monday was
a public holiday in the UK,

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.630
where I'm based, but it wasn't
here, so I was working here.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.510
But my team doesn't need to
be interrupted with the emails

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.500
that I was sending.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.100
So I can schedule
send to say I want

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.990
it to arrive on Tuesday when
they're back in the office

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.050
and not interrupt
them on the Monday.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.120
And all of this is
helping us build

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.070
more of an intentional
way for users

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.870
to interact with
technology, so they

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.311
can meet more of their
digital well-being goals.

00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:02.497
With that, I'll
pass back to Maggie.

00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:03.580
MAGGIE STANPHILL: Awesome.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.710
Thank you, Rose.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.280
All right.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.370
So bringing it home
with this notion

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.270
of embracing digital well-being
for a sustained relationship

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.090
with users, which I'm sure you
all are thinking a lot about as

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.360
well, and I personally
want to provide you

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.950
with some tools and resources.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.140
This is early days
in this space,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.390
and we'll continue to build
upon what we shared today.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.600
But what we know is that
having a meaningful impact

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.120
really requires getting these
tools out to more people,

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.710
and you're a huge,
huge part of that.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.980
So I want to share with
you resources for you,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.710
resources for parents
and educators,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.498
and resources for
you as developers.

00:21:41.498 --> 00:21:43.540
But first, we have to
start with ourselves-- kind

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.740
of that heal thyself first
mantra that I think many of us

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.450
don't spend enough time on.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.980
And our friends in our Google
Brand Studio and marketing team

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.040
relaunched our
wellbeing.google site.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.020
We know that this is not a
one-size-fits-all solution,

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.510
it's very nuanced.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.350
And so they've created a great
tool, a self-reflection tool,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.170
a guide for parents and
kids about tech use,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.270
and video content with
some of those experts

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.440
who we've sought out.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.940
So I hope you'll
find this valuable,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.050
and I hope you'll check it out.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.830
The other thing that
we have available

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.740
is a great resource called "Be
Internet Awesome" for kids.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.220
How many of you have
actually checked this out?

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.730
Show of hands?

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.310
All right, there's
lots of homework.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.530
I think you guys would love it.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.280
Three great assets within
here-- curriculum for teachers,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.000
intra-LAN video game for kids,
and a helpful guide for parents

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.340
to have those conversations
and get kids safe

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.330
online at an early age.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.410
And the good news, this is
available in 16 countries.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.990
And finally, resources for you.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.250
You are a huge, huge part
of us making this change

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.420
as a collective effort.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.130
And so I wanted to start with
our digital well-being values.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.250
We hold these dear, and we
build these into our products.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.033
First, provide awareness.

00:23:02.033 --> 00:23:03.700
We want to ensure
that we're encouraging

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.950
mindful, intentional use.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.730
We want to then enable
control and personal ownership

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.940
so that people really
understand the decisions they're

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.220
making with their technology.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.650
We want to then deliver
benefits without guilt, shame,

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.550
or regret.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.040
We learned a lot of this
through the sentiment analysis

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.200
and surveys we run,
and maybe that's

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.940
an insight for you to
think about, as well.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.830
And then we want
to ensure trust.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.030
Ultimately, we're all here to
build that trust with users,

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:35.350
and this can be a critical
resource for that.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.930
Transitioning into a
case study, the thing

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.150
that I have found so
interesting about working

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.700
on digital well-being as
a longtime user experience

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.820
practitioner is that
oftentimes what we find

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.800
is that it's what's
good for the user

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.020
is good for the well-being.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.310
And that makes a lot of sense.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.960
And what's interesting
about Drops--

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.880
this is a language learning app.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.670
They use a technique
called space repetition.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.830
And they have an
intentional amount of time

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:03.130
where they give a lapse between
the last learning session

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.230
and the subsequent session.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.180
And what's interesting
is these stats

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.410
could look possibly
counterintuitive to somebody

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.850
who is looking at it from
a growth perspective.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:18.130
The average daily user spends
56% less time within the app

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.250
and uses it 51% less often.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.230
And so from a digital
well-being standpoint,

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.340
that sounds like a
really good thing.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.820
But the amazing thing is
that this model really

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.190
lines up the user goals
with the business goals

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.370
to really make their
app strategy work.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.280
So I'll share with you
first the user goals,

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.280
and then I'll share with
you the business goals,

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.610
and hopefully this will
convey a little bit more

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.380
about how they approached it.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.040
So from a user
goals perspective,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.370
they want to lower
the barrier to entry.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.160
So they've introduced a
five-minute session limit.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.870
They figure anybody
who's looking forward

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.180
to learning a language can
certainly spend at least

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.115
five minutes on that session.

00:24:55.115 --> 00:24:56.740
They then want to
make sure they've got

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.240
a sustainable engagement model.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.350
So they have a limit on the
next session, which is 10 hours.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:07.090
What's cool about that is that
is that space repetition, which

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.630
really allows for
memorization, so a great way

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.990
to align those user goals
with their app strategy.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.320
Then when we take a look
at the business strategy,

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.980
they have users who pay
more, subscribe more,

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.990
and churn less,
which is a pretty

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.400
amazing feat in and of itself.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.100
So their stats are
also very impressive.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.520
They see a 4x higher
average revenue

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.940
per daily user versus
their peer average.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.350
They see a 2.5
higher install rate

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.680
to paid subscriber conversion
verse peer average.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.660
And then finally, 84% percent
lower subscriber churn.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.400
So this is amazing
evidence of how

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.470
you can align user
goals, business goals,

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.260
and really have a
solvent business model.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.540
And the good news is, I'm
seeing more and more of this

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.630
in the ecosystem.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.260
I was meeting with
top app developers

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.870
yesterday in a
developer event we had.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.690
I'm sure many of you are also
thinking along these lines.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.330
And I think this is what
has been so heartening to me

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.550
about this work, is
lining up the user

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.620
goals that ultimately lead
to the business goals.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.870
I also want to share
with you best practices.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.850
This team, this collective team
which I represent right now,

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.010
but there are many, many across
the company working on this,

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.040
have observed two critical
signals for digital well-being.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.120
They're quality and quantity.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.723
So let me tell you a little
bit more about quality.

00:26:32.723 --> 00:26:35.390
So what this might look like, as
you're thinking about your app,

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.950
or maybe even reflecting on
what we just shared with Drops,

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.290
this is all about helping
them complete tasks

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.790
without completing
any extra steps.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:48.270
It's also about enjoying
their time and energy spent

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.660
on the site.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.380
And then finally, one thing
that we've really looked into

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.590
is collecting signals of
quality so that we understand

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.340
how they spent their time.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.180
And what's interesting
about this is oftentimes,

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.400
the people in their life,
the people who matter

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.590
is a really critical signal.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.480
And that's much of
what Rose was also

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.940
intimating with some of the
prioritization in Gmail,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.420
et cetera.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.660
When we look at
quantity, we want

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.180
to make sure we're encouraging
that intentional use.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.452
So this means prioritizing
the things that help you

00:27:18.452 --> 00:27:19.660
with your overall well-being.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.450
That includes sleep,
work, relationships--

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.600
all those things that help your
physical and emotional self

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.620
also be well.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.980
We then want to recommend that
if you're building enterprise

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.100
tools, you provide
some way for the user

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.220
to maybe separate that personal
life and that work life.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.960
And I think for many of us,
it's become very intermingled,

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.050
but it's a time where
it might benefit

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.400
us to really look at ways to
break that apart at times.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.350
And then finally,
consider the user

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.220
needs and support those needs.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.210
This sounds like a no-brainer,
and ultimately, this comes back

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.880
to really that user
experience principle

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.150
of focusing on the user,
which we do a lot at Google.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.610
But you might uncover
some really unmet needs

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.510
and discover some new ways
of going about your work.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.630
Finally, again, representing
the amazing research

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.420
our team has done
across Google this year,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.180
I wanted to synthesize
just three methods

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.180
that we have found incredibly
useful with digital well-being

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.290
research.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.170
One, interview the
90th percentile user.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:25.010
You can really get a sense
of where the unmet needs lie

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:29.030
when you're getting to know
who's not using your product.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.720
Second, consult experts,
critics, and brand trust data.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.880
Having a more
objective perspective

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.620
really helps you see
your blind spots.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.670
And then finally, survey your
users and then check logs.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.180
What we've seen is that through
surveys, qualitative feedback,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.270
and surveys, that doesn't
always line up with the actions

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.130
people are taking on the
website or on the app.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.950
So correlating those
two will really

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.870
uncover what is happening
with their user behavior.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.620
Do they say they want
to change something,

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.480
and yet they're not
actively doing that?

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.790
And finding ways to make those
bridge is really important.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.660
Finally, I want to thank
you, first and foremost,

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.850
for coming out very early
this morning to be with us.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.790
I really appreciate that
you've come to Google

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.980
to spend this time together
with this amazing community.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.970
And I hope that you'll get
outside, once it gets sunny,

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.810
and take some time to just
enjoy this amazing week,

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.650
and experience JOMO,
as we like to call it.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.760
And when you get
back to your desk,

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.250
we look forward to
working with you

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.290
on building an ecosystem
that supports and prioritizes

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.820
digital well-being.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.420
Thank you.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.370
