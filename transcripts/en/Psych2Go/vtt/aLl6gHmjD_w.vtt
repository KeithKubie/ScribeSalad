00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.200
It's not easy dating
when you're naturally reserved

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.240
and don't go out of your way

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.300
to meet new people on a daily basis.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.480
But there are many benefits
to dating an introvert.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.600
As you get older,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.020
you may get sick and tired
of meeting new people,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.180
who only want to have a good time.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.160
Instead, you began to
find yourself wanting more.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.860
Here are 5 reasons why

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.520
introverts make the best
relationship partners.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.600
1. They can teach you
to take less for granted.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.020
Introverts are observant

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.240
and notice the little things
that are commonly overlooked.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.260
This means that they have
a keen eye for unique moments.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.380
They also know how to slow down

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.960
and learn to appreciate things
in the present.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.240
As why as in individuals,
they don't see life as a race.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.220
They know how to pace themselves.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.100
So, if you catch yourself constantly
feeling burned out or stressed,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.700
because you're always
looking for the next big thing,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.120
unline with your partner,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.740
and learn how to enjoy
what you have now.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.380
2. They make you their top priority.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.060
Are you unsure about entering
a long-distance relationship?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.340
If your partner is an introvert,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.260
you won't have to worry about
be cutting less important to them.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.580
In fact, introverts tend to excel
in long-distance relationships,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.680
because they put a lot of effort

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.000
in making things work for their partner.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.380
Considered and reliable individuals,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.520
they are great in making
an practical schedule

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.960
that lines up with yours.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.160
Introverts also tend to enjoy
going out of their way

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.680
to bring joy to their partners.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.740
Because that's how they demonstrate
their love and dedication.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.240

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.260
3. You can count on them

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.240
to be there for you
on your bad days.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.440
Maybe you just got laid off,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.040
or maybe you're dealing
with some family trauma.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.540
Whatever the case may be,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.340
if you need to have a good cry,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.100
know that you can do so
on your partner's shoulder.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.840
Introverts make great listeners
and excellent problem solvers,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.300
because they know how
to absorb information

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.220
and pick up on useful details.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.100
Of course, no one's perfect

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.640
and it's impossible
to have all the answers,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.740
but introverts are careful and earnest

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.460
in times of emergencies.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.060
How matter how big
or loud the storm is,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.660
They know how to provide the com,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.420
which is incredibly refreshing.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.220
4. You always feel like

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.960
there's something interesting
to learn about them.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.940
Introverts are naturally mysterious by nature.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.680
They prefer not to put
all their cards down at once,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.360
and slowly warm up to others.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.320
So, if you're dating an introvert,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.580
be thankful that they chose to let you in.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.740
Since introverts tend to
internalize their thoughts often,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.040
their inner worlds
tend to be complicated,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.160
yet rich and full of imagination.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.540
They make deep thinkers

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.660
and always seem to have
something interesting to say

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.980
when you least expected.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.380
5. They're in it for the long haul.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.700
Looking for a one-night stand?

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.740
Then look for someone else,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.780
because you've got the wrong person.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.820
Introverts like to weigh all their options

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.660
before making any decisions.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.180
This makes them (?),
responsible and level-headed.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.800
If an introverts chooses you
as their partner,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.160
then it means they see a future with you.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.300
We all know that
excitement eventually wears off

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.380
after the first stage of relationships.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.140
But this never discourages introverts.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.300
In fact, they don't care
about the adrenaline rush,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.440
So you'll know that
your partner's serious about you,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.120
because they have
a good time with you regardless.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.680
Good luck out there!

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.620
Introverts are an illusive target.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.900
It might just be best to set up
the Netflix fate and wait.
