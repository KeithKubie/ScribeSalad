[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:09.190
SPEAKER: Hello.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.052
Thank you, everybody,
for joining.

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:13.510
We're happy to have
you here today.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.140
Please, welcome our
speaker, Ishan Shivanand.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.980
He's going to give a talk on
reversing desensitization.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.340
He has been a meditation
teacher and life coach,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.880
giving meditation retreats
for the past 10 years

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.690
all around the world.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.950
And today, he'll be
speaking about the effects

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.020
of information overload and
what we can do to mitigate that.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.838
So please welcome Ishan.

00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:43.822
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:45.316
ISHAN SHIVANAND:
Thank you so much.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.360
I salute you.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.000
I salute the god
within all of you.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
Thank you so much for being
here, and first of all,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.600
it was very interesting
the introduction,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.760
very heavy words used.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.290
I apologize if my talk
would be a bit simpler.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.090
And basics-- I
believe in two things.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.740
And those two things are--

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.280
the most important
thing, if you ask me,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.740
the first being peace and the
second being relaxation, peace

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.410
and relaxation.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.770
So on this quest for
these two things,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.070
you and I are sitting here, and
I would like to welcome you all

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.480
and thank you from the bottom
of my heart for being here

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.650
and listening to me.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.110
I look at all of you smile,
and I would appreciate

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.580
if you can smile back.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.900
It would be less scary for me.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.170
So very nice, yes.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.170
I am glowing in pretty faces.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.306
So as I said, peace and--

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:09.139
what was the second?

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.380
I forgot.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.060
Relaxation, yes.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.710
Thank you.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.480
And these two things
I feel are the most

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.940
important in today's
life, because we can do

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.100
anything at all.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.790
We can work, we can study, but
in the end, what is that quest?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.020
We could be imagining of our
favorite show on Netflix,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.970
and there's always
the anticipation

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.730
that when the day will come,
when I was sure will come,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.850
and the day it has to
come, what do we feel?

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.080
A lot of peace.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.920
And when we are inside that
experience, what do we feel?

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.500
A lot of relaxation.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.900
Doesn't matter if the show
is bad or the ending is bad,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.930
but at least the anticipation
got us two things.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.650
What it is?

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.890
Peace and relaxation.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.810
Any noble experience that
we are trying to gain--

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.920
behind that, you will
find these two friends.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.300
And our objective is to
find them, befriend them,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.570
and sort of learn how to
create them on demand.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.650
Before I begin any further,
this whole concept,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.780
reversing desensitization,
how this came to be?

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.410
You see, my good friend here,
Mr. Jay, he and I were talking,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.020
and he said, I
believe you should

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.230
do a talk in my most
beautiful company, Google.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.955
And I said, what can I, me being
a man in a frock, teach them?

00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:57.570
And we were just
wondering what I

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.200
can talk, what we can discuss,
and a very interesting show

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.060
was on air.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.991
Have you heard of
"Game of Thrones?"

00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:09.490
Yes?

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.780
Uh-huh.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.350
You must.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.700
I did not hear,
so it's new to me.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.119
And I was very amazed, you know,
because every spiritual man

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:20.910
is supposed to have a
spiritual book, which

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.670
he's supposed to talk about.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.640
So let me be the spiritual
man, who's talking

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.460
about George RR Martin's book.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.880
So in that book,
what's most interesting

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.830
I found there is this
girl called Arya Stark.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.180
And somehow, she goes
to this place, where

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.520
there is the many-faced god.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.960
And this girl is being
trained to change faces.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.160
There is a game called
the Game of Faces.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.910
And it is a very
interesting game.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.940
How it's played is, like,
imagine you and I are sitting.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.300
I am sitting here.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.870
I am the one playing the game.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.970
You would be sitting there.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.150
So I will start
to say something,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.090
and if it sounds like the
truth, if you are convinced

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.200
it's the truth, it's fine.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.710
But if you are not convinced
that it's the truth,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.960
you have the opportunity to
whack me [WHACKING NOISE]..

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.810
So that's how the
game was played.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.930
Arya Stark was there saying some
lie, which seemed like a lie,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.540
and whenever it seemed like
a lie, [WHACKING NOISE]..

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.020
She got whacked.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.830
And then I'm thinking,
this George RR Martin

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.140
has copied my life, or the
life which me and so many

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.490
of my friends used
to live in India,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.040
because we were already expert
of playing the Game of Faces.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.320
And you know how
we used to play?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.380
In the morning, I would
say to my mother, Mother,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.150
I don't want to go
to school today.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.200
Such a good day.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.360
And she would be like,
[WHACKING NOISE]..

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.180
Say that you want
to go to school.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.110
And I'm like, OK, I have to
make my lie little bit more

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.510
convincing.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.170
I would go and stand in
the morning assembly,

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.030
and if I'd say to
my teacher, I don't

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.920
want to stand in the morning
assembly, what would happen?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.550
[WHACKING NOISE]

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.460
Not physical, more of
a metaphorical-- you

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.670
know what I'm talking about.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.250
And then I realized in
my life, so many times,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.830
I have played this
Game of Faces.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.040
Now, my new teacher is my wife.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.480
So she is teaching me.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.619
How she's teaching--
she'll say, please take me

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.910
to the shopping mall, and
I'll say, I don't want to go.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.740
[WHACKING NOISE]

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.724
OK, let's go to
the shopping mall.

00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:44.390
[WHACKING NOISE]

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.410
OK, I really want to take
you to the shopping mall.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.520
You know?

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.510
It's like you have to say--

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.990
and the beautiful words
of my loving wife are,

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.760
I don't want you to do it.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.300
I want you to want to do it.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.710
And that is the
time when I realize

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.340
that it's not just Arya Stark.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.490
George RR Martin is copying me.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.290
But the thing with Arya Stark
is that she's an expert.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.310
She's more masterful than me.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.360
She has learned how to
play the Game of Faces

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.920
in such a beautiful manner
that like a chameleon,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.920
she can put on a face, and
in the words of Shakespeare,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.164
all the world's a stage.

00:07:32.164 --> 00:07:37.960
Arya Stark can be whomever
she wants to, whatever

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.800
the situation calls.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.570
And the trouble that happened
with me was sometimes,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:53.420
while putting on a face, I get
confused that if that is me,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.750
then who am I?

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.270
Because so many times
you're talking to people,

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.900
and some person is saying,
midlife crisis, or some person

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.880
is saying, identity crisis.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.380
And while that
person is saying so,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.100
because maybe somewhere down
the line, he put on a face,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.540
or he had to put on a face.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:23.490
And in that face, somewhere,
the confusion occurred.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.890
So the moral of the story
is that Game of Faces

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:37.059
is fine, as long as I
know what my real face is,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.500
because if I don't know what
my real face is, then maybe

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.810
in these situations, maybe in
the incidences which happen

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:53.330
in my life, I get so confused
or attached or detached

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:58.610
to whatever it is
that is happening,

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:06.660
that I start to lose sight
of my goal or my objective.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.640
And what it does
is that it creates

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.390
a form of cognitive dissonance,
and it takes me away

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.670
from two of my best friends.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.820
And what were the names
of those two best friends?

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.060
Peace and relaxation.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.260
And peace and relaxation
are, then, aware.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.050
So again, I start to
think, and then I'm

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.050
looking for something, something
to give me that happiness.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:48.060
And all the beauty is
that if I'm already aware,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.190
centered, grounded,
in a state of peace,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:10:02.650
then even the happiness that I
search will lead to my growth.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.830
Otherwise, it would be
something called hidden trial.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.310
The thing with
hidden trial is there

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.266
is a very beautiful concept
that I heard when I was young,

00:10:16.266 --> 00:10:18.140
and it is one of the
most beautiful concepts.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.639
Why?

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:22.790
Because it had a
prominent effect on me.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.510
You see, earlier, I
used to have six packs.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.690
After understanding this,
I still have six packs,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.420
but they are well-hidden
somewhere here.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.830
And that beautiful
concept was junk food.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.060
Have you heard of junk food?

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.830
Yes, very interesting.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.170
It was a new concept
when I heard of it

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.910
and very delicious at that.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.940
Junk food is dependent
upon something that

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.575
is called supernormal stimulus.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.940
Supernormal stimulus
is biological responses

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:09.000
that are hardwired into my
nervous system, into my brain.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.100
So for example, if my brain
is wired in such a manner

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.470
that I will prefer
a certain taste--

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.730
let us assume the taste of
sugar or the taste or salt

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.840
or the taste of fat--

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.450
then even if I have a
choice of nutritional food,

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:34.580
my brain somehow pulls
me towards these tastes,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.040
so much so that I will
go towards these tastes,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.460
even if it sacrifices the
nutritional properties that I

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.960
may gain, if I have to
forfeit these tastes.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.350
So you can take a dish,
and you can take away

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.320
all the nutritional properties
that may be in the dish.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.610
And if you just put in
the supernormal stimulus

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:06.620
of those things, which the
biology is attracted towards,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.310
then maybe after
a certain point,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.910
it is the supernormal stimulus
that starts to trigger.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.220
And the problem
with such a trigger

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.450
is it can be manipulated,
and again, there

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:27.870
can be deviation,
deletion, and alteration.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.700
Deviation from what?

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.800
My goal, because if
there is no peace, then

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.980
there is a form of
anxiety, because I

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.040
may be eating a lot
of food, but if it

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.170
is the junk food
without the nutrition,

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:53.830
then my body will be
in a state of conflict.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.650
In the same manner, if I am
running after a stimulus,

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.860
and that stimulus is
a junk food stimulus,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.260
then the lack of
peace creates anxiety,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.690
and I will be
deviated from my goal,

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.380
looking for something that is
not bringing me satisfaction.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.610
The second is the deletion.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:20.440
The deletion is that in myself,
I have the power of creativity.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.620
In myself, I have
the power of balance.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.735
In myself, I have poetry.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.450
It is so beautiful,
the eyes of the poet.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.860
You look at any masterpiece,
and it comes from stone.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.430
Yes or no?

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.290
And stones are everywhere.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.830
And imagine, if I
have the creativity,

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.910
then if I will look at a stone,
I'm not looking at a stone,

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:57.920
but I am looking at the
masterpiece inside the stone.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.350
And if I have the
capacity to look

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.380
at the masterpiece
inside the stone,

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.610
then I may very well
end up carving it out.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.710
Yes or no?

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.260
And the same stone can be what?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.170
Used as a weapon to throw.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.580
The same stone can be nothing
but a mundane experience, which

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.740
is a part of my life,
but the same stone,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.120
if I have the
capacity, has the power

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.260
to be converted into a
beautiful masterpiece.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:38.100
And deletion means that me
having all these stones around

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:49.120
me, yet my eyes cannot see
the beauty that I can create.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.420
And a person who starts
to go towards this space

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:59.630
will realize that he has
the power to carve out,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:06.070
carve out this beautiful
and phenomenal masterpieces.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:16.446
And finally, what happens is
if I am lost and not grounded,

00:15:16.446 --> 00:15:17.570
it's a very beautiful term.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:26.820
It's called alteration, but I
like the term, zombification,

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.280
because, again, when I was
sitting with my friend, Jay,

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.950
he was showing me
another beautiful thing.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.670
Actually, that wasn't beautiful.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.460
Another show-- I don't know
why he likes to show me TV,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.020
educate me.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.200
"The Walking Dead--"
and I learned

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.360
something about something
called a zombie.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.490
Have you heard the
term, "zombie?"

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.590
For me, it was new.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.390
It was very nice, you
know, this zombie.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.539
And the thing about this zombie
is, one, it is always hungry.

00:16:01.539 --> 00:16:02.080
I don't know.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.360
Maybe he needs some
digestion problem or what.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.920
The second thing
about the zombie

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.720
is that it always goes
in conformity, the hoard,

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.850
like a pack mentality.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.330
And the third thing about a
zombie is it bites somebody,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:23.230
and that person also
becomes a zombie.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:29.160
And this made me think
that how very practical

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:36.760
this is, because if there is
alteration from human being

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.560
being a human being, then
again, the zombification--

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.050
a negative person
starts to have the power

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.970
to make other person negative.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.980
Early in the morning,
we are getting up.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.120
We are very happy.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.320
We are driving a car.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.870
We are peaceful,
listening to a nice song.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.180
Suddenly, zombie is
driving next to us.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.220
I don't know why
he's in a bad mood,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.810
but in America, I've seen
nobody honks that much.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.024
In India, we honk a lot.

00:17:03.024 --> 00:17:04.690
We are very happy
honking at each other,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.460
but in America, nobody honks.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.550
So if somebody does honk,
it is like an electrocution

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.930
experience.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.579
Certainly, there is
so much of current,

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.170
and you are like,
why did you honk?

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.140
What happened?

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.650
And maybe that person
was negative, but now

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.390
through that person's
experience, even I am thinking,

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.250
what?

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.020
Why did he say like this?

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:28.950
Why did he honk?

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.540
He was the one who was wrong.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.420
Maybe I should have
given a piece of my mind.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.670
I continue to think,
and I continue

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:42.710
to choreograph situations
and incidences.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.020
Like you watch a
Jackie Chan movie,

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.150
and it is so very,
very choreographed,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.640
and all the punches
are choreographed.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.470
So many times, I
look at people that

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.000
have been bitten by a
metaphorical zombie,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.390
and they are choreographing
in their head.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.080
If somebody would have told me
this, I would have told this.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.130
And how you can get to
know, it's very beautiful.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.710
Sometimes when
you get in a lift,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.420
look at the person's face.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.825
The person's face is
normal, and inside his head

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:14.200
he's choreographing,
and there'll

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.420
be small twitches in his
eyebrows and his lips.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:28.330
And he's thinking that, why
did, at that time, I not think?

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.810
And what has happened
that now my brain, my body

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:41.200
can be utilized to manifest,
to create, to dream, to wish,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.800
to hope?

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.630
But where is my brain going?

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:52.920
Choreographing the
zombified moments

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.770
that somehow came into my life.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:03.350
And as I said, even
zombies go in a herd.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:08.150
The same thing affects
conformity to a human mind.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.080
If I'm listening to four people,
and four people are dancing

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.940
to a simple tune,
and if at that time,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.780
I am not centered
in the manner, then

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.110
that person, who at that
time, is not grounded,

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.510
a person who doesn't
stand for something

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.070
can be swayed towards anything.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.120
In India, there's a very
beautiful term called "guru."

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.290
Guru means a guide, a
teacher, and it doesn't

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.780
need to be a human being.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.490
It can be my principles.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.610
It can be my morality.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.840
It can be my stability.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.910
But what it is
supposed to be is it

00:19:53.910 --> 00:20:00.820
is supposed to be my anchor, my
rock, especially in the times

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.570
when I am obviously confused.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.300
I don't-- there can be
some times when I am lost.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.990
And if at that
time, a person, you

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.910
see he's not there, then five
people, six people, 10 people--

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.140
he starts to believe.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.690
He starts to accept,
and he starts

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.080
to create a parallel reality.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.050
And hence, to avoid
this zombification,

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:36.940
to avoid these phases,
there has to be a purpose.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.400
And why I say purpose,
you must understand

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.930
why there is supposed
to be desensitization.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.360
Because so many times,
we just want to relax.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.130
Yes or no?

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:57.330
You had a hard day,
and we want to forget.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:02.230
Maybe somebody will say,
it is so nice at that time

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.700
to be zombified, to just
sit in front of the TV,

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.880
and be lost in that
artistic poetry

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.400
that I'm seeing in front of me.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.560
And I want you to understand
the whole point, the purpose,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.710
because I'm not saying this
is good or this is bad.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.285
I am just saying the purpose.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.170
The purpose is simple.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:34.870
There is relaxation,
and there is numbing.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:41.160
And numbing is different
than relaxation.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.780
Numbing means when I am lost.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.200
Numbing means when
I do not know,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:54.060
when I am dependent
upon external chemical

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.510
stimulus or external
physical stimulus

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.570
or external whatever it may be.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.520
Numbing means when
the dosage has

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:10.090
to increase every single time
to chase that first high.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:21.350
Numbing is when I am not the
creator, and I am dependent.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:26.850
Relaxation, on the other hand,
is something very beautiful.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.970
Relaxation means
I have the power.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.700
It is internal.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.070
It is only me, who has
the power to create.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.610
And I am not affected
by that which I see,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.990
because it is I who am the
director and the writer

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.070
of my story.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.880
That is peace.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:50.030
And as I said, the
importance of peace--

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.620
there is an old
saying which says,

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.810
empty mind, devil's workshop.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.110
Long ago, I was in
Australia, and I

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.400
was sitting with a shaman.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.610
He was a very old,
aboriginal shaman.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.850
I don't know what is the precise
term-- the village elder,

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.670
the wise ones, you
know, the one who

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:25.020
have that big beard,
sitting next to the fire,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.700
looking precisely what
he's supposed to be.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.480
I don't know.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.330
It was very, very nice,
very, very theatrical,

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.970
and I'm sitting
with this wise man.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.620
And he comes to
me, and he's even

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.340
talking in those wise manner.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.400
You know, the voice is very
low, and he comes to me,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.110
and he says, "Ishan."

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.330
I can't repeat, you know.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.930
Maybe I don't have
that exact quality,

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.740
but he was very-- the
stars and the fire.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:59.050
And he says, "Ishan,
I have to make road,

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.840
and there are trees on the road.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.980
So necessity is the
mother of invention,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.830
and hence, my mind
invents an ax.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.160
So I cut the tree,
make the road.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:23.420
Now, there is no
need for the ax.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.180
And if my mind doesn't
give purpose to the ax,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:32.710
then my mind will start
creating purposes for the ax.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.910
So now there is no road to
be made, no tree to be cut,

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.810
and I am angry, and I have
anger, and I have my ax.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.520
So what is the 2 plus 2?

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.840
I am angry with you.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.990
I have anger.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.090
I have my ax.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:51.080
Let us start thinking about
cutting something else."

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.590
And I am looking
at that man, and I

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:56.750
am saying, why are you saying
to me all these things?

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.150
I am a very peaceful person.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.040
I've never even held an ax.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:09.610
He said, "Son, the same
goes for everything in life.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:14.140
There has to be a purpose,
purpose for your mind,

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.710
purpose for your body,
purpose for your work,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.220
purpose for even
your spirituality.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.170
Otherwise, your veganism
will also become cruel."

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.930
Because so many times--

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.910
I am a vegan, and I am
sitting with somebody,

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.120
and that person is
explaining to me,

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.040
and he's explaining in
such a forceful manner

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.630
that even I am
thinking, brother,

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.040
I have been vegan all my life.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.320
Why are you shouting at me?

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.155
Even the spirituality
has to have purpose.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.520
And if there is no
purpose, then like the ax,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.680
which was invented
to make roads,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.370
it's the same ax that
can be used for what?

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:05.920
Giving haircuts to people or
whatever you may soon please.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:18.120
Lack of peace and relaxation and
all technology, all knowledge

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.745
is utilized for
singular purpose.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:31.290
Add the variable of
peace and relaxation,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.830
and the whole knowledge
and technology

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:41.820
can be utilized in a much
more humanistic purpose,

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:47.940
because at that time, we can
start thinking as humanity,

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.530
as a whole species.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:54.540
At that time, we can become
more poetic in our outlook.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.830
And at that time, a
rock is not a rock.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.730
A rock has the power to be what?

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.640
A masterpiece.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:11.030
And to create this piece,
there are a few things

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:21.140
which are the entry point,
a few types of meditations

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.980
that I would love to teach
you, if you allow me.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.850
Do I have your kind permission?

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.800
You have to nod your
head or say something.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.515
I know I'm very--

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.070
whatever you may
say, but reaction.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.408
Give me a reaction, please.

00:27:38.408 --> 00:27:38.908
Yes.

00:27:43.337 --> 00:27:48.440
The first is a very
dynamic meditation

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.630
that I want to teach you.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:55.700
The second is a very
simple, dharmic meditation

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.330
that I want to teach you.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:03.561
And the third is a very--

00:28:03.561 --> 00:28:10.960
a meditation for every
single second of your life.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.600
So there are three
things that I want

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.250
to teach you that will help you
in your life to bring these two

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.360
best friends so that somewhere
down the line, if we were

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.200
playing the Game of Faces,
we can be more proficient.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.300
But more than that, we can
help realize our objective

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.140
and slowly move towards that.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.120
And before we go towards the
experiential part of whatever

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.500
it is that we talked about,
if there are any questions,

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.580
you may ask.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.580
I would love to answer.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.530
And then we may proceed.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.460
Yes.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.880
Now, the spotlight
is on you, and I

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.260
will try to sit on this
long chair, which looks very

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:04.000
difficult. But I will manage.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.354
Yes.

00:29:06.354 --> 00:29:08.610
Any question?

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.490
AUDIENCE: I can at
least start off.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.690
And we talked about this
a little bit earlier.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:19.140
There is just a lot of--
you talked about purpose.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.100
Life has so many dimensions
and so many purposes.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.360
And throughout the day, we
get through from one context

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.280
to another to another, and
this whole notion of things

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.530
to keep track of,
things to do, and things

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.460
to get done, at some level,
goes away from purpose

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.390
and turns into
tactical execution.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.360
So how do you keep track of not
one but the plethora of things

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.850
that we need to do in
life, and still make sure

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.362
that at the end, we are
moving toward something

00:29:50.362 --> 00:29:52.320
that will give us
satisfaction in the long run?

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.560
ISHAN SHIVANAND: Have
you heard about dolphins?

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.660
Dolphins are the sweetest
creatures that you will see,

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.440
and they are so
very inquisitive.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.920
And the thing about dolphin
is that they are mammals.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.300
I did not know this.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.070
I thought everything
in the water is fish.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.150
But apparently, dolphin is not.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.500
And one of the most
complicated things in a dolphin

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.910
is that it has to come to
the surface to breathe.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:37.900
I did not know this.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.160
I thought everything in
the water could breathe.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.420
And it's so very interesting.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.530
You know, my question was, how
does a dolphin go to sleep?

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.880
Because if it has to come
to the surface to breathe,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.970
and if it is sleeping, then
imagine if you have to sleep,

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.990
and you needed some special
room, where you have to go to,

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.370
where only you could breathe.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.590
So how would you sleep?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.270
It's very interesting.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.090
So I went to this place.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.820
There's an island
called Mauritius-- very

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.830
beautiful, very nice place.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:15.400
And I was studying dolphins.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.400
So when the daytime comes,
all these dolphins, they

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:25.570
come near the shore, and they
go into a rhythmic motion.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.520
They are going up.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.660
They are going down.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.590
They're going up.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.550
They're going down.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.880
They're doing like a dance, a
ballet, where they go to sleep.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.030
And just like our chest
expands and contracts,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.660
it goes into a rhythm,
and we are sleeping.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.670
Even the dolphin--
the only difference

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:47.030
is the dolphin comes up, and
then goes down, and sleeping.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.050
And it comes up,
and it goes down.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.920
It's such a beautiful
thing to witness.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.550
And here, the most
important thing

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.330
is the dolphin is coming up.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.790
Even though the dolphins'
life is in the water,

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.540
the dolphins' kids
are in the water,

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.490
the dolphins' food
are in the water,

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.990
I'm sure there must
be a [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.450
also somewhere down there.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:12.110
The dolphins' everything
is inside the water.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.956
Yet where is breath?

00:32:14.956 --> 00:32:15.456
Up.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.990
And the thing is we must
learn from the dolphin.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.870
Imagine if the dolphin
says that I have to learn

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.020
to be technical and tactical.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.870
I have to learn to
be a strategist,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.870
and in my strategizing,
I have no time at all.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.830
I am so very busy
and so very focused

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.950
that I can do 20 things,
but I don't have the time

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.170
to go up and breathe.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.135
What is going to happen
with the dolphin?

00:32:46.135 --> 00:32:50.800
The dolphin is going to become
anxious, more anxious, and more

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.700
anxious.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.250
And then if you are
talking to the dolphin--

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.800
again, now I am
being metaphorical--

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.350
and the dolphin will be
like, oh, I'm so stressed.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.720
I can't breathe, and I am here.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.260
But I have to work so much.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.170
I have to be so very tactical.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.570
Do you go after 10 minutes
and talk to the dolphin,

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.680
and the dolphin says,
life has become very hard.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.590
It's so hard now.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.820
I have nothing to do.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.440
And then you go
after half an hour,

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.430
and now the dolphin
is like, [GASPS],,

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.875
it's time to go, my friend.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.090
Everything is fine.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.510
Everything is good.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.440
Everything is beautiful,
as long as the dolphin

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.370
goes up and breathes.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.360
Similarly, we human beings
are doing so many tasks

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.410
in our life, yet there are
some tasks in our life, which

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.720
sort of heal us.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.070
And the task can be anything.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.010
For some people,
it is meditation.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.380
For some people, it is
hiking in the woods.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.650
For some people, it
is jumping off cliffs.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.820
Really, I have met people.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.870
For them, meditation
is going woo-ha.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.230
For some people, it is
doing charitable work.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.810
But there are activities,
which heal you,

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.860
and there are activities,
which put a strain upon you.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.889
And we as human beings
must learn from dolphin,

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:24.300
and every single day, we must
do that one activity, which

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.880
heals us, which
sort of connects us,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.260
which sort of
beautifies us, which

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:40.659
makes us feel one with the
world that is around us.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:47.239
This is called
realistic meditation,

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:53.659
and realistic meditation
depends upon additions.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.480
Why, I say, it is
realistic meditation

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:04.880
is that one is a meditation
based upon subtractions.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.820
This is the most difficult
type of meditation that exists.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.540
In fact, this meditation
compels a person

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.760
to maybe develop obsessive
compulsive disorder.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.610
And a subtractive meditation
is that you will not

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.310
think negative.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.470
You will not think negative.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:30.030
A subtractive meditation is I
tell you that from today, you

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.550
will not think about monkeys.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.560
You will not think
about orangutans.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.760
You will not think
about gorillas.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.290
You may not think
about King Kong.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.782
King Kong is
considered a monkey.

00:35:41.782 --> 00:35:42.990
Let us assume it is a monkey.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.690
And now, I tell you, what did
I tell you not to think about?

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.050
What is the answer
that is coming?

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.060
[INAUDIBLE], my dear.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.470
What?

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:57.120
Monkey.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.000
Yes or no?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.520
And I tell you again, focus.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.770
Don't think about monkey.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.050
Don't think monkeys.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.050
Stop thinking about
monkey right now.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:08.080
What did I tell you
to not think about?

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.100
What?

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.540
You were supposed to forget.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.780
Why is it that "Dunston Checks
In" is coming in your head?

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.050
This is subtractive.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:24.760
The second is the
addition-based meditation.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.980
And addition-based meditation is
imagine I have a bottle of ink,

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.040
and I need to purify
this bottle of ink.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.110
One is put my hand inside.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.180
Try to clean that bottle of ink.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.920
It will take ages and ages.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.870
The other is take water, keep
putting inside the pot of ink,

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:48.187
the ink will get diluted,
and slowly, it will go away.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.830
So the beautiful thing here,
what I am requesting from you

00:36:54.830 --> 00:37:00.370
is you are working
very hard, yes.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:05.540
Has But the best
thing is if we start

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.990
to add a little bit of
more of such activities

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.090
that I've mentioned
in your life.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.300
And that addition
can be anything.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.290
If you feel peace while learning
a new language, then every day,

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.610
for a few minutes,
that's what it should be.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.440
If you feel very,
very good working out,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:31.050
then make the additions
of working out.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.590
If you feel very, very nice
sitting in a nice place

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.490
contemplating--

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:40.820
I was in Vienna, and in
Vienna, it's very interesting.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:44.330
I went to this place, where
all these psychologists came,

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:45.110
all of them--

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:48.230
Sigmund Freud, this, that,
the Psychological Society.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.560
And there, I saw it
was such a nice culture

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.890
that so many people would just
take a cup of their coffee

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:59.350
and go in the garden, sit
and drink their coffee,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.210
and just contemplate.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.820
And I asked one of them,
gentlemen, what are you doing?

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.550
And they said, we are thinking.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.840
And I said, thinking what?

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.830
He said, doesn't matter,
because if I think so much,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.220
maybe one or two thoughts will
have a little bit of meaning

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.490
or whatever it is.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.190
And then I also said,
looks very good.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.840
I also took a cup of coffee,
and I started to think,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.970
because apparently,
I rely, generally,

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.040
usually, mostly,
in fact, certainly,

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.684
always, we are not thinking.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.670
We're not rethinking.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:39.060
We are always being bombarded
by so much stimulus,

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.100
so much information.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.320
The moment we are
walking into a shopping

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:51.110
mall, every single brand that
we see is a sort of conditioning

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:55.770
that Pavlov had done
when he was demonstrating

00:38:55.770 --> 00:39:00.410
the effects of conditioning
on his canine friend.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.740
Similarly, when we are
walking into a shopping mall,

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.390
these are all patterns.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.240
And our brain is trying to
calculate these patterns,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.140
and we are so busy deciphering
the patterns from the patterns

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:17.500
of the past, trying to
give an understanding,

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.190
meaningful understanding
of the world around us

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:23.910
that never do we
just sit and think

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.010
free thoughts, the creativity.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.460
And I learned this,
that this contemplation

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.950
is one of the best form
of meditation, which

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.900
we are going to talk about.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.600
But as I said, addition.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:45.250
And the easiest way of what
this kind gentleman asked

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.420
was, be like the dolphin.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.760
Every single day, give yourself.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.010
And that time is
your time, me time,

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:57.450
when I am doing that
activity, which is really,

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:03.030
really benefiting me and making
me extremely, extremely happy.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.640
And that will help
in the long term,

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.890
because then, when
you will look back,

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:12.660
you will find that there is one
connection in every single day

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.770
that I have lived.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.330
And that is the connection.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:21.640
That is the growth that I
have brought in my mind.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.150
So yes, dolphin.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.190
Thank you so very much.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.840
Anything else?

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:37.160
AUDIENCE: So a lot of times,
I see people who are--

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.100
you talked about
peace and relaxation.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:45.800
And there's a way of being
peaceful and being relaxed

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:51.270
that is put on, that is forced.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:55.810
And I see people walking
through in that way,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.650
when it's just a covering.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.500
Do you have any--

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.180
can you speak to that at all?

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.360
ISHAN SHIVANAND: Can
you elaborate, please?

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.800
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess in
the context of meditations--

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.165
ISHAN SHIVANAND: Yes.

00:41:11.165 --> 00:41:12.540
AUDIENCE: --that's
where I see it

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.320
the most, because with
certain meditations,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.410
you can very forcefully
force yourself

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:25.770
into a state of
"peace," in quotes.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.610
It's almost peace,
because there's

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:33.530
something underneath, which is
never acknowledged and never

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.477
addressed.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.020
ISHAN SHIVANAND: Can I speak?

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:44.550
My friend, Jay, took me
to a Muay Thai class.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.820
I had no idea what Muay Thai is.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.700
Apparently, it's a
place, where people

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.100
kick you, punch you,
elbow you, and knee you.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:03.490
And when I went for the first
time to the Muay Thai class,

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:10.740
the gentleman that was there
told us to do 10 push-ups.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.660
Now, the beauty is I do
only two push-ups every day.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.100
One is when I'm
going down to sleep,

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.070
and the other is when I'm
waking up in the morning.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.690
And now, this gentleman is
saying, doing 10 push-ups.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:29.470
Then, of course, I had no
capacity to do 10 push-ups.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:29.970
Why?

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.870
Because I had never
done them in my life.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.010
And the beauty was I did
two push-ups that day,

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:43.090
and I could feel
them the next day.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:46.660
But then, the thing about body
is, the thing about our mind

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:50.490
is we are very adaptive.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.950
Our body learns.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:55.530
If you look at our
self, we didn't

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.920
know to drink coffee
when we were born.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.080
It is all acquired behavior.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.650
We learned.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:06.620
Our body adapted so that we
would learn to drink coffee,

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.050
and now, every day
in the morning,

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.680
the first thing that we are
saying is, where is coffee?

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.270
My love, I want to have you
in my arms and take you.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:17.880
Because my cells
are asking for it.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.090
My body adapted.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.280
And after just doing
10 days of push-ups,

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.260
I could do 20, 30
push-ups at a time,

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.260
and I'm so impressed by myself.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:27.760
Why?

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.920
Because my body has adapted.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.570
The same goes for meditation.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.240
Imagine if I look
at Rich Froning,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.570
that CrossFit champion guy.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:43.630
And I say, this is Rich
Froning, and if he's

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.350
doing these CrossFit
workouts, then today, I also

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.150
do the same CrossFit workout.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:53.470
I will do 100 burpees,
200 push-ups, 500 squats.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.360
One, I will not be
able to do them.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.590
Second, if by God's miracle, I'm
even able to do quarter of it,

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:04.000
then for the next 10 days,
I will be on the bed.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.640
The same happens that
I look at Buddha,

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.190
or I look at somebody in
the Himalayas, and I say,

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.520
this is what I want.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.750
And we can get this, of course.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.440
If our goal is to become
like Gautama Buddha,

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.170
then, of course, if
we have perseverance,

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:23.050
then we have the
capacity to get this.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:26.190
But underline this
word two times--

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.770
perseverance.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.650
Because perseverance
and persistence

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:37.920
will help us reach to whichever
goal we are wanting to achieve,

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.170
because even when we are
talking about meditation,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.810
and I'm talking about it myself.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.720
The first time when I
also started to meditate,

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.940
I would have had a hard day.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.000
And trust me, I kid
you not, I fell asleep.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.330
I was very good meditation,
because I'm falling asleep,

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.100
and I'm coming out,
and people are saying,

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.750
oh, you were meditating
for one hour.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.510
I'm saying, yes.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:06.500
Sometimes when I'm meditating,
my knees start to itch,

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.530
and then I itch my knee.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.810
And imagine if at that
time, I say to myself,

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:13.360
no, I will meditate.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.610
I will not itch my knee.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:16.660
What is going to happen?

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:22.570
Will I meditate on myself, or
will I meditate upon the itch?

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:26.630
The thing is perseverance and
persistence makes you grow.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.280
Your body adapts.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:33.420
Even for meditation, quietness,
peace, and relaxation,

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.000
the body adapts.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.140
Just like our body adapts to
tea, our body adapts to peace.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.080
And that is why the start
is very, very important.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.420
The entry is very,
very important

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.200
and a little bit forced, yes,
because if you take a gym

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.350
membership, you have
to force yourself

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.540
to go to the gym every day.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.240
So that little force
in the beginning just

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.910
to overcome the
inertia, my friend,

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.720
is always there in anything
that you do in your life.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.490
But once the body starts
to adapt to that situation,

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:20.400
then the same things start to
give me a lot of happiness.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.980
I was doing this class.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.470
Again, my friend,
Jay-ji, put me.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:30.180
There is this thing called Soul
Cycle in San Francisco, where

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.970
a lot of spinning is
happening, and they

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:36.780
put nice candle and nice music,
and you're cycling, cycling.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.880
I went early morning, 6:00.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.550
And so many people were
there, and so many people

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.310
were enjoying.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:43.560
They were going with the beat.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.320
They were so very happy.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.340
And I realized that these
people are very, very happy

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.110
doing this, because
now their body

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.330
has adapted to that happiness.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.170
And seeing their happiness,
even though it was my first day,

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.507
even I started to
go, [GROANING]..

00:47:01.507 --> 00:47:03.340
Even though nothing was
happening down here,

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.430
but at least this was nice.

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:09.480
So you know, force
is not a bad thing,

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.660
as long as it's
taking me somewhere,

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.550
as long as the result
that I'm getting

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:18.570
is good, as long as my body is
adapting, as long as I'm not

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:24.630
going against my nature,
and as long as every day,

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.790
I am growing.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.400
So let me teach
you a few things.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.780
Let us start.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.850
And just like I
could do 30 push-ups

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:38.510
in 10 days, maybe, my friend,
you are Gautama Buddha in 20.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.640
Thank you so very much.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.410
Yes.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:43.280
Anything else?

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:50.110
OK, so we continue.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:56.190
As I said, the three
forms of meditation--

00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:01.140
the first meditation is
a very simple meditation.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.625
And that meditation
is called sleep.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:08.270
The first thing
that we need to do

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:12.920
when we are talking about
moving towards the path of peace

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.720
and relaxation, the
first thing is sleep.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.470
Do you all sleep in 24 hours?

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:22.330
Please say yes.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.250
Please say yes.

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:24.270
Oh, thank you.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:27.540
Yes, that's nice.

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:32.930
So in this meditation
that is sleep,

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:38.080
first is the preparation
for this meditation.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.080
So for the first
preparation that we

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.990
have to do before we
are going to sleep

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.690
is one hour before
of whatever time

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:49.690
it is that you are
wanting to go to sleep,

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.636
I want you to switch
off your smart devices.

00:48:53.636 --> 00:48:55.010
And I know I'm
sitting in Google.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.910
I am so sorry Google.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:01.000
You are the best, but
still, one hour before you

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.500
go to sleep, no
phones, no screens,

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:11.180
no sort of light pollution.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.830
What this will do is this
will start preparing us.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:19.130
This will start
preparing your brain

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:24.830
to now slowly go into that
deep level of relaxation,

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:25.790
because sleep--

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.880
we all sleep-- but one
is asleep when we wake up

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.040
happy, and other is the sleep
when we wake up like Dracula.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.240
So what we want is we want
a high quality of sleep.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:45.530
So the first thing that we do
is that we switch off everything

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.420
one hour before our sleep.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:53.770
We let our body sort of
detox from technology.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:57.560
Another thing that
you can try if you

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:02.210
are physically very,
very able, do not

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:06.230
eat cooked food at
least two to three hours

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:09.230
before you are going to sleep.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.990
If you are medically
able, physically able,

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:16.700
you have the capacity,
don't take cooked food.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.000
Give your biology time
to digest whatever

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.920
it is that we've already put.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:27.670
Give yourself the
power to sort of focus

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:32.260
in rebuilding yourself,
rather than digesting whatever

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.580
has been put inside you.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:41.450
And finally, 10 minutes
before you go to sleep,

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:44.390
it is a very wonderful
exercise that I want

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:48.150
you to do that will help you.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:52.636
This, we call it
the golden book.

00:50:52.636 --> 00:50:57.960
The golden book is we
sort of make a journal,

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.940
and in that journal, we write
three things every night.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:08.190
One is, what is it
that I want from life?

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.900
And this is a contemplation.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:14.550
You don't have to just write
Maserati or Lamborghini.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:16.450
Just think.

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:20.990
You don't have to write the
lyrics of Desiigner's "Panda,"

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.750
another song my friend
had made me listen to.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.810
Very nice.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:31.890
We have to think, what
is it we want from life?

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:39.640
Second, what will be get
it, if we get whatever

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.710
object that we are seeking?

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.140
What would be the
change in my life,

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.500
if I get whatever
it is that I am

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:52.070
seeking through my hard work?

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:55.700
For example, even if you
are seeking a Maserati

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.980
from your life, the
next thing that you

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.350
must write in that
book is, what is

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:05.870
it that I will get if I have a
Maserati sitting in my garage?

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.060
And the final thing
that you must write

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:15.790
is, what is the price
I am willing to pay?

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.700
And by the price I'm
willing to pay, what is

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.430
the hard work that I will do?

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:25.960
How many hours I will put
on achieving that goal?

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.450
You know, you're sort
of making a ledger.

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:31.220
I will repeat,
the first thing we

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.440
will write in that
book, what it is

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.980
that you want from your life.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:40.910
The second is, what will you
get, if you have achieved?

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:47.290
And finally, what is the
price you're going to pay?

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.080
And I want you to contemplate
before you write it.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.880
Let there be no stimulus at
that time, no TV, no radio, no

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.650
whatever it is that you
consider a stimulus.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.890
And for five minutes, just
think, contemplate, and write.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:05.190
And this you must do
every night, because you

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:08.530
will find as your
consciousness changes,

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:11.860
as your incidences
in life changes,

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.280
as your growth changes,
even the things that you

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:22.330
are seeking from life may change
from a Monday to a Friday.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:23.400
So you contemplate.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.320
You write.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:31.370
Then you shut that book, and
you put it next to your bed.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:36.210
And then comes the second
form of meditation,

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:39.340
which will help us in our sleep.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:45.320
And this is called sort of
like a relaxing meditation.

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.500
And how you will do that, you
will just close your eyes.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.550
Let us try.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:51.300
Close your eyes.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:57.640
You will try to sit
straight, and if you are not

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:02.560
able to sit straight, you will
just relaxingly lie down so

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.660
that you are straight.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.055
No need to lie down here.

00:54:06.055 --> 00:54:07.360
This is for the nighttime.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:15.850
And then, you will
start breathing.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:23.900
But your breathing will be
like dolphin, each breath

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:30.800
helping you connect to that
happy place that is within you.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.750
And there is a
physical difference

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:36.960
that I want you to
bring in yourself when

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:41.060
you are breathing.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:46.680
The first is I want your
breath to be deep, as

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.930
deep as your breath can be.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:53.130
The second is I want your
breath to be continuous.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:55:00.139
Let there be no difference
and no space between inhaling

00:55:00.139 --> 00:55:00.680
and exhaling.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.310
And the third and the
most important thing--

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:13.780
try to listen to the sound
of your breath, deep breath,

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.860
continuous breath, and just
little bit loud breath.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:21.952
Try.

00:55:21.952 --> 00:55:22.873
Inhale.

00:55:22.873 --> 00:55:27.803
[INHALING AND EXHALING DEEPLY]

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:49.830
Continue.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.200
And as I said, just
these three things

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.630
are most important-- deep
breath, continuous breath,

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:02.490
and just listen to the
sound of your breath.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.716
Try to close your
eyes, and just breathe.

00:56:05.716 --> 00:56:06.890
It's very simple.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.240
But trust me.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:15.130
It is the simplest things in
life that matter the most.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.740
These are the things we
may take for granted,

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:26.360
but something as simple as the
sunlight is the most important

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.340
in our living.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.510
The same is with the breath.

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:34.850
Just breathe, and
expand, and contract.

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:39.830
Imagine yourself like a
balloon, a big balloon.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:44.470
And you are expanding
and contracting.

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:51.010
Deep breath, continuous breath,
and the sound of the breath.

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:57.520
And at the same time,
create another intention,

00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:02.350
as if when you are breathing,
you are not breathing just air.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:07.155
You are breathing energy, as
if air in itself is energy.

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.420
And you are inhaling
the energy, and you

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.195
are exhaling the energy.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:23.960
Bring one more intention that
as you are becoming aware of air

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:30.620
as energy, how does your mind
perceive the concept of energy?

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.660
Is it like electricity?

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.190
Is it like air?

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.960
Is it like water?

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.400
Is it a fluid?

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.830
Is it an object?

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:42.610
Whatever it is, let
yourself be filled,

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.345
and let yourself be empty.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.820
Be aware of your
thoughts at this time.

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.450
Be aware of all your
feelings and perceptions.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:58:00.580
Be aware of all
your five senses.

00:58:04.024 --> 00:58:08.750
And let your breath
now be slower.

00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:14.449
But as I said, deep, continuous,
and the sound of your breath.

00:58:51.873 --> 00:58:52.373
Relax.

00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:07.287
Slowly, open your eyes,
and once again, look at me.

00:59:07.287 --> 00:59:08.120
How are you feeling?

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:11.170
See?

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:12.550
Relaxed.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:13.480
So very nice.

00:59:16.412 --> 00:59:18.120
And the third thing
that I want you to do

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:25.680
is when you wake up,
the first thing when

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:35.460
you wake up, go into the sun, in
front of a window, if you have

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:41.040
grass, very nice, if you have
a penthouse, awesome, anywhere

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:46.510
where you can be under the
sky, and you can be in the sun,

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:49.870
or if your feet can
be on the grass.

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:53.440
It's very, very important
that we expose ourselves

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.130
to nature a little bit.

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.410
I have seen that when I'm
talking about meditation,

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:08.260
and I'm making people
meditate on hard wooden chairs

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:16.690
in a nice AC hall, then
it is a bit difficult.

01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:21.000
And a few weeks ago,
I was in Austria,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.660
and we were in the Alps, in the
nice mountains, on the grass.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.660
And I found it
was so very easier

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.760
for me to make people meditate.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.520
But I'm not saying
that's always--

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.980
in Alps, only that meditation
can be done, or in Himalayas.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.640
The thing was the nature.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.560
And the nature sort of--

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.850
I don't know what it does.

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:58.340
It gives you a form of
grounding, so to speak,

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:05.140
or a form of connection, which
is a very beautiful experience,

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:09.118
because imagine if we start
to think ourselves as atoms.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:16.760
One is, we are human body.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.530
Human body can be male, female.

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:20.540
Human body can be
Indian, American.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.710
Human body can be I don't
know, so many things.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.270
But then you'll
start to go within.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:31.420
You start to think of
the human body as cells.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.790
Now, the thing with the cells
is that a cell can be healthy.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.390
A cell can be sick--

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.560
so many differences,
so many variations.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:45.470
But when suddenly, you
start to meditating,

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:49.300
you will start observing
after a certain point,

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.710
something happens.

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:52.480
Some feeling comes
on the surface,

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.260
and you start to perceive
the human body as atoms,

01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.240
as vibration, as frequency.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.010
And the most
beautiful part of this

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:05.970
is not that it is a very
holistic experience.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.040
The most beautiful
part of this is

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.030
it is the oneness, because
at that vibration that you

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:13.980
are feeling, there is no man.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.000
There is no woman.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.090
There is no health.

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:17.370
There is no sickness.

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.230
That is just a vibration.

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:23.220
There is a sense of peace,
and you are in the grass,

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.660
and you can feel that light, and
it is such a creative feeling

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:32.430
that I am feeling as if I
am absorbed in that setting,

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.150
in that environment.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:39.890
And I feel very powerful,
because at that certain point,

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:45.660
it is only that feeling,
and there is no restriction.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.560
And you must have felt this
feeling somewhere at some point

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.750
of your life, and
you were completely

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.420
part of whatever it
was that was happening.

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.900
And it was such a
feeling of high.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.820
Maybe when your project
sort of shot into the sky,

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.150
or maybe when a surprise
party was given.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:09.210
Or maybe there was
this excellent ending

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:11.820
to this excellent movie
that you had seen,

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:18.240
or maybe the first time when you
fell in love, when time stops

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.090
still, and there is nobody.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.260
There is no cell.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.816
There is just the
energy, the frequency.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.210
And I want you to
think right now.

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:33.130
When was the last
time that you had

01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:36.560
felt something so very awesome?

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.930
And what I want you to do early
morning or whatever or morning

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:43.000
or whatever afternoon
or evening you get up--

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:43.840
I don't know.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.650
Not judging.

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:48.920
Your day starts when you get up.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:54.830
The moment you get up, the first
five minutes or 10 minutes,

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.350
just give to yourself.

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.810
Go in this nice setting.

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:01.600
If not, you are in an apartment.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.170
Make a few [INAUDIBLE] trees.

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:10.910
I don't know what, just so that
you are near some greenery.

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:15.410
And you are sitting, and once
again, what you are going to do

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:19.190
is you are going to close
your eyes, just like you're

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:20.875
going to do right now.

01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:22.250
And you're going
to sit straight.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:24.090
Now, you will sit straight.

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:28.320
Both your hands will
be on your knees,

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.190
and your eyes will be
closed-- very important,

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:34.320
because the moment
you close your eyes,

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.870
you become more aware of what
is happening inside of you.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.690
And the moment your
eyes are closed,

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:49.180
you will take your awareness
to the feeling of the most

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:53.080
happiness that you have
ever had in your life.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.780
I'm not telling the situation.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:04.150
But you may use the situation
to connect to that feeling, when

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:12.110
you were feeling very happy,
as if you were peacefully high,

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:17.730
when you were in that state
of ecstasy, achievement,

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:20.960
when you were triumphant.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.417
Not the situation-- be
aware of the feeling.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.260
And when you are
in that feeling,

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.866
just bring a simple intention.

01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:43.802
I am good.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.605
I am good.

01:05:51.405 --> 01:05:52.355
I am good.

01:05:55.690 --> 01:06:02.540
And I thank myself for all
that I'm going to achieve.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.460
Just a very simple thought--

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.280
I am good.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:10.910
I am good.

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:21.120
And I thank myself for all that
I am going to achieve today.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.530
And once again,
your breath is going

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:30.155
to be very deep,
continuous, and loud.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:37.260
Your breath so deep that you
are breathing until the time you

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.680
cannot inhale, and you are
exhaling to the point you

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.220
cannot exhale, so continuous
that there is not even

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:51.510
a millisecond of gap between
the inhalation and exhalation,

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:55.500
and so loud that you should
be able to hear the sound

01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:00.930
of your breath as it goes
in and as it comes out.

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:05.750
Feel the breath on your
nostrils, through the nose,

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:10.580
through the windpipe going
in, and feel it as you exhale,

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:15.400
coming out through
the nose to your lips.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.960
And slowly, being lost.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.270
In just five minutes of
being completely aware

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:28.347
of your breath
and your thoughts,

01:07:28.347 --> 01:07:35.350
your thoughts may rise up and
down like waves on the ocean.

01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:38.190
But it is all right.

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.460
Just witness, and just breathe.

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:54.080
Now, increase the intensity of
your breath a little bit more.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.110
Just like in the nighttime,
you are letting your breath

01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:58.850
relax more and more.

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:03.530
Now, you will increase
the intensity little

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:04.940
by every minute--

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:12.020
10%, 20%, and by intensity, I
mean the depth of the breath

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.400
and the speed of the breath.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.520
Let it be more than before.

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.850
Continue.

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:45.960
Excellent.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.929
Now, at least 30 times more
powerful than what it was.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:10.819
The speed to whatever it
is that is comfortable,

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:15.410
the strength to whatever
it is that is comfortable,

01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:20.540
and a simple thought that I
am grateful to myself for all

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.460
that I'm going to achieve.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.210
Excellent.

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:44.569
Relax.

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:47.510
Open your eyes.

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:49.840
Smile.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.460
Try smiling.

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.560
Smiling is nice.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.730
Yes.

01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:56.380
How are you feeling?

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.480
Say, I'm feeling very good.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.930
Saying that I'm feeling
good is half the battle won.

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:04.720
How are you feeling?

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.760
Please say it.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.930
Let me hear you.

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:13.390
Yes, I am feeling good, and
I thank myself for all the

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:18.660
better that I am
going to achieve.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.174
Finally, in the end,
what I would like to say

01:10:21.174 --> 01:10:26.987
is we are living a
life of patterns.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:36.070
And when we live our
life, we can either

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:42.172
reinforce our old patterns,
or we can create new patterns.

01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:53.610
Living a life, as I said, of
not being aware of the goal

01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:58.320
and being away from
peace and relaxation

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:03.900
reinforces the previous patterns
that we make in our life.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.710
And the pattern can be anything.

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:11.580
I cannot love the
way I used to love.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:15.150
I was more motivated
when I was younger.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.370
I do not know--

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:21.480
whatever pattern
that we have made.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:25.770
And through our choices and
our decisions and our actions,

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:27.750
you can only do
things in your life.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.930
Trust me, there is nothing else.

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:34.590
One is we can
reinforce the patterns,

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:39.090
or we have the power
to start creating what?

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:39.735
New patterns.

01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:46.330
Of course, I can do
push-ups, but if I

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:48.300
don't do push-ups,
then every day,

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.880
I am reinforcing
the pattern of what?

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.910
That I can't do or cannot--

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.270
please mind my English.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.250
It is not my first language.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:59.501
I cannot do push-ups.

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:06.490
The second thing that I can do--
start doing one push-up today

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:11.481
so that tomorrow, I can
create a new pattern.

01:12:11.481 --> 01:12:11.980
Why?

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:14.020
Because my body
is very adaptable.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.400
My body is very
beautiful, and my body

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.905
is very sensitive to growth.

01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:29.800
And if I choose
to reinvent, then

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.670
I have the power
and the capacity

01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:38.440
to upgrade my inner software
in such a fantastic manner

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.610
that every day, I am
creating new patterns

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:44.630
in which to live my life.

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:48.020
But these patterns are
not the numbing patterns,

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:52.300
but the relaxing and
the peaceful patterns.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.530
And the beginning
is, the start is

01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:56.230
the three things that I said.

01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:59.350
The first thing-- one are
before you go to sleep,

01:12:59.350 --> 01:13:01.020
no electronics.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:01.620
Let's start.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.700
Let's see what happens.

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.030
15 minutes before
you go to sleep,

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:12.110
take out your golden
book, per se, and write.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:13.340
What is it I want?

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:15.680
Why do I want it?

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.250
What will I get, if I get it?

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:23.460
And what is the price
I'm going to pay?

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.700
Five minutes before
I go to sleep,

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.710
I just relax, and
I just contemplate,

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:31.110
and I just connect
with my breath,

01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:34.140
and my breath, the three
most important things--

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:39.030
deep, continuous, and little bit
so that your breath is acting

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:41.042
like white noise for yourself.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:51.530
And finally, when you get up,
take out the time to go out,

01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:58.860
and at least five, 10 minutes,
again, this breath, awareness

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:03.750
of this breath, awareness of the
thought, and the contemplation,

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:07.500
and at the same time, I am good.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:12.085
And I thank myself for all
the time going to achieve.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.140
Why?

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:20.930
Because you see our
bodies are so very simple.

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:25.650
And final experiment on
how simple our body is--

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:32.680
my friend, Jay,
took me to a place--

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.748
I don't know where--

01:14:34.748 --> 01:14:39.460
where they give you two
cookies, vegan cookies.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.180
And they put very nice ice
cream in between the cookie.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.190
It is the most
fantastic alliance

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.920
I have ever seen since
the sun and the moon.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.950
I never had thought-- have
you ever eaten cookie and ice

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:53.150
cream?

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:53.810
Yes or no?

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:54.480
All of you?

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:54.980
No.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.050
If you haven't, what have
you done with your life?

01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:01.890
So what I want you to do is
imagine that cookie and ice

01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:06.390
cream of your most favorite
cookie that you have ever eaten

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:09.850
and the most favorite ice cream
that you have ever imagined,

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:13.720
and put it in front of you.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.810
And maybe the cookies
are hot and gooey,

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:18.530
fresh out of the oven.

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:20.530
And the ice cream is cold.

01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:23.260
And both of them are
sort of together,

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.540
and you put them in your mouth.

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.340
And when you put
them in your mouth,

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.950
you are biting into the
cookie, and the cookie

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:32.110
is mixing with the ice cream.

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:36.550
And it slowly starts to
swirl and merge into one,

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:39.770
and then you inhale
and take it inside.

01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:44.700
And then-- forget about then.

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.800
What I want to ask you--

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.240
how many people's mouths
start to water when I explain

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.260
the cookie and the ice cream?

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:57.660
Was there a little bit
of saliva in your mouth?

01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:58.940
Yes or no?

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.030
If yes, you are human.

01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:05.100
If not, I don't know
which planet you are from.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:09.000
But imagine this is how simple
and beautiful our mind is.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.332
There is no cookie and ice
cream, at least not here,

01:16:11.332 --> 01:16:13.170
not right now.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:14.910
I am not that kind
of a monk, who

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:18.150
will do like this and
cookie and ice cream.

01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:21.810
And your mind knows there is
no cookie and ice cream yet.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.841
Your mind salivates as
if it is about to come.

01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:28.280
Yes or no?

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.450
Tell me, my dear, reciprocate.

01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:34.610
Yes or no?

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:41.390
So if your mind can drool to an
imaginary cookie and ice cream,

01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:45.050
then I want you to imagine
how many of your reactions

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:49.730
are to imaginary stimuluses
or stimulants or--

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:50.400
I don't know.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.320
You get it.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:59.980
And that is why if
our reactions are

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:05.900
going to be so many
imaginary stimulants,

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:10.710
then why not somewhere
I start to tell myself

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:17.080
that I thank myself for all
that I am going to achieve?

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.760
Maybe that peace will give
me the power to work hard,

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.800
and maybe, in
time, truly achieve

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.840
whatever it is I am capable of.

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:35.210
And the final thing
that I can request

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:41.910
to you is one of the
most powerful tools

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:45.070
is the most active
form of meditation

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:48.510
and sometimes the toughest.

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:51.372
Do I have permission
from you to share?

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:57.130
This is the secret ingredient.

01:17:57.130 --> 01:18:01.020
This is the chemical
X used by professor

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.590
to make Power Puff Girls.

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:08.200
This is the most important Kung
Fu Panda dragon scroll secret

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.360
that I'm about to tell you.

01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:13.670
And the secret is--

01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:14.900
in fact, it's not a secret.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:20.070
It's something that
sort of helps me,

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:25.190
may help you, a form
of active meditation.

01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:30.350
And the secret is I
want you to learn to--

01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:34.930
drum roll-- smile.

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:36.716
It's very beautiful.

01:18:36.716 --> 01:18:37.216
Try.

01:18:37.216 --> 01:18:37.716
Smile.

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.810
Try, please.

01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:43.580
Yes.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.781
All of you, smile.

01:18:46.781 --> 01:18:49.030
And how you will practice
this, the first thing you'll

01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:51.730
do when you go early
in the morning,

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:52.900
you will look in the mirror.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.570
And what you are going to
do is look at whatever face

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:57.970
you are seeing, and you
will smile at that person

01:18:57.970 --> 01:19:00.870
that you are awesome.

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:01.870
Can you do that?

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.040
I want you to try.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:03.540
Trust me.

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:06.000
It is the most
fantastic thing when

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.090
you are looking in the mirror
and not pulling in your stomach

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:12.390
and not thinking how I would
look if this would happen

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:16.080
or that would happen or if
I was fairer or I was darker

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.560
or if my hair was longer
or lesser, or I don't know.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.020
Just look at the person you
see in the mirror, and say,

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.243
you are awesome.

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:28.450
And then continue
to practice this.

01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:30.760
When you are driving,
somebody looks at you

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.460
while you are
driving, no need to--

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.500
try.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.790
Let's see what happens.

01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:38.680
Maybe that person smiles back.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.620
Maybe that person gives you
some universal gestures.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.610
How do I care?

01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:45.070
But I am not smiling
for that person.

01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:46.810
I am smiling,
because my brain is

01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:49.900
so simple that if I look
at imaginary cookie,

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.680
my brain drools.

01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:58.140
And if I give my brain a
conditioning to be happy,

01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.190
then trust me.

01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:02.610
My brain do not know it
is such a simple thing.

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:04.730
My biology don't know.

01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:09.760
It thinks the cookie is real,
and that will give me the power

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:15.700
to focus, to function in the
most appropriate and beautiful

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.530
manner.

01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:21.460
Maybe the easiest way to
break the desensitization,

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:25.000
and be in the moment
of where you are

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.490
is accepting that I am good.

01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:37.190
And finally, I thank myself for
all the time going to achieve.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:43.750
So I thank all of you,
and I smile at all of you.

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:47.190
And I hope you are
happy listening

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:50.770
to what I had to share.

01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:56.530
And I hope that all of you find
the real happiness, but most

01:20:56.530 --> 01:21:00.070
of all, the peace
and relaxation that

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:05.020
are the most beautiful
forms of human existence.

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:08.620
And I hope, and I
wish that all of you

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:13.030
feel the euphoria that
I was talking about--

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:17.170
maybe in your work, maybe
in your relationships,

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:21.820
maybe in whichever form
you wish to experience it,

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:27.500
because I believe we, humanity,
are a collective consciousness.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.300
And if all of us are
resonating at a high frequency,

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:34.930
then the whole planet is healed.

01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:38.170
And even if a part
of the body is sick,

01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:40.390
then the whole body
feels the pain.

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:44.560
In the same manner, even if
part of collective consciousness

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.070
is hurt or in pain,
then the whole planet

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:51.370
feels in some
manner or the other.

01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:54.040
And that is why I like to talk.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.130
I like to come all
the way from wherever

01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:01.660
to here, San Francisco, to
speak to the kind and good

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.570
and gentlemen and gentlewomen
that are sitting in front

01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:10.360
of me, because I
seek that one day

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.740
through our collective
efforts and endurance,

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:17.190
the whole collective
consciousness will

01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:21.410
be very, very good.

01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:23.100
So thank you.

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:26.480
I thank you, and I
thank the infinity that

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.510
resides amongst all of you.

01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:34.010
And I hope, and I pray,
and I bless that all of you

01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:36.155
achieve all that you seek.

01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:40.340
[INAUDIBLE]

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:44.290
[APPLAUSE]
