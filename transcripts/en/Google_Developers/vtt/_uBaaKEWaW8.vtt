LAKSHYA: Hi friends.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.160
I am Lakshya
Siyaramakrishnan, and I'm here

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.130
to walk you through my
journey with technology.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.750
You can follow me here on my G+
and Twitter handle so that we

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.970
can get in touch.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.340
Let me introduce myself to you.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720
Born in Mumbai, the city of
dreams, a native of Kerala,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.420
the place with the highest
literacy rate, a Tamil speaking

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.880
girl brought up in
Karnataka, the land

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.800
of sandlewood, scenic
beauty, and splendid people.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.350
I have been fortunate to
see many flavors of India.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.180
And you get to see
our diversity here.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.090
I am a woman tech maker, a
design engineer by profession,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.350
a unicorn and
connector by passion.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.060
I'll tell you why I
call myself a unicorn,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.770
but you'll have to wait
for me to get there.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.350
I call myself a connector.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.620
You want to know why?

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.060
That's because I love
connecting to people around me.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.010
Connectors bring about
change through people.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.930
And that's exactly what
I am here to do today.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.300
I am here to bring about
change through you.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.230
I am here to bring about change
through woman tech makers.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.940
I want you and me to be
instrumental in bringing

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.080
about this change.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.410
So let's do this together.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.730
Let's close our
eyes for a moment.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.450
Can we do that together please?

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.470
Imagine an engineer.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.420
Have you done that?

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
How many of us visualized
a man coding on his laptop?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.040
Many of us would have
done that, for sure.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700
Or did you think of a woman?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Or even better, is it you?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.470
How many of us think
of ourselves when we

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.290
have to visualize an engineer?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.630
Hardly a few.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.490
And this is exactly
where the problem lies.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.190
One of the biggest
problems is that we

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.740
doubt our own capabilities.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.620
Technology is touching our
lives right from our cradles

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.170
to our graves, and having
a woman's perspective

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.520
in prototyping, designing,
and implementing

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.660
is equally important.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.250
Statistics say that
if a man and a woman

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.840
are given an unknown
task, a man is 90%--

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.460
I repeat, 90%
confident of committing

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.130
to do it, whereas
a woman instantly

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.540
doubts her capabilities.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.770
Why is there this mismatch?

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.460
Why are we losing out on
seizing the opportunity?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.730
Not many things that happen
in your childhood stays

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.480
imprinted in your minds a
few decades down the lane.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.340
But I clearly remember
the first time

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.610
I got associated
with technology.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.850
I had to prepare for my computer
science lab best way back

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.320
in school when I was around
six, seven years old,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.930
and we did not have
a computer at home.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.620
My father accompanied
me to a cyber cafe

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.770
quite some distance away for
me to practice my lessons

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.030
for the exam.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.000
And when I went there,
I saw this lady typing

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.660
onto this machine at
quite an amazing speed.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.620
I was so amazed by
the typing speed

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.740
that I told my father about it.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.050
My father was happy at my awe
and said, in a few years time,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.160
you'll be able to
do it much faster.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.260
A few months later, he
got me a computer at

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.610
home so that I'd get
there soon enough.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.890
Reaching out for what we
don't have and getting it

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.470
is always a good start.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.030
At that age, it
was amazing for me

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.040
to see a machine being
able to do so many things.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.940
Once I got the
computer at home, I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.010
started exploring and
experimenting new things on it.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.340
Creating a PowerPoint
presentation

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.820
gave me a lot of satisfaction.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.650
I remember the time when my
father took me to his office

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.630
one day and allowed
me to use his system,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.830
and I came up with this
beautiful PowerPoint

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.200
presentation and handed
it over to his boss.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.240
And for a kid of that
age, it was a real sense

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.790
of accomplishment to
be patted on your back

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.519
by your dad's boss.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.750
User interface was always
dear to me, and it still is.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.610
I love designing web
pages at my leisure

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.250
on the themes of my choice.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.170
So listen to me when I
tell you, do what you love,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.980
and you would love what you do.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.940
It's very essential that we look
to build of any strong support

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.610
system around ourselves
to get to the top.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.050
My teachers and my parents
always supported me.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.760
The teachers always
pushed me to achieve more.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.350
They used to tell me that I
have to be better than the best

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.420
to shine in life, to
make a mark in life.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.430
And similar scenes
were seen at home.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.200
If I come back home with
a 99 in math-- trust me,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.340
this has happened two
or three times at home--

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.600
my mother would first ask me
where I lost that one mark,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.590
and then give me credit
for the 99 that I've got.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.310
And that zeal to score a
perfect 100 in as many places as

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.620
possible really helped me.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.090
This even got me the best
student award at school.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.940
So that is why I tell
you it's so essential

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.880
to build a strong support
system for ourselves.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.410
At no point in this journey
did I visualize myself

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.645
as an engineer.

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:40.710
I did not know about a career
called software engineering.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.670
I knew only of two careers--
a doctor and a teacher,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.830
and I always wanted
to be a doctor.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.920
So as I was getting out
of school at crossroads

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.510
deciding career paths,
a teacher of mine

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.450
suggested that I
take up engineering.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.620
She knew how much I
loved math and science,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.370
and life often throws
us into situations

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.690
where we need to make a choice.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.180
I made the choice.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.210
I said, I want to
be an engineer,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.490
and I followed my heart.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.100
I got into one of the
premier engineering colleges

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.500
in Karnataka and
learned my lessons well.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.730
And over this journey of four
years, the passion in the field

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.280
further strengthened.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.420
I wanted to try out new things.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.120
And as I completed my four years
of engineering, I realized,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.610
hey, four years have
passed, and I've not

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.480
done anything hands on.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.780
I know my theory well, but it's
time to put this into practice.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.420
At that time, I decided
that pursuing a masters

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.300
would be the best thing to do.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.010
Again, following your heart.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.820
I applied to
universities across India

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.770
and go into one,
where life turned out

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.210
to be better than
I thought it would.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.430
I got the best
hands-on experience

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.480
with some great faculty, some
great people, good projects,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.080
and above all, great learning.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.310
We always say we hardly
have women in technology.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.920
But let me give you
a contradiction.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.660
We were one of the very few
masters of technology batches,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.725
probably in the country,
to have more numbers

00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:21.330
of girls than guys in a class.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.280
Girls were at a 51 to 49 ratio.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.800
But then, what goes wrong?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.460
The girls are really good.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.900
They attend all their classes,
dutifully write down notes,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.370
get great grades.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.760
But when it comes to
going above and beyond,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.390
when it comes to exploring
and experimenting,

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.530
we often take a backseat.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.920
I remember a time
when I had to attend

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.260
a hackathon outside college.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.690
A few of my male friends
agreed to accompany me,

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.420
but not a single
girl put her hand up.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.989
So when I told my mother
about this, she was like,

00:07:58.989 --> 00:08:01.030
what are you going to do
with all the guys there?

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.680
Fortunately, this
did not put me off,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.490
and I continued
attending these events.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.460
So let me ask you
that today, we have

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.260
to look to alter this phenomenon
to get more women sitting

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.960
at the table.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.820
Right from the very
beginning, I was

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.500
someone who seized
every opportunity,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.990
and that's the way I
had been brought up.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.600
Remember I told you
about the support system?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.370
This was where I was getting to.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.230
My parents always
encouraged me to take up

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.539
any activity that came
my way, and the concept

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.390
of participation was far
more important than winning.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.880
I was fortunate to
be a part of the YMCA

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.780
Mumbai for a few weeks.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.660
I had been the head girl
and the valedictorian way

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.980
back in school.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.660
I was part of the
student's activity council

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.790
and the Google student
club at my master's degree.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.730
I've done a lot of computing
and event management

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.020
in school, colleges, and
even at my workplace.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.580
They call me an energizer
in my workplace.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.050
Oh, that reminds me,
I have to tell you

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.980
why I am called the unicorn.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.950
Time to unravel
that mystery now.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.400
No, it's not the same
animal that we know about.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.180
I'm a part of the GDG
BlrDroid community

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.840
and help them
organize events there.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.000
Again, I just love doing this,
and I went on to do that.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So they call me a unicorn.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.730
I don't know why,
but I know what's

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.730
common between me
and the unicorn.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.780
We both follow what we
love doing the most.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.630
And just like how I got
inspired by being a unicorn,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.270
I want to take you all there,
ensuring that we are all

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.780
following our passions.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.350
So that was about me.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.100
But I am here for
a bigger purpose,

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.330
to help contribute
to the community

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.850
and inspire you to do the same.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.870
I know there are many
classes like mine

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.160
with more numbers of girls than
boys in a professional course.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.920
But it's time we make an impact.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.860
It's time that we look
to bridge this confidence

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.580
gap by believing in
ourselves, by taking risks,

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.670
by doing what we love the most.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.780
I imagine a perfect
world where there

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.820
are equal number of men
and women sitting a table,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.200
brainstorming together,
innovating and inventing

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.380
together, and most importantly,
leading a group of people

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.390
by inspiring them.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.130
There will be many people
throwing stones at you,

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.060
but let's learn to
silence critics and say,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.170
I can do much better
than this, and look

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.090
to convert these
stones into milestones.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.590
I'm sure we'll be reaching
places by doing this.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.880
We'll figure out how to take
this to a larger extent.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.560
But for now, let's make
a promise to ourselves.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.100
Let's look to attend all
developer events that

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.210
are happening across the city,
learn from them, teach a few,

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.310
and contribute back
to the community.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.320
Today, if everyone
watching this video

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.290
works towards
keeping this promise,

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.510
I think we will get to hear
more women voices out there.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:19.210
We will get to see more women on
the team, sitting at the table.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.340
Remember the time
when we were little

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.950
and we had no baggage
on our shoulders?

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.030
When we did what
we loved the most?

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.900
When we would connect to
as many people as possible,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.130
just to have a game together?

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.630
Let's get back to
that mode again.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.680
Let's stop being
at the side lines.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.760
Let's change the
rules of the game.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.870
Be heard.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.100
Be seen.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.040
Be at the table.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.170
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.850
Thank you.
