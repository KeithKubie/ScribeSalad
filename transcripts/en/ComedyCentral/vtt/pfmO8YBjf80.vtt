(pages turning)
(sleigh bells ringing)

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.971
(men groaning)

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.306
- Is it in?

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.741
- I don't think it's in yet.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.077
(foreboding drum beats)

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.315
- Let's do this.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.484
Remember what we talked about.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:21.654
You read the book, you have
an opinion, and it's valid.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.690
- Okay.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.925 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Don't be nervous!
- I'm not!

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.897
- We'll come for you
later, we'll cuddle.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.165
- (crying) I don't wanna--

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.434
- I've got five of
my good guys here.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.002
We'll be together soon, okay?

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.406
- No, I don't wanna.
Where are you going?

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.910
- Alright, welcome to
our book club meeting!

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.245
(applause)

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.746
Let's discuss

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.716
When Love Dies: How to
Save a Hopeless Marriage.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.718 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh man, this puppy
got me pumped up.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.119
I love the intrigue.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.087
- Nonstop thrilling.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.388
- I thought it should be called

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.123
When I Loved This
Book, I Loved It.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.727 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Hey, well look at
this guy's small hands!

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.962
(laughter)

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:08.468 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Hey, what character did
you guys most identify with?

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.372
- This is a nonfiction book.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.640
- Adam, you're new here,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.842
you're probably gonna be
wrong here all the time.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.712
Brian, what character did
you identify with the most?

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.347
- Train man.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.983
- I don't think there's
a train man in there.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.218
- Train man was not in there.

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.419
- But there was a part of the,

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.620
the nervous part
of the book, right?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.222
- Yeah, but that's
not really, well yes.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.523
- Yeah, no, train man.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:31.991
- Train man was my
favorite character.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:32.926
- Train man!

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.461
- Actually that is right.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.862
- There was the waterfall
we all remember that part,

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.231 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then it, when it
splits, it's like who was--

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.499
- Water, water!

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.800
- Train man lying on
the ground and he say,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.168
he asked himself, "Is
this when love dies?"

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.002
- Train man!

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.003
- "Not on my watch!"

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:44.971
The book should have been called

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.172
The Adventures of Train Man.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.341
That's just bad editing.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.342
- Train man?

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.512
Did you guys even read the book?

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.346
- What?

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.180
- What?

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.349
- Is this, is this a words?

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:57.317 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Did you guys
even read the book?

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.952
- What?

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.721
Can you, can we even hear
what this guy is saying?

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.290
It's like this guy is
talking into a napkin.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.293
- Let me please clarify
Mr. Adam's confusion here

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:12.265 align:start size:97% position:3%
by reading an all-too-relevant
excerpt from the book.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.168
I crawled out of bed to
check on our small sons,

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.202
Matthew and Trevin.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.470
- Trevin?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.172
- Are you right down
the hallway at home,

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.775
or are you on a play
date with train man?

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.410
- Train man!

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.079
You were right, oh my god.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.080
- Train man.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.682
(Brian claps)

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.951 align:start position:0%
- I'm trying to participate
here but that guy's hitting me,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.486
this guy keeps rubbing me.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.421
- Come on, you can't take
a slight little roasting?

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.656
- I'm excited to find people

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.358
that are as passionate
about books as I am.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.294 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe I just don't understand
them the way you guys do.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:42.495
I'll see you guys later.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.763
- Where are you going?

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.965
- Someplace where
people read books.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.635
(playful music)

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.809 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Brian, read a
quote from train man.

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.228
(screams)

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.829
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.731
(man crying)

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.802
You're fine, it's okay, he's
just going to the park to play.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.405
(woman crying)

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.814 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Dammit, I would
like to invite you all

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:36.816
to my child-dog funeral.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:41.221 align:start size:84% position:16%
He's dead so it should
be happening now.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.124
- Lovely sweater.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank you, this
one's belongs to me.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.894
(pages turning)

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.397
(vigorous classical music)
