00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.870
Why Blueprints are Blue

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.180
Making copies of architectural drawings hasn’t
always been the easiest thing in the world

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.180
to do.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.840
For the majority of human history, the most
economical solution was simply to have someone

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.290
make a tracing of the original plans.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.520
In the mid-nineteenth century, the process
abruptly became much quicker and easier thanks

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.500
to famed polymath Sir John Herschel.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.030
In 1842, Herschel invented a method to easily
copy drawings using potassium ferrocyanide

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.400
and ammonium iron citrate.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.350
The exact method, called cyanotype, is performed
as follows.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.920
First, you take a drawing of the plans done
on relatively translucent tracing paper or

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.370
cloth and place it on top of and attach it
to paper (or sometimes linen, Mylar, etc.)

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.940
that has been previously soaked in a mixture
of the aforementioned two chemicals, then

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.940
dried.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.449
Next, you expose the papers to a bright ultra-violet
light source, such as the Sun, for several

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.449
minutes.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.090
The result is that the paper soaked in the
chemicals ends up turning blue as the chemicals

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.819
react to the light and form a compound called
blue ferric ferrocyanide, also known as “Prussian

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:16.819
Blue.”

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.130
This wouldn’t be very helpful for making
a copy of a document except for the fact that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.049
where the light cannot penetrate the translucent
paper, namely where the drawing marks are,

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.719
the coated paper remains the original color
of the paper, usually white, effectively making

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.850
a nice copy.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.969
You might see a potential problem here in
that you then can’t expose the un-blued

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.469
bits to any bright light source at first,
but this problem is easily solved by simply

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.229
washing the chemicals off, then allowing the
paper to dry.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.319
At this point, the copy is complete.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.749
Within a few decades of the discovery of this
method of copying (as well as other blue-printing

00:01:53.749 --> 00:02:00.310
methods such as one developed by Alphonse
Louis Poitevin in 1861 using ferro-gallate),

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.119
the price dropped to about one-tenth the cost
of having someone simply trace the original

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.270
plans, helping the popularity of blueprints
explode.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.540
In the mid-twentieth century, copying methods
such as as diazo prints, and then later xerographic

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.930
prints, finally supplanted blueprints.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.561
Much more recently, simply sticking with digital
versions of plans has become popular, with

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:26.880
these having the advantage of being easy to
modify and distribute as needed during the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.340
construction process.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.260
Despite the technological changes and the
fact that these plans usually aren’t on

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.920
blue paper anymore, in popular vernacular
the term “blueprints” has stuck around

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:47.450
anyways.
