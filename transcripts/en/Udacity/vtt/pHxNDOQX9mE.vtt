00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
Today, we're going to talk about resources, activities, and costs, and congratulations,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.450
this is your last lecture.  By now, you're intimately familiar with the business model canvass.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.030
We've talked about value props, customer segments, channels, customer relationships,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.590
revenue streams.  We jumped ahead and talked about partners, and right now, we're going to talk

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:28.030
about key resources. And for key resources, the real question is what are your most important assets

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.720
to make your business model happen?  Let see what are some most important assets?

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.270
What are the most important things that are required to make your business model work?

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.540
For every startup, the thing you're always worried about is money, finance.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.730
How do you get the company started?  Can you do that on your credit cards?  Can you line a credit

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.090
to a small business loan or then physical resources.  You need a manufacturing line.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.610
You need machines.  You need cars.  You need vehicles.  And, how about intellectual property?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.940
Or pets?  Critical to defending your position or is it customerless?  Or should people?

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.900
And then that kind of get us into what are the key human resources you need to make this happen?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.790
Is it the world's best scientists?  Or programmers?  Or engineers?  Is there a specific area in the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.880
country that has a concentration of them.  And, so when you think about resources some of these

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.760
are just kind of natural.  All you have will hire a bunch of engineers and we'll have a building, etc.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.670
But actually, you could think about the strategic way.  She is impossible to have headquarters in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.740
one place like Silicon Valley, but great engineers back in our country somewhere in Finland or

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.380
Chile or Russia or these are physical manufacturing plant that is located in the United States or

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.180
do we need to put it in a place for lower cost manufacturer.  And, so all these resources are the

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.070
things that you really need to think through even though what they want they might not seem

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.520
important.  It just gets to be a bigger and bigger problem overtime.  If you have an actual approach

00:01:58.520 --> 99:59:59.000
to this dose of strategy at least giving it a couple of cycles when you start your company.
