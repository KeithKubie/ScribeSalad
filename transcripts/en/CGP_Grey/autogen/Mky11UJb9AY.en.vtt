00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.070
 The Lion Queen of the Animal Kingdom has added a legislature to the government. 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.790
 To let his citizens enjoy more democracy 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.730
 Every citizen has one vote and is divided into constituencies. Each constituency will elect a representative 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.370
 Come to the newly formed jungle council 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.570
 In order to understand how this system works, let’s look at a small colony with only two parties. 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.860
 Bison Party and Antler Rabbit Party 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.910
 This colony is divided into four constituencies. Candidate for the Rabbit Party in the first election 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.780
 Won two constituencies, and the candidates of the Niu Party won the remaining constituencies 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.770
 After a few election cycles, everything worked fine. Until the animal kingdom census enumerator came over and investigated 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.640
 And found that the population here has migrated and grown 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.260
 So in order to better reflect the population growth, a new seat has been added to the jungle council. 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.480
 This leads to the need to re-divide the boundaries of the constituency here. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.560
 This is a trouble. Redistributing the constituency is a major political problem 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.760
 To help them, the representative of the Jungle Council hired a weasel consultant. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.010
 To figure out how to divide the new boundary 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.350
 If the weasel turns the constituency into a rectangle, everything is fine, because of this, the jungle council 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.560
 The true situation of voters who can be as close as possible 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.330
 However, the weasel did not do this. Instead he told the Buffalo Party that he was willing to pay 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.460
 He can turn their weak majority into an overwhelming victory in the election. 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 If the Bison Party has an absolute majority in the jungle council, they will never hear those annoying antler rabbit parties. 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.220
 The obstruction of the proceedings, so the cattle party was happy to pay the money 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.170
 So how should the weasel fulfill his promise? The method is simple and frustrating: just put the voters of the rabbit party 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.280
 Concentrate on one constituency as much as possible, and spread the other voters to make the ox party 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.030
 Win a seat, don't let any voter change the party 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 What the Weasel and Buffalo Party do is called "Jerry's" (selection division) 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.700
 That is, consciously divide the constituency to make a profit for yourself. 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.210
 After several election cycles, the antler rabbit party that could not be selected and was not happy found the weasel 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.630
 And asked if he could manipulate the constituency to help the rabbit party instead of the ox party. 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.990
 Of course he can. By the same means, the weasel puts the voters of the cattle party 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.360
 They are concentrated in several constituencies and the rest are diluted to many places where the rabbit party supporters 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.170
 After the election, the rabbit party, although representing only a minority of the voters 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.860
 Now it has become the majority party of the jungle council. 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.820
 This is the terrible power of "Jerry": the same voter 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.200
 The weasel can let any party win the election. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.000
 I am so powerful! Unsurprisingly, the business of the weasels is getting bigger and bigger, and in the end all areas of the animal kingdom 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.190
 Unsurprisingly, the business of the weasels is getting bigger and bigger, and in the end all areas of the animal kingdom 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.300
 All paying money to ask him to engage in "Jerry's" in their constituency. 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.280
 As the number of customers increases, the weasel now uses a well-designed mathematical statistical model of voter voting behavior. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.890
 Test hundreds of constituency combinations on a computer to get the results he wants 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.850
 When the Queen of the Lions discovered the activity of the weasel, he drove him out of the kingdom. But demographer 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.610
 Remind her that due to population changes, the constituency still has to be re-divided 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.500
 So how do you decide this? 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.460
 The Queen of the Lions presented an obvious plan: all new constituencies must be divided 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.180
 Recognized by a bipartisan committee 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.770
 This seems like a good idea. After all, if there are divisions recognized by both parties. 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.820
 Finally, it must be fair to everyone. 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.280
 However, after several electoral cycles using this approach, the Lion Queen found her in the Jungle Parliament 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.450
 I can always see some old faces. These representatives almost never 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.790
 Lose election 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.000
 The interests of the original representatives are not the same as the interests of the citizens. 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.450
 The elections that citizens want are candidates who must find ways to earn their own votes. 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.840
 In such a close-knit election, every party has the same chance to win. 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.570
 However, the delegates do not want the elections that are evenly matched, they want to win the election 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.210
 That is, where the majority of their supporters are elected 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.810
 Since the delegates can decide the division by themselves, they will try their best 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.640
 Some insurance for the zoning 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.380
 Then the inter-party committee is not enough. Want to really solve "Jerry" 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.090
 There are three ways 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.120
 One is to establish a politically independent committee to divide the constituencies, and the committee members are all designated experts. 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.620
 Or judge 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.060
 The independent committee is better than the inter-party committee, but it is not very ideal. 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.150
 Because they usually put similar areas together, the result of the election is not competitive. 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.970
 And there are also these independent committees. 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.150
 Not as likely as they seem to be independent on the surface 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.660
 The second choice is to divide the selection by mathematical methods. In mathematics, there are many ways 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.800
 Can divide a region into a constituency of equal population 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.500
 One of the simplest examples is called "the shortest dividing line method". First find the voters. 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.900
 Divide into the shortest line of two equal parts, then repeat the process until all the constituencies are drawn 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.100
 This method is far better than the "independent" committee, but it is still possible 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.800
 It is not good to divide the constituency due to accidental luck. 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.400
 But by publishing the algorithm, all citizens can check and be convinced in the system. 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.180
 No intentional prejudice 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.830
 The last method is very surprising: hire the weasel and hug "Jerry" 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.030
 But this time, spending money to let him put the (selection of the district) in general, the election winners are as close as possible to the wishes of the voters. 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.200
 Although this method sounds annoying, it is the best way to avoid disproportionate representations. 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.800
 That is, the biggest disadvantage of "Jerry" 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.980
 However, thinking of these three solutions makes the Queen of Lions very angry. 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.420
 The first two are improved, but there is still the possibility of a lack of competition or a disproportionate election result. 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.280
 And the third method doesn't sound right: relying on "Jerry" to solve the problem of "Jerry" 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.660
 It feels so...very weird 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.320
 She now thought of the lessons she learned during the previous elections, and she realized these "Jerry" phenomena. 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.300
 In fact, it is only the appearance of a more fundamental problem. 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.460
 That is, each citizen has only one vote and only one candidate’s voting system is selected. 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.110
 There are many ways to solve "Jerry's" and restore the competitive nature of the election. 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.360
 To make her citizens happy, but want to do that, the Queen of Lions must 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.190
 Make some huge, fundamental changes to her democratic system 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.190
 To be continued...
