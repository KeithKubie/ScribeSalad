00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Instead of developing your own,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in many cases you can, of course, use somebody else's solver.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There are lots of ready-made software for that.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First of all, there is general mathematical software--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
application packages, which can do differential equations,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but which also can do lots of other stuff.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
First of all, MATLAB and its clones, such as Octave or SyLab,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Wolfram Alpha if you manage to formulate your problem in one line,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Mathematica, and tons of others.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Second, there is dedicated modeling and simulation software,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
such as Simulink, which comes with MATLAB, COMSOL, Multiphysics,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and Wolfram Alpha System Modeler, and PyDS Tool,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which is based on, as the name says, Python.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Then there are lots of code libraries that you can use to build your own application.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
One important library to mention here is scipy integrate--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
obviously for Python again.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
To create plausible motion for games, there are a number of physics engines.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Finally, there are cook books providing snippets of code to be reused or adapted.

00:01:03.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The most prominent one of these are the Numerical Recipes.
