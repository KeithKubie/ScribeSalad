these are scientists in particular being

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420
these are scientists in particular being
 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.680
these are scientists in particular being
a theoretical physicist we are what I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690
a theoretical physicist we are what I
 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.499
a theoretical physicist we are what I
like to call hopeless optimist now what

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
like to call hopeless optimist now what
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.740
like to call hopeless optimist now what
do I mean by this well when we look at

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
do I mean by this well when we look at
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.720
do I mean by this well when we look at
the world obviously there are many many

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
the world obviously there are many many
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.090
the world obviously there are many many
conditions of humanity that cause us to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
conditions of humanity that cause us to
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.009
conditions of humanity that cause us to
despair hunger poverty war bigotry and

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019
despair hunger poverty war bigotry and
 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.380
despair hunger poverty war bigotry and
so it would be easy to lose hope if you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
so it would be easy to lose hope if you
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.870
so it would be easy to lose hope if you
just look at these parts and of human

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
just look at these parts and of human
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.650
just look at these parts and of human
behavior on the other hand if you're a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
behavior on the other hand if you're a
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200
behavior on the other hand if you're a
theoretical physicist you're doing

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
theoretical physicist you're doing
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.200
theoretical physicist you're doing
something that you were likely if if

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
something that you were likely if if
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.580
something that you were likely if if
you're doing it it's at its most

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
you're doing it it's at its most
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.560
you're doing it it's at its most
fundamental level you're doing something

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
fundamental level you're doing something
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.030
fundamental level you're doing something
that most likely in your lifetime you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
that most likely in your lifetime you
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279
that most likely in your lifetime you
will never see a single fruit coming

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
will never see a single fruit coming
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.049
will never see a single fruit coming
from it and so you're creating ideas and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
from it and so you're creating ideas and
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029
from it and so you're creating ideas and
what I like to call the storehouse of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
what I like to call the storehouse of
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.360
what I like to call the storehouse of
human knowledge in order for these ideas

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
human knowledge in order for these ideas
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459
human knowledge in order for these ideas
to become a value however it will take

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
to become a value however it will take
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.220
to become a value however it will take
time it's a little bit like putting a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
time it's a little bit like putting a
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.439
time it's a little bit like putting a
note in a bottle and simply casting the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
note in a bottle and simply casting the
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.289
note in a bottle and simply casting the
bottle into the sea with the hope that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
bottle into the sea with the hope that
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.440
bottle into the sea with the hope that
someone will find this note and it will

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
someone will find this note and it will
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690
someone will find this note and it will
be of value to them that's what doing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
be of value to them that's what doing
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.170
be of value to them that's what doing
theoretical physics is like on one hand

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180
theoretical physics is like on one hand
 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.480
theoretical physics is like on one hand
so I understand that that's the life

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
so I understand that that's the life
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.020
so I understand that that's the life
I've chosen for myself it's a life where

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030
I've chosen for myself it's a life where
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.990
I've chosen for myself it's a life where
we get to think about the universe and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000
we get to think about the universe and
 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.230
we get to think about the universe and
it's a life where at the end of the day

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
it's a life where at the end of the day
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359
it's a life where at the end of the day
it's a it's a personal engagement with

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
it's a it's a personal engagement with
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.749
it's a it's a personal engagement with
the universe at a profound level on the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
the universe at a profound level on the
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.170
the universe at a profound level on the
other hand it's not something that that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
other hand it's not something that that
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.319
other hand it's not something that that
I think of as separating me from the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
I think of as separating me from the
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.469
I think of as separating me from the
rest of humanity because in fact the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
rest of humanity because in fact the
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.660
rest of humanity because in fact the
whole point of the exercise is to do

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
whole point of the exercise is to do
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.749
whole point of the exercise is to do
something valuable for Humanity there is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
something valuable for Humanity there is
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.399
something valuable for Humanity there is
a wonderful saying by Horace ma man who

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
a wonderful saying by Horace ma man who
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.929
a wonderful saying by Horace ma man who
said and you should be ashamed to die

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939
said and you should be ashamed to die
 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.609
said and you should be ashamed to die
before you have won some great victory

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
before you have won some great victory
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.160
before you have won some great victory
for humankind and that's what's being a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
for humankind and that's what's being a
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.109
for humankind and that's what's being a
physicist a theoretical physicists like

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
physicist a theoretical physicists like
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149
physicist a theoretical physicists like
you're trying to make that that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
you're trying to make that that
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.839
you're trying to make that that
wonderful victory for humankind and so

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
wonderful victory for humankind and so
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.390
wonderful victory for humankind and so
it's a profoundly connecting sense of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
it's a profoundly connecting sense of
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.130
it's a profoundly connecting sense of
what it is that we do

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
what it is that we do
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.690
what it is that we do
so when I look at the world and as you

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
so when I look at the world and as you
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.090
so when I look at the world and as you
brought up the American Idol I

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100
brought up the American Idol I
 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.580
brought up the American Idol I
understand that for most people these

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
understand that for most people these
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.100
understand that for most people these
are things that are important to them

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
are things that are important to them
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.520
are things that are important to them
personally that bring great value to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
personally that bring great value to
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.699
personally that bring great value to
their existence on the other hand for

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
their existence on the other hand for
 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.860
their existence on the other hand for
someone like me for example I've never

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
someone like me for example I've never
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.630
someone like me for example I've never
actually seen American Idol I know it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
actually seen American Idol I know it
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.520
actually seen American Idol I know it
exists because I hear about it all the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
exists because I hear about it all the
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.280
exists because I hear about it all the
time but I don't for me personally I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
time but I don't for me personally I
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.949
time but I don't for me personally I
don't see a point so doing theoretical

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959
don't see a point so doing theoretical
 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.710
don't see a point so doing theoretical
physics is to me profoundly a human

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
physics is to me profoundly a human
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.610
physics is to me profoundly a human
activity because it's an expression of

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620
activity because it's an expression of
 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.290
activity because it's an expression of
optimism in our species and that's why I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300
optimism in our species and that's why I
 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.590
optimism in our species and that's why I
say we are hopeless
