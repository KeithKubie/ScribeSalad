the documentary and the it was a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
the documentary and the it was a
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.750

scientific paper or discrepant but it's

the problem everybody is that livestock

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
the problem everybody is that livestock
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.080
the problem everybody is that livestock

livestock stomachs metabolize the plant
material into methane natural gas and

you can make all the jokes you want but

you can make all the jokes you want but

you can make all the jokes you want but
nothing is a very strong greenhouse gas

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
nothing is a very strong greenhouse gas

the first place I'd look to find the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
the first place I'd look to find the
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.649

reasons for the discrepancy between the

reasons for the discrepancy between the
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.499
reasons for the discrepancy between the
two figures is in the amount of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
two figures is in the amount of
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.320
two figures is in the amount of
greenhouse gas supposed to come from a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
greenhouse gas supposed to come from a
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.929
greenhouse gas supposed to come from a
cow or a sheep or goat so with humans

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939

the human population getting so big that

the human population getting so big that
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580
the human population getting so big that
it's we are raising so many farm animals

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
it's we are raising so many farm animals
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.319
it's we are raising so many farm animals
it's very reasonable that we're creating

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
it's very reasonable that we're creating
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420
it's very reasonable that we're creating
a tremendous amount of extra methane

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
a tremendous amount of extra methane
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.920
a tremendous amount of extra methane
that wouldn't normally be it wouldn't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
that wouldn't normally be it wouldn't
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.819
that wouldn't normally be it wouldn't
otherwise be there in the atmosphere and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
otherwise be there in the atmosphere and
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.370
otherwise be there in the atmosphere and
that is causing global warming and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
that is causing global warming and
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.230
that is causing global warming and
climate change happen more rapidly than

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
climate change happen more rapidly than
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.850

it would otherwise

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860
it would otherwise
 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.920
it would otherwise
however if humans weren't there animals

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
however if humans weren't there animals
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450
however if humans weren't there animals
would be all over the place anyway it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
would be all over the place anyway it's
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.710
would be all over the place anyway it's
not clear that they'd be in these

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
not clear that they'd be in these
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350
not clear that they'd be in these
concentrations though it could be a

concentrations though it could be a
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600
concentrations though it could be a
difficult thing to measure but it's also

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
difficult thing to measure but it's also
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.499
difficult thing to measure but it's also
reasonable that agriculture researchers

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
reasonable that agriculture researchers
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.219
reasonable that agriculture researchers
are going to produce or breed farm

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
are going to produce or breed farm
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.219

animals that produce less methane by

animals that produce less methane by
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.609
animals that produce less methane by
changing the bacteria that are in their

the way down to a plant-based diet might

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050
the way down to a plant-based diet might
 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.290
the way down to a plant-based diet might
be tricky for a lot of people however it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300
be tricky for a lot of people however it
 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.490
be tricky for a lot of people however it
seems like a good idea

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
seems like a good idea
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.560
seems like a good idea
check in with me in a few months because

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570
check in with me in a few months because
 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.540
check in with me in a few months because
I noticed that my diet is becoming

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550
I noticed that my diet is becoming
 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.110
I noticed that my diet is becoming
increasingly vegetarian and so the next

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
increasingly vegetarian and so the next
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.910
increasingly vegetarian and so the next
little while I may be all the way over

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
little while I may be all the way over
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740

very interesting question and important
 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.630
very interesting question and important
