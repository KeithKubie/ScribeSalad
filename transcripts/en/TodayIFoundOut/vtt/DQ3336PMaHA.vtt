00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:21.010
The (Carcharodon) Megalodon is thought to
have looked very much like a Great White Shark,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.080
only a bit more stocky and overall bigger.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.070
If they idea of a bigger version of a Great
White Shark isn’t frightening enough to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.869
you, perhaps we should say how much bigger.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.440
The average adult Megalodon is estimated to
have weighed around 70-100 tons (about 30

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.920
times that of a Great White Shark which full
grown tend to be about 2.5-3 tons).

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.899
The Megalodon is also estimated to have been
around 15-24 meters long (50-78 ft., compared

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.609
to a typical adult Great White Shark which
is only 6m or 20 ft long).

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.249
It is also estimated that the bite force the
Megalodon’s jaws could generate was somewhere

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:01.530
in the vicinity of 11-18 tons of force.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.990
For reference, this is about 6-10 times the
biting power of a Great White Shark and 18-30

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.369
times that of a Lion.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.000
Not only were its jaws exceptionally powerful,
but the Megalodon had teeth as large as 18

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.390
cm long (7 inches- in fact, “Megalodon”
literally means “giant tooth”), which

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.110
are today the most common remnants of the
Megalodon found.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.100
These teeth didn’t just have powerful jaws
helping them to slice through prey, but they

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.140
also are serrated and deeply planted in the
jaw, so as not to break loose or chip when

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.480
biting even through thick bones of another
creature.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.650
This giant of the sea seems to have traveled
far and wide, with their teeth found throughout

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.650
the globe.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.960
Based on fossil evidence (particularly chewed
remains of certain things), its favorite food

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.800
is thought to have been marine mammals, but
it also would eat other things.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.270
Among the known things it preferred to eat
were dolphins, squids, whales (including very

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.850
large ones like Sperm Whales), sea lions,
porpoises, giant sea turtles, and the like.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.810
So if this was such a big and powerful creature,
seemingly the king of the ocean, what happened

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.810
to the Megalodon?

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.280
There are a variety of theories, but mainly
it’s thought its extinction came about due

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.410
primarily to climate change.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.340
The Megalodon preferred warmer waters and
thanks to global cooling of the Earth’s

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.549
oceans starting around 15-17 million years
ago and culminating into the last Ice Age,

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.989
the Megalodon died out around the end of the
Pliocene era (about 2.5 million years ago).

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.650
At this point, the Earth’s global temperature
had cooled to just about 2-3° C (3.6-5.4°

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.409
F) higher than today.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.829
It’s thought this may have simultaneously
resulted in a lessening of available warm

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.239
water breeding sites and a decline in available
food supply due to many of the whales it fed

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.019
on either dying out or moving towards more
polar regions where the water was now too

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.010
cold for the Megalodon.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.959
Without an abundance of reasonable sized prey
to feed on, the extremely large and voracious

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.299
Megalodon couldn’t last long.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.029
It’s thought that as food became scarce,
the Megalodons even began resorting to cannibalism,

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:04.889
and young Megalodons were particularly susceptible,
further accelerating their progress towards

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.370
extinction, which ultimately happened around
1.6-2 million years ago.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.489
Bonus Fact:
• Contrary to what certain films show, the

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.340
Megalodon was not alive when dinosaurs roamed
the Earth.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.799
The dinosaurs went extinct around 65 million
years ago, while the Megalodon didn’t pop

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.689
up until about 25 million years ago and wasn’t
prevalent until approximately 17 million years

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:39.069
ago.
