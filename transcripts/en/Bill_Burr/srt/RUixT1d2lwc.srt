00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,010

It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,373
Just checking.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,610
Just checking in on you.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,830
You fucking who? What's
going on? How are you?

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,270
Um, oh, it's the sound.
Sound fucked up here.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,100
In order as you guys probably
want a white pill, why don't you,

8
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:29,700
when you get the fucking sound
right, why don't you just set it,

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,920
set it and forget it. Remember
that Shit you turn on an oven.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,420
Just forget about it. Just
fucking walk away from it.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,550
I bought one of those things. That
thing was this shit. I don't know.

12
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:42,990
I can't remember whatever happened to it.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,130
Stick a whole fucking chicken in
there, you know? And I would shut it,

14
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,240
but I would not forget it.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,620
I would always remember that I had a
chicken cooking cause I was living in New

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,401
York and uh, you know,

17
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:58,110
I was paying nine grand a month for like
fucking 30 square feet. So, you know,

18
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:01,440
I had my pillow propped up on the
other side of it. And you know,

19
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:05,040
it's impossible not to hear that bell go
off considering my head was against it.

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,903
You know,

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,020
half of my head would be sweaty and red
and I'd sit down and eat a whole chicken

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,120
greasy shit.

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,590
I don't understand why fucking chickens
is so God damn greasy. You know,

24
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:22,190
when you look at them, they don't look
greasy and that grease is shit. And then,

25
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:22,550
you know,

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,510
what's the worst is you fucking show up
and the amount of people that don't know

27
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:30,710
how to cook chicken and it's just
fucking dry ass chicken. Do you know,

28
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:34,610
way back in the day, back in the day
when I was young and I had more hair,

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,370
um, I used to do a what was
called the uptown shows,

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,620
you know, do the uptown show at town.
You know, in my business is means, uh,

31
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,730
the black shows,

32
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,740
these shows where the crowd
is African American and uh,

33
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,770
every once in is like one white guy
on the show at one token white guy.

34
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,720
So I used to be the token
white guy on those things.

35
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,560
And I remember all the fucking time I
used to do these things and I hope he

36
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:03,170
hears this. I used to work for a talent.

37
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,800
He used to do all those fucking rooms
and they used to always give me shit,

38
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,530
say white people don't know how
to have a cookout or barbecue,

39
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:12,560
whatever the fucking thing is. And
I'll never forget, he invited me,

40
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,260
I can't remember, was him a Gerald Kelly.

41
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,640
They invited me up way the fuck up in
the Bronx. I Dunno where the hell I was.

42
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,641
It was just fucking like basketball
slash do stand up during the day in this

43
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:30,210
basketball park. So I got fuck
it. I'll go up there and do it.

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,170
So I went up there, you know, and then
fucking cooking out and all that shit.

45
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:34,861
And I gotta tell you,

46
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,460
I will never forget how fucking
disappointed I was when I ate the chicken.

47
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:43,450
It was so fucking dry. Tell
you everybody talks shit.

48
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,080
Uh, fuck it. Do this. I'll
fucking go fucking do it.

49
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,590
Yeah,

50
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,371
I got it. Oh, you know what?

51
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:54,440
I should have Nia here for this
cause that's another one too.

52
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,060
They always telling me
how good soul food is.

53
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:57,920
I've been to one good soul food place.

54
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,800
It's the same thing
with like barbecue too.

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,780
Everybody Raven above fucking barbecue.

56
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,560
90% of those things are absolute
shit holes. You walk in there,

57
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,550
you see like 50 health code
violations is fucking flies and stuff

58
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,510
and then they just, they try to disguise
all their fuck ups with like fucking,

59
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:18,660
you know, 10 pounds of
barbecue sauce. I mean,

60
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:20,700
you put barbecue sauce on a tree branch.

61
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,310
It's gonna fucking taste
good to some level. Right.

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,033
Um,

63
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,610
I found that all, you
know, trying to, you know,

64
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,300
you want the reality is is I don't know
shit about barbecue. So it's just like,

65
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,900
you know, if you don't
know shit about standup,

66
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,470
you're going to watch a bunch of
hacks before you get to a good one.

67
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:41,180
So maybe that's what it is. I
have no idea. I have no idea.

68
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,100
The one place soul food place
that I want that actually,

69
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,620
I went to Amy roofs a long
time ago and I liked that.

70
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:49,610
I thought that that was quality. All
right. So I know it has to be out there.

71
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,700
I mean, God knows if you want to get
a good fucking corn beef sandwich,

72
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,910
I know the go down to Tom Burgins
here in fucking La, right?

73
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,500
I know where to go for that shit.
So somebody helped me out in la.

74
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,720
Where's was it? Was it good spot for
all of that type of stuff? Cause I've,

75
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,050
I can't say it because
it'd be sacrilegious,

76
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,680
but I've gotten the
most famous fucking, um,

77
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,640
I guess so food place out
here. There's two locations.

78
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:18,350
And I went to both of them and the
food. Absolutely. Without a doubt.

79
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,710
No questions. Landslide fucking sucked.

80
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,280
And I was like, why is there a God?

81
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,450
Why is there a fucking line around the
block for this shit? It's terrible.

82
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,060
There has to be, this has to be the
spot that only guys like me know about.

83
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:37,370
Right? And then everybody else
is going to the real place.

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,473
Um,

85
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,120
that was a fucking left turn.

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,150
I think the only good barbecue I think
I ever really enjoyed was when I was in

87
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,810
Alabama and there was
a place called a size

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,960
smart ass Wilson. It's still stood for
and that shit was fucking delicious.

89
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,630
You go in and the place
was clean, you know,

90
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,490
they always have to have it be a little
bit funky. It kind of looks like,

91
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:03,060
do you guys build hot rods here or are
you, are you making a fucking, you know,

92
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,290
brisket, you know,

93
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,050
fucking pisses me off those wherever you
watch the food network and you watched

94
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:15,750
those professionals doing it, I'm always
screaming at the TV, where do you,

95
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,550
where the fuck is your restaurant?

96
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,470
I don't want to sit here and watch you
cook and all this shit that I can't

97
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:26,200
fucking eat. I mean it's
works of art, you know? Yeah.

98
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,100
People will make barbecue or
some fat motherfuckers though.

99
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:32,580
You gotta admit that, right? Just big
fuck. They look like they drive trucks.

100
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,263
Um,

101
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,330
anyways, this is just making
me hungry. Speaking of which,

102
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,340
I've been eating like shit, you know,

103
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,280
I know it's going to fucking
tell you something. I mean,

104
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:48,780
what the Hell is talking about? Start
talking about fucking dry chicken. Okay.

105
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,070
So fuck right. Does it really
matter? I'm just checking in on you.

106
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,450
This is really isn't even a podcast.

107
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,913
Um,

108
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,970
anyways, what did I want
to talk about? Oh yeah,

109
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,620
so give you the update on my, uh,
yeah. Fuck that. I'll do that later.

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,410
I, um, I fucking drank so
much the other night, right?

111
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,470
I had some friends of mine, they were
at this bar and they texted me going,

112
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,440
hey man, we're out here drinking.
Right? And I didn't want to drink,

113
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,140
which is really surprised. I
mean, I always want to drink,

114
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,280
but I knew I shouldn't,

115
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,350
something in my head and my big
stupid Charlie Brown head said,

116
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:27,310
don't go to the bar. Right? So I
just, you know, they like, yeah,

117
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,830
we've been day drinking, we're
already here, Yada, Yada, Yada.

118
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,080
And I'm just like, okay, blah,
blah, blah, blah, whatever. Right.

119
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:36,480
I'm not going to, you know, you know, I
got a set tonight. They're like, yeah,

120
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,350
we're right up the street. Hit us
up after. And I was just like, okay.

121
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,200
And I was just hoping they were going
to be totally hammered and forget.

122
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,630
And I went down to the comedy store.

123
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,300
I've been doing sets all week cause I got
those huge shows this weekend. And um,

124
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,130
I went up ahead a fucking great
set, got all this new shit,

125
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,600
really excited about it, you know,

126
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,200
because I did just do a Gig in downtown
La and one of my gigs is out in

127
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,940
Riverside. The other
one's in Orange County.

128
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,670
My agents telling me this is
a completely different market.

129
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,180
There's a completely different flat
[inaudible] and I'm just worried that

130
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,060
somebody from the show, New
Year's is going to show up.

131
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,740
So I gotta make sure I got a new 15,

132
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:19,980
20 so they don't be like
[inaudible] same shit. Right?

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,670
Like I'm supposed to write a brand
new whack in 90 fucking days.

134
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,800
It's not even 90 days,
you know. So anyways, um,

135
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,243
wow.

136
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,250
I'm working on that shit. And the
second I get off stage, I have a text,

137
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,210
hey man, you off you off off stage
yet for right down the street.

138
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,980
So like a fucking ass hole.
Don't listen to my gut.

139
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,570
I go down there, right.

140
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,930
And I show up and it's everybody that I
like to drink with and I'm like, fuck.

141
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:49,980
And I'm driving, right? So I go,
I'm going to have one whiskey,

142
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,320
I'm going to nurse it and
that's going to be it. Okay.

143
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,730
And I sipped it and it tasted fucking
delicious. And I literally looked at the,

144
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,470
another comic goes, yeah, I go, why does
it taste so good? And he just laughed.

145
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:05,970
He goes, it tastes better every year.
And that's kind of the last coherent,

146
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:10,971
like part of the night that I remember
I sucked at one down and then the

147
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:16,830
waitress came by and she goes, hey, gay
gay, right? How's, yeah, your house?

148
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,720
And I was, she didn't say, you know, she
was actually, you know, completely, uh,

149
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,230
probably probably did
better in school than I did.

150
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,130
And I'm making fun of her because I'm
set with the answer that I gave her.

151
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:30,120
I said yes, as my brains gone.

152
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,630
Don't do this bill. Don't do this.
The second you get the second one,

153
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,430
now you have to fucking take a taxi home
and you've got to leave your car here.

154
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,240
Don't do that. Just
fucking relax. You know,

155
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,100
you're really just here
for the social thing.

156
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,190
Just have a water and
talk to the fellas. Right.

157
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,560
So that's what I'm thinking. And my
brain just goes, yes, a mouth goes,

158
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:57,500
I would like another drink. And then
that it, and then I just looked at it,

159
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,080
buddy, go, well, I'm not driving
now. And they'd go, yeah, yeah,

160
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,240
you're not driving. You're not
driving. And then that was it. And um,

161
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,840
I don't know what the fuck happened.

162
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Then somebody told the fucking story
about this drink called the John Riley and

163
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,360
I kept thinking it was like
the, the actor John C. Reilly.

164
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,560
So I kept picturing his,

165
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,540
his face as the guy was telling
the story and I'm going like,

166
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,250
John c Riley's got his, I already
has a drink named bathroom. That's,

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,410
that's like the, like the bar version
of women, like the Mark Twain Award.

168
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:35,130
Right. And I'm like, good for John.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,190
And it wasn't until he got
like halfway through the story,

170
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,710
I realized he was just talking
about a guy, John Riley,

171
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,130
Eddie date fucking did something.
He fought one of those,

172
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,660
one of those wars that they never make
a movie about the Spanish American war.

173
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,400
They never make a fucking movie about
that. And the Spanish American war.

174
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,750
Wasn't that the one we fought
in the fucking Philippines.

175
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,340
I always thought that that one was
like with Sam Houston and Dave Bowie.

176
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,450
David Bowie, now Daniel Boone,
whatever the fuck his name is, right.

177
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,520
They surrounded the Alamo.
Let's see this here.

178
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,460
Spanish American war.

179
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,450
What do you put the home game
away game. How do I look this up?

180
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Serve or not found the fuck
you talking about. What again?

181
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,960
You motherfucker. Don't don't do
this to me. All right. This is,

182
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:30,420
this is how I fixed it. I shut it
off. Shut off Wifi. Turn Wifi back on.

183
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,440
That's like the fribulation. You're
fucking, I say that word right?

184
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,980
Come on. I feel like
Pachino in and he car guys.

185
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,120
Alright, here we go. Spanish American war.

186
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,290
I think this was in the Spanish
American war. Wikipedia.

187
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,520
God knows they're always right.

188
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,660
Spanish American war was a conflict
between Spain and the United States.

189
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,570
The result of the u s intervention in
Cuba. We've always been doing that, huh?

190
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,580
Well, we're trying to make
them free also. All right.

191
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,750
Location, Cuba, Puerto Rico,

192
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,030
the Philippines in Guam.

193
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,130
Why don't they ever make a movie
about that one? I'm sure they did,

194
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:19,920
but why don't they make a one that's
fucking known enough that I've seen it?

195
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,283
Hang on a second.

196
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,780
I know I've ever even read about this
was a conflict in 1898 between Spain and

197
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:28,440
the United States.

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,730
The results of US intervention
in the Cuban war of independence.

199
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
In other words, you know,
we, we always have a dog.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,650
We always have a dog in the
fight. You know what I mean?

201
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,160
If we go to the fucking casino and
there's that gouge his fucking bet,

202
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,680
every game, that's the
United States, we always,

203
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,200
we always got some action going, you know,

204
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,200
walk around with our fucking
Hawaiian shirt and a big cigar.

205
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,570
Flip flops were a mess.

206
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,540
US attacks on Spain's Pacific coast. Oh,

207
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,500
Pacific positions led to the involvement
in the Philippine revolution and

208
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:03,760
ultimately to ultimately, ultimately
to the Philippine American war.

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,970
All right, let's click on
that Philippine American war.

210
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,840
It fucking lasted for
almost two over two years.

211
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,620
1899 three years. One
month. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah,

212
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,730
that's three years. Jesus. Bill,
lay off the fucking sauce, Huh?

213
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,553
Um,

214
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,930
alright. Filipino civilians dead.

215
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:33,160
200 to 250,000 dead mostly from disease.

216
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,880
We lost four to 6,000.
They lost 12 to 20,000.

217
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,040
We crushed another one, Huh? Jesus Christ.
We were on a tear back. That was it.

218
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,920
That's what, that's when we
were really on a fucking tear.

219
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,520
Conflicts arose when first
Filipino republic objected
to the terms of the treaty

220
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:57,850
of Paris under which the United States
took possession of the Philippines from

221
00:12:57,851 --> 00:13:02,500
Spain ending the Spanish American
war. Yeah. They're like, dude,

222
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,810
we want to be our own
people, if you don't mind.

223
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,060
And then we came over their land to the
home for a land of the brave free of the

224
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,960
home, whatever the fuck
our, our little tagline is.

225
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,480
I, and they probably scared up some
guy named fucking Ulysses, you know,

226
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,560
scared the shit out of. They're going
to come over here to go to kitchen.

227
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,170
They're going to get you
fucking four wheeler. Um,

228
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,460
anyways, once again, I don't even know
how the fuck I got to that goddamn thing.

229
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,650
Oh yeah. So the drink, it's called
the John Riley. All it is, it's,

230
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,080
it's a fucking Margarita.

231
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,210
And you take a shot at Jamison
and you'd dump it in there.

232
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:40,180
And it had something to do with the fact
that there was a bunch of Irish people

233
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,940
fighting on this side and
they decided, you know what,

234
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,320
you guys are fucking using us.

235
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,540
We're going to go fight on the
side where the Latinos are.

236
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,410
So that's the Jamieson going over
to the other fucking side. Right?

237
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,110
So now I got whiskey, the
bird, the real tailor.

238
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:56,860
The tape here is now I got what the
fuck's in a, in a, in a Margarita.

239
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,100
Okay. I never drink. Is that,
is that vodka or is it Tequila?

240
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,000
I think it's Tequila.

241
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,833
Right?

242
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,820
And uh, I fucking dumped
that in there. So now,

243
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,680
now I'm on my third fucking whiskey.

244
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,280
I had already ordered another Johnny
Black because it was a really long fucking

245
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:16,660
story. And now I'm three of those in, I
had a Jamison and then I had a fucking,

246
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,590
uh, a Margarita and a, I believe
I had one more after that grant,

247
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,870
I did all of this, I swear to
God it felt like 90 minutes,

248
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,740
but I think it was about two
and a half hours. And um,

249
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,780
then I did the Irish goodbye,
which is, I just hit me. He's like,

250
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,900
I got to get the fuck outta here.

251
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:35,820
And I didn't say goodbye to
anybody and I just walked.

252
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,173
Yeah.

253
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,500
They called my old friends La taxi.
That's who I always call. I do not Uber,

254
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,870
I don't do Uber because I
just, you know, you do Uber.

255
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:52,400
It's be some young kid,

256
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,060
he's in the fucking business and he's
going to hand you a fucking script or some

257
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,530
shit, you know? And eventually just
say something really creepy like, Oh,

258
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:05,480
you live here. You know? But yeah, you
get in the cab, it just like yellow.

259
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,240
Yes. Hello my friend. They don't give a
fuck. They don't, they have no fucking,

260
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,550
you know, they don't give a shit. They're
not trying to fucking do anything.

261
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,750
Right. So I call La taxi like, okay,

262
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,170
you know how many taxi you have Ababa?
And I'm just like, yeah, I just like,

263
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:19,460
yeah, I'm [inaudible].

264
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,450
And then that was just dead silence
it in my fucking head. It made,

265
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,990
they made me seem, made me think that
they knew where the fuck I was at.

266
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,650
I wasn't at the Ramada, I'm not going to
say what the fuck I was at. Right. So,

267
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,833
um,

268
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
then I was just standing there swaying
in the breeze and then one of my buddies

269
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:39,920
came down and his Uber pulled up and he
just saw me and he saw the state I was

270
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,710
in any, just let me get in it.
So I got in the fucking thing.

271
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,990
And like most streets in La, they're
the longest fucking streets ever.

272
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,200
You know what I mean?
Like last Sianna goes,

273
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,590
starts at the Hollywood hills and we'll
just go all the way down to like the

274
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:58,110
palace Verdi's peninsula. Maybe that one
doesn't, but some of them don't. They,

275
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,650
they're like, they're like
fucking 20 mile long streets,

276
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,070
so you have the north
side and the south side.

277
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,920
This guy started going in the wrong
fucking direction. Fortunately,

278
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,090
I wasn't so drunk,

279
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,370
he would've dropped me off to the
opposite end of the fucking, uh, you know,

280
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,950
fucking city or whatever.
And um, so I go to bed,

281
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,360
I don't even remember going to bed.

282
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,290
And then I wake up the next day I
woke up at like eight in the morning,

283
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,500
my dog fucking lick in my face and I
swear to God at eight in the morning,

284
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,450
I was still legally drunk, legally
drunk. And I was just like, oh my God.

285
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:33,520
So I got up, I walked
the dog around the block.

286
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,030
I sat down and I just fucking,

287
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,440
it took me till about 10 30 to get my
shit together and then I just walked all

288
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:43,990
the way back to the bar,

289
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,990
to the hotel area to get my fucking car.

290
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,543
Yeah,

291
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,870
just a complete waste of a fucking
day. By the time I got home,

292
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,490
it was like one in the afternoon.

293
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,520
And I'm just muttering to myself the
entire time going, look at this bill,

294
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,354
would you look at this?

295
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,260
Look how many fucking times
you got to learn this lesson.

296
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,950
And I would love to tell you that
this is the last time I'm going to do

297
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:10,970
something like that. It's the last
time for a while. Oh, is a bad one.

298
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,560
That was a bad bump. But you
know what was good was a,

299
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:20,480
I sold off some of the shit from my
garage and I got to tell you, felt good.

300
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,920
Made me want to get rid of a
bunch of more of my shit. Um,

301
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,650
I just got a ton of shit.
I don't know what I fuck.

302
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:30,620
And you know what it is and I'm telling
you, when I say shit, it's fucking shit.

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,470
Bunch of baseball hats and fucking
all these books and shit and just,

304
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,760
just stuff. Got All this
fucking shit and I'm sick of it.

305
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,060
It's all over the fucking
place. I don't use most of it,

306
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,050
so I'm, I'm, you know what,

307
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,910
I'm just gonna I'm going to
get rid of a bunch of shit. I,

308
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm where I'm going to start to do is
every couple of days I'm going to give

309
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,680
something away or sell something on
Ebay and I literally want to get down to

310
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:59,100
basically bare bones.
What the fuck do I use?

311
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,620
You know, I was thinking about that
one on my long fucking walk of shame.

312
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,770
Back to my fucking car. I saw this giant,

313
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,310
we know all those may flower
moving trucks just as jai,

314
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,350
the biggest one you could possibly get.

315
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,920
Or they even have like in between
the front and the back wheels,

316
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:21,610
they drop the back end the trailer
down so they can even have shit down in

317
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:25,300
there. And I was just thinking like,
I never want to need one of those

318
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,443
ever. Okay.

319
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,490
You gotta be that guy that can fuck
the next size up from the u haul van.

320
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,110
That's what the fuck you need, right?

321
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,600
I want to be late. So,

322
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,413
uh,

323
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,650
oh, she's like a ton of shit to tell
you guys. So I also, I also want,

324
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:45,660
I looked at cars before my fucking,

325
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,260
my big, uh,

326
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,910
fucking booze fest and, uh,

327
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,350
I thought I finally found my
car and uh, I swear to God,

328
00:18:57,351 --> 00:19:01,490
I love the picture of it. I
went and I looked at the 2016,

329
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,903
uh,

330
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,450
Cadillac Cts v await now though, the,

331
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,250
the top of the line one, whatever
the wanted, the one, it basically,

332
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,240
it goes fucking,

333
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,180
it goes 200 miles an hour and it's
a four door sedan. Right. And all,

334
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:22,560
all I'm thinking is that I'm, I'm just
like, all right, this is the fucking,

335
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:27,300
this is the one, it's exactly what
the fuck I want. I can't explain it.

336
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,860
I love the way it looks
like in the picture.

337
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:32,040
And then I went to go see it and it just
looked like something that you'd buy if

338
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,810
you were in, like if you
were in your twenties,

339
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,350
if you could somehow afford it
just with all the fins in the tail.

340
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,181
And of course I'm just like,

341
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:42,090
I can't get in my driveway because
the front end is too fucking low.

342
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,420
There's a little hump to get in my
driveway and then they go in like, well,

343
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:49,020
you could back it in. And um,

344
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,890
I don't know man. I just couldn't get
past. And then they were like, yeah,

345
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,440
Justin Bieber bought one of these.
And I'm like, yeah, exactly.

346
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:59,190
He should buy one of these. If
you could walk around shirtless,

347
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:02,280
putting one my eyebrow up and doing the
kissing your two fingers in the piece

348
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,140
thing, that's the fucking car for you.

349
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:07,500
I can as an almost 50 year old
fucking man walk in that thing.

350
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,450
I got to tell you, I
love the inside of it.

351
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,340
And it went like nine zillion miles an
hour. But I gotta admit I fucking, uh,

352
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,650
I realized while I was test driving the
car that I am an old man and I don't

353
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,160
like going fast. I just like cruising. So

354
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,690
I looked at the other Cadillacs like
the $54,000 fucking old man one,

355
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:35,391
it was 54 fucking thousand dollars and
I cannot stress enough what an absolute

356
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,080
piece of fucking shit it was. I could
have put my foot through the fucking door.

357
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,670
I literally left just like depressed.
I was just like, you know what?

358
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,010
Fuck this. Fuck all these fucking things.

359
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,860
I'm just going to keep driving my
fucking piece of Shit Prius. Right.

360
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,370
And it really is a piece of shit at this
point. Now the engine is fucking great,

361
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:57,580
but like I've had all the dents,
take it out and everything,

362
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,180
but it's sat in the sun for fucking
eight years. It's been hit too many.

363
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,730
It's punched drunk. My car
is fucking punch drunk.

364
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,570
So last night I'm at the
comedy store. Oh by the way,

365
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:12,130
the Lincoln New Lincoln
Continental's coming out in August,

366
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,990
2017 and it looks pretty fucking bad
ass. And it's just like, you know,

367
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,910
I was talking to a comic last night and
I was joking about how old I am that I,

368
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,300
I like comfort over speed at this
point. And he goes, oh yeah. He goes,

369
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,100
you know, you're out here in la cause
where the fuck are you going to?

370
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,280
Where are you gonna go? The fuck are
you going to go? You can't go anywhere.

371
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:29,800
You want comfort, you're
going to be stuck in traffic.

372
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,400
Just drive around in a living room and
it just totally made sense. It's like,

373
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,620
yeah, that's what the fuck I
want to do. Then of course,

374
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:39,970
I drive down to the club
that night, right? And all
of a sudden, I swear to God,

375
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,430
I don't know if every, these are a
bunch of tourists and they all rent,

376
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,450
rented the cars.

377
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,580
There was a fucking guy in a
white corvette like 2016 corvette,

378
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,530
a guy in a fucking 2016 brand
new fucking Ferrari, spider,

379
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:56,290
whatever the fuck that thing is. And
then somebody else with this, you know,

380
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:00,070
one of those BMW, the m ones,
m three m five or something,

381
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,240
and they're all zigzag and out of stop
and go traffic revving the engines and

382
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:08,890
all that shit. The exact thing that my
buddy was saying and I was going, look,

383
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,770
look how I was thinking that I'd
be thinking, look how dumb that is.

384
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,410
And all I was thinking was, look
how fucking great those cars look.

385
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,420
But of course everybody
in them was 20 something,

386
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,400
you know the Yolo guys,
Yolo shoes, right? I mean,

387
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:28,820
I just have to fucking old,
right? So, um, anyways,

388
00:22:28,821 --> 00:22:32,320
so I went down to the store last night
comedy store and I fucking know I did a

389
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,340
set once again and I wasn't really
even funny last night. I mean,

390
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:37,510
I did a decent enough job.

391
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,910
I've been doing it long enough where
I can fake my way through my job,

392
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:43,930
but I just kept having brain farts and
all that cause I was still fucking hung

393
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,600
over. Right. So,

394
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,720
and when I'm hung over and
I'm kind of in a grouchy mood,

395
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,920
my shit goes from fucking silly to
like, dude, is this like a meeting?

396
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,340
This guy sounds like an
insane person. And, um,

397
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,170
I got out of the club and I
was walking in my car and uh,

398
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,260
this guy comes up, he goes,
excuse me, Mr Burr, Mr. Brewer.

399
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,670
And another reason why I shouldn't buy a
fucking cool sports car when somebody's

400
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,410
pushing 30 calls. You, Mr.

401
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,760
It's time to get yourself a Buick Riviera,
right though. You know what I mean?

402
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:21,880
Yeah. You can't fight it.
You can't fucking fight it.

403
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,410
I am in my sport coat luxury
car, you know, fucking years.

404
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,340
I'm going to go fucking,

405
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,970
I'm going to go online and buy an old
cutlets or something like that. Um,

406
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,380
old cutlets is actually a cool cone. Am
I talking about whatever, the fucking a,

407
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,020
a delta 88 or some shit. Um,

408
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,020
so he comes up and he's with his
girlfriend and uh, he goes, yeah,

409
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,290
I just want to say, you know,
I really enjoyed the show.

410
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,890
A big fan [inaudible] I got,
yeah, thanks. Or whatever.

411
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:52,700
And there's his just standing there.
She goes, yeah. She goes, I'm not a big,

412
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,530
she goes, yeah, I don't like you. Right.
Cause I was trashing the lays. Right.

413
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:01,820
She goes, I don't like you. And I go,
yeah, okay. I just went, all right.

414
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,710
And then she goes, no, I like you.
And she goes, I like you, but,

415
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,930
and I'm like, here we go. Here we go.

416
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,730
It's just like we just get on with
fucking trash and me, you know,

417
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:17,570
that fucking female manipulation
thing. She said, I don't like you,

418
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,020
cause she was expecting that I gave a
fuck. They'll be like, Ooh, you like me?

419
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:24,740
And then she could tell me what part of
my act she didn't like and guess what

420
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,710
part it was only this shit
about me, trash women,

421
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,840
all the other stuff was
perfectly fucking fine.

422
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,420
I'm talking about drunk driving
and going to McDonald's. Right.

423
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,950
She didn't have a fucking
problem with that.

424
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,150
All the hypothetically like innocent
people during that joke that I could have

425
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:41,750
fucking got in trouble, you
know, could have run over. Right.

426
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:45,050
She didn't give a fuck about that. So she
literally, she goes, I don't like you.

427
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,210
And I said, I'll coach.
She goes, no, I like you.

428
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:50,390
And then like a fucking
rookie. I stopped. She goes,

429
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:54,730
but you shouldn't be trashing him.
And it's just like, ah. I said,

430
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,800
I don't give a shit. I don't give
a fuck either. Dead after the show,

431
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:02,270
heckling is my number one pet peeve. I
stood on stage for 20 fucking minutes,

432
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,350
right in your crosshairs,
you know, yell out something.

433
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,650
Then you don't say shit.
You just fucking sit there.

434
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:14,540
And then after the show you come up to
me in the parking lot and you ignore the

435
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:18,230
30 topics. I went, I talked
about those, those were all fine.

436
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:21,470
And he'd just talk about the one that
pertains to you. So I just said, you know,

437
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:24,830
I don't give a shit, right. So
I get in my fucking car and she,

438
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,780
but at this point she was yelling at me,

439
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,763
um,

440
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,410
and this is hilarious. She goes, oh my
God, did I forget? She was like, man,

441
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:34,970
I don't have that. I wasn't
listening. And she goes,

442
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,400
and you drive a fucking Prius

443
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,760
steady yelling at me about my
car. Oh, it's fucking hilarious.

444
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,170
Fucking hilarious. She, when
she yelled fucking Prius,

445
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,870
she had turned around and
cause she realized that
wasn't going to listen to her

446
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,410
bitch moaning and
complaining about my jokes.

447
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,400
She had already turned away and she goes,
oh fuck. And she threw her head back.

448
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:02,500
She goes out, fucking
praise. And, uh, what she,

449
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:03,410
what she did there,

450
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,610
she made me laugh harder than I probably
made the whole crowd laugh my entire

451
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:11,360
set in that moment. So thank
you to that woman. And uh,

452
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,470
you know, other than that, you know, I
don't know what to tell you next time.

453
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,810
Heckled me onstage and, and I'll
listen to what you have to say.

454
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,520
There was a fucking woman
had called me in the crowd,

455
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,220
although I'll tell you how
to rough one, you know. Um,

456
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,520
yeah, I don't know what the fuck to
tell you. Um, all right. Before I,

457
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,320
before I end voice, start doing
some of these reads here. Uh,

458
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,821
what the fuck is it? Yeah.

459
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:40,821
Five dogs from tribe
called quest passed away.

460
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:44,820
Man. I was one of the, a casual of that,
you know, I'm just too fucking white.

461
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:47,250
I missed it. I totally missed
the boat. You know, I saw

462
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,540
Michael Rappaport's documentary on
him and I'll just maybe feels like,

463
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,550
how the fuck did I miss
this shit? Oh, that's right.

464
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,080
Cause I was listening to warrant.

465
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,640
I got it man, that fuck it. But I,

466
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,280
even though I didn't listen to
the band as much as I should have,

467
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:05,580
it really forced fucking depressing. Um,

468
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,480
just cause I obviously had friends die
at that fucking age from that shit.

469
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,210
Complications of diabetes and
all that. So, uh, I dunno,

470
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,290
that's just getting old.
Sucks. Just fucking blows.

471
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,360
45 years old. How the fuck do you
come to terms with that? You know,

472
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,780
why did I bring it up? I knew it was
going to be depressing. All right,

473
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,680
let's read some advertising.
All right. Score big. Uh,

474
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:35,520
you're paying too much for tickets
between all the markups in last minute

475
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,950
convenience charges. Oh, by the way,

476
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,740
you know I asked this before,

477
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:44,550
how the fuck is there a way that I can
sell tickets to my show just off my

478
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:46,680
website and only fans will get them.

479
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,990
Like what stops these people who go in
and somehow cause they got the money,

480
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:56,100
we'll go out and buy like 500 fucking
tickets and then jack the price up and

481
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:59,760
then everybody gives me shit
on the Internet. Go Look,

482
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,260
do you phone you not this funny.

483
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:04,090
And then they show how much the tickets
are for and the amount of times I call

484
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:06,840
my age and going to what the fuck
are we doing here? And he's like,

485
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:07,590
that's not us.

486
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,470
That's those constant buy a thousand
tickets and then rape everybody.

487
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,960
If anybody knows a way.
You know what's hilarious?

488
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:14,580
I think this advertising might be the way.

489
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:18,240
I have no idea between all the markups
that you know with these guys at doing.

490
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,400
These guys are going to undercut stub hub.

491
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:22,950
This is actually probably a
good thing here. All right.

492
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm not saying these guys
aren't dirt bags too,

493
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:29,160
but you know you can't just have one dirt
bag. You know if you get to dirt bags,

494
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:32,280
they start fucking going at each other
and then you slide under the radar.

495
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:33,520
Right? Anyway,

496
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:36,180
she paid too much for tickets between
all the markups and last minute

497
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,290
convenience charges. Even print
at home fees. Question Mark.

498
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,280
Exclamation point.

499
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,380
You can end up paying court side prices
for nosebleed seats score big.com is

500
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:50,970
here to change that. Well,
well, well let's see.

501
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:54,420
Let's see you guys. You guys check this
thing out. Let me know if this is legit.

502
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,820
Did you know that 40% of all live event
tickets go on sold and did you know that

503
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,560
there's a place to get these seats at
huge savings? It's called score big.com.

504
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,500
In other words, you bought
up 40% of the tickets.

505
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,680
What do you mean they go
on sold? No, they don't.

506
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:12,730
Yeah.

507
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,620
Well they don't, this is all bullshit.

508
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,080
40% go on. Sold. Yeah. And
then you know what they do?

509
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:20,670
They probably would
fucking cancel the show.

510
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:25,410
The acts not making the venue any money.
All right. You know what? I'll, I'll,

511
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,630
I'll, I'll suspend
disbelief here. You know,

512
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:30,720
considering Batman versus Superman is
going to be coming out this week and you

513
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,770
gotta suspend all that disbelief that a
guy from another fucking planet that can

514
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:38,700
fly and bullets bon off
his bounce off his chest.

515
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,030
He's gonna have a fucking fight against
a regular human being who has a fucking

516
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,050
utility belt,

517
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,353
right?

518
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,950
Bullets bounce off his chest.
What is Batman going to?

519
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:54,180
What does he have in his little fucking
tool belt there that can fuck with that

520
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:55,014
guy?

521
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,670
If they really made this movie as real
as possible, Batman versus Superman, it,

522
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,030
it's going to go down like one of those
old school Mike Tyson paper views.

523
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:08,820
Remember that the fight would be over
before the pizza showed up. But you know,

524
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,770
somehow they'll, they'll
fucking, I dunno what they'll do.

525
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,550
They'll keep it going. I love
how they are out of victims.

526
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,920
They're out at like villains and
now they have to fight each other.

527
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,620
You know what I mean? Like what
does that say about superheroes?

528
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,710
You know what I mean? I think
that just they just into fighting.

529
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:24,960
They don't give a fuck whether
somebody's good or bad. They just,

530
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:25,794
they just need,

531
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,300
they need to fight somebody and then when
they stop all the crime and you think

532
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,810
they're going to relax and get themselves
the new 2017 Lincoln continental,

533
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,300
you know, maybe chill on the
whole flying and all that stuff.

534
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Get themselves some adult
clothes, right? What do they do?

535
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,650
They start fighting each other.
Fucking animals. All right.

I'm a warp time. Praise.
Uh, we've all been there.

558
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,850
You come home after a long exhausting day

565
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,920

never have to worry about being wined free

566
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:37,470
again. Clip Debbie, I'm
better than Jim Jam.

567
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:41,810
Couldn't make it through the primaries
is a new wine club that sends you wine

568
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:46,010
directly to your door, saving you
all those trips to the grocery store.

569
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,520
Not only this club. Debbie, I'm
going to stop here one more time.

570
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,670
Praise and evil doers. Send
your wine, send you wine,

571
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,490
they'll send you wine that you'll
love drinking club. Debbie,

572
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,450

brother, older brother, GM.

573
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,650
He's not as good as me. Easy six
question quiz figures out your palate.

574
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,730
So every bottle you receive is perfectly
tailored to your tastes. Clip, Debbie,

575
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,920
he's doing it being an alcoholic.
Now I can speak Spanish,

576
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,430

vineyards to cut out the middlemen,

577
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,260
which saves you money club, Debbie,

578
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,100

580
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:27,620

2000. He still reelected me in 2004.

581
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:31,850
How Doma you is offering listeners $20
off your first order when you go to club

582
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,770

583
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,220
thing.com/burn and yet
it gets even better.

584
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,510
I know you all hate paying for shipping.

585
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:45,040
So club Debbie will actually pay for your
shipping on orders of four bottles or

586
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:48,730
more. So it takes something off

00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,090
Shame on you for me twice.

590
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,960
You're not good for me. Um,

591
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,500
all right. Is that the fucking
podcast here for this week? Yes.

592
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,930
I believe checking in on your,
they'll checking in on your podcast.

593
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:15,930
Let me guys let me know. Um, I
know I shit on that sponsor a lot.

594
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:17,790
They're probably not going to
advertise me anymore, but you know.

595
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,310
Okay.

596
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,380
Yeah. You know, it's shit happens.

597
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,560
Um, the fuck do I just
have a socket here for

598
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,740
anyways? Um, yeah, so I'm going to
start selling some shit on Ebay and uh,

599
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,170
I was actually thinking that this is
not much, I want to start selling shit.

600
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:41,040
I was thinking of fucking taking my truck
out to my shows this weekend and just

601
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,900
bringing a bunch of shit in the
back and it just shit, you know,

602
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,810
shit to me, somebody else might
like it, the end of the show,

603
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:51,270
just fucking given it to people, you know,

604
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,120
just getting it Outta here and then
somebody else takes it and they like it

605
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,310
because if I throw it out, it
ends up in the fucking ocean.

606
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:59,670
But if I fucking just give it to
somebody, they can keep it in, in their,

607
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:03,840
in their bedroom or in their fucking
living room, away from the poor purses.

608
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,243
Um,

609
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,470
I know it's just an idea. Just an idea.

610
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,800
I've decided I'm going to start with
the fucking closet in my, in my bedroom.

611
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:15,760
I'm just going to go in there. I want
to, I'm going to have two fucking piles.

612
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,241
Shit.

613
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:21,220
I need shit I don't need and
I'm going to write on a post it,

614
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,100
stop being a sentimental
bitch. Get rid of this shit.

615
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:27,790
Whatever I need to do to just fucking
plow through and get rid of all of this

616
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,050
stuff because I'm

617
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,400
okay.

618
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm not, I don't, I don't, I just don't
want all this shit anymore. All right.

619
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,240
That's it. That's the podcast this
week. You guys have a wonderful weekend,

620
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,950
Yukon and I'll, uh, I'll
talk to you on Monday.

621
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,663
[inaudible] everybody

622
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,713
[inaudible]

623
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,070
and that is, it built a bit
of a dilemma here for you. Uh,

624
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,370
I'm an 18 year old male who's
about to graduate from high school.

625
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,910
Congratulations. Um,
over the past few years,

626
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:51,500
I've been told I'm a really good
dancer. Uh, not ballet or artsy stuff,

627
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,030
but just good dance
floor dancing. Oh my God,

628
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:59,150
I'm going to take over the dance
floor. Hey Angie, watch me.

629
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,550
You're John Travolta. This is great.

630
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,300
Do you go out to the Staten Island
Bridge and do headstands with your,

631
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,860
with your buddy Bobby? You
know, if he didn't have an Afro,

632
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:13,250
he never would've fell off that
bridge if he had it high and tight.

633
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:17,560
Like all these Armenians out here, all,
every Armenian looks like they know, uh,

634
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,930
they, they know, um, um, MMA moose.

635
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:24,680
Last time you saw in our Armenian
dude in his twenties or thirties,

636
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,010
and he did not look like he could put
you in an arm bar within two seconds if

637
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,210
you wanted to. If I was,

638
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,220
if I was a Dana white and I was
running the UFC at one point,

639
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,510
that this point, whether
they're up to like what,

640
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:42,230
like UFC 2006,

641
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,520
they're like running, they'd run out
of adjectives this time. It's really,

642
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:49,610
really personal, right? Not Saying
I'm not a fan of a huge fucking fan.

643
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:51,710
I'm just saying, you know,

644
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,150
the way they had those things like every
other week and there's only so many

645
00:37:56,151 --> 00:38:00,510
like you know, redemption. I mean
you're running out of words. Um,

646
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,350
I'm such a fucking idiot.

647
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,100
This is what I would do if I was dating
a white at some point I would have,

648
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,140
you know, you know what I would,
this is what I would branch off.

649
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:12,530
And when they had those
tough man competitions and
they would have just people

650
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:12,951
coming in,

651
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:16,190
throwing haymakers which is some of
the best boxing ever is when you watch

652
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:19,530
people who just aren't trained
whatsoever and they just start, you know,

653
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,650
cause somebody's going to connect, right.

654
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,000
I think that they should have one week
they should have the Armenians verse the

655
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:29,840
Russians tough man competition because
I really think that that meets,

656
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,490
it needs to be decided who is
the tougher of the two. Uh,

657
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,160
cause when I, when it comes
to white people, that's,

658
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,320
that's who I got my money
on. All right. That those,

659
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:46,150
those are the crips and the bloods of
white people is the army and the Russians,

660
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,950
all of them, they just have that
vibe that somebody just like, yeah,

661
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:55,040
I'm a fucking with that guy. Just
really, I'm really not doing it anyways.

662
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,620
Uh, not a ballet or artsy stuff. Uh,
but just ballroom dates in a fucking,

663
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,680
you know, uh,

664
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:07,180
I kind of think of think dancing is
gay from an outside point of view.

665
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:12,700
Um, I, it isn't, it really isn't,

666
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:14,260
that's just how white people look at it.

667
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,040
It's considered gay cause it involves
like letting yourself go and actually

668
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:22,990
admitting that you have emotions as a
man, as a white male. Yeah. It's, yeah,

669
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,710
it is. It's considered gay. Um,

670
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,920
as his crying as his showing any sort
of emotion as is not dying for no good

671
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:37,660
goddamn reason before you're 56,
um, or not dying, I should say.

672
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,410
If you live to be 60, I believe amongst
white men, that's also considered gay.

673
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,260
Cause that means at some point you cried
something out of your chest and you

674
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:47,740
didn't have a heart attack.
Um, anyways, he says,

675
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:50,680
I think dancing is gay from
an outside point of view,

676
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:55,120
but I'll be the first one to admit that
I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I

677
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:58,180
didn't think so. I wouldn't be out
there doing it. Yeah, but dude,

678
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:03,160
you gotta be getting some, I'll, I'll
fucking women love a guy who can dance,

679
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,150
but if you can dance and you're wearing
like a silk scarf, it's fucking over.

680
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:10,120
It's going to be rain and pussy.
As far as my outside view,

681
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,590
my freckled view from over in the bar
trying to stand out from underneath those

682
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:17,380
hot lights so I don't
get burned. Uh, you know,

683
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:21,100
red heads with the closest
thing to vampires, you know,

684
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,320
we have, we have none of
the powers of vampires,

685
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:28,250
but the sun affects us the same.

686
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,850
Okay.

687
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,080
A friend of mine who was a female dancer
keeps telling me I could make money

688
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,900
doing it on commercials or music videos,

689
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,090
parentheses clothes on.

690
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:46,160
Or You could go to fucking Broadway and
be like one of the five straight men who

691
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:51,161
dances on Broadway and just tag every
fucking lonely chick out there who's all

692
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:54,590
stretched out. Just make
sure you keep their shoes on.

693
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,880
Dancer's feet are always fucked up.
Uh, here's where it gets complicated.

694
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:03,830
I plan on becoming a policeman. Oh
Dude, this is, this is a no brainer.

695
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,630
You need to dance it. Bachelorette parties
dressed as a cop. All you need, dude,

696
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:12,260
is that a fake uniform on a boombox
and you're on your way to making money?

697
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,870
Dude, you should fucking
do that in a second.

698
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,090
And then you write a book about it.

699
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,690
I was a gyrate and cop
for Bachelorette parties.

700
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,560
You write a tell all book about how
many fucking broads you bought. Ready?

701
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:28,820
Got Married, go get married, suck your
Dick. You really need help on this one.

702
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:29,990
I mean, I'm going to read the rest of it,

703
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:32,450
but I think I've already come
with the solution anyways.

704
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:35,030
How is anyone to take me
seriously on the force?

705
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:39,290
If there's a video going with me,
pop and locking next to little Wayne.

706
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,500
At the same time, I'll, dude, you
should fucking pull people over.

707
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,330
You should pull people over and fucking
moonwalk up to their car and just freak

708
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:49,790
them out. Even if they
were reaching for a gun,

709
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,110
they'd be laughing too
hard and they, they,

710
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:53,750
they wouldn't shoot you then you
could rest them and then you move up.

711
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:58,430
Next thing you know, you're a
commissioner, right? Nothing. Anyways,

712
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:01,430
at the same time, I'm getting laid a
lot because of it. Of course you are.

713
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,800
I'm a seven on a scale of 10. I
like this guy's honest and um, uh,

714
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,150
and like having a jumpshot. It's
put me up to an eight, five.

715
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,950
I'm bang intense. I've always wanted
to be a cop at the parks here.

716
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,730
Seen better if I was able to make money
doing it other in the dancing thing,

717
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,120
I wouldn't just be getting hammers
for letting gross moms off on speeding

718
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:29,870
tickets. I could be banging
J-lo. She's into dancers, right?

719
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,050
Thanks. Yeah. Dude. APP's
a fucking lutely dude.

720
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:38,200
You're basically saying,
what should I do here?

721
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the
club and make all this fucking money or

722
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:49,140
should I take a job where I'm going
to get shot at and not be appreciated.

723
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:50,800
Okay.

724
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,740
You know, I'll tell you every cop
out there with dance if they could,

725
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,830
as opposed to being a cop, I don't care
if they're like seven generations in,

726
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,080
dude, this is what I think of as
far as like dancing. I think if I,

727
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:03,914
if I,

728
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,140
okay.

729
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,600
Like compare it to being a comedian. Oh,

730
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:11,890
the open mikes would be getting a piece
of cardboard and being on a subway

731
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:13,600
platform, making money that way.

732
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,910
And then when you move up to hosting
a show, that would be your dresses,

733
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,340
a cop and you fucking dance
at Bachelorette parties.

734
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,140
That's what you do on the side. That's
like your fucking day job. That bullshit.

735
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,530
And then during the day, I, yeah, I
would try out for those. Fuck, I don't,

736
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,940
do they make music videos
anymore or fucking, uh,

737
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,800
I dunno. I believe it or not, I don't
know how to climb the ladder as a dancer,

738
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,280
but dude, APP's a fucking lutely.

739
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,010
If you can make money doing that shit.

740
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:50,750
And then what the great thing is, is
once you get to a certain level to, to,

741
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,740
uh, make more money, you know, once
you got some credibility, you can,

742
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,780
you always have the fallback where you
can teach a class. They, you can be like,

743
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:03,830
I danced for nine years and Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every

744
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:05,000
fucking broad on there.

745
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:07,940
And then if you'd like to know how to
fuck the women in your cast while still

746
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:12,590
not losing your job, come on down the
Frankie's in Dade Studio, whatever.

747
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:16,550
Just you'll figure it out
as you go in there. And, um,

748
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:21,680
yeah, absolutely. Absolute fucking
Lulea. I would definitely do it.

749
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:23,510
You want to do what you
want and taking the time,

750
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,893
um,

751
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,450
to write in. So your big fears, should
we be whatever, everybody's big fears.

752
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:34,230
Like what if I go after this dream and
I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a fucking

753
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:36,870
futon and it hasn't happened yet.
Well, I gotta tell you something, sir.

754
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,300
I'd been there. I was there at fucking 34.

755
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,870
I was still sleeping on a futon and a
fucking studio apartment that they call

756
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:45,240
the one bedroom because they
slammed a fucking wall in there

757
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,490
and put a door on it.

758
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,090
And then one day I was trying to bang
the girl upstairs who had the fucking

759
00:44:50,091 --> 00:44:54,380
apartment right above me, and
it was the exact same unit.

760
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:55,370
And hers was a studio,

761
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:57,830
but she had been there longer so
they never slammed a wall in there.

762
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,220
And I realized, Hey, wait a minute,
I'm getting fucked. You know,

763
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,740
I should go down there and try and
get some money taken off of this.

764
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:07,340
I should go down to the a. They're fucking
me over rental board. But I didn't.

765
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,060
I said, fuck it. Just
keep writing jokes, right.

766
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,600
So whatever all you've got to do,

767
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,350
you've just got to commit to this shit
and uh, and then realize that, you know,

768
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:21,890
sleep on Futon when you're 30 is
not the worst thing. It isn't.

769
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,830
You don't see what you don't. It's
worse to sleeping on Futon at 30,

770
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,610
sleeping in a king bed next to a fucking
woman you're not really love with.

771
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:30,920
But for some reason married and a,

772
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,130
you got a couple of kids and you got
a job that you fucking hate. Okay.

773
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:38,080
You'll be laying there fantasizing about
fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh,

774
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,170
on a futon there, there is no risk.

775
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,740
When you go after a dream,
it's all fucking reward.

776
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,990
It's all going to lead to
something good. It always does.

777
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,320
There's a tremendous amount of
risk to playing it safe and uh,

778
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,580
that leads to unbelievable
levels of regret,

779
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,460
which is something else I've also
experienced. Cause I'm an old [inaudible]

780
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,423
mother, motherfucker.

781
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,910
Well in the city, believe you.

782
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,900
Every day is pretty much

783
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,070
[inaudible] I be happy.

784
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,620
Surprise. We're getting a divorce. All
right, here's a new story. All right.

785
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,640
Hey Bill, I know you have,
you aren't a therapist,

786
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:38,780
but I think I just want to talk to
anyone at this point. So here goes,

787
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,110
I've been married for just under four
years to my wife who I dated for four

788
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:46,590
years prior to marriage. I love being
married and have said that to anyone. Uh,

789
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,660
that asked since day one, we own a nice
house together. We have three dogs,

790
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,660
pit bulls, two good man and
both make a decent living.

791
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,740
I share everything in my life with my
wife. Uh, when something makes me happy,

792
00:46:57,741 --> 00:47:01,250
she knows when I'm upset about
something. I tell her, uh,

793
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,820
throughout the course of our relationship
about once a year she would suddenly

794
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,200
without warning say she,

795
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:09,860
she was unhappy and has been for months.

796
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,000
Okay. Here we go. Okay.

797
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,250
She says she has discussions with their
mom who loves me and is the sweetest

798
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:22,251
woman alive and close friends about
the things that make her unhappy by,

799
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:26,190
I never hear a word about it until it
boils over and she floors me with how

800
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:30,790
unhappy she is. Well,
that's not fair. All right.

801
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:33,610
We tried to work it out
though. Make changes.

802
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,750
She would act like it was okay
while it bottling it up again once,

803
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,230
once the lid goes on the bottle,
there's no opening it again.

804
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:45,220
Each and every time she
calls the unhappiness state
of the Union meeting into

805
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:45,940
session.

806
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,330
I've always been completely honest as
saying that I'm very happy with her.

807
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,280
I love our jokes and honesty and joy.

808
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,460
Honestly enjoy spending time at Bahbahbah
Jesus Christ to get to the fucking

809
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:58,120
point. All right, last
Wednesday, here we go.

810
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,820
We had a good night together.

811
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:04,240
We went out for dinner and ice cream
and laughed at about Alibaba by bar.

812
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:08,320
So I thought I'd come home the
following night in general, great mood.

813
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:11,980
And she told me she had talked to her
mom and a friend and that they recommend

814
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:16,900
that she talks to me. I was
confused, Eh Damn. Oh Shit.

815
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:21,580
About not being unhappy. Uh, anyways,

816
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:22,840
I wanted anything to make her happy,

817
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:25,480
but she told me she didn't
think there was anything.

818
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,710
It was very emotional as she finally
mustered up the courage to say that we

819
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:31,390
might need to get separated.

820
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,560
I was floored and not in an almond
asshole husband that sits around drinks,

821
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:41,230
beer and watches football with his
buddy way. I love my wife. We have free.

822
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:44,140
Okay Dude. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh,

823
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:46,540
so the following day
after much reluctance,

824
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:51,070
I get her to agree to try
marriage counseling so we
can work out our happiness

825
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,330
do, and I'm not giving
you shit that this is,

826
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:54,490
you're pouring your heart out because
this shit just happened. I understand.

827
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:58,270
But for the sake of the listeners,
I got to put fly through this. Um,

828
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:02,470
I get to agree with her. I get to, I
get it. Okay. So the following day,

829
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,100
it's like Lord of the rings
here, after much reluctance,

830
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,300
I get her to agree to try marriage
counseling so we can work out her

831
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:13,240
unhappiness. I was willing
to do anything at this point.

832
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,420
I immediately scheduled an appointment
with the counselor and was looking

833
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,790
forward to having someone
neutral for us to talk to.

834
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,030
Later that night we were laying in bed
and I asked her if there was someone else

835
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:26,990
in her life. She said, no. Yeah
Dude. Oh Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Uh,

836
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,930
Jesus, here we go. We just went over
the waterfall folks or where we,

837
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:33,250
you know what it is
now? No. In this story,

838
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:37,190
we were hearing the waterfall and we just
looked at the other person in the RAF

839
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:37,721
with the panic.

840
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:41,680
Look on our face for that split
second before we tried to desperately.

841
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:46,510
But futilely try and paddle the fucking
thing over to the Goddamn coast.

842
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,730
Okay, here we go. We're going over.
I got a feeling we're going over.

843
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,660
Um, she said, no, there's
no one else in my life.

844
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,440
I asked her if she's ever been unfaithful
in our relationship relationship and

845
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:01,210
she adamantly said no again.

846
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,140
Then she turned out the
light and laid down to sleep.

847
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:09,280
Five minutes later she sat up
and turn the light on a fuck.

848
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,240
She told me she just lied to me and said
that she had messed around with someone

849
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:20,350
a year into our marriage. And he
writes in capital letters, what period?

850
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,600
The period fuck period.

851
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,670
I probed her to tell me what messing
around was as got at least be at blowjob.

852
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:29,933
Okay.

853
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,700
Oh, ah, fucking whore. Um,

854
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:40,610
and after a minute of me guessing
her silence told me that she went in

855
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:45,410
down on a guy, she works
with, swear to God.

856
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:46,280
I had read this.

857
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:47,843
Okay.

858
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,870
Oh, if I was very busy right now. Yeah.
What I say, you heard me, you heard me

859
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,980
fast. Fucking creek. I
was furious and hurt.

860
00:50:56,981 --> 00:51:00,520
Then furious again. She cried
and cried and said she was sorry.

861
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,340
We cried together. Dude,
you're a bigger man than me.

862
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,710
While I tried to wrap my head around
how she could possibly have done that to

863
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:12,040
me, I've had casual flirting
with people over the years,

864
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:15,250
but to act on something physically
with someone other than your spouses,

865
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,810
completely disgusting. To me,

866
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,800
the worst part is I love this woman
more than anyone. She's been my og.

867
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:23,350
Here we go again. She's not my best
friend for the last eight years.

868
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:24,640
She knows everything about me.

869
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,620
I want to hate her and make her sleep
at her parents house until we divorced.

870
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:33,040
But all I want to do is, yeah, be near
her again. Yeah, Dude. Let's, because

871
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,120
yeah, dude, she, she was in the hurry
up offense. That's what happened here.

872
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,820
So now you're scamper and trying to
figure out what the fuck is going on.

873
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:44,030
And she, you know, she has an x three
place that she just called in the huddle.

874
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,680
That's why this, this is why it
sucks to be you right now. Um,

875
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,760
one of my close friends tells me what
I know is the right thing. He goes,

876
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:54,290
let it go. Don't bother with clown.

877
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,190
Silene what else has she done that you
don't know about how he never trusted her

878
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:02,660
again? Bill, is it possible for me to
forgive my wife? Am I wasting my time?

879
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:09,070
Um, also I find out who this guy is
and I really wish I hadn't. Yeah, dude,

880
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,620
of course. All I wanted to do was show
up at the job, beat the shit out of him.

881
00:52:14,621 --> 00:52:18,460
Like Ed Norton, Pete's the blonde,
pretty boy up in fight club. He writes,

882
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:20,140
I wanted to destroy something beautiful.

883
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,980
My other thought is since this guy
also cheated on his girlfriend,

884
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,650
who we still with, um,

885
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,550
he did it with my wife.

886
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:33,990
I threatened to tell his girlfriend what
he'd done but not actually do it. Yeah.

887
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:35,880
You don't want to do that that way.

888
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,170
He live in fear of coming home and her
knowing everything because I told her or

889
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,690
he would try to beat me
to it and admit to it,

890
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,370
hopefully ending his relationship
and getting terminal cancer and aids,

891
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:51,900
terminal cancer and aids. And you know
what? You're still being a gentleman.

892
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,310
I still think that you're,

893
00:52:53,311 --> 00:52:57,150
you're handling this with class wishing
terminal cancer and AIDS on this guy.

894
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,470
Um, I know you don't give a
shit. Of course I give a shit,

895
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,710
but not occupy a, but I've
got to occupy my mind. So I,

896
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:09,990
I thought I do it here. Yeah. Dude, why
would you think I don't give a shit?

897
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,080
You know, I mean, I'm not a friend
of yours, but you know what I mean?

898
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:15,930
Give me a fucking break. This
is horrific. Um, all right.

899
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:19,030
Your first question builds it
possible for me to forgive my wife. A,

900
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:21,900
eventually you're going to have to, uh,

901
00:53:21,901 --> 00:53:26,901
and or you're going to go on a fucking
tear and you're going to meet some really

902
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,420
damaged fucking women and they're gonna
reinforce everything that you've now

903
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:37,730
found out about your wife. See, can't
do that. You're going to go on a fucking

904
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:42,050
a hate fuck pussy spree. That is, yeah.

905
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:47,210
You don't want to do that. Um, you
said, am I wasting my time? Yeah, dude,

906
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,110
it's over. She's not happy.
She's not good at communicating.

907
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,440
Um, she puts a lid on it, you know, until
it boils over. This is the deal, dude.

908
00:53:57,441 --> 00:54:01,190
You know what I, this is
going to kill you. All right,

909
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,180
let's go with the positive. You
don't have any kids with her. Okay?

910
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,710
You can just walk away. Okay.

911
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:14,240
We had a prop and there was a, there's
nothing we could do. It's over.

912
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,730
He didn't make it. Did you just fucking
walk away? Just walk away. It's over.

913
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,420
All right. Um, that's a good
thing. All right. One thing.

914
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:24,830
You've had a bunch of
kids with his fucking,

915
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:29,400
this person who for whatever
reason, couldn't say that they will.

916
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,910
I don't think that she wanted
even wanting to fucking marry you.

917
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,550
I think she ignores her feelings.

918
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,110
She's actually having a
fucking breakthrough right
now while stomping all over

919
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:42,680
your fucking heart. All right, well

920
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,120
I dunno. I don't know. I don't fuck her.

921
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,550
Give me a break, dude. You fucking,
you loved her with all your heart.

922
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,720
You say a mother's a sweetheart. You
got dogs. You like communicating dude.

923
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:00,160
You know something your like
the fucking guy. You're the guy.

924
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:04,450
My girl wants me to be. Every
fucking woman wants a guy like that.

925
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:08,170
You know guy who actually wants to be
married guy who actually comes home and

926
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,004
communicates,

927
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,550
you know a guy who gets along with
the mom and all that type of shit.

928
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:14,950
You're a family man. All
right. Unfortunately,

929
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,430
you know you met the wrong
person, so forget that dude.

930
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,860
All right. Forget it. Forget it. Fuck
that. Fuck dead. It's over. Walk away.

931
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,860
Well, walk away dude.
Give me a fuck about you.

932
00:55:29,861 --> 00:55:32,780
You know what you're talking about
there. You're talking about like the,

933
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:37,120
the amount of fucking shit she has to
go through before she even learns how to

934
00:55:37,121 --> 00:55:41,320
just communicate her fucking emotions
and the frustration of that's going to

935
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:44,050
meet every once in a while she's
going to blow somebody at work.

936
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,960
Are you wasting your time?
APP's a fucking Luli. Okay.

937
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,460
Apps of Fucking Luli.

938
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:56,170
And as far as like going there and
trying to fuck over that other guy,

939
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:59,170
that other guy is, he's already,
you don't need to fuck him over.

940
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:02,210
He's fucking himself over. He's living,

941
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,240
he's living a life of misery.

942
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:10,050
That life is miserable to fuck
around with the person that you with,

943
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,180
with somebody else. That
is a miserable life.

944
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,340
You know, I don't know.

945
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,970
They get something that a lot of guys do.

946
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:21,870
Myself included back in the day in my
twenties going into the thirties trying to

947
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:26,470
fucking, uh, you know, figure
myself out. I lived that life,

948
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:29,180
that whole fucking double. It's
horrible. It's a fucking horrible thing.

949
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,123
Then in the end,

950
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:34,870
I ended up alone and I heard a lot of
people and I was a complete piece of shit.

951
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,000
So, and believe me, dude,

952
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:39,580
it was miserable and ended up
with me on a fucking futon.

953
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:46,390
Um, yeah, dude, you're, you're, you know,

954
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,800
don't become a piece of shit. Now.
Don't judge other women like that.

955
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:55,750
Just fuck it. You know?
Yeah. Get out of it.

956
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,940
Get out of it and just know
that it's gonna be a fucking a,

957
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:01,450
I dunno,

958
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,630
it's gonna be a hundred yards of pain
that you never fucking dealt with in your

959
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:08,290
life and you just gotta
go through it. And, um,

960
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,780
I would say the next time you
get with somebody, uh, make,

961
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:17,600
you know you're going to get serious with
somebody who would make God damn sure

962
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,250
that they know how to fucking
communicate, because that's a,

963
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,600
that's a scary thing to get with a woman
who does not communicate because that's

964
00:57:23,601 --> 00:57:25,730
something that they're supposed
to teach us how to do. You know,

965
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,600
in a way they make you better
because you, oh, all I can just say,

966
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,290
uh, no, I don't feel like doing that
without fucking punched in the wall.

967
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:36,740
You know, they do that set of sell
you down if you get with some psycho.

968
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:41,300
And she can't settle you down. I
mean, she's a, she's damaged Chris

969
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,710
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

970
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:16,820
all right. 27 year old
Virgin Jesus Christ.

971
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,890
Hey Billy, I'd love to hear your
humorous take on my pathetic situation.

972
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:26,120
First of all, dude, let's work
on yourself estate. All right.

973
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:30,410
You're already shitting all over
yourself. I'm all right. Watch this guy.

974
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:35,250
Watch him shit all over himself. I'm
a 27 year old virgin. Oh geesh. Uh,

975
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,960
that's what he wrote.

976
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,780
Now your first question is going to
be how the fuck did that happen? Well,

977
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,800
to protect myself,

978
00:58:39,801 --> 00:58:42,620
I'd actually preserved prefer to keep
my background as quiet as possible. Hey,

979
00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:45,650
I'm not trying to get you to rat
yourself out. Here's what I can say.

980
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:50,570
I come from a rich town inhabited by
obnoxious cause I was always the weird kid

981
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:54,080
and very socially awkward people
hated me no matter how nice I was.

982
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:55,790
Jesus Christ. Dude,

983
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,930
are you like a superhero that's like
the exact same background of like every

984
00:58:59,931 --> 00:59:03,830
fucking superhero movie, isn't
it? Probably Cause Nerds, right?

985
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,070
Those movies cause they don't have to
fight and all of a sudden you're like,

986
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:10,670
what am I knew how to play? What am I
could fly? I was a guy who could save me.

987
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:12,290
Um,

988
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:17,290
and then they draw it and then nerds
line up around the block to go see it.

989
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,150
New Spiderman. Yes. It's
exactly the other ones. Um,

990
00:59:23,151 --> 00:59:26,900
I was always the weird kid and very
socially awkward people hated me no matter

991
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:30,680
how nice I was. And eventually I
came to hate myself and still do.

992
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,270
I called it dude, I fucking called
it a, he's shitting all over himself.

993
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Eventually it was discovered that I most
likely have a mild case of Asperger's

994
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,140
syndrome, which is a mild form of
autism, which is way out of my league.

995
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,870
Are you guys trying to make me
look dumb? I thought I did that.

996
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,390
I achieved that by how
awful. I read out loud.

997
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,160
[inaudible]

998
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,960
here we go. That causes social ineptitude
and Quirky personality traits. Well,

999
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:02,050
I would go find a hooker with asbergers.
That's the first thing I would do.

1000
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,200
You get the Fucking v off my
back. Definitely wear a condom.

1001
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,660
See that's where my advice
is going to be coming from.

1002
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,350
You guys have some weird
conversation in some ironic vehicle.

1003
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,020
I'm at least discovering this made me
more of self-aware and I've been able to

1004
01:00:17,021 --> 01:00:19,300
clean up my act over the last few years,

1005
01:00:19,301 --> 01:00:22,450
but I still have a lot of social anxiety
and shyness and very few friends.

1006
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:25,540
On the flip side, I'm actually
pretty decent looking,

1007
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,600
have a decent job in a
laboratory. He's a fucking,

1008
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,650
he's going to get bit by something
radioactive and he's going to become a

1009
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,930
superhero. Uh,

1010
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,580
and I'm a certified commercial
pilot and do volunteer work

1011
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:46,230
dude. Like you know something.
If, if I was in the FBI,

1012
01:00:46,231 --> 01:00:50,100
like so many fucking red flags
just went up there. Uh, okay.

1013
01:00:50,101 --> 01:00:53,070
That's the set up now.
Now for the question

1014
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,360
first, what the fuck would you
do if you were in my situation?

1015
01:00:57,361 --> 01:01:01,140
I told you I'd get a hooker
with Asperger's syndrome
and you guys could just

1016
01:01:01,141 --> 01:01:05,750
bond over that. Uh, I
don't know. Let, let me,

1017
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:06,680
let me read all your questions.

1018
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,010
I'm obviously kidding off trying to find
a hook with Asperger system syndrome.

1019
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,620
All right. You couldn't find one that
would be like a needle in a haystack,

1020
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,070
which you'd have to do is go to an escort
service and request that personally.

1021
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,970
Um, I would think

1022
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,870
I'm looking for 36, 24 36 with Asperger.

1023
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,353
Okay.

1024
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:32,550
Hair color does not matter. Yes,
I can hold 'em next if ever.

1025
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,790
If eventually everything I ever do
make it anywhere with the chick.

1026
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,910
Should I tell her up
front about my status?

1027
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:42,420
I had this conversation a few weeks ago
with a friend who has a lot of romantic

1028
01:01:42,421 --> 01:01:46,740
experience and she said it would be
extremely obvious that I'm new to the game

1029
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:51,270
and that withholding that information
could itself be detrimental.

1030
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:55,050
But I also know that if I do tell
a chicken 27 year old virgin,

1031
01:01:55,051 --> 01:01:59,340
she will demand an explanation before
going any further and it will send up red

1032
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,500
flags for the most. What do you do?

1033
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,800
Built thanks to doing your awesome
podcast and go fuck yourself. All right,

1034
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:05,634
this is what I would do.

1035
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:12,050
I would just start hitting on every check
that fucking interests me and I would

1036
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:16,940
be just totally honest. Tell him,
tell her what your, your, uh,

1037
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,130
your situation is. And uh, you know,

1038
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,500
if she doesn't accept it,

1039
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:25,920
then fucker let her walk and then you
don't have to deal with any of the

1040
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:27,180
bullshit. You didn't or you just,

1041
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:31,430
you just fast forward through a three
year fucking horrific relationship. Um,

1042
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:32,670
I would just be upfront with people.

1043
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:36,600
I wouldn't open it with a at you have
beautiful eyes and I have Asperger.

1044
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:41,490
I wouldn't do that, you know? Um,
I would work on my self esteem.

1045
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,700
I wouldn't talk shit. You just, you
shit on yourself right out of the gate.

1046
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:45,451
I mean,

1047
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:47,820
obviously I knew you're going to do
that when you said you were 27 year old

1048
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:52,490
virgin and you probably going
to go that route, but uh,

1049
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,370
think good thoughts about yourself,
man. I know that's kind of like simple,

1050
01:02:56,371 --> 01:03:01,080
but I, you know, you gotta like you
got to amp yourself up a little bit,

1051
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,840
go out there and you know, you
don't have to go find the check.

1052
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,980
He had drains but just go out.

1053
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,650
You don't get to tell some girl he got
fucking Asperger syndrome. You don't,

1054
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:12,670
why don't you just do that with somebody
that you're really interested in but it

1055
01:03:12,671 --> 01:03:15,470
just want to go out and get laid. Just
go out there, start hitting on checks,

1056
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,200
turn it into a game so you don't have
to deal with the pain of the rejection.

1057
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,210
Just be like, alright, I don't have
the balls to take the next step.

1058
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:28,020
Whatever that step is. Peeling
yourself off the fucking wall.

1059
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,070
Striking up a conversation, just
saying hello to a pretty girl.

1060
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:33,180
She walks down the street.

1061
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:37,020
Just try to get over that fucking hurdle
and give you permit yourself permission

1062
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,690
to suck and you just, you
gradually build it up.

1063
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:40,950
It's like learning how to play guitar.

1064
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:43,320
You're not going to pick it
up and immediately be able
to play all your songs.

1065
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:47,520
You learned a couple of fucking chords,
you know? Then your fingers hurt, right?

1066
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:48,390
And you get frustrated,

1067
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,610
but you keep coming back and
eventually you can fucking play.

1068
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,850
Pussy is no different.

1069
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:00,690
That's what I would do. Put the Asperger
on the back burner. Who knows too.

1070
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:04,800
Maybe not as fucked up as you think you
are socially. You know what? I mean,

1071
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,610
maybe you got a sense of humor under that.

1072
01:04:06,611 --> 01:04:10,080
I think you do your shit on
yourself in a funny way. You know,

1073
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:14,860
spin it around that way. Do you
have any interests? Go, go to, oh,

1074
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,400
go to a fucking, I dunno,
whatever. You know, you fly kites,

1075
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:18,460
go to some flying again in the code

1076
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:21,240
convention. There's gotta be
some woman there also likes Kate.

1077
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,560
I know that was an overly simplified
thing, but that's what I would do.

1078
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,023
All right.

1079
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:32,410
And then when you go to like a
hookup with somebody, a nice,

1080
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:34,900
you know, NGS, tell them
if he start and you're not,

1081
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:38,480
don't know what you're doing to watch
a couple of fucking pornos, you know,

1082
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:42,350
you'll get the idea. Actually,
no, don't do that. Don't do that.

1083
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:45,110
Cause then you'll suck. Just start
slapping them around. You don't do that.

1084
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:49,970
I know what to tell you, dude. I get
buy some books. I say go buy some,

1085
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,990
buy some books and that, that, uh,
that, that part of the bookstore that,

1086
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:56,930
you know, if, if bookstores
exist anymore, go on, go online.

1087
01:04:56,931 --> 01:04:59,840
There's gotta be plenty
of information. I bet.

1088
01:04:59,841 --> 01:05:04,820
If you literally looked up finger banging
technique, if you looked how to kiss,

1089
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,190
I bet this is going to be
reams of fucking information.

1090
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:14,210
I've never done that because I never had
to. Oh, just kidding. Of course I had.

1091
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:17,710
Do you think that I've been wished that
fucking information was around way back

1092
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:18,900
in the day when he had no id,

1093
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,990
just practice kissing your fucking pillow
and tried to overhear conversations in

1094
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:26,470
the fucking high school cafeteria and try
to figure out what people were talking

1095
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:30,250
about. That's all I could do. You, you
have the whole world that you fingertips,

1096
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,593
you know?

1097
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,760
So when you're done in the laboratory
working with radioactive shit before you,

1098
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,910
you get bit by something you don't
want you to go on and get late.

1099
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:40,970
Okay.

1100
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,310
Before you learned how to
fly. Alright. All right.

1101
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:09,840
[inaudible].
