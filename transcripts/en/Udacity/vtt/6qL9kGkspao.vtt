00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
We created the today layout 
so why doesn't it show up?

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.110
The reason is because we're
using a simple CursorAdapter.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.070
Remember that it creates a list item 
for every row in the cursor,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.050
but it only supports one item view type.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.510
That means that all list items 
must use the same layout.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.880
If we want today's forecast 
to look differently

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.730
we're going to need to create 
a custom CursorAdapter.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.284
That way we can have 
multiple item view types.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:26.173
Then we can have different 
list item layouts based on what row

00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:27.856
of the cursor we're looking at.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:31.630
Note that the concept of item view types 
applies to adapters in general,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.370
not just the CursorAdapter.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.150
If you open up the documentation
for CursorAdapter,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.080
you'll see that it's an abstract class.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.216
It contains two abstract methods 
that you'll need to override,

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:45.052
the bindView method
as well as the newView method.

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:47.580
The newView method knows 
how to return a new list item layout

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.330
but doesn't contain data yet.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.020
The bindView method knows 
how to take an existing layout

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.990
and update it with the data 
pointed to by the cursor.
