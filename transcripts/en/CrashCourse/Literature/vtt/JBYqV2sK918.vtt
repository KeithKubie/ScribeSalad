00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.680
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
literature, and today we’re going back to

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.980
the future–that is now past–to George
Orwell’s 1984, which imagines a terrifying

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.980
world in which every human activity is recorded
and monitored.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.660
How unpleasant would that be, he said staring
into a camera lens.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.029
So, as mentioned in our previous episode,
the Newspeak language created in the book

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.329
was intended “to make speech [...] as nearly
as possible independent of consciousness”

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.329
(319).

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.880
In an episode of Crash Course Psychology,
my brother, Hank, defined “consciousness”

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.180
as “our awareness of ourselves and our environment.”

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.870
I would add that consciousness also explains
our ability to experience life and to feel

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.870
emotions.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.990
So can the structure of a language actually
be “independent of human consciousness.”?

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.510
Well, today, we’ll explore whether language
is imposed on us from the outside or whether

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.190
it’s an innate feature of humanity.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.150
I’m also gonna talk about how this novel
was perceived, when it was published, in the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.370
actual 1984, and how people think about it
today.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.570
And we’ll go ahead and make some connections
between Orwell’s novel and our current society’s

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.249
really confusing relationship with truth and
surveillance.

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:08.490
Yeah, we can still criticize surveillance
society.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
that’s not a thoughtcrime.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.570
Yet..

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.549
INTRO
In 1984, Orwell’s protagonist, Winston Smith,

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.659
works in the Records Department of the Ministry
of Truth (in Newspeak, known as “Minitrue”).

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.899
He adjusts financial and weather forecasts
so that “Big Brother’s” predictions

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.210
are always retroactively correct.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.040
He also removes references to “unpersons,”
or “vaporised” political dissidents.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.460
And he rewrites history so that Oceania appears
always to have been at war with EastAsia.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.630
Or with Eurasia.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.039
It changes, depending on shifting allegiances.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.109
The “central tenet” of Ingsoc (the version
of English Socialism practiced in Oceania)

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.359
is that the past is “mutable,” that it
has “no objective existence,” and it exists

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.459
only in “written records and in human memories.”

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.389
Orwell writes:
The past is whatever the records and the memories

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.530
agree upon.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.009
And since the Party is in full control of
all records and in equally full control of

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.080
the minds of its members, it follows that
the past is whatever the Party chooses to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080
make it” (219).

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.810
So, Winston mainly writes in Newspeak--a version
of English with grammar and vocabulary designed

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.540
to “narrow the range of thought.”

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.370
The idea is that, without the language to
express dissent, political crimes, in thought

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.080
or deed, will become impossible.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.910
But quickly, before we get to the chicken
and egg problem of language and thought, though,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.430
I want to pause to ask you to think about
this novel’s relationship to memory.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.720
Now, we know from neuroscience that each time
a memory is accessed, you’re remembering

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.810
it anew--there’s no, like, spot in your
brain containing a memory; it is formed each

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.980
time you have it.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.810
And that means that your memories are shaped
by your now--and that at least to some extent,

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.730
the Party is right when it says that telling
people what they remember does change their

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.730
memories.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.500
So, the Party is manipulating a real, structural
feature of the human brain--as we learned

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.790
in our discussion of Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s
One Hundred Years of Solitude, “What matters

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.739
in life is not what happens to you but what
you remember and how you remember it.”

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.439
OK, so with that noted, let’s turn to thought:
Many experts have explored to what extent

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.680
our ability to think is dependent on language.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.349
In the late 1920s, the ethno-linguist Edward
Sapir began talking in academic circles about

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.409
his theory that the structure of the language
a person uses determines how they perceive

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.349
and categorize experience.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.939
When his student, Benjamin Whorf, published
his writings in the 1950s, this theory became

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.579
known as “the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.”

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.400
Then, in the 1960s, Noam Chomsky questioned
the premise of this theory, arguing that humans

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.299
are born with an innate knowledge of grammar
that forms the basis for language acquisition.

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.390
And in 1994, Steven Pinker argued that language
is a basic instinct, and that the ability

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.280
to understand, manipulate, and add to it based
on one’s own experiences is an expression

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
of one’s humanity.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.069
In fact, he wrote a book called The Language
Instinct.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.580
But before any of these theories were published,
Orwell was also thinking about the relationship

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.430
between instinct and language.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.480
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.670
The word “instinct” appears 31 times in
1984.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.580
Winston is a creature of instinct, and his
strongest instinct is to survive: “To hang

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.120
on from day to day and from week to week,
spinning out a present that had no future,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.669
seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as
one's lungs will always draw the next breath

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.650
so long as there is air available” (emphasis
added, 155).

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.860
Winston understands that his society is inhumane:
“It MIGHT be true that the average human

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.780
being was better off now than he had been
before the Revolution.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.000
The only evidence to the contrary was the
mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.699
feeling that the conditions you lived in were
intolerable and that at some other time they

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.020
must have been different” (emphasis added,
76).

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.080
So to Orwell there are human instincts toward
generosity and survival and liberty, but Orwell

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.660
is also aware how dangerous human instincts
can be, particularly when manipulated by a

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.660
totalitarian state.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.610
For example, the Party transforms an innate
fear of death into mob violence:

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.380
“For how could the fear, the hatred, and
the lunatic credulity which the Party needed

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.419
in its members be kept at the right pitch,
except by bottling down some powerful instinct

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.030
and using it as a driving force?”

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.030
(emphasis added, 136).

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.199
It also transforms the survival instinct into
a form of self-repression: “Crimestop”

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:25.039
is the ability to cut off one’s ideas, “...as
though by instinct, at the threshold of any

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.039
dangerous thought” (217).

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.039
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.820
But of course, those thoughts are only dangerous
because the government might kill you for

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.820
having them.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.349
But -- and I think this is critical -- writing
in Newspeak and participating in Party rallies

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.900
alone does not alter Winston’s consciousness,
and it doesn’t seem to change his instincts

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.540
-- he’s still able to love Julia, and in
little ways to live his “ownlife” life.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.470
But then, eventually, Winston does betray
his girlfriend, Julia, and he comes to believe

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.880
that he “should” repress his thoughts.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.870
So ultimately, he loses his sense of self.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.509
But not, I would argue, entirely because of
Newspeak.

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.270
Mostly because of torture.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.639
In the end his consciousness can’t survive
being threatened with having his head put

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.690
in a cage with hungry rats.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.030
It is then that Winston breaks down and wishes
that Julia receive this punishment in his

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.030
place.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.319
And by betraying Julia, he loses his ability
to love.

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.710
He loses faith in his own humanity.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.360
And after Winston is psychologically broken,
he starts to think in Newspeak.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.550
Consider his stream of (non-) conscious narrative:
“The mind should develop a blind spot whenever

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.759
a dangerous thought presented itself.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.919
The process should be automatic, instinctive.

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.250
CRIMESTOP, they called it in Newspeak” (emphasis
added, 288).

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.420
So initial use of Newspeak might be part of
Winston’s journey toward the lack of consciousness,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.640
but it’s the physical and psychological
torture that really take him there.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.770
And with that in mind, we can turn to the
question of whether words actually matter.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.270
I mean, can ‘good’ language or ‘good’
books enhance the human experience?

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.270
I believe so.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.129
And I think Orwell must have believed so,
too, or else he wouldn’t have written 1984.

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.720
And as we talked about in the last video,
we know that free expression survives within

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.819
the logic of the novel, because the appendix
is written in Standard English

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.190
It also refers to the totalitarian government
in the past tense.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.080
So we know that humanity eventually triumphs
over oppression and oppressive language!

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.280
Free thought and free speech endure!

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.289
Great, but Orwell doesn’t tell us how those
victories were won.

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.530
One minute, Winston is in love with Big Brother,
the next minute, Appendix in Standard English.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.330
But that hasn’t stopped readers from trying
to use 1984 to diagnose (and solve) problems

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.810
unique to their times.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.669
Like, when 1984 was first published, Time
Magazine claimed that “any reader in 1949

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:42.010
can uneasily see his own shattered features
in Winston Smith, can scent in the world of

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.159
1984 a stench that is already familiar.”

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:49.389
Other early reviewers at the time read 1984
as an attack on British Socialism.

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:51.610
In a letter to a friend, Orwell explained
that the novel:

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.319
“...is NOT intended as an attack on Socialism
or on the British Labor Party (of which I

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:01.979
am a supporter) but as a show-up of the perversions
to which a centralized economy is liable and

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:05.800
which have already been partly realized in
Communism and Fascism.”

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.500
In the years after the book was published,
readers began associating Orwell’s name

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.879
with the forms of oppression that he critiqued.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.879
Surveillance?

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:13.930
“Quite Orwellian!”

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.930
Propaganda?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.139
“Also Orwellian.”

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:17.330
But actually anti-Orwellian!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.810
In 1983, a Time Magazine journalist tried
to reappropriate the term “Orwellian”

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.789
to make it signify, “the spirit that fights
the worst tendencies in politics and society

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:28.970
by using a fundamental sense of decency.”

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.030
Of course, that was a failure.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.969
If you Google “Orwellian,” you’ll find
a long list of ways it has been applied to

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:36.209
various misuses of government power.

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:37.209
Poor Orwell.

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:41.419
Not since Dr. Frankenstein has someone so
often been inappropriately alluded to.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.320
And then of course there is the question of
our today, and whether it resembles the Oceania

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.480
of 1984.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.320
In terms of politics, neither the U.S. nor
the U.K. look much like Oceania.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.209
Whatever you think of our elected officials,
they are just that.

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:56.209
Elected.

00:08:56.209 --> 00:09:00.180
In fact, a higher percentage of people on
Earth today live in democracies than did in

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.880
1949, or for that matter 1984.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.500
So it’s actually been a pretty good seven
decades for democracy, but, there are some

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.579
similarities between contemporary life and
the future that Orwell imagined:

00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:15.470
For instance our time has some serious issues
with the dissemination of objective fact.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.291
There’s a good reason that Stephen Colbert’s
word “truthiness,” meaning “a truth

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:24.040
that wouldn’t stand to be held back by fact”
was chosen by the American Dialect Society

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.720
as the word of the year in 2005.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.810
Propaganda, both subtle and overt, continue
to distort social and political discourse

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.810
around the world.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.920
And then there’s the issue of surveillance...
in Oceania, the government places microphones

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.920
and telescreens in public spaces and private
homes.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.200
And the telescreen is an addictive content
provider--broadcasting news, weather reports,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.980
and interactive exercise videos.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.610
It detects sounds above a whisper and movement
within its field of vision.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.730
In Winston’s apartment, it can be dimmed,
but not turned off completely.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.370
Creepier still: there was, “...no way of
knowing whether you were being watched at

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.560
any given moment” (3).

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.040
Today, we, too, have audio and video surveillance
in shops, and airports, and public parts of

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.288
big cities, and also in our homes--alexa,
can you make sure not to spy on me?

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:06.288
{[[Alexa, off-screen]] I’m sorry, John.

00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:07.288
I’m afraid I can’t do that.}

00:10:07.288 --> 00:10:08.288
I have to say, I don’t find that answer
terribly comforting.

00:10:08.288 --> 00:10:09.780
And this loss of privacy is the trade-off
that we make for increased security and convenience.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.940
But also, think about how much of your ownlife
and consciousness also exists out there in

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.139
the personal information you willingly post
online.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:21.490
We have Snapchat, and Instagram, and Twitter,
and Pinterest, and Tumblr, and WhatsApp, and

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.540
LinkedIn, and YouTube, and I think we still
have Google Plus.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.500
And if you’re waiting for me to denounce
social media, I’m not gonna.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.089
These are amazing ways to broadcast pictures
of yourself being cool and to publish your

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:31.420
thoughts from the sublime to the ridiculous.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.689
We indicate our preferences by liking, swiping,
reposting, and commenting.

00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:40.250
We tag all the wonderful places that we visit
and show everyone what we ate while we were

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.250
there.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.250
Social media is fun!

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.250
It’s awesome!

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.450
I’m in favor of it.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.020
But have you read the privacy policy of each
service you use?

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:54.090
There’s no question that something is lost
when you choose to make any part of your ownlife

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.090
public.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.890
Winston can’t turn off his telescreen.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:02.410
Many of us choose not to turn ours off , exposing
a lot of our ownlives to surveillance, and

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.300
I believe that does ultimately shape our lives.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.160
It’s certainly not a 1984-level control
of the private self--but it is worth considering.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.880
In our era, for those of us lucky enough to
live in democracies, Big Brother is not a

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.089
totalitarian government, able to alter the
consciousness of its citizens through various

00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:19.540
forms of torture.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.820
Instead, Big Brother is each of us.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.850
We are watching each other--in the best ways,
and the worst ways.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.380
Does this distract us from our physical bodies,
our animal desires, our bonds with real life

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.209
family and friends, our impulses to help others
(you know… that business of being conscious

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:36.209
and human)?

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:38.630
Or does it ultimately enhance our humanity?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.630
I don’t know.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.540
But I don’t think time spent considering
those questions is wasted.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.930
And that’s Orwell’s true genius: The questions
that he asked in 1949 about a hypothetical

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.890
1984: they’re timeless.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.459
What is the nature of humanity?

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:54.510
Which social orders best allow humanity to
flourish?

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.959
Which oppress it nearly beyond recognition?

00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:00.589
And what is the role of language and literature
in liberating the oppressed?

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:05.170
Keep asking those important questions and
you will be “Orwellian” in the most heroic

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.470
sense of the word.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.470
Thanks for watching.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.040
I’ll see you next time.
