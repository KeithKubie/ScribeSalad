00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.834
NARRATOR: Welcome to Moab,
Utah, surrounded by thousands

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:05.734
of square miles of
Mars-like Red Rock landscape

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:08.033
and the mighty Colorado River.

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.900
Surprisingly, Utah has yielded
fossils from more dinosaur

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.700
species than any other state.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.200
And that fact alone makes
for a thrilling story, 150

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.500
million years in the making.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.333
It involves the Civil War,
an incredible cargo airlift

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.967
mission, and the sight of
a dig that could unearth

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:25.667
a major discovery,
a missing piece

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.633
in the dinosaur family tree.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:31.266
Let's take a deeper look at how
the fossil and a long lost sea

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:31.967
are linked.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.000
In the early 1800s,
there was this patch

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.667
of desert in eastern Utah that
got some attention for being

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:42.433
an easy, natural crossing
point on the Colorado River,

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.567
along the old Spanish
Trail, good for trade.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:48.433
A few key railroad lines
later, it was 1859,

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:51.033
and a US geological expedition
discovered this giant,

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:52.867
awesome fossil in the area.

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.834
But before they get unearth
it, the Civil War broke out.

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:58.533
Yep, and the fossil
was long forgotten,

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.100
for almost 150 years.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.867
In 2014, National Geographic
explorer John Foster

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:06.166
picked up where the Civil War
and a few other scientists

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.166
in the '80s and '90s left off.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.000
And his excavation
team began to find

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.066
the remnants of a Sauropod.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.266
Huh?

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.100
Well, you've probably
heard of the Brontosaurus

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.633
or the Brachiosaurus.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:21.367
They're Sauropods-- long
necks, long tails, four-legged,

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:22.667
eats leaves.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.500
Turns out they have
a common ancestor.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.433
And at least in North
America, it might

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.100
be this guy, Dystrophaeus.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.934
But wait.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:31.967
Why are there dinosaurs here?

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.333
Where does this
leaf-eating dinosaur

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.800
get his greens in the desert?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.934
Well, this arid desert was
actually a long lost sea.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:41.633
190 million years ago,
this place was an oasis.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:45.200
Think spring break-- sandbars,
drinks with little umbrellas,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.233
but like the dinosaur version.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.500
Not a bad place for the
potentially oldest Sauropod

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.400
in North America to call home.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.600
Relocating this dinosaur
vertebrate for research

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.700
is no joke.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.133
Each piece weighs a
whopping 800 pounds

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.200
and has to be
covered in plaster.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.266
And the team is on
the edge of a cliff.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.433
It sounds like a job for--

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:09.333
the dinosaur fossil airlift
cargo helicopter service.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.900
OK, that's actually
not really a thing.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.300
But watch this.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.100
[helicopter motor]

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.266
Pretty unbelievable.

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:19.667
What Foster and his team began
unearthing in this long lost

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:21.867
sea could be a
missing link in North

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.233
America's dinosaur family tree.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:25.834
Welcome to the
family, Dystrophaeus.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.433
But that's not the whole story.
