00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.600
At this point, you know the possible activities, the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.520
possible phases performed during the software development process. But there

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.710
this something that we still haven't discussed, which is

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.910
very important. And that is how should we put these

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.990
activities together to develop software? And this all comes

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.360
down to the concept of software process model. Also called

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.520
software lifecycle model. And what this is, is a

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.470
prescriptive model of what should happen from the very beginning

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.960
to the very end. Of a software development process. The

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.360
main function of the life cycle model is to determine

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.290
the order of the different activities so that we know

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.920
which activities should come first and which ones should follow. Another

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.910
important function of the life cycle model is to determine

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.290
the transition criteria between activities. So, when we can go from

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.000
one phase to the subsequent one. In other words, what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840
the model should describe is what should we do next and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.450
how long should we continue to do it for each activity

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.290
in the model. Now let's see a few traditional software process

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.920
models. I will discuss them here at the high level and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000
then revisit some of these models in the different mini courses.
