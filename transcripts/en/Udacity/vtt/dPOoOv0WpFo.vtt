00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.470
So let's see if we can figure what
the problems are with UMA aka SMP

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.530
aka Multicore.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.280
Let's suppose that we want
to have a lot of cores and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.110
have them use this centralized
shared memory in a UMA SMP fashion.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.700
Which of these are problems we'll
have to face when we do this?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.230
First, memory needs to be very large and
thus slow for this type of a machine.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.700
Our main memory will get too
many accesses per second.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.300
Basically, we'll need a huge memory
throughput that a normal memory module

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.150
will not be able to provide.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.540
The next option is,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.030
we'll need a lot of small memory modules
in proportion to the number of cores.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.460
Next, our caches will have
very small block sizes.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340
And finally, the pages for

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.660
our virtual memory will become
too small to be usable.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.380
So, select all of those that are
problems for this type of architecture.
