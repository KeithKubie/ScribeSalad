00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Any time I tell people that I have 5 cats,

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:04.371
they all say the same thing:

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:05.226
"Oh wow.

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:07.434
Your house must smell."

00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:08.689
Uh, no, cause..

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.992
[hallelujah]

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:15.247
I'm used to the way that people react 
to how many cats I have,

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:17.364
and it's never really bothered me,

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:18.430
until recently.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.339
So I had this really weird moment when 
I was researching tortoise shell cats

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.384
and their "tortitudes", so cute,

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:26.342
when I read this article that said:

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.929
"Black cats are aloof, sometimes distant...

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.113
(ding)

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.490
Grey cats are very needy...

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.587
(ding)

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:34.240
Tabbies are very friendly...

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.520
(ding)

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.000
Orange cats are cuddly...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.215
(ding)

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.807
and Tortoise shell cats are vocal, ill-tempered, 
and like to boss around other cats.

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:43.215
(ding ding ding)

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.575
All of this is so spot on!

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.240
Oh my god.

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:48.540
Am I a crazy cat lady?

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:52.241
Wait no, I don't have a white cat. 
Ooh, I need to get a white cat..

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:53.746
I've been called a crazy cat lady.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.556
But am I one?

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.841
Hmm? Nn. Hmm?

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.584
(sweet music)

00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:03.449
Aw, it's missing Ghost..

00:01:03.898 --> 00:01:06.493
Here, come kitty! Here kitty kitty, come here kitty kitty!

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:08.180
Hi kitty kitty! (demonic) Hello kitty kitty..

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.802
And why is that such a bad thing? I mean, what is up
with the stigma against people who love kitties?

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:15.650
Cats are funny, they're cute, they're cuddly creatures..

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.618
and yet, people have a lot of negative things
to say about women who love them.

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:21.087
You're like, never gonna get married.

00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:23.435
Oh wow, you must be so emotionally unstable..

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.528
Oh my god, why? Dogs are so much better.

00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:30.184
If dogs are a man's best friend, 
cats are a woman's bestie.

00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:33.869
They were worshiped by ancient Egyptians, 
they're the cornerstone of the internet.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.395
They're the independent and elusive loves of our lives.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.240
Am I a crazy cat lady?

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.880
No.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:41.936
I'm just a cat lady.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:43.834
But if anyone can't handle that..

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:44.660
tough kitty.

00:01:45.153 --> 00:01:46.430
I'm Anna Akana.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.720
Stay awesome Gotham.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.372
I wanna say thank you to Tidy Cats 
for sponsoring today's video,

00:01:50.372 --> 00:01:54.365
I know! A match made in heaven 
cannot be more purrrrrrrfect.

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:58.436
If you find that you have stank face from the 
obnoxious odors of inferior kitty litters,

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:01.274
you must make the switch to Tidylock.

00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:02.838
My kitty Lily, she's the oldest,

00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:06.271
she's very particular about her litter 
box and the kind of litter I use,

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.588
especially cause she shares her whole 
bathroom area with 4 other roommates,

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:11.717
and she highly recommends it.

00:02:11.717 --> 00:02:15.684
