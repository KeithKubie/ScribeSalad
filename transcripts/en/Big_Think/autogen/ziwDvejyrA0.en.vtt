back but what happens to humans we our

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430
back but what happens to humans we our
 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.990
back but what happens to humans we our
brains are so active we imagine so many

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
brains are so active we imagine so many
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880
brains are so active we imagine so many
things and we're always looking for

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
things and we're always looking for
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.030
things and we're always looking for
cause and effect that is to say when you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
cause and effect that is to say when you
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.730
cause and effect that is to say when you
hear a bump in the night you want to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
hear a bump in the night you want to
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.859
hear a bump in the night you want to
know what caused it you want to know

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
know what caused it you want to know
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.389
know what caused it you want to know
what brought it on and the first thing

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
what brought it on and the first thing
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.060
what brought it on and the first thing
you might imagine is that there's some

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
you might imagine is that there's some
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.730
you might imagine is that there's some
body or some entity out there causing

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
body or some entity out there causing
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.069
body or some entity out there causing
this effect the bump but you can't see

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
this effect the bump but you can't see
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.600
this effect the bump but you can't see
it so then we intuitively are

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
it so then we intuitively are
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.480
it so then we intuitively are
instinctively for ancient reasons

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490
instinctively for ancient reasons
 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.970
instinctively for ancient reasons
put a pattern on it we imagine it has an

put a pattern on it we imagine it has an
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.740
put a pattern on it we imagine it has an
agent as we call it but there's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
agent as we call it but there's
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.480
agent as we call it but there's
something out there some agent is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
something out there some agent is
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.640
something out there some agent is
causing this but it could be the wind

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
causing this but it could be the wind
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.260
