know wander past him at one of these
scientific meetings and tell him how

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350
scientific meetings and tell him how
 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.020
scientific meetings and tell him how
much that his his show had meant to me

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030
much that his his show had meant to me
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.700
