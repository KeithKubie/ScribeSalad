00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.589
Hello You Tube, this is Bozidar Djelic, Deputy
Prime Minister of Serbian Minister of Science.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.200
Many open questions today in Davos. I pick
one. And that to recognize that over the last

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.700
decade the growth or trade and the increase
in investments in particular towards emerging

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.380
countries have been very important factors
in promoting democracy, social cohesion, and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.980
also taking a large number of people out of
poverty. That's something that happened too

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.160
largely in Serbia as well. Of course starting
form a role base indefinitely working that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.580
restation today. The question has raised whether
we can continue trading and having this increase

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.780
in investment. Today and in the past few days,
we have heard from leaders of the major countries.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.470
Many ideas of how to take us out of this difficult
spot. It's hardening to hear the leaders of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.080
Europe, leaders of India, leaders of Russia,
China and many other countries say that they

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.149
are ready to do their part to promote economic
growth. But the question is raised, how are

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:17.170
we going to be able to promote social cohesion
and the degree of strengthening an institutional

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.010
democracy with a smaller pie of investments.
And should we avoid being trapped into zero

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.889
someday or it everybody trying to out do or
to out compete or to dump in particular socially

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:36.200
on the neighbor. We believe, an I'll tell
you from the vantage point of which in Europe,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.060
that a solution is possible as long as big
blocks that have appeared over the last decade

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.950
work together to make sure that there is no
medium protectionism, to make sure that the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.720
door around is closed in the debate. And above
all to make sure that we find win win solutions

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.919
an the idea is not to close factories in Germany
to open them in emerging europe or to do the

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:08.929
same thing in other countries. So more consumption
in china and other emerging nations. And then

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.720
making sure that we continue trading together.
One of the more important things where we

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.099
need to provided more mobility but aldo find
common agreement is on tolerance. The demographic

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.980
situation in the world is such that rich countries,
medium people, and the one type of people

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.640
that they need most is educated people. But
then those larger countries end up absorbing

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.191
entire spots of elites from emerging countries.
There will be no development in those countries.

00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.280
And at the end of the day, not enough consumption
to support the rich ones. So let's make sure

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.900
that in the forth coming world of tolerance,
we also find common language the way that

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.180
we need to find in trade and investments.
They should not be worked out, they're should

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.920
be cooperation to make sure that the portions
are done the proper way all around the world.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.180
They really would be better off that way.
And that's the message coming from Bozidar

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.260
today.
