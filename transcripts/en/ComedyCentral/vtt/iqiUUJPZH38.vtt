- The time that I tried
masturbating,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.276
I ended up in the emergency
room.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:19.078
[laughter]

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.581
And it happened because I went
through this super-awkward

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.449
puberty leading up to it.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:26.219
Like, when I was 15, that was
the year that all of my friends

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.589
lost their virginity, and I was
the only one who hadn't yet,

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.390
so I felt really left out.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.426
Like, my friends would talk
about their favorite positions

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.328
at lunch, and I would just bury
myself in my sandwich like,

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.598
"Oh, cool, anal, ehh..."
like...

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.666
Like, I was so naive.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.102
I had a very Lisa Simpson vibe
in school.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:45.605
Like, a guy passed me a note in
math class.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.573
It just said "69" on it,

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.142
and I didn't know what that
meant yet.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.410
I thought he was starting a
math game with me.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:53.246
[laughter]

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.647
So I just built onto it.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.616
I was like, "69 divided by 3 is
23.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.251
Your turn."

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:03.289
[laughter]

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.957
He was like, "The fuck?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.462
No, this is not what you think
this is."

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.297
And I got teased for not
knowing,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.766
and I just, like, I kind of
snapped, right?

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.301
Like, there was too many things
building up.

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:17.970
I was so sick of feeling left
out and clueless,

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.006
and I was sick of waiting for a
boyfriend to lose

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.776
my virginity to, so I got this
crazy idea, and I was like,

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.647
"Okay, I'm
gonna stick something up there

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.949
"so that I'll know what sex
feels like

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.351
and I can feel cooler around my
friends."

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:36.222
I know how mentally unstable
this sounds, by the way.

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:39.492
Any time you go the homemade
dildo route,

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.494
never a great idea.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.863
But I was so desperate to fit
in that I just decided

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.832
to take matters into my own
pussy, so, you know,

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:50.870
I was, like, this is happening
now.

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:54.240
So...so I went home from
school,

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.509
and I decided to, like, you
know, look around the house

00:02:56.542 --> 00:03:00.179
for an object to lose my
virginity to.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.847
[laughter]

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.517
You know, and just like
anyone's first time,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.085
I was super nervous.

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:08.721
Oh, my God.

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.590
And I went to my mom's bathroom
closet,

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.659
because it was just full of,
like, phallic wonders, right?

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:16.062
Just, like, Sonicare toothbrush
handles

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.864
and travel-sized shampoo
bottles.

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:20.733
But the thing that really
caught my eye was,

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:24.370
she had this handheld manicure
tool.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:26.239
You could put little
attachments on top to, like,

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:29.842
buff your nails, but the
handle was shaped like a dick.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.078
A little too much like a dick,
by the way.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.213
Like, whoever designed it was
definitely targeting

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:38.884
curious teenage girls
and lonely housewives.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.253
It was bright blue.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:41.687
It looked like Papa Smurf's
boner.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.390
Just, ugh.
Just so awkward.

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:47.126
The only problem I didn't
notice at the time

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.231
was that it was made of a
grippy rubber material.

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:53.599
Yeah.

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.401
There's a little foreshadowing
for you.

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:57.737
But again, I knew nothing about
that hole and, like,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.573
what should or shouldn't go in
there.

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:03.643
So...
[sighs]

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.879
So I drop my pants, and I, you
know,

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:10.549
put my foot up on the side of
the tub, as you do.

00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:12.318
[laughter]

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.586
You know.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:14.720
Hi, sir, by the way.

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:16.656
This is...
[sighs]

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.092
Weird for both of us.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.994
And I--I started to try and,
you know, like,

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:26.098
make this happen, but I'm not
aroused by anything

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:26.999
that's going on.

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.268
Frankly, I'm terrified,

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:31.771
so I'm as dry as a dead man's
mouth.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:35.008
[laughter]

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:42.615
And my body is not helping me
at all.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:46.118
So that combined with this
grippy rubber material,

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.354
it's like a kid trying to go
down an unsoaked Slip 'N Slide.

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:49.655
It's just, like...

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:53.526
[laughter]

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.328
Nothing.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:59.699
So I stop for a sec, and the
sane part of my brain is like,

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:02.001
"Dude, this is clearly not
meant to be.

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:04.804
You just need to wait to have
regular-person sex."

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.439
[laughter]

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:10.543
And then the crazy part of my
brain was like,

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.312
"I'm not a fucking quitter."

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:16.949
[laughter]

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:19.151
I'm already crouched over naked
like Gollum.

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:21.721
Like, we've come this far.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.356
Let's just throw the Hail Mary.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.693
So all of my desperation to fit
in

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:32.665
fueled my tiny pubescent wrist
until I fit the manicure tool

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:35.134
all the way inside of me.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:36.836
And then I just stood there
frozen for a second

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.538
with it in me like, "Uhh."

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.341
And then I threw it out, and I
threw it in the trash,

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:44.677
and I got in the shower to,
like, wash the shame off of me.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.479
[laughter]

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:50.683
And I knew that something was
horribly wrong right away,

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:54.987
because I started to feel a
burning and itching sensation.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.356
And I was like, "Oh, fuck.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.593
"Okay, I'll look at it with a
mirror,

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.895
and maybe it will look
fine."

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:06.199
[laughter]

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:14.874
What I saw in that mirror still
haunts my dreams

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:17.543
to this day.

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:22.548
My crotch had swollen shut.

00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.717
[laughter]

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.354
Closed like the bank on a
Sunday.

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:32.291
My pussy looked like Rocky's
eye turned sideways.

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:35.395
[laughter]

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.736
Yeah, no bueno.

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.938
So my stomach dropped.

00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:47.573
I was like, "Oh, my God.

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:49.542
"I need medical attention.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:51.911
"I'm gonna have to tell a
doctor exactly what

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:55.080
"I just did, but before that,

00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:56.882
"I'm gonna have to tell my mom,

00:06:56.915 --> 00:06:58.417
"because I need somebody to
drive me

to the doctor's office."

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:02.054
Like, my puberty is just
flashing before my eyes.

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:03.422
Everything's coming to an end.

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:05.424
So my mom is in bed at this
point.

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:08.761
She's doing, like, a crossword
puzzle or something momsie.

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:11.263
I walk in pale as a ghost.

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:12.965
And she sees me, and she's
like,

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:14.166
"What's going on with you?
What's wrong?"

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.903
And I was like, "Um...

00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:21.607
"I don't
know how to tell you this,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.244
because you're never gonna see
me the same way again."

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:28.747
[laughter]

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.984
And she was like, "Sweetie,

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:36.255
nothing you tell me can make
me stop loving you."

00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:37.790
[laughter]

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.592
[sighs]

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.928
And I was like, "Let's not say
things we can't take back."

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:47.633
[laughter]

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:49.435

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:52.304
"I wanted to know what
sex felt like,

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:55.774
"so I took your manicure tool,

00:07:55.807 --> 00:07:59.945
and I put it..."

00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:03.182
[laughter]

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.820
"I put it inside me, and now my
vagina's gone."

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:11.057
[laughter]

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.635
And my mom was like, "Wow.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:27.339
"Well, we were gonna have
corn dogs for dinner, but..."

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:28.707
[laughter]

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.011
"Now that seems like a safety
hazard, so..."

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:35.681
[laughter]

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.416
She's like, "All right, get in
the car; here we go,

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:38.751
going to the doctor's office,"
so we drove down

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.185
to the emergency clinic.

00:08:40.218 --> 00:08:41.654
I grew up in this tiny town.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.589
I'd been seeing the same family
doctor

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:45.491
since I was, like, five years
old.

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:49.228
He's this 60-year-old Christian
man,

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:53.766
very Steve from "Blue's Clues"
type of energy,

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:56.035
not great for the situation.

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.736
He has no idea how to handle
it.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:59.605
He's just like, "Okay, Kelsey,

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:03.709
we're all a little confused as
to what you did."

00:09:03.742 --> 00:09:05.110
[laughter]

00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:07.446
"Something with a--a manicure
tool?

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:09.949
Susan, do you know?
Nope, nobody knows, okay."

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:13.352
[laughter]

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:14.920
"Do I need to have a little
look-see

00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:19.024
I'm like, "Just put me down
like an old animal.

00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:21.226
Oh, my God.
I can't do this."

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:24.530
So he straps on his miner's
headlight...

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:27.600
[laughter]

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.038
To go spelunking for treasure.

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:35.541
[laughter]

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:37.409
And he goes down, and he pokes
around with a Q-tip

00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:39.411
a little bit, and he comes back
up, and he's like,

00:09:39.444 --> 00:09:42.081
"All right, so, you know, from
all the swelling and burning

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.049
"and inflammation, I can deduce

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:46.085
"that you are allergic to
latex.

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:49.888
"So, you know, going forward,
that means no latex condoms,

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.423
"no latex gloves.

00:09:51.456 --> 00:09:54.293
"Please don't do anything with
balloon animals.

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:55.995
No."

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.597
[laughter]

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.166
"Let's not do that."

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:03.302
So I left the clinic that day
with that knowledge

00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:05.304
that I'm allergic to latex.

00:10:05.337 --> 00:10:07.840
All my future boyfriends have
been very happy about that,

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:12.778
right, you know, just high
fives all around, no condoms.

00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:14.580
I'm just riddled with disease.

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:17.650
[laughter]

00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:23.489
Unfortunately, I didn't redeem

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.758
my awkward reputation at
school.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.293
You know, I did all that to try
and fit in, and instead,

00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:30.496
word spread around the school
of what happened,

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:32.264
and everybody was like, "Hey,
old hairy bush

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:34.500
"made her pussy disappear;
check that out.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.803
Look at that, the world's worst
magician over here."

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:39.338
[laughter]

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:40.973
I was so embarrassed.

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:42.441
Like, this haunted me for ten
years.

00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:44.443
I was just mortified about it.

00:10:44.476 --> 00:10:47.513
And I honestly thought I was
done with my latex encounters

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:50.716
until two years ago when I
moved to Los Angeles

00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:53.352
and I went to a new doctor for
my annual exam,

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:55.287
and I was lying back on the
table.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.823
He did the whole, like, fingers
inside you business,

00:10:57.856 --> 00:11:02.828
and then I sat up as he was
taking his gloves off,

00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:07.132
and I was like "Oh, no."

00:11:07.165 --> 00:11:09.835
I was like, "Are those latex
gloves?"

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:13.038
And he was like, "Yeah, do you
have an allergy?"

00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:15.474
And I was like, "Yeah."

00:11:15.507 --> 00:11:17.576
And he was like, "Oh, I'm so
sorry.

00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:20.479
What happens when you come into
contact with it?"

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:24.516
And I was like, "My vagina
tries to kill itself."

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:27.586
[laughter]

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.857
And he was like, "Oh, shoot.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.394
"Okay, well, there's not much I
can do for you right now.

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:37.162
"I can prescribe you some cream

00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:38.864
that you can spread down
there."

00:11:38.897 --> 00:11:41.734
I was like, "It's not a bagel.
I don't..."

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.737
[laughter]

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.371
"I don't want to do that."

00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:48.707
So he writes me this
prescription,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.777
and he walks out, and I'm just
standing there so pissed.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.847
I'm like, "There's no way I'm
going through this again.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.216
Like, there has to be a way
around this."

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.551
So my survival instincts
kicked in.

00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:02.354
And I locked the doctor's
office door behind me.

00:12:02.387 --> 00:12:03.856
And I got another crazy idea.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.558
I was like, "Okay, I'm gonna
masturbate,

00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:09.695
"because if I can make myself
come,

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:14.066
"I might be able to flush out
the allergens

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.635
before a reaction starts."

00:12:16.668 --> 00:12:19.271
I think Bill Nye would be
pretty proud of my plan.

00:12:19.304 --> 00:12:21.106
[laughter]

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:23.909
There's obviously no scientific
research behind this at all.

00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:26.078
But I was just, like, I just
have to try this.

00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:27.913
I have to go for it.

00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:29.648
I'm also standing there, like,
I can't believe that ten years

00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:31.550
ago I tried masturbating and I
gave myself

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:33.218
an allergic reaction, and now
I'm gonna masturbate

00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:35.788
to try to not have an allergic
reaction.

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:39.658
Really a decade of doing the
Lord's work, this one.

00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:42.094
So I'm racing against the clock
at this point.

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:44.429
Like, this reaction's coming,
so I drop my pants,

00:12:44.462 --> 00:12:45.998
and I just, like, I close my
eyes.

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.100
I try to, like, find a way to
be turned on.

00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:50.002
I just--I picture that Channing
Tatum's behind me just, like,

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:51.770
you know, grinding it out
to some "Pony" by Ginuwine.

00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:54.573
You know, just, like, really
encouraging me.

00:12:54.606 --> 00:12:58.844
And by the power of Magic Mike,

00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:02.948
I came, and I did not have an
allergic reaction.

00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:04.283
Hey.

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.284
[cheers and applause]

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:07.019
Thank you.

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:09.488
Yeah.

00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:13.625
Sometimes you've got to be your
own douche.

00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:15.828
And now I think I should get
the letters "RX"

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:20.199
tattooed on these two fingers,
'cause they're the only

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:23.468
prescription I need,
motherfucker.

00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:26.138
All right, I'm Kelsey Cook.
Thanks so much, guys.

00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.673

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.141
<i> - Kelsey Cook, everybody.</i>

00:13:29.174 --> 00:13:31.210
<i> Give it up for Kelsey Cook.</i>
