Hey, what's up guys welcome back you might remember last week we tried making Coke Rockets using propane

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.290
We saw videos all over the internet claiming that you could mix propane and coke and getting them to blast off like a rocket

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.100
However, when we tried that we found that at the epic fail, oh boy

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.879
now when I discovered the propane does absolutely nothing it hit me and maybe something got lost in translation

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.359
Maybe the experiment is supposed to be done with butane

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.939
so the purpose of our experiment today it to see if we can get these coke bottle rockets blasting off using butane

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.949
So in preparation for this experiment. I went down to the local hardware store. I cleaned them out of butane

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
I bought everything they had now butane comes in canisters like this. It has very similar properties to propane

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.320
It's under pressure

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.250
And it's extreme fire hazard

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.709
Now getting this out in Liquid form is a lot easier than the propane all you have to do is pop off the cap turn

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.300
The canister upside down find a way to depress the nozzle and have some kind of a container to collect the liquid underneath

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.719
Alright, so we've got our butane. We've got our bottle of coke

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.269
Here's the basic idea of how the experiments going to work

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.459
First, we'll need to pour a little coke out of our coke bottle so the liquid levels off just below the lettering on Coca they're going

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.089
To take our caster of butane turn it upside down and squirt the butane into the bottle of coke

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.659
Until the liquid level rises to the top to label at that point

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.099
It's just a matter of loosely holding the bottle in our hands turning it upside down and watching the Magic happen

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.019
Here we go it's ready. Let's do this coke and butane  rocket see if it works

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.369
whoa

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.799
Bottle tipping over is like a slight delay, and then boom gone like a rocket because that's what it is Coke Rocket

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.250
That's the reaction I was looking for

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.019
It cleaned our bottle right out and now we can use this empty container to pour more butane

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.200
We can actually fill this thing all the way up and store it with the cap on because we found

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.319
Like propane we can store butane the coke bottle as well

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.089
interesting observation guys I just went through two of these canisters of butane filling up this coke bottle we made it to the top and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.759
Label there which is about three hundred fifty milliliters and that right there cost about ten dollars you're looking at ten Dollars of Liquid butane

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
guys crazy

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.649
All right guys. It's time for test number two this time

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.450
I poured out a little less liquid you through the top of the coke lines up with the topic later here weird of course will

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.369
Be obtained into the coke bottle it forms a layer about an inch high flip some coke bottle over the feet that takes off any

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.370
more vigorously

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.030
That's cold stuff

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.180
It froze my glove

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.360
Interesting that when you release the pressure it all spews out everywhere like a fountain and that is very cold liquid you see that quickly

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
We've already lost like a third of our container

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.599
Wow, it's amazing. How much of that liquid disappears? I just pour it in there slowly

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.500
the blows bubbles

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.349
There's some pretty quickly

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.889
There we go. That's a good amount of liquid way there

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.220
Sure for that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.470
Here we go

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.300
There's quite a bit of power to those things

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.829
They're not nearly as explosive as it's not they're going to be but they definitely work success

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.450
So this one has a little bit less butane, and it will keep that makes you different

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.279
Cool, so by hanging on to it a little bit longer actually got a little resistance. I like that one the best

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.339
this is the whole reason this works guys when you flip the coke bottle over the butane rises to the top because it's lighter than

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.160
the Coke itself

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.279
And because it's trapped us know where to go it rapidly builds pressure and forces the coke out of the mouth of the bottle creating

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.280
Thrust making it shoot off like a rocket

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.589
Now I do have to say that because our coke is cold it might be delaying the reaction if we had warm soda it would

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.010
probably happen a lot faster and

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.159
possibly make the bottle explode but saying that you wouldn't want to hold on to them for too long with your hands either because if

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.880
They did rub your it

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.850
There's a good chance the plastic will pray out and take your skin with it

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.989
Number this next experiment something I've always want to try [is] the way [we] want to eat waffles

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.420
I've seen videos where people hold the bottles on the edge of their fingertips and let it fall off where it catches itself and shoots

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.330
Off from there, I'd like to see if we can get that to work for us as [well]

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.080
A

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.039
Little bit of a delayed reaction wasn't it like hit the ground and shot over sideways, not exactly what I was going for that

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.360
Actually seems a little more powerful

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.560
Attempt number two here we go

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.819
Man, I think of explosively, but I like hit the ground and social

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.929
I can't get it to go like right off my hand with [this] front. So that was pretty cool

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.929
You can see it tipping you can see the butane mixing with the coke rising to the top

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.770
But [then] it actually gets [to] [prom] before we get that explosive reaction it takes off

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.720
So in order to get them to shoot up

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.980
You'd almost have to hit it straight on and have to be perfect now because we're using butane for this experiment

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.520
It has a characteristic that liquid nitrogen doesn't liquid nitrogen is not fly well the butane is so for our grand finale

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.949
Let's do something that you definitely shouldn't try at home

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.400
Let's plate it off and see if we can get our coke rocket to blast off in play

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.610
Firing all right let's get it. Thanks here. We go 00

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.120
last of the work

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.210
That burned a lot faster than I thought I was going through

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.780
It was kind of hot like holy in the bottle I was worried about the tip burning

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.230
There's the flip you can see the flames

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.940
Descend like a waterfall and then the bottle just disappear. There's a whole column of fire

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.359
That's crazy imagine if they sprayed all at you. I probably heard a lot

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.529
I think I've squirts my fingers a little bit. I can smell burning human hair, but that was awesome

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.529
That was an epic way to go out in style

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.440
pink

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.770
Right on guys so here's what we learned from our experiments today

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.069
We started off with the knowledge that propane and coke don't do anything

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.640
So we wanted to try using butane if you can get that to cause reactions dead

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.900
Although the reactions weren't nearly as powerful as I'm used to seeing with liquid nitrogen and water

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.200
They still were powerful enough to make a coke rocket. It's a viable idea we also discovered that one canister of Butane

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.420
Oh Philip. Coke bottle about halfway and give you enough for two coke bottle shots and at five dollars per canister

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.279
I'm not really sure whether or not that's actually worth it next we tried skipping the coke bottle off of our fingertips [it] found that

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.250
There wasn't enough reaction time it actually fell down and hit the ground first

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.260
Then jetted off like a rocket one can make contact

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.689
I'm not exactly sure the reason for the delay

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.779
But it might have been because our coke was a little bit colder we discovered

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.940
you can fill up a coke bottle with Mutane cap it off and the strength of the bottle is enough to contain the fluid but

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.380
As we unscrew the cap and release the pressure we saw the liquid begin to boil and a lot of it disappear

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.290
For our final experiment and grand finale we showed

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.080
That unlike liquid nitrogen containing extremely clowns

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.779
So we lit off the gas turned our bottle upside down and watch the rocket blast off in a flaming fiery fashion

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.360
And there we have it based on this set of experiments. I'd say the coke and butane rocket is a success

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.109
