00:00:01.724 --> 00:00:02.909
- [Voiceover] Okay, now
we're going to work on our

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.118
first Op-amp circuit.

00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:07.197
Here's what the circuit's
going to look like.

00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:11.364
Watch where it puts the plus
sign is on the top on this one.

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:17.992
And we're going to have a
voltage source over here.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.467
This will be plus or minus V in,

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:28.467
that's our input signal.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.590
And over on the output,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.007
we'll have V out,

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.642
and it's hooked up this way.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.499
The resistor,

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:40.890
another resistor,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.723
to ground,

00:00:42.803 --> 00:00:46.303
and this goes back to the inverting input.

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:49.133
Now we're going to look at this circuit

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.673
and see what it does.

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:52.158
Now we know that connected up here

00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:53.588
the power supply's hooked up

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:55.338
to these points here,

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:59.937
and the ground symbol is zero volts.

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.183
And we want to analyze this circuit.

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:03.241
And what do we know about this?

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.241
We know that V out equals some gain,

00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:09.978
I'll write the gain right there.

00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:12.894
A big, big number times V minus,

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:15.144
sorry V plus minus V minus,

00:01:17.268 --> 00:01:18.321
and let's label that.

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.016
V plus is this point right here,

00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:24.378
and V minus is this point right here.

00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:25.976
And we also know that the currents,

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:28.893
let's call them i plus and i minus,

00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:35.980
equals zero, and that's
the currents going in here.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.916
This is i minus here, and that's i plus,

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:41.583
and we know those are both zero.

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:45.498
So now what I want to do it describe

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:47.868
what's going on inside this
triangle symbol in more detail

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:50.946
by building a circuit model.

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:53.012
Alright, and a circuit
model for an amplifier

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.773
looks like this.

00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:57.606
We have V minus here, V plus here,

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:00.298
so this is V in,

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:03.887
and over on this side we have an,

00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:07.594
here's a new symbol that
you haven't seen before.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.719
It's usually drawn as a diamond shape,

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.136
and this is a voltage source,

00:02:13.874 --> 00:02:17.374
but it's a special kind of voltage source.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.638
It's called a voltage-dependent

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.095
voltage source.

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.986
And it's the same as a
regular ideal voltage source

00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:40.342
except for one thing,

00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:43.544
it says that the V, in this case V out,

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:46.794
equals gain times V plus minus V minus.

00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:54.498
So the voltage here depends
on the voltage somewhere else,

00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:56.442
and that's what makes
it a voltage-dependent,

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:57.719
that's what that means.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.756
So, we've just taken our
gain expression here,

00:03:00.756 --> 00:03:03.246
added, drawn circuit
diagram that represents

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:06.496
our voltage expression for our circuit.

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:09.464
Now, specifically over here

00:03:09.464 --> 00:03:12.157
we've drawn an open circuit on V plus,

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:15.721
and V minus so we know that
those currents are zero.

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:18.719
So this model, this circuit sketch

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.386
represents our two
properties of our Op-amp.

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:26.414
So I'm going to take a second here

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.512
and I'm going to draw
the rest of our circuit

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:30.930
surrounding this model,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.847
but I need a little bit more space.

00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:38.868
So let's put in the rest
of our circuit here.

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:41.035
We had our voltage source,

00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:45.983
connected to V plus,

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:48.424
and that's V in,

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.660
and over here we had V out.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.827
Let's check, V out was
connected to two resistors,

00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:04.873
and the bottom is connected to ground,

00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:07.290
and this was connected there.

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.290
So what our goal is right now,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.957
we want to find V out
as a function of V in.

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.659
That's what we're shooting for.

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.705
So let's see if we can do that.

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:25.377
Let's give our resistors some names.

00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:27.523
Let's call this R1, and R2,

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:30.100
our favorite names always,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.809
and now everything is labeled.

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.547
Now and we can label this point here,

00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:38.310
and this point we can call V minus,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.143
V minus.

00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:43.826
So that's our two unknowns.

00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:46.563
Our unknowns are V not, V out,

00:04:46.563 --> 00:04:50.553
and V minus, so let's
see if we can find them.

00:04:50.553 --> 00:04:52.052
So what I'm going to do is just start

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:55.211
writing some expressions for
things that I know are true.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.711
For example, I know that V out

00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:03.678
equals A times V plus minus V minus.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:11.933
Alright, that's what this
Op-amp is telling us is true.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.146
Now what else do I know?

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:16.252
Let's look at this resistor chain here.

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:18.054
This resistor chain actually looks

00:05:18.054 --> 00:05:20.889
a lot like a voltage divider,

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.975
and it's actually a very
good voltage divider.

00:05:22.975 --> 00:05:24.494
Remember we said this current here,

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.952
what is this current here?

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:26.785
It's zero.

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:32.169
I can use the voltage divider
expression that I know.

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.175
In that case, I know that V minus,

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:37.835
this is the voltage divider equation,

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:38.835
equals V out

00:05:42.073 --> 00:05:42.977
times what?

00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:45.556
Times the bottom resistor

00:05:45.556 --> 00:05:47.181
remember this?

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.764
R2 over R1 plus R2,

00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:55.885
so the voltage divider
expression says that

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:58.274
when you have a stack
of resistors like this,

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.190
with the voltage on the top
and ground on the bottom,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.357
this is the expression for
the voltage at the midpoint.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.303
Kay, so what I'm going to do next

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.572
is I'm going to take this expression

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:14.905
and stuff it right in there.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.169
Let's do that.

00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:21.822
See if we got enough room,

00:06:21.822 --> 00:06:23.179
okay now let's go over here.

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:25.179
Now I can say that V out

00:06:26.622 --> 00:06:29.372
equals A times V plus minus V out

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.243
times R2 over R1 plus R2,

00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:45.940
alright so far so good.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.310
Let's keep going, let's
keep working on this.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.810
V not equals A times V plus minus A V not,

00:06:59.777 --> 00:07:01.360
R2 over R1 plus R2.

00:07:05.787 --> 00:07:08.562
Alright, so now I'm going
to gather all the V not

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:11.559
terms over on the left hand side.

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:13.118
Let's try that.

00:07:13.118 --> 00:07:15.183
So that gives me,

00:07:15.183 --> 00:07:16.766
V not plus A V not,

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.584
times R2 over R1 plus R2 and that equals

00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:31.055
A times V plus,

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.098
and actually I can change that now

00:07:34.098 --> 00:07:35.840
V plus is what?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.090
V plus is V in.

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:47.828
Okay let's keep going I
can factor out the V not.

00:07:47.828 --> 00:07:48.828
V not is one

00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:52.989
plus A R2 over R1 plus R2

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.623
and that equals AV in.

00:08:04.578 --> 00:08:06.885
Alright so we're getting close,

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:08.181
and our original goal,

00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.077
we want to find V out in terms of V in.

00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:14.256
So I'm going to take this
whole expression here

00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:16.160
and divide it over to the other side,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.631
so then I have just V not on this side,

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.881
and V in on the other side.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:24.186
Make some more room.

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:27.095
I can do that, I can say

00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:28.678
V not equals A V in

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.181
divided by this big old expression,

00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:39.681
one plus A R2 over R1 plus R2.

00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:48.744
Alright so that's our answer.

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:50.607
That's the answer.

00:08:50.607 --> 00:08:54.107
That's V out equals some function of V in.

00:08:59.153 --> 00:09:01.725
Now I want to make a really
important observation here.

00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:04.864
This is going to be a
real cool simplification.

00:09:04.864 --> 00:09:07.334
Okay, so this is the point where Op-amp

00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:09.198
theory gets really cool.

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:10.454
Watch what happens here.

00:09:10.454 --> 00:09:12.545
We know that A is a giant number.

00:09:12.545 --> 00:09:14.179
A is something like 10 to the fifth,

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.800
or 10 to the sixth,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.500
and it's whatever we have here,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.397
if our resistors are sort
of normal-sized resistors

00:09:20.397 --> 00:09:22.867
we know that a giant number
times a normal number

00:09:22.867 --> 00:09:26.898
is still going to be a very
big number compared to one.

00:09:26.898 --> 00:09:30.482
So this one is almost
insignificant in this expression

00:09:30.482 --> 00:09:32.507
down here, so what I'm going to do,

00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:33.865
bear with me,

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:34.917
I'm going to cross it out.

00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:37.975
I'm going to say no, I
don't need that anymore.

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:40.506
So if this, if this number
here, if A is a million,

00:09:40.506 --> 00:09:42.050
10 to the sixth,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.258
and this expression here
is something like one half

00:09:45.258 --> 00:09:48.571
then this total thing is
one half 10 to the sixth

00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:50.171
or a half a million,

00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:52.037
and that's huge compared to one.

00:09:52.037 --> 00:09:54.221
So I can pretty safely ignore the one,

00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.408
it's very, very small.

00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:57.846
Now when I do that,

00:09:57.846 --> 00:09:59.122
well look what happens next,

00:09:59.122 --> 00:10:02.585
now I have A top and
bottom in the expression,

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:04.266
and I can cancel that too.

00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:06.373
So the A goes away,

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.830
now this is pretty astonishing.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.017
We have this amplifier circuit

00:10:10.017 --> 00:10:12.205
and all of a sudden I
have an expression here

00:10:12.205 --> 00:10:13.561
where A doesn't appear,

00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:15.060
the gain does not appear,

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.518
and what does this turn into?

00:10:16.518 --> 00:10:18.563
This is called V not

00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:20.563
equals V in, times what?

00:10:22.816 --> 00:10:24.233
Times R1 plus R2,

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:28.783
divided by R2.

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:34.643
So our amplifier, our
feedback circuit came down to

00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:39.139
V out is V in multiplied by
the ratio of the resistors

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.690
that we added to the circuit.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.465
This is one of the really cool
properties of using Op-amps

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:46.834
in circuits, really high-gain amplifiers.

00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:47.989
What we've done is

00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:50.114
we have chosen the gain of our circuit

00:10:50.114 --> 00:10:52.342
based on the components that we picked

00:10:52.342 --> 00:10:53.962
to add to the amplifier.

00:10:53.962 --> 00:10:56.251
It's not determined by
the gain of the amplifier

00:10:56.251 --> 00:11:00.546
as long as the amplifier
gain is really, really big.

00:11:00.546 --> 00:11:02.974
And for Op-amps, that's a good assumption,

00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:04.291
it is really big.

00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:07.451
So this expression came out
with a positive sign, right?

00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:09.637
All the R's are positive values,

00:11:09.637 --> 00:11:13.054
so this is referred to as a non-inverting

00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:20.630
Op-amp circuit amplifier.

00:11:25.048 --> 00:11:26.587
So just to do a quick example,

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:29.017
if R1 and R2 are the same,

00:11:29.017 --> 00:11:31.062
then we end up with an
expression that looks like this

00:11:31.062 --> 00:11:35.229
V out equals R1 plus R2, R
plus R over R is equal to two

00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:41.015
so the gain is two times V in.

00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:46.373
So just to do a quick sketch

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:50.206
just to remind ourselves
what this looks like,

00:11:51.658 --> 00:11:52.825
this was V in,

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:55.607
and we had what out here?

00:11:55.607 --> 00:11:57.693
We had a resistor,

00:11:57.693 --> 00:12:00.360
we had a resistor to the ground,

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:03.993
and this is V out.

00:12:08.669 --> 00:12:11.281
So this is the configuration
of a non-inverting amplifier

00:12:11.281 --> 00:12:13.813
built with an Op-amp,

00:12:13.813 --> 00:12:17.057
the two resistors in this
voltage divider string

00:12:17.057 --> 00:12:19.724
connected to the negative input.

00:12:21.346 --> 00:12:23.756
So that's what non-inverting
Op-amp circuit looks like,

00:12:23.756 --> 00:12:25.662
and it's going to be one of the familiar

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.644
patterns that you see over and over again

00:12:27.644 --> 00:12:31.394
as you read schematics and
you design your own circuits.
