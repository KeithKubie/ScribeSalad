00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.201
What do you think about Sarah
Lynn?

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.103
Oh, I don't really
think about her all that much.

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:07.540
I mean, obviously,
I'm a fan of her early work
which both satirized

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.876
and celebrated
youth culture's obsession
with sex,

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.944
but I do wonder
as a third-wave feminist

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:14.714
if it's even possible for women
to reclaim their sexuality

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.816
in this deeply entrenched
patriarchal society,

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.719
or if claiming to do so
is just a lie we tell ourselves

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.355
so we can more comfortably cater
to the male gaze.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.123
-Uh, what?
-But you know,
on the other hand,

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:25.958
I worry that conversations
like this one

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.061
often dismiss her as a mere
puppet of the industry...

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.996
-That's my same worry.
-...incapable of engaging

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.365
-in these discussions herself...
-Obviously.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.667
...and infantilization,
which is itself a product

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.403
-of the deeply misogynistic
society we live in.
-So deep.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:39.839
But like I said,
I don't really think about her
all that much.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:43.576
Okay, but I was more asking,
like, what do you think
about her living here?

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.111
Oh, right.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:48.381
Well, what was your relationship
like with her

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.715
when you were working
on the show?

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:51.651
It was very good,
very professional.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.954
(CLEARS THROAT) BoJack,
where did you go to college?

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.458
Honey, college
is for ugly people
who can't tap dance.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.894
-I want to be an architect.
-(LAUGHING) Sweetheart,

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.897
Mommy didn't do what Mommy did
to that<i> Star Search</i> producer

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.666
so that you could be
an architect.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.569
-Aw.
-All right, take it sleazy,
everybody.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:13.039
Wait, BoJack, um,
what are you doing this weekend?

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.208
I don't know.
I'll probably just go
to the amusement park,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.478
maybe the circus,
fly a kite on the beach,
watch the sunset,

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.481
then I'll head back to my place
to watch any number
of Disney princess movies

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.216
while eating ice cream
straight from the tub.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.985
-Whoa, can I come?
-(LAUGHS) Yeah,

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:29.055
like I want to spend my weekend
hanging out with a little girl.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.723
(LAUGHS) Good one!

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.758
You should write
for the Shouts and Murmurs.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.760
See you Monday!

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.896
So the makeup
they were putting on you
was not for the show,

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.065
-it was just for the weekend?
-Why does that matter?

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.900
I'm just trying
to understand the story.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.136
Do you think it's possible
that you inviting Sarah Lynn

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.972
into your house now is your way
of compensating for not--

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.207
No, Diane,
I'm just helping out a friend.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.910
I'm not trying to play out
some weird, sick dad fantasy,

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:53.546
or resolve a deep guilt
for past neglect,

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.149
or even try to retroactively fix
my own childhood

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.217
by recreating someone else's,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.654
and I'm especially not doing
all those things at once!

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.589
Okay.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:05.525
What happened?
Did somebody hurt
my precious baby?
