00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.650
Now I'm going to talk
about setting goals.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.290
You probably have some personal
goals for yourself like getting fit.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.890
Well, you can also set goals for
your app.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.820
For example, you might set a goal for
users to click the donate button or

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.210
reach a certain level in the game.

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:17.860
Or stay engaged with the app for

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.440
a certain amount of time,
hopefully not that long.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.760
To set goals for
the app you go to the Admin interface.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.100
And then in the View, you click Goals.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.659
And then create New Goal.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.640
When you're setting up a goal
you'll see a list of templates.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.000
If you choose a template,
it fills in the name and the type for

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.680
you, like this.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.350
But even if you choose a template,
you can change the name and type anyway.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.360
So I'm going to start out
by creating a custom goal.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.140
And you enter whatever name you want and
then you choose a type of goal.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.320
So you can specify screen that
you want the users to reach or

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.930
duration how long you want them
to stay engaged with your app.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.540
You can specify how many screens you
want them to visit in a session.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
And you can also specify an event
like view product or show recipe.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.920
So I'm going for
five screens per session min.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.510
So after you set the name and the type,
you can add more detail for the goals.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.000
The details you can set depend
on the type of the goal.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.470
If the type is number
of screens per session,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.780
well you choose how many you want.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.900
I want at least five,
that would be greater than four.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.460
If the type is duration, then you could
specify criteria for the duration.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.420
How many hours, minutes,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.380
seconds do you want the users
to stay engaged as a minimum.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.090
If the goal type is destination,
then you specify the screen name.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.510
And as you see, there' some flexibility
around how you specify the screen name.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.030
You can give a regular
expression if you want.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.340
And notice the funnel option.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.740
If you enable this, you can specify
the progression through your app

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.080
that you wont use to take
to reach the destination.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.340
My advice is to start out with
the simpler options and as you

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.810
build your understanding of Analytics,
to add in more complex tracking.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.130
For now, I'm not going to set a funnel.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.560
If the goal type is event,
then you specify the category,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.290
the action, the label and
the value of the event.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.050
And actually you can specify any or
all of these starting with the category.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.120
You could just set the category.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.670
And leave the other values
blank if you wanted.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.888
So I'm going to set up a goal
called five screen for

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:43.870
my users to visit five
screens per session.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.300
So I've chosen the type
Pages/Screens per session.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.200
And I want them to go to at least five.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.730
So that would be greater than four.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.360
Then, I create the goal.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.720
So now my goal is listed
in the list of goals.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.810
Now you might be wondering,
do you need to write code for the goals?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.720
Well, it depends, is order activity
tracking enabled for your app?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.590
If it is, then you don't need to write
any code for screen-related goals.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.680
Analytics will get hits for
all screen views.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.890
But if the goal depends
on other kinds of hits,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.380
such as event hits, then your app must
include the code to send those hits.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.010
If auto activity
tracking is not enabled,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.200
then your app must have the code to send
the hits that Analytics needs to figure

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.120
out if the goals are met, or not.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.940
And that includes screen view hits,
because if auto activity tracking's not

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.920
enabled, Analytics won't
get screen view hits.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.290
Other than the ones that get
explicitly sent by the app.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800
So I've created one goal for
my app so far.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.960
But each app has a limit to
how many goals it can have.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.750
After you create a goal,
you can't delete it.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.180
There's no point in hunting around for

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.580
the delete button,
because it isn't there.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.600
However, you can edit an existing
goal and change it completely.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.590
So I'm going to change my goal.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.630
My new goal is for users to read
the recipe for dinner suggestion.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.240
There are two ways to express this goal.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.570
Either I can set a goal for
users to click the Show Recipe button,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.760
or I can set a goal for users to go to
the show recipe activity or screen.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.030
So I'm going to set a goal for my users
to go to show recipe as a destination.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.860
Now, my app sends a screen view hit
through the code in the on start method

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.770
of the show recipe activity.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.610
So I need to make sure
that the screen name and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.160
the goal is the same as the one
that gets set in the code.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.790
And see here how it says verify this
goal, you can click on this to see

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.500
what the conversion rate would have been
for the date of the past seven days.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.840
So this is only going to be helpful if
you actually have a bunch of data from

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.460
the past seven days.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.485
And it has to be exactly the past
seven days, but not including today.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:09.135
So now I'm going to save my goal,
and there it is.

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:13.960
Now my app already sends a screen view
hit for the Show Recipe activity, so

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.615
Idon't need to make any
changes in my code.

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:18.445
So I already have the app
running on the phone, and

00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:20.085
I didn't even need to redeploy it.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:24.149
I'm just going to go ahead and
show the recipe a few times.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.920
And then I'm going to
need to wait a while for

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.450
the goals to show up in
the Analytics dashboard.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.270
The real-time view in Analytics
doesn't show goal conversion,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.670
so you may need to wait a while for
the goals to show up.
