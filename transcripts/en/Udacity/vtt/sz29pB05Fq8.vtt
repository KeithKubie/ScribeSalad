00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.327
How to submit assignments. There are two

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:07.408
ways to submit assignments, first, through T-Square, and

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:11.082
second, through the Udacity site. We'll cover

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:13.252
both of these in the orientation, as your

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:15.920
courses will use both methods. Depending on

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.117
the format of the assignment. Lets start with

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:23.380
T-Square. T-Square is Georgia's Tech's learning management system.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.810
You will use T-Square, to submit certain assignments.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.020
For example, PDFs and other documents. Your instructor

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.900
will provide links to submit assignments on T-Square,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.430
in addition to detailed instructions. Lets walk through

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.290
an example, to show you how this will

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.290
be done. Let's say that I'm ready to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.050
submit my project for Agile software development, as

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.634
part of my software development processes course. I

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:51.604
can access the project instructions from the instructor notes,

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:54.790
through this link here. When I'm ready to submit

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.634
my project, I click on the link provided. That'll

00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:59.506
take me to the assignment section of the course

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:03.080
on T-Square. Where I can submit the exact assignment.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.030
Because I'm logged into Udacity with Georgia Tech, I'll

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.508
be able to access this link to T-Square, without

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:12.930
logging in again. If you have any technical difficulties,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.186
please contact your course manager, through the chat window, or

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:20.100
by emailing gt-support@udacity.com.
