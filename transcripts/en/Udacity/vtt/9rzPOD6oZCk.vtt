00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It turns out that if we could just build this chart correctly--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and that's not going to be easy, but it's going to within our power--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
then we've solved parsing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's say that our grammar has some special start symbol S.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So goes to E, and then E could be many things.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The state we really want to be in is this one.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I have seen everything. S goes to E, and there's nothing more. We are totally done.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I mentioned before that we have to augment all of our parse states with this starting add information.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Just to be a little more specific, I have seen S goes to E,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and there was no additional previous information.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Starting from zero tokens of input,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I have seen enough to make the judgement S goes to E based on this input string.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So if the input is T tokens long, we just look to see if S goes to E dot starting at zero

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is in chart T.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If it is, our input is in the language of the grammar.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If it's not, our input is not.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Parsing totally solved assuming we can build the chart,

00:01:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but building the chart is going to be tricky--tricky but possible.
