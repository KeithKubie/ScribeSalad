00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now let's multiply every single piece of data by 1.5 and get some new data.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We'll call them Ys.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Can you tell me what is the mean--mu--of the Ys,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what is their standard deviation--sigma--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what is their variance--sigma squared--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and what is the value of this point--now Yi--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and what is the standard score--z--of Yi.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Fill in your answers.
