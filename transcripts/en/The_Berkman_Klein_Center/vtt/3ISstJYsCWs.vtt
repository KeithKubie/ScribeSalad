00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.030
 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.740
Hello.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.190
I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.190
This is the fourth of 12 lectures
on the subject of copyright.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.520
The topic I'll be discussing
today is the welfare theory

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.050
of intellectual property in general
and of copyright law in particular.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.610
The topics of all 12 lectures are
listed on the slide on your screen.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.100
If you're viewing this lecture after
having watched the first three,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.530
then you'll recall that
in lecture number one,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.580
I examined the foundations
of copyright law.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.090
More specifically, I began by discussing
the multilateral treaties that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.670
constrain the freedom of
each country in the world

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.410
to set its own copyright laws.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.650
I then discuss the originality
doctrine and the distinction

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.600
between ideas and expression, which
is fundamental to the copyright

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.000
systems in all nations.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.270
In the second lecture, I discussed two
theories of copyright-- the fairness,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.480
or labor dessert theory, which tends
to have greater salience in countries

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.530
influenced by the common law tradition,
and the personality or personhood

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.390
theory, which is greater salience in
countries influenced by the civil law

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.520
tradition.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.200
Although it's gaining in
strength outside that region.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.300
In the third lecture,
I surveyed the types

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.410
of works that are subject
to copyright protection.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.020
I showed how the rules of copyright
law vary significantly by type,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.195
and consequently that
the business models that

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:41.650
have developed on the basis of
those rules differ considerably.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.240
 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.785
Today, we return to copyright theory.

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:49.850
I'll be examining the third
of the four general approaches

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.700
to copyright law, which is
known as the welfare theory.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.430
You can see from the list
of topics on the screen

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.680
where we're going after this.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.420
The first segment of today's lecture,
will describe the overall framework

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.020
of the utilitarian perspective
that underlies the welfare theory.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.919
The second segment will
examine how, viewed

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.620
through the lenses of the welfare
theory, copyright law functions.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.140
In the third and last
segment, I'll explore

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.970
a few of the many applications and
implications of the welfare theory.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.960
On your screen now should
appear a map, specifically

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.840
the second of the two maps I've
been employing in this course.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.090
This one, as you can see, addresses
theories of intellectual property.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.890
The map itself, as I've indicated,
is available in several formats

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.360
on the CopyrightX home page
and on my personal home page.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.340
The fairness theory, which
I discussed two weeks ago,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.160
centers on the proposition
that labor gives rise

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.780
to a natural property right
in the fruits of that labor.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.460
Somewhat more specifically,
creative or intellectual labor,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.800
so the argument goes, gives rise
to a natural right to a reward

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.670
or a set of entitlements proportional
to the amount of labor invested.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.570
Law, the argument continues,
should recognize and enforce

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.370
that natural right.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.640
In lecture number two, I discussed some
of the implications of the labor theory

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.880
and the ways in which it finds
expression nowadays in many copyright

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.980
systems, including that
of the United States.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.210
I also discussed some
of the difficulties,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.980
complexities, and ambiguities
associated with the theory.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.010
The second of the four main approaches,
also considered in the second lecture,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.220
is the personality or personhood theory.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.070
Its premise is that law
should provide people,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.700
especially but not exclusively
artists, property rights over objects

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.490
or intangibles that they need in
order to fully realize theirselves.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.130
This argument is grounded in
the writings of Kant and Hagel.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.280
In the second segment
of lecture number two,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.460
I examined some of the contemporary
applications of the personality theory.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.340
In particular, the ways in which
it has informed the practice

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.140
in European countries of moral rights.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.820
I also discussed some
difficulties for complexities

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.060
associated with that argument.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.720
Today, we turn to the welfare theory,
which has a very different heritage.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.890
The foundation of the welfare theory
is, as I mentioned, utilitarianism.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.680
Its patron saints are Jeremy
Bentham and John Stuart Mill,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.070
who established starting in the late
18th century a distinctive approach

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.370
to political thought and
eventually economics.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.920
The key idea of utilitarianism,
undoubtedly familiar to most of you,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.660
is that government and
law in particular should

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.750
be organized so as to promote the
greatest happiness of the greatest

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.230
number.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.520
Somewhat more
specifically, law should be

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.550
organized to induce
people to behave in ways

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.930
that redound to the benefit
of the public at large.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.090
How?

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.160
Primarily by creating combinations
of incentives and penalties

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.250
to nudge people in socially
beneficial directions.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.880
Two characteristics of this
orientation bear emphasis

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.080
and cause it to contrast sharply with
the fairness theory, its primary rival.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.810
First, the utilitarian approach
is prospective in orientation.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.590
In other words, it
looks forward in time.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.890
It seeks to craft the law in a way
that will induce people in the future

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.490
to behave in a fashion that will
increase overall happiness or welfare.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.660
By contrast, the fairness theory, as we
saw, is retrospective in orientation.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.700
It seeks to create
rights that appropriately

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.370
reward people for their
conduct in the past.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.150
The second characteristic
of the utilitarian approach

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.330
that differentiates it from the
theories we've discussed thus far

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.730
is that it's collective rather
than individual in orientation.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.180
It focuses on the welfare
of society as a whole

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.970
rather than on doing
justice to or serving

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.800
the human needs of its
individual members.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.860
So that's the starting point--
the foundation of this approach.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.900
The way this venerable
broad perspective is

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.180
brought to bear on intellectual property
is through the concept of public goods.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.240
This is a phrase common in
economics, although less familiar

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.350
outside the field of economics.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.810
I'll begin by defining it and
then discuss its implications.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.690
A public good economists
tell us, is a good

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:49.480
that has two related features-- it's
non-rivalrous and nonexcludable.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.820
By way of contrast, consider an apple.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.400
An apple is said to be rivalrous because
consumption of the apple by one person

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.280
is inconsistent with consumption
of it by a second person.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.620
If I eat the apple, there's
nothing edible left for you.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.040
Partly because it's rivalrous in this
sense, it's naturally excludable.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.210
In other words, as long as
the apple is in my possession,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.460
it's difficult for you
to gain access to it.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.960
A non-rivalrous good is
one whose consumption

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.570
is not inconsistent with its
availability to other people.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.240
A classic example of this
phenomenon that figures prominently

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.400
in the literature of economics is a
lighthouse or other navigation aid.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.330
Suppose that I erect a
lighthouse on a rocky headland.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.000
The purpose of the lighthouse is to warn
ships not to come close to the rocks,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.580
thereby enabling them
to avoid catastrophe.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.070
The benefit of that warning
can be provided simultaneously

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.040
to a nearly unlimited number
of ships and their captains.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.200
Making the lighthouse
signal available to one ship

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.340
does not diminish its availability
or benefit to other ships.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.140
The lighthouse is for that
reason said to be non-rivalrous.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.040
 

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.150
For a related reason, it's
also said to be nonexcludable.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.760
As should be apparent by
now, it would be difficult

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.630
for me, the creator of
the lighthouse, having

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:26.270
made the signal available to one ship to
prevent others from benefiting from it.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.610
Consequently, it would
be very difficult for me

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.220
to charge for access to the good.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.220
In theory, I suppose, I could
construct a fence of some kind

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.510
10 miles out from the lighthouse--
in other words, on the horizon

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.074
this photo-- and then charge
ships who want to enter the gates.

00:08:43.074 --> 00:08:44.449
But that's plainly impracticable.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.310
These two characteristics
of lighthouses largely

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.440
explain why there are almost no
privately constructed lighthouses

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.650
or other navigation aids
anywhere in the world.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.870
The reason is that no private party
has an appropriate financial incentive

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:04.760
to construct such a socially beneficial
facility because the builder would

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.770
be unable to charge the persons and
organizations who benefit from it.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.540
 

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.780
Navigation aids are the example of
public goods most commonly deployed

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.750
by economists.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.780
Here are some others.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.890
National defense.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.340
Once the benefit of an
army or navy is made

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.720
available to one
resident of a country, it

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.200
can be enjoyed by everyone
else in the country.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.470
Roads can be used by a very
large number of drivers

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.600
simultaneously without
impairing usage by others.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.565
Now, as any commuter can
attest, there's an outer limit

00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:44.020
to the number of cars that
could use a road simultaneously.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.650
But short of that limit, roads
function as public goods.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.400
Most important for our
purposes, the kinds of things

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.940
that are at issue in
intellectual property,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.532
specifically inventions
and reproducible art,

00:09:58.532 --> 00:10:02.220
are classic examples of public goods.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.220
Here's a simple illustration.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.830
Suppose that I'm a poet.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.110
I write a poem.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.810
I make it available to one poetry lover.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.690
She reads it and likes it.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.220
She's likely to want to
share it with others.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.260
Why?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.360
Well, partly, of course, because of the
natural human impulse to share things.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.120
But also partly because by sharing it,
she would not be giving up anything.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.390
Even after sharing it, she could
reread or recite it anytime she wants.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.910
The practical result is that I
will have great difficulty charging

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.410
successive readers
for access to my poem.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.550
Instead, it is likely to spread
from one reader to another

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.130
without my knowledge or permission.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.970
Public goods, such as-- as we've
seen, lighthouses, roads, and poems,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.300
are special in a couple of ways.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.425
First, usually though
not invariably, they

00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:56.130
have especially large social benefits.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.300
Second, they're likely
to be under produced.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:05.350
In other words, to be generated
at socially suboptimal levels.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.830
In this respect, I,
the hypothetical poet,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.260
am in the same position as
a private party considering

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.400
building a lighthouse recognizing
the difficulty of collecting money

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.880
from readers unlikely to be
discouraged from producing

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.250
the poem in the first instance.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.520
And society at large
will consequently suffer.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.230
If lawmakers wish to prevent
this unfortunate outcome,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.220
they have to act in some way,
have to provide a special stimulus

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.350
for the creation of public goods.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.830
How governments can
provide so such a stimulus

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.000
we'll consider in just a minute.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.720
Before doing so, however, we have to
consider several circumstances that

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.450
will either exacerbate or mitigate the
hazard that public goods will be under

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:59.040
produced and thus increase or decrease
the need for governmental intervention.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.690
Listed on the screen
are some circumstances

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.910
that are commonly said to
exacerbate the public goods problem.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.200
First, high cost of creation.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.830
If a public good cost a lot to generate,
the risk that it will be under produced

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.060
is especially serious.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.930
In the intellectual property
context, the premier example

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.470
is new pharmaceutical products, which
taking into account the money spent

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:29.890
on failed experiments, cost roughly $800
million to $1 billion dollars apiece

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.160
to produce.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.970
The second exacerbating
circumstance also true

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.690
of the pharmaceutical
industry is high uncertainty.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.340
If a potential innovator
is unsure of success,

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.850
he or she is especially likely
to give up at the threshold.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.660
This tendency is exacerbated
in social settings

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.140
where potential innovators
are risk averse.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.380
By contrast, high degrees of uncertainty
are less problematic in social settings

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.150
where potential innovators
are risk preferers,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.990
meaning naturally inclined to gamble.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.380
This is an interesting contested theme
in the context of intellectual property

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.630
because some commentators relying
either on anecdotal evidence

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.850
or in a few cases empirical work,
contend that some kinds of artists

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.090
are risk preferers.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:25.280
This matters from utilitarian
standpoint because to the extent

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.460
artists or authors are
gamblers by temperament,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.056
we should be at least
marginally less concerned

00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:33.805
with giving them strong
legal protections.

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:36.920
 

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.630
A third circumstance that is said to
exacerbate the public goods problem

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.700
is low marginal cost of production.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.500
If it's easy to make
copies of an innovation,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.310
then the risk that it will be spread
willy nilly without any compensation

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.940
to the original creator
are especially high.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.890
Again, drugs provide a clear example.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.510
New pharmaceutical
products, at least if they

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.200
consist of so-called small
molecules as opposed to biologics,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.550
are easy to replicate cheaply.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.460
As a result, the hazards of
under production are high.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.280
In the copyright context, this
worry is even more serious nowadays

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.150
with respect to digital embodiments
of recorded entertainment.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.870
Sound recordings, which we
discussed last week, or films.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:30.040
It's virtually costless to reproduce
and redistribute digital recordings.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.680
In other words, the marginal cost
of the copies is close to zero.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.590
That creates well known hazards
for the creators of such things,

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.010
increasing the argument for some
kind of governmental response.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.030
 

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.140
In the same vein, ease
of reverse engineering

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.210
exacerbates the public goods problem.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.660
The easier it is to figure out how
a particular product was created,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:01.290
the easier and cheaper it will be
to replicate it without permission.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.520
Most copyrighted materials are
highly vulnerable on the score.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.290
Reverse engineering a poem, for
example, is a simple matter.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.890
There are, however, a few exceptions.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.740
I discussed one of them in the
previous lecture-- software.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:24.600
Software enjoys a modest, natural
shield against some kinds of copying.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.830
After a program is written in a
language comprehensible to people,

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.750
it is compiled into so-called object
code-- the sequence of ones and zeros

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.660
comprehensible to computers.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.610
Proprietary software is
typically distributed

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.930
to the public only in object code form.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.870
In other words, the source
code, the human readable code,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.060
is not contained in the CD-ROM you
purchase or the copy of a program

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.060
that you download.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.740
Now, there exists things called
decompilers-- devices that

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.800
enable one to infer source
code from object code.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.940
But they remain imperfect.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.940
As a result, software developers are
able by keeping the source code secret

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.800
to discourage replication of that code.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.680
Members of the public
can, of course, make

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.310
verbatim copies of the object code.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.400
That's what the term software
piracy usually refers to.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.380
But they have a harder time getting at
the source code, and thus a harder time

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.950
modifying or adapting the program.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.800
The key to this modest
amount of natural protection

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.060
is the difficulty of
reverse engineering.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.170
 

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.620
Last but not least, the
public goods problem

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.900
is especially worrisome
when the product in question

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.330
has strong positive externalities,
meaning that it confers benefits

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.310
not merely on immediate consumers,
but also on third parties.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.210
The context in which this
issue arises most often

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.510
is with respect to
informational products

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:02.120
that have infrastructure or generativity
benefits, to use terminology developed

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.819
by Brett Frischmann
and Jonathan Zittrain.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:09.690
The key example is the set of
protocols that underlie the internet.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.310
 

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.950
The reason that such
externalities matter

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.920
is that would be especially tragic
if the incentives for the creation

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:25.300
and improvement of such things
were insufficient to foment them.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.840
So to review, there are
five main circumstances

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.940
that can exacerbate the
public goods problem

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.840
and thus heightened the need
for governmental intervention

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.480
to overcome it.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.500
Those circumstances are high creation
costs, uncertainty, low marginal cost

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.380
of production of copies
of an innovation,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.370
ease of reverse engineering, and
strong positive externalities.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.470
 

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.830
On the other side of the
ledger are circumstances

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.600
that mitigate the public goods
problem and therefore reduce

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.580
the need for governmental involvement.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.110
First, in some contexts,
innovators obtain

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.770
through lead time enough of
an advantage over copyists

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.730
to enable them to recover the
costs of their innovations,

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.960
thus reducing the need for
a governmental stimulus.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.130
Justice Breyer of the
United States Supreme Court,

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.850
long ago when he was an assistant
professor at Harvard Law School,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.940
wrote an article developing this
argument in the context of trade books.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.200
One of Breyer's contentions was
that the writers and publishers

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.500
of so-called trade books-- for
example, the textbooks that

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:38.680
are used in US high schools-- enjoy at
least a moderate lead time advantage.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.770
It takes a while, he contended,
to reproduce and redistribute

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.880
books of the sort.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.450
During the window of time before
competitors can enter the field,

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.450
the first publisher
can earn quite a bit.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.540
Perhaps enough to render uncertain the
social need for copyright protection

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.560
with respect to such books.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.600
Hence the title of
Breyer's famous article,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.540
"The Uneasy Case for Copyright."

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.695
Another context in which lead
time may be sufficient adequately

00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:14.750
to support innovation is fashion,
meaning the design of high end clothes.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.990
At least until recently,
a fashion designer

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.190
enjoyed a window of time
between the first introduction

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.820
of a new design and the moment
when knock offs became available.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.330
During that window, the designer
could and did sell his or her dresses

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.940
and suits for a very high price
to wealthy and fashion conscious,

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.500
or perhaps prestige
conscious, consumers.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.020
As a result, innovation has
long flourished in fashion,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.130
despite the fact that in many
countries, including the United States,

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.350
new clothing designers do not enjoy
copyright protection or indeed

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.000
any other type of intellectual
property protection.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.730
Now, this argument, I hasten
to add, is controversial.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.080
Some commentators and
designers disagree sharply,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.920
and most commentators acknowledge that
the lead time window is getting shorter

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.090
as the technologies for quickly
reverse engineering and replicating

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.290
fashion innovations are advancing.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.950
Another circumstance that may
reduce the public goods problem

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.230
and therefore reduce the need
for governmental involvement

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.040
is the presence of customary
or extra legal norms

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.420
that forbid or discourage
unauthorized, uncompensated usage

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.940
of the good in question.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.240
Again, trade books may be an example.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.540
If there is a custom adhered to by
all of the publishers in the field

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.900
not to knock off each other's works,
then the need for legal intervention

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.230
diminishes and indeed
may evaporate altogether.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.370
This argument may also be
found in Breyer's article.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:57.850
Another potential example of extra
legal norms is stand-up comedy.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.520
Professors Dotan Oliar and Chris
Sprigman argue in a recent article

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.900
that comedians have a fairly
elaborate set of customs

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.260
that discourage
so-called stealing jokes.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.690
Not all comedians abide by those norms.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.090
Robin Williams, for example,
is famous for defying them.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.740
But most do.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.780
To the extent these
customs are effective,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.360
then legal intervention may
be less necessary to provide

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.140
an incentive for the
creation of new jokes.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.150
 

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.670
A third circumstance that can
mitigate the public goods problem

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:39.210
consists of opportunities for increasing
excludability through self help.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.620
That's a somewhat cumbersome
phrase, but here's the basic idea.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.530
In some contexts, innovators
can use self help maneuvers

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.730
to prevent promiscuous
reproduction-- the creation

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.760
and distribution of knockoffs
of their innovations.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.690
Innovations in the fields of soft
drinks and chocolate, for example,

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.630
are usually protected by keeping the
formulas for the innovations secret.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.190
Think Willy Wonka.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.880
Encryption is a modern
analog to secrecy.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.000
In some contexts,
innovators nowadays are

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.770
able to impede reproduction
of copies of their innovations

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:21.510
by encasing each copy in a
technological wrapper of some kind.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.834
Think Blu-ray disc.

00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:25.750
I'll return to this
strategy in just a minute.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.340
 

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.950
Yet another self help
technique relies on contracts.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:36.530
An example-- in the United States,
in contrast to many other countries,

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.610
the primary databases for
legal materials are not free.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.090
Instead, they're hosted by
private companies, specifically

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.210
Lexus and Westlaw.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.760
And those companies charge a
fair amount of money for access

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.420
to their databases of judicial
opinions and statutes.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:53.920
How?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.050
How do they protect
themselves from competitors

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.470
who have an obvious incentive
to copy their databases

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.130
and make them available more cheaply?

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.950
Well, for the most part, not
by relying on copyright law.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.070
In the United States, in
contrast to many other countries,

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.810
governmental works including
judicial opinions and statutes

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.210
are not covered by copyright.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.330
They are in the public domain.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.490
Anyone is free to copy them.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.000
The way in which Lexus
and Westlaw nevertheless

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.670
discourage competition and
maintain their business models

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.590
is by requiring subscribers
to agree to limitations

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.820
on copying and
redistributing the materials.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.030
Violation of those agreements
is not copyright infringement,

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.410
but it's actionable as
a breach of contract.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:47.170
The net result, Lexis and Westlaw don't
need intellectual property protection

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.270
to maintain their business models.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.890
 

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.590
The fourth circumstance that
mitigates the public goods problem

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.190
is that with respect to
some kinds of innovations,

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.660
alternative motivations for
production can substitute

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.360
for governmentally organized incentives.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.070
A non-exhaustive list
of such alternatives

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.750
is set forth on your screen.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.790
The most obvious, passion.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.800
Many artists love their
work and would continue

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.150
to do it even in the absence of
any monetary reward whatsoever.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.320
To the extent that's true,
the utilitarian argument

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.650
for intellectual property or any
other governmental intervention

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:35.230
falls away because the good in
question will not be under produced.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.560
Assume for the moment that all
poets write for love, not for money.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.000
That, from the utilitarian standpoint,
would provide a compelling argument

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.720
for withdrawing copyright
protection from poetry.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.220
Now, there are other arguments reviewed
previously in this lecture series

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.840
for affording poets strong
intellectual property protection.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.350
But from the utilitarian
standpoint, the fact,

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.490
the possible fact that
a particular producer

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.540
is motivated by non-monetary
incentives reduces the need for law.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.520
 

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:15.990
Prestige, fame, tenure-- these play
powerful roles in academic communities.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:20.190
Most scholars make no money
whatsoever from their articles.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:24.780
Some make money on books, but
from articles, almost never.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.810
So why do scholars write them?

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.900
Well, first, to get tenure.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.890
And then, in some cases, to
increase their prestige or renown.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.660
Less selfish is the next entry on
the list-- the norms of science.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.580
Specifically, truth seeking.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.690
This figures, at least to some degree,
in all fields of scholarly endeavor.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.010
Most people who work in
research universities

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.990
are primarily focused on
contributing to human knowledge,

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.570
not on earning more money.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.570
Scholars who've written powerfully about
the implication of this fact for patent

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.330
law and about the risks
we run by contaminating

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:07.390
this ethos with monetary incentives
include Arti Rai and John Golden.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.310
 

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.120
Advertising-- I mentioned
this in a previous lecture.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.000
In some contexts,
intellectual property products

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.900
will be generated even in the
absence of legal protection

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.280
because they serve as
advertising for other things.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.370
For example, it's sometimes
said controversially

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:30.200
that sound recordings function as
advertisements for performances,

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.380
specifically for concerts,
and thus that we should not

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.420
be troubled from a
utilitarian standpoint

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.730
by the decline in the
monies that could be earned

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.800
by selling copies of the
recordings themselves.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.340
 

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.910
Next, collaborative voluntary creation.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:51.550
In some contexts, people love to
contribute without monetary rewards

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.010
to collective creative enterprises.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:59.350
A rich array of such settings is
examined by my colleague Yochai

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:03.900
Benkler in the two articles
listed on your screen.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.390
Perhaps most familiar
modern example is Wikipedia,

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:11.890
which now rivals in influence and
accuracy proprietary encyclopedias

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.890
like the Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.530
The people who have built
Wikipedia don't make any money.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:19.790
So why do they do it?

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.160
Well, primarily because it's fun.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.610
It's fun not just to
contribute to knowledge,

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:29.390
it's fun to engage in a collaborative
enterprise of that sort.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:34.510
Again, the general point is that to the
extent such motivations are operating,

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.450
the need for governmental
incentives diminishes.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.000
 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Finally, that need is
also reduced to the extent

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.020
that innovators in a particular context
are supported by private philanthropy.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.400
For example, as Mike Scherer
emphasizes, once upon a time,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.770
philanthropy was a main way in which
musical composition was funded.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:02.500
Another example-- in the United States
today, the news, gathered and broadcast

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.460
by Public Radio stations, is
funded in significant part

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:12.150
by listeners who voluntarily
contribute funds.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.160
Again, to the extent that's true,
the need for governmental support

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.890
is reduced.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.860
So to review, we've identified a
special and especially important

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.150
category of goods known by
economists as public goods that

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.600
are subject to a unique danger.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.850
The danger is that unless
government stimulates

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.250
in some way their
production, they will be

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.530
generated in socially
suboptimal quantities.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.310
There are, with respect to
some such goods, circumstances

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.950
that exacerbate the
hazard of under production

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:50.280
and thus intensify the need
for governmental engagement.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.730
Conversely, there are with respect
to other types of public goods

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.655
circumstances that reduce
or mitigate the difficulty,

00:28:56.655 --> 00:28:59.060
and thereby reduce the need
for governmental engagement.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.920
 

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.020
So let's assume that
we're dealing with one

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.320
of the many types of
intellectual products

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.900
where the public goods
problem is serious.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.910
Say, full length entertainment
films or new vaccines.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.150
If a government recognizes the risk
that such things will be under produced

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.926
and seeks to overcome
it, how could it do so?

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:24.230
Well, over the centuries,
governments have

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.770
attempted to resolve the public
goods problem in five different ways.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.420
They're listed on your screen.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.790
I'll survey them
briefly and then zero in

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.620
on the one that's most relevant
to this course of lectures.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.010
Number one-- the government can
provide the public good itself.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.430
Recognizing that it will be under
produced by private parties,

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.540
the government can produce it.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.100
An example is space research.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.060
In most advanced countries, government
agencies conduct space research.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.590
In other words, governments don't rely
on private parties to do the research.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.110
Rather, governments take
on the task themselves.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.740
In the United States, this
approach may be corroding a bit,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.730
but it's still the dominant one.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:15.870
Similarly, much agricultural research is
currently conducted in government labs.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.140
Likewise, the provision
of national defense

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.590
is almost always done by a government.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.170
Mercenary armies are rare,
at least in the modern world.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.990
The final example mentioned
earlier-- navigation aids.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.050
Throughout the world, almost all
lighthouses and buoys and so forth

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.430
are built and operated by governments.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.330
Not surprisingly, the density of those
aids varies with the amount of money

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.120
each government is able and
willing to devote to the project.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.862
So there are many more buoys per mile
along the coast of the United States

00:30:48.862 --> 00:30:50.445
than, say, along the coast of Croatia.

00:30:50.445 --> 00:30:53.730
 

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.800
Number two-- instead of
providing the public good itself,

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.510
a government can select and
subsidize private parties

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.972
who are able and willing
to provide the good.

00:31:02.972 --> 00:31:07.760
The premier example of this strategy
in the United States is the $27 billion

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.930
per year that the National
Institutes of Health

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.560
pay to private parties--
typically universities--

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.150
that, in the government's
view, are likely to conduct

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.040
socially beneficial medical research.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.580
Much smaller scale is the grant
program of the National Endowment

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:30.950
for the Arts, which subsidizes
some kinds of cultural production.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:35.010
In Europe, governments commonly
subsidize private filmmakers.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.100
In other words, give them
grants that supplement

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.000
the money they can earn from box
office revenues, performance licenses,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.850
and so forth.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.130
Where do the European
governments get the money

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.980
that they then pay to the filmmakers?

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.010
Well, sometimes from
general tax revenues.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:56.580
Sometimes by taxing television
stations or television advertising.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.620
Implicit in this portion of the
system is a controversial judgment

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:06.330
that film is a more worthy art
form than television programming.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.010
Finally, sometimes the
European governments

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:14.150
get the money through taxes
on box office receipts.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.840
That at first seems very
odd, until one realizes

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.450
that the governments are
trying in this fashion

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:23.170
to diversify the kinds of
films that are produced.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.880
In other words, a portion
of the ticket prices

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.910
paid by the patrons of
mainstream films are

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.180
used to subsidize films that
are less popular, perhaps

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.500
because they're unconventional,
or because they're

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.560
made by first time filmmakers.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:44.130
Arguably, the ultimate objective is
to elevate the tastes of moviegoers.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:49.230
Whether the European governments are
justified and successful in this regard

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.610
is a question to which we'll return
later in this lecture series.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.440
 

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.590
Number three-- instead of giving
private parties grants in hopes

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.010
that they will then
generate public goods,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.530
the government can offer to
give the private parties prizes

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:09.460
if they generate socially
beneficial public goods.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:14.620
In the context of inventions, the former
Soviet Union and the People's Republic

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.180
of China have pursued this
strategy aggressively.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.360
In the United States,
it's used much less often,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.990
but innovations in atomic
energy are stimulated

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:27.130
by the government in this fashion.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.610
In the artistic context, the Audio
Home Recording act in the United States

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.650
contains a mechanism for
distributing government funds

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.270
to the owners of the
copyrights in popular songs.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.850
Several European countries have
much more extensive levee systems

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:48.320
that work essentially the same way,
all reliant prizes to induce innovation

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.080
that arguably would not otherwise occur.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.930
 

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:59.740
Solution number four consists of legal
reinforcement of self help strategies.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.370
A few minutes ago, I mentioned
that in some contexts,

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:06.640
secrecy or encryption can
substitute for governmental funding

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.760
and supporting innovation, specifically
by providing innovators protection

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.850
against competition and thus helping
overcome the public goods problem.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.530
Secrecy and encryption
are not perfect, however.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.940
They're threatened by economic
espionage, by faithless employees,

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.770
and by encryption circumvention.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.530
So governments can come
to the innovator's aid

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.389
not by paying them money, but
by establishing and enforcing

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:39.760
penalties for evading the innovators
private self help strategies.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.719
That's basically what
trade secret laws do.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:47.280
It's also the essence of the Boat-hull
Protection Act in the United States,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.650
which forbids certain ways
of reverse engineering

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.480
the design of recreational boats.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.050
Last but not least, this approach
underlies the recent addition

00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:01.500
to the copyright universe of
so-called anti-circumvention rules.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.060
In brief, these rules impose
fairly strong penalties

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:10.150
upon non-permissive trafficking
in circumvention technologies,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:14.980
and in some cases, upon the act of
encryption circumvention itself.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.860
The idea behind these rules
is to buttress encryption

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.360
as a strategy for discouraging
non-permissive reproduction

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.090
of cultural products.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.510
I mentioned these rules
in the first lecture.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.850
And we'll come back to them and examine
them in detail in the 11th lecture.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.220
 

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.740
This brings us finally to the
fifth, and for our purposes

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.350
here, the most important
of the approaches.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.050
The fifth strategy for overcoming
the public goods problem

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.100
is that governments sometimes
protect the producers

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.660
of public goods against
competition through law.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.400
So here's a quaint example.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.570
In the 19th century, governments would
sometimes authorize private companies

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.900
to create toll roads or bridges.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.430
In other words, to construct turnpikes
or bridges over rivers, and then

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.540
charge the travelers
who wanted to use them.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.910
But here's the key feature.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.810
When doing so, governments would
frequently promise the companies

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:20.760
that no competitor would be permitted
to construct a rival road or bridge,

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.770
at least for a certain period of time.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:27.250
The purpose and the effect
was to enable the companies

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.150
to charge high tolls,
at least for awhile.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:37.160
High enough to defray the construction
costs and to make a tidy profit.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160
Now, a footnote.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.250
The governments didn't always
make good on their promises.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:45.000
For example, the famous Charles River
bridge case in the United States

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.870
arose out of a breach of
a promise of this sort.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.210
A promise to limit the set of
bridges across the Charles River

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:55.060
here in Cambridge to
the first developer.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.480
Investors expectation
that governments might

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:04.070
renege in this way limited the
effectiveness of this approach.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.410
Putting that important
nuance to one side,

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.500
the key point is that
governments sometimes

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.360
encourage private parties to make
socially beneficial things not

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.590
by giving them grants or offering them
rewards or helping them to lock up

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:20.560
their ideas, but by
suppressing competition,

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.490
giving them for limited
periods of time monopolies.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:29.520
Intellectual property, and the law of
copyright and patent in particular,

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.320
constitute an application
of this approach.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.510
At least when viewed through
the utilitarian glasses,

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.960
the point of such laws is to give
authors and inventors exclusive rights

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.590
to make and distribute
copies of their creations,

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.000
and thereby to charge
high prices for them.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.110
High enough to offset the cost of
creating them in the first instance

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.940
and, even more importantly,
to induce creative people

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.060
to become authors and inventors
rather than lawyers or financiers.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.100
 

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.310
In the next segment
of this lecture, I'll

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:08.470
examine in detail how the copyright
system works, how exactly it functions

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.319
to overcome the public goods problem.
