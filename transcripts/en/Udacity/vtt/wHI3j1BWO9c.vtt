00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.770
Hi. In the last lesson we discussed

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.370
requirements engineering. This lesson is about object orientation

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.958
and other related concepts. The lesson is split

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.720
in two main parts. In the first part,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.870
we will provide a quick introduction to

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.890
object orientation and object oriented analysis and design.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.750
In the second part, we will cover the

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.710
essential of UML, which is the notation that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.190
we will use in the rest of the course and also in our projects.
