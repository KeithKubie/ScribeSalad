00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Music)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
On a typical day at school,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
endless hours are spent

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
learning the answers to questions.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But right now, we'll do the opposite.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're going to focus on questions where you can't learn the answers,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because they're unknown.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I used to puzzle about a lot of things as a boy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
For example, what would it feel like

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to be a dog?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Do fish feel pain? How about insects?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Was the Big Bang just an accident?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And is there a God?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And if so, how are we so sure that it's a He and not a She?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Why do so may innocent people and animals suffer terrible things?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Is there really a plan for my life?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Is the future yet to be written,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or is it already written

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and we just can't see it? But then, do I have free will?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Who am I, anyway? Am I just a biological machine?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But then, why am I conscious?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What is consciousness? Will robots become conscious one day?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I mean, I kind of assumed

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that some day I would be told the answers to all these questions.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I mean, someone must know, right?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Huh. Guess what? No one knows.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Most of those questions puzzle me more now than ever.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But diving into them is exciting

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because it takes you to the edge of knowledge,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.585
and you never know what you'll find there.

00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:47.000
So, two questions to kick off this series,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.477
questions that no one on Earth knows the answer to ...

00:01:51.997 --> 00:01:55.529
Text: How many universes are there?

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.308
Why can't we see evidence of alien life?
