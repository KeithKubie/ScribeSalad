00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.497
- [Voiceover] Given the polynomial above,

00:00:02.497 --> 00:00:05.179
what are its zeros?

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:08.582
So the zeros of this polynomial

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:10.521
are going to be the x-values

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:13.064
that make it equal to zero.

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:14.716
So it's going to be the x-values

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:17.220
that make this expression equal to zero.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.782
Or you could say the x-values

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:22.185
that satisfy this equation.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.325
Because if you satisfy this equation,

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.346
you're making this
expression equal to zero.

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:30.993
So what are those x-values going to be?

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:32.653
Well, if I take the product of two things,

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:34.313
and if they're going to be equal to zero,

00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:38.363
I can get zero if one or both
of these are equal to zero,

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.057
'cause zero times anything is zero.

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:42.946
So x plus seven

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.844
could be equal to zero,

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:47.841
or another way to solve this

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:51.167
is for x minus 10 to be equal to zero.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.071
So the zeros here,

00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:55.230
well how do we get x plus
seven to be equal to zero?

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.337
Well, subtract seven from both sides.

00:00:57.337 --> 00:00:59.322
X could be negative seven.

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:02.041
And if I add 10 to both sides here,

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.478
x could be equal to 10.

00:01:04.478 --> 00:01:05.802
Either of these is going to make

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.058
this expression equal to zero.

00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:07.767
You can see that.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.516
If x is equal to negative seven,

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:10.515
this is going to be zero.

00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:11.710
Zero times anything here,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.266
the whole thing's gonna be zero.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.764
If x is going to be equal to 10,

00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:17.114
this expression's going to be zero.

00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:18.537
And then the whole thing's gonna be zero.

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.394
So x is equal to negative seven,

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:22.183
and x is equal to 10,

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:24.622
which is that choice.

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:27.465
I wasn't able to circle in on

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:28.915
that choice right over there.

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:30.355
X equals negative seven,

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:33.497
and x is equal to 10.
