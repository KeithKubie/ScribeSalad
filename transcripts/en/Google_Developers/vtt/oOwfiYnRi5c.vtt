SPEAKER: From the
beginning, people

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.530
have been tinkering,
experimenting, taking things

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.700
apart, trying things out.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.910
And when lots of people are able
to get involved in this process

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.300
and play around with
tools and technology,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.210
it gets better for everyone.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.690
Recently, this
has been happening

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840
with artificial
intelligence, especially

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.580
with machine learning.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.170
Lots of people are
getting involved,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.530
exploring speech, language,
image recognition, and more.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.330
And that work is being
applied in helpful ways.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.070
In something like
Google Photos, you

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.790
can now just type "dancing"
to find all your pictures

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.001
of dancing.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.250
But if you're curious and
want to play with this stuff

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.000
and you're poking
around things like this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.130
trying to understand
how it all works,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.290
it can be pretty intimidating.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.570
That's why we've created a
site called AI Experiments.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.930
It's a showcase for simple,
hands-on experiments that show

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.736
how machine learning can make
sense of all kinds of things

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:52.235
like sound--

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.340
--language, music--

[PLAYS MUSIC]

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.257
--live video, everyday objects--

00:01:01.257 --> 00:01:02.257
COMPUTER VOICE 1: Drink.

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:03.720
COMPUTER VOICE 2: Drink.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.710
SPEAKER: --even in
different languages,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.730
and your messy doodles.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.410
COMPUTER VOICE 3: I see
frying pan or whale.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.360
Oh, I know.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.949
It's snowman.

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:13.490
SPEAKER: For each
experiment, there's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.530
a simple video explainer
by the people who made it.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.020
There are links to
open source code

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.120
to make it easier for others
to make new experiments.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.480
And people can submit
what they make.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.080
All of this is an effort to
make this technology more

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.990
accessible to everyone--
engineers, hobbyists, students,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.400
anyone who's curious.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.510
This way, anyone can get
inspired to start making things

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.870
with machine learning.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.266
So come and start playing
at g.co/aiexperiments.
