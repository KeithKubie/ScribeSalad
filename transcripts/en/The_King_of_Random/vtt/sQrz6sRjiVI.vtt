00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.190
Here's a little brain game you can easily
make to impress the smartest people you know.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.430
The idea has been around forever, but most
people still can't do it. The challenge is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.130
simple .. just balance these 14 nails on a
single nail head.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.649
For this project I started by making a template
for a platform design I want to try. If you

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.829
like it, you can have it for free. I'm getting
ready to tape this to a piece of wood, and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.999
I want these edges flush, but a little overhang
on these others. I found a 3/4" panel of birch

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.219
wood in a scrap pile at the home improvement
store, and my paper template goes right in

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420
the corner. A little duct tape will hold it
in place just enough to help me cut holes

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.290
for some nails. A total of 15 holes for 15
nails. I've got a 9/64" drill bit that looks

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.060
about the right size, so that goes in the
chuck of my drill press. And once I've got

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.180
it in secure, I'll drill a test hole in some
junk wood to double check these 3" framing

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.350
nails will fit. I can manipulate the nail
easily, and the hole is still tight enough

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.420
to support the spike firmly in place. Perfect!
Lowering the bit next to the edge of the board

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.260
will help me gauge the depth of the hole,
and I can set these nuts to stop the press

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.060
from drilling any deeper. I think I'm ready
to drill some holes. I'm being careful to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.750
drill all 15 markers to the same depth, and
before I move on I'll insert a nail in each

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.190
hole and check the tops of the nail heads
to see if they're all level. Looking good.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.300
Let's move on. The nails come out and it's
over to the chop saw to cut the other 2 sides

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.430
off the template. These cuts are good, and
I'm happy with it so far, but let's go one

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.210
step further and take it to the router table
for some finishing work. I've got a 3/8" beading

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.490
bit and i'm testing the profile cut on some
scrap wood. It looks like that's going to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.830
work, so I can place the block with the nail
holes facing down and carefully router the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.789
edges. This bit is spinning at 20,000 rpm
so I have to be very careful not to lose a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.120
finger here. Ok the edges are done, but a
little furry, so I'll sand that off with some

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.860
100 grit sandpaper, then hit the top as well
to get it ready for some color. I like how

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.940
it's looking now, so time to grab some leftover
stain and shake it up, wearing gloves of course.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.970
This is a "Rosewood" color stain and one of
my project nails will help get the lid off.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.640
I'll use a rolled up paper towel to apply
the stain to the bottom, top, and edges, making

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.990
sure every surface gets a liberal coating.
This will soak for about 3 minutes, then I'll

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.700
use another paper towel to remove the excess
so that it looks like this. After about 2

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.640
hours of drying, I'll insert a nail in the
center hole, and grab some wood finish that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.200
will seal the wood and give this a somewhat
glossy look. When the sides are all sprayed

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.380
I'll prop it up to dry for another couple
of hours. If this looks like more work than

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.959
you want to put into this project, you could
always just grab any old piece of wood and

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.459
a hammer and nail it in just about anywhere.
It's as easy as that. But maybe you don't

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.959
have a hammer? Go find a rock. Just a couple
of taps and you're ready to go. If you don't

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.500
have a rock? How about an attractive assistant?
You can use any method you can think of, as

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.000
long as your nail is straight up like this.
Alright it looks like the finish is dry, and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.819
we've got the nails set in place. Now you
can challenge your friends to balance all

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.959
the outer nails on the lone inner one. All
the nails have to balance at the same time,

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.040
and can only touch the center nail head. I've
seen some pretty creative attempts at getting

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.260
this to work. I say "attempts" because typically
it's fail after fail after fail. When your

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.709
player is sufficiently discouraged and claims
it's impossible, this is where you get to

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.480
show off your brilliance. Here's the super
simple pattern that was discovered long long

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.180
ago, and works amazingly well. Lay one nail
on the table, and mesh the other nails over

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.380
top, one after the other, like this, until
you have 6 nails laid out on either side.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.180
This last nail goes on top, pointing the other
direction, and the pattern is complete. To

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.060
make this effective, grab the bottom nail
on both ends with your middle fingertips,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.360
and while lifting slowly, use your thumbs
to hold the top nail down until all the nail-heads

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.450
catch. At this point you can remove your thumbs,
and place the entire structure in position.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.060
Well that was easy! The center of gravity
of the entire unit is lower than the balance

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.780
point, making this amazingly stable. I also
discovered that the nails can be compacted

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.000
and even more nails added! I just added 9
more nails for a total of 23, and it's still

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.560
holding firm. I just made another stack of
22 nails, and am seeing if I can get them

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.940
to balance on top. Ooh, a little shifting,
but they've held. I'll take my chances with

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.250
another group of 22, and now this structure
is up to 67 nails! When I try one more stack

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.830
of 22 spikes, it's about finished, but wait,
it actually stayed up! Well there you have

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.150
it, 89 nails balanced on 1 nail head. At this
point, the center of gravity is high, and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.030
the base is narrow, so it takes mad ninja
skills to balance any more. I even got this

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.970
to work with stacks of up to 15 matches. And
even when they were lit on fire they held

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.340
their place on top of those little match sticks
amazingly well. How many nails can you get

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.760
to balance? Thatâ€™s it for now. If you liked
this project, perhaps you'll like some of

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.470
my others. Check them out at thekingofrandom.com
