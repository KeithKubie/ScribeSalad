00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:17.854
Paula Stone Williams: So, I was the CEO
of a large, religious nonprofit,

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:22.222
spoke at some of the largest
churches in America,

00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:25.700
was on television in 70 different markets,

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:28.464
but more than anything else,

00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:31.154
I just wanted to be a good parent.

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:33.284
I told all three of my children,

00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:35.237
"When the going gets tough,

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:38.351
you have to choose the road less traveled,

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:39.669
the narrow path."

00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:44.765
I had no idea how difficult
that was going to become.

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:47.909
I knew from the time I was three
or four years of age

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.517
that I was transgender.

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:54.346
I knew if I came out,
I would lose everything.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.257
But the call toward authenticity is sacred

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:00.264
and for the greater good,

00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:04.725
and it asks you to trust that the truth
not only sets you free,

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:07.608
it will set everyone free.

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:10.422
I decided to stake my life on it.

00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.120
So I came out.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:15.005
Turns out, if you spend most of your life

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:17.291
working in the conservative
religious world,

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:21.413
coming out as transgender
is not all that great for your career.

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:23.038
(Laughter)

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.230
Who knew?

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:26.765
(Laughter)

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.126
Within seven days, I lost
every single one of my jobs.

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:36.645
My family was supportive but struggling.

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:39.194
Most of my friends
and coworkers had rejected me;

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:41.037
the rest were confused.

00:01:41.473 --> 00:01:45.012
One friend said,
"You really messed with me."

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:48.137
I said, "Yeah, well, get in line."

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:53.611
They said, "You were my only example
of an alpha male who was gentle."

00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.572
And I thought, "Oh. You're right."

00:01:57.108 --> 00:01:59.372
I was an alpha male.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.161
And I was gentle.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:04.065
And if it was hard for him,

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:07.648
how much more difficult
was it for my own son?

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.503
Jonathan Williams: Estrangement
was not an option.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:14.567
It was Father's Day and my girls
brought me craft beer

00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:17.199
and a homemade jar of pickles,
which, in my estimation,

00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:19.027
is the perfect Father's Day gift.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.202
(Laughter)

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:22.065
But the question remained:

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.574
Do I call my own father?

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:26.936
To call him, and I continue down
this spiral of denial,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.685
pretending that my dad was still --

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.875
well, my dad.

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:35.282
To not call was to acknowledge
that everything had changed.

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:40.360
It meant that I was in for years of pain
and mourning and sadness,

00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:43.323
but ultimately, hope for reconciliation.

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:48.378
There's no playbook for when one's father
of 30 plus years decides to transition

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.047
to the female gender.

00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.266
But my dad did teach me one thing.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.082
He said the road to redemption always
comes from choosing the narrow path.

00:02:56.906 --> 00:02:58.888
And so I decided not to call that day,

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:02.541
and a few months later, Paula flew
out and met me at a hotel in New York,

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:03.942
my wife and I.

00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:06.630
I knocked on the door,
and this woman answered.

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:08.760
It definitely wasn't my dad.

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.482
"It's good to see you," she said.

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:13.655
It didn't sound like my dad, either.

00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:17.006
We went to lunch, and the waiter
came to take our order.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.890
He said, "Let's start with the ladies,"

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.730
but there was only one lady
at the table and it was my wife,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.213
and -- oh my God, there are two
women at the table.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.243
And my dad ordered something like lettuce,

00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:28.220
and I was like, I have fries on my plate.

00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:30.904
Did my dad like fries? I don't remember.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.500
I think he liked them.

00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:35.071
But she wasn't eating them.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.923
Here's this woman who knew
everything about me,

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:41.675
and I knew nothing about her.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.030
I don't even remember saying goodbye.

00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.503
PSW: All I could think about that day

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.583
was that it was late
September in New York,

00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:53.370
and I was wearing white jeans.

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:54.498
(Laughter)

00:03:54.522 --> 00:03:57.609
You don't wear white
after Labor Day in New York.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:00.138
There was a knock at the door,

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:03.951
and all I could think about was,
here I stand in my wrong jeans.

00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:06.394
And then I saw these big,
blue eyes I love so much,

00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:08.988
and they were staring
back at me in disbelief.

00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:13.116
And I thought, "Oh, this is not
going to be easy."

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.704
When one person in a family transitions,

00:04:16.728 --> 00:04:20.436
the entire family transitions
whether they want to or not.

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:23.314
Now, for those on the fringes it was easy.

00:04:23.702 --> 00:04:25.531
The liberals said, "Oh, wonderful!

00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:27.834
She's found her truth, how delightful."

00:04:27.858 --> 00:04:30.944
And the conservatives said,
"That's messed up, I'm out of here."

00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:32.094
(Laughter)

00:04:32.118 --> 00:04:36.028
But for my family, neither extreme
was going to work.

00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:39.103
Their anger, their hurt,

00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:41.826
their love and loyalty --

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.849
all of it had to be brought
on to the road of trials.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.553
JW: Was it all a lie?

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.033
Every game of catch in the front yard,
the Mets season tickets --

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:55.380
was that with my dad or was that with her?

00:04:56.503 --> 00:04:58.082
I remember this one time,

00:04:58.106 --> 00:05:00.566
my dad took me on a bike ride
through Heckscher Park

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.252
to teach me about sex.

00:05:02.276 --> 00:05:06.554
He explained the parts of the body
that I now know he wished weren't hers.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.557
Had my father ever even existed?

00:05:11.508 --> 00:05:12.706
Now, grief --

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.137
grief is without rules.

00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:17.340
Grief borrows your car without asking,

00:05:17.364 --> 00:05:18.520
wrecks it

00:05:18.544 --> 00:05:20.288
and then doesn't apologize.

00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:21.628
And I was a wreck.

00:05:22.018 --> 00:05:23.168
This was heavy.

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:24.394
I retreated into myself.

00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:25.674
I was angry.

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:27.738
I felt betrayed.

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:29.239
And I guess I should have known

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:31.646
by the fact that you encouraged
me to be a Mets fan

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.768
that you were preparing me
for life's really big disappointments.

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:35.842
(Laughter)

00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:37.016
That's true.

00:05:37.678 --> 00:05:39.756
And yet, there were the games of catch,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.372
and there were the season tickets

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:43.808
and bacon, egg and cheese
sandwiches every Saturday

00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:45.809
from the best bagel place on Long Island.

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:48.133
My father lived this life
he didn't want to live,

00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:51.578
but he lived it so
that I could have a dad.

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:55.283
I stopped wondering
if my dad had ever existed.

00:05:55.991 --> 00:06:01.093
He had existed -- willfully,
consciously, intentionally --

00:06:01.117 --> 00:06:03.360
each and every day of my growing up.

00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:05.417
For that, I was thankful.

00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:10.148
Paula's body was hers now
and her transformation was complete,

00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:12.534
but my transformation was just beginning.

00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:16.694
I had another trial, another journey,
another choice to heed my father's advice

00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:19.449
and continue down that narrow path.

00:06:21.088 --> 00:06:24.442
PSW: So most days
I believe there is a God.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:26.816
Tuesdays and Thursdays can be tough,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.421
and any day that you're
on the New Jersey Turnpike.

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:30.748
I mean, really, you know?

00:06:30.772 --> 00:06:31.743
(Laughter)

00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:35.410
It's hard to believe in God
when your soul is in the wrong body.

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.656
Still, somehow I ended up in ministry.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.344
When I lost all my jobs,
it was nothing personal.

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:43.948
It's what religious tribes do.

00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:47.358
They believe an enemy is necessary
for the tribe to survive,

00:06:47.382 --> 00:06:49.406
so where no enemy exists,

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.221
they create one.

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.522
Right now, sexual minorities
are the enemy;

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:56.015
my departure was swift and sure.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.326
I was surprised when my son
left his job teaching in West Philadelphia

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.028
to go into the ministry.

00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:05.153
I did not see that one coming.

00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:07.626
And now I wondered:

00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:09.531
What would he do?

00:07:10.172 --> 00:07:12.995
I didn't have to wait that long
to find an answer.

00:07:13.392 --> 00:07:16.149
Six months after that first visit,

00:07:16.173 --> 00:07:18.533
he invited me back to New York.

00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:21.324
JW: The designers of the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:07:21.348 --> 00:07:22.954
they had their share of bad luck.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.890
John Roebling, he died shortly after
the bridge's construction began.

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:28.303
His son Washington took over,

00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:30.654
but he suffered
from decompression sickness.

00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:33.680
His wife Emily became the surrogate
executive engineer

00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:35.672
who oversaw the bridge's completion.

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:37.700
Father and son,

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:39.424
John and Washington,

00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:41.145
done in by their work.

00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:43.194
It was this sunny day in May

00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:46.234
and my father and I sat in the shadow
of that Brooklyn Bridge.

00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:48.977
Would our lives follow the Roeblings' --

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:51.949
father and son, done in by our work?

00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:55.182
My father thought
that her friends in church

00:07:55.206 --> 00:07:57.379
would carry her through her transition,

00:07:57.403 --> 00:07:59.037
and they did not.

00:07:59.497 --> 00:08:01.337
They ditched her and they clung to me.

00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:03.505
I was the pastor
of a new church in Brooklyn.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:06.127
This wonderful group
of forward-thinking people,

00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:09.635
and yet, we were financially tied
to really conservative churches.

00:08:10.016 --> 00:08:14.658
To hold space for Paula meant jeopardizing
our own church's livelihood.

00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:18.961
I sort of straddled the line
between these warring worlds.

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:20.173
So I said to my dad,

00:08:20.197 --> 00:08:22.656
"Dad, I still live and work
in your old world.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.300
Is it possible that you might extend
an olive branch for my sake?"

00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:30.526
And her response was impassioned.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.866
You said to me, "Do you have
any idea what it feels like

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.074
to finally show yourself
to your true friends

00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:40.582
and have them completely reject you?

00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:42.091
To ask you to live a lie?

00:08:42.115 --> 00:08:44.076
Do you know what that feels like?"

00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:47.423
And I didn't know what that felt like.

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.736
But I knew I had a decision to make.

00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:55.069
It was the decision to continue
down that narrow path through nights,

00:08:55.093 --> 00:08:57.049
but for the first time,

00:08:57.073 --> 00:08:58.724
I caught a glimpse of light.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.474
I cannot ask my father to be anything
other than her true self.

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:09.630
(Applause)

00:09:12.494 --> 00:09:15.321
PSW: So as we sat by the river that day,

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:20.668
Jonathan talked about his pain,
his suffering, his grief, his confusion.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.067
He brought all of himself
to that conversation,

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.842
and it tore at me

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:34.256
to be the cause of such pain.

00:09:36.566 --> 00:09:40.280
But as he talked, there was something
redemptive going on,

00:09:40.304 --> 00:09:43.251
full of tension but possibility,

00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:46.088
grounded in that narrow path.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:51.360
He said, "This is always going to be hard.

00:09:51.384 --> 00:09:52.731
It always will be.

00:09:52.755 --> 00:09:53.930
But Dad,

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:56.193
I love you."

00:09:56.954 --> 00:10:00.951
My son is the best of me and more.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.514
He's bold and strong,

00:10:03.538 --> 00:10:06.333
sensitive and thoughtful.

00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:08.643
I guess you could say,

00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:12.705
he's an alpha male who's gentle.

00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:17.979
JW: It was time for my daughters
to meet their -- Paula.

00:10:18.003 --> 00:10:19.396
We went back to my apartment,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.073
and my daughters were coloring
at the dining room table,

00:10:22.097 --> 00:10:23.782
and there was this awkward silence.

00:10:23.806 --> 00:10:27.661
And finally, my youngest asked
a single, confident question.

00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:31.486
"So, Grandpa, do you have a penis?"

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.162
(Laughter)

00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:36.758
And after the tension abated
and the laughter subsided,

00:10:36.782 --> 00:10:39.879
my girls took their grandpa
back into their room

00:10:39.903 --> 00:10:41.336
and showed her their new toys,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.292
and they christened her with a new name.

00:10:43.316 --> 00:10:45.337
They called her "GrandPaula."

00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:47.864
(Laughter)

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:53.556
PSW: So this past summer, I had all five
of my granddaughters at my home,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.129
there in the foothills
of the Rocky Mountains.

00:10:56.153 --> 00:10:58.405
We went swimming
in the cool waters of the river

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:00.099
that flows through our little town.

00:11:00.123 --> 00:11:02.387
And one day, one of Jonathan's
girls said to me,

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:05.962
"GrandPaula, can we go
tubing on the river?"

00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:07.765
And I said, "Well, you know,

00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:10.283
I'd really wait until your daddy
gets here for that.

00:11:10.307 --> 00:11:12.650
That feels to me like
that ought to be his call."

00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:16.680
And she said, "Oh, but GrandPaula,

00:11:16.704 --> 00:11:19.353
he'll exactly make the same
decision you would.

00:11:19.377 --> 00:11:21.763
He's a lot like you, you know."

00:11:21.787 --> 00:11:23.331
(Laughter)

00:11:23.355 --> 00:11:27.643
And I thought, yeah, he is a lot like me,

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:31.723
both of us determined
to find the narrow path

00:11:31.747 --> 00:11:35.819
and follow it through
the long, dark night,

00:11:35.843 --> 00:11:38.651
all the way to the light of dawn.

00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:42.215
JW: Have you ever noticed
that a child who is secure,

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:43.491
a child who knows love,

00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:45.303
that child will dance?

00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:47.531
They wave their arms,

00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:50.389
they kick their legs to music
that only they can hear.

00:11:50.413 --> 00:11:54.027
It's the music of a child
who is safe and unharmed

00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:56.671
and wholly loved.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.678
The day after my children
met their GrandPaula,

00:11:59.702 --> 00:12:01.354
she took them to go get doughnuts,

00:12:01.378 --> 00:12:03.510
and I watched as they walked
down the street,

00:12:03.534 --> 00:12:05.221
and my girls took my father's arms,

00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:07.207
and they danced.

00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:09.935
My father's arms swung wildly.

00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:14.104
You bought them one too many doughnuts,
because you always do --

00:12:14.128 --> 00:12:15.167
(Laughter)

00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:17.845
I watched my older daughter
take a bite of her doughnut,

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:20.270
and she unleashed two jumps and a twirl.

00:12:20.294 --> 00:12:21.613
It was perfect.

00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:24.345
That narrow path,

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.888
it always has its share
of burdens and challenges.

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:31.908
But I was certain that we were going
to see this through to redemption.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.920
I looked at my dad

00:12:33.944 --> 00:12:37.933
and I looked at my girls who were dancing
and eating their doughnuts,

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:40.305
and I said aloud to no one in particular,

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:41.717
I said, "This ...

00:12:42.503 --> 00:12:44.506
this is how God sees my dad."

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:48.159
My father was literally born again.

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:52.152
And by choosing the narrow
path of redemption,

00:12:52.176 --> 00:12:53.827
I was born again with her.

00:12:54.234 --> 00:12:55.384
Thank you.

00:12:55.912 --> 00:13:02.515
(Applause and cheers)
