00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:08.525
 We have the expression (2x + 4) (5x - 9) = αx ^ 2 + bx - 36. 

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:12.909
 We have to find what a and b will be. 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.080
 I recommend that you pause the video and try to find it yourself. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.240
 There are several ways to deal with this 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:22.760
 and the simplest is to multiply the two single members on the left side 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.375
 and see we can link members and odds. 

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.140
 Let's multiply the left side. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.788
 There are several ways to do that. 

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:34.720
 I prefer to consider it as applying the distribution property twice. 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.480
 The expression on the left can be written as ... 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.842
 One way to do this is to uncover braces and multiply 

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.303
 (2x + 4) at (5x - 9). 

00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:51.460
 This is the same as (2x + 4) at 5x plus (2x + 4) by -9. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.400
 Or we could write it this way. 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:03.340
 This is 5x by (2x + 4). 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.600
 And we can see this as plus -9 or only as minus 9. 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.520
 Minus 9 in (2x4). 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.146
 All we did was reveal the brackets and multiply (2x + 4) by (5x - 9). 

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:23.186
 Okay, now that we've written it this way, looking at 5x by (2h + 4), 

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:25.369
 we see that we can multiply by 5x. 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.875
 We can multiply 5x by (2x + 4). 

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.104
 How much is 5x by 2h? 

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:34.378
 This is 10 x 2, 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.680
 5x by 4 is plus 20x. 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:49.760
 And then we have -9 at 2x = -18x. 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.897
 Minus 18h. 

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:58.353
 And then you got -9 at 4, which is -36. 

00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:00.234
 And now we can simplify it. 

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:01.859
 We have two first degree members. 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.840
 We have 10x ^ 2 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.476
 and then these two first degree members, 

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:09.846
 let me surround them ... 

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.983
 We have these two first degree members. 

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.792
 If I have 20x and get out of them 18x, 

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.138
 will stay 2h. 

00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:19.715
 20x minus 18x is two x. 

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:22.803
 And then, of course, we still have -36. 

00:02:22.803 --> 00:02:24.289
 Everything I've done so far is 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.888
 simplify or convert the left side. 

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:30.180
 However, we must remember that this is an equation, 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.960
 so this should be equal to the right side. 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:46.520
 This is equal to αx2 + bx -36. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.537
 And now, after writing it in appropriate colors, you can think of what a and b will be. 

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:59.502
 On the left we have 10x ^ 2, and on the right the member of the second degree is αx ^ 2. 

00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:02.126
 So 10 should be equal to a. 

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:03.915
 These two factors must be equal. 

00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:06.306
 We can write that a is equal to 10. 

00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:09.000
 And then we look at the first grade member. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.251
 Here we have 2h, and here we have bh. 

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.921
 So 2 should be equal to b 

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.359
 or b must be equal to 2. 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.006
 And it turns out that free members 

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.235
 are the same on both sides. 

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.044
 So we decided it, but it is equal to 10, b equals 2. 

00:03:25.044 --> 00:03:28.300
 Now that you have exercised enough on this, you might want to ask: 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.989
 "Is there a faster way to do this?" 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.628
 Even though you're more likely to do it 

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.484
 inadvertent errors. 

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.134
 You can ask: 

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:37.176
 "How do I get a square?" 

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:39.498
 How, when I multiply these, 

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:40.358
 do i get a square? " 

00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:41.960
 The only way to get x in a square 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.606
 is to multiply 2x by 5x. 

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:48.660
 And this is 10x square. 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.880
 And then you can ask: "Well, it's equal to 10. 

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:54.029
 But how do I find x? " 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.674
 There are two ways to find x. 

00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:02.713
 You can multiply 2x by minus 9. 

00:04:02.713 --> 00:04:05.707
 This is minus 18x. 

00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:08.795
 Or you can multiply 4 by 5x, 

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:11.698
 which is plus 20x. 

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:13.928
 If you put them together, 

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:16.380
 they will be equal to 2h. 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.000
 Therefore, 2x = bx, 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.658
 b must be equal to 2. 

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:23.865
 And then you can just check ... 

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:25.050
 how will you get the free member? 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.907
 Well, you have to multiply the two free members. 

00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:29.531
 4 in 9 and you will get -36. 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.020
 The second way I've just decided, 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.132
 is a little faster, but 

00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:34.198
 you are more likely to make a mistake inadvertently. 

00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:35.243
 I hope you understand, 

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:37.356
 that they actually do the same thing. 

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:40.300
 Perhaps with different degrees of clarity.
