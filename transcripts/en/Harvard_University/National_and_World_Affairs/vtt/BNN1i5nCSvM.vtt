00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.910
These are safe rooms.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.009
We can put a person with of tuberculosis in it

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.000
and he is not

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.989
or she is not going to infect

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.089
anyone else as long as they are wearing a mask

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.639
whereas right now, in every hospital that ever
seen

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.830
in a really poor setting

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.300
TB patients who are in the hospital

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.710
are at great risk of infecting other patients
and at an even greater risk of infecting

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.480
health workers who were there all the time.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.129
Hind is just extraordinary person you know
she's originally from Sudan

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.240
she's probably now seen as many or more patients
than any clinician 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.660
on the face of the earth

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.820
dealing with MDR-TB, XDR-TB and HIV.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.470
"and we are trying actually, we 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.200
cannot just keep the patient as we 
are keeping him in the prison

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.280
so we take him outside 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.200
so he can go

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.290
and during the day, they really need to go 
outside and have some fresh air.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.030
So they are very advanced patients

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.550
they are HIV positive

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.870
with very low CD-4

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.870
some of them had CD-4,6, and 11, and as well as CD 
side effects for MDR-TB treatment

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.740
so we are keeping them for a long time,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.140
but usually they would stay here for 2- 3 weeks maximum."

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.439
"So we explain to him that the drug will take up to what, 
2 weeks

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.780
to pick up, so he has to just relax and allow them to work."

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.280
I'm a Doris Duke Fellow so it's a year of clinical research and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.860
I'm working on a community treatment program for MDR-TB

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.590
and as part of that we've come here to see
how Partners in Health 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.640
have been running their program

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.640
This is the map of patient distribution across Lesotho

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.970
as you can see the patients are everywhere. 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.009
The introduction of Tb treatment

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.750
had started in the lowlands before the highlands.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.090
So it is just in the last years 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.360
that the TB medications 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.909
had been distributed to the clinics in the highlands

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.179
but we have seen patients with confirmed MDR 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.529
and as well with XDR

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.179
from the mountain area

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.579
from our clinic in Ohana

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.109
had 4 cases with MDR

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.479
one of

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.679
and another patient with XDR.

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.719
In southern Africa

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.120
with the combination of HIV and MDR-TB

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.099
and patients being so sick and no hospital
being able to do it

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.650
what is happening by default in other
countries, even in South Africa,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.359
especially in places like Swaziland and Botswana

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.069
is they go into a big hospital with everyone
else

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.409
and with very high rates of HIV in the general
population

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.189
lots of people were getting infected so this is

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.529
you know this is going to have to happen everywhere
in southern African Africa where this is 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:52.889
this kind of problem

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.029
the first thing you want to do is get them

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:55.579
healthier

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.039
smear negative and then get them out.
