00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.880
Let's say that I have
a geometric series.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.960
A geometric sequence,
I should say.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.680
We'll talk about
series in a second.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.160
So a geometric series,
let's say it starts at 1,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.875
and then our common
ratio is 1/2.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:15.250
So the common
ratio is the number

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.460
that we keep multiplying by.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.510
So 1 times 1/2 is 1/2, 1/2
times 1/2 is 1/4, 1/4 times 1/2

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.510
is 1/8, and we can keep going
on and on and on forever.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.190
This is an infinite
geometric sequence.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.980
And we can denote this.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.570
We can say that this is equal to
the sequence of a sub n from n

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.525
equals 1 to infinity, with
a sub n equaling 1 times

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:45.560
our common ratio
to the n minus 1.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.770
So it's going to be our
first term, which is just 1,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.570
times our common
ratio, which is 1/2.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.834
1/2 to the n minus 1.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:54.750
And you can verify it.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.980
This right over here you can
view as 1/2 to the 0 power.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.200
This is 1/2 half to the first
power, this is 1/2 squared.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.319
1/2 to the first,
this is 1/2 squared.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.020
So the first term
is 1/2 to the 0.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.090
The second term is 1/2 to the 1.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.710
The third term is 1/2 squared.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.470
So the nth term is going
to be 1/2 to the n minus 1.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.100
So this is just really 1/2
to the n minus 1 power.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.406
Fair enough.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.780
Now, let's say we
don't just care

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.360
about looking at the sequence.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.830
We actually care about
the sum of the sequence.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.882
So we actually
care about not just

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:28.340
looking at each of
these terms, see

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.660
what happens as I keep
multiplying by 1/2,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.710
but I actually care
about summing 1 plus 1/2

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.710
plus 1/4 plus 1/8, and keep
going on and on and on forever.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.760
So this we would now
call a geometric series.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.110
And because I keep adding
an infinite number of terms,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.590
this is an infinite
geometric series.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.200
So this right over here would be
the infinite geometric series.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.310
A series you can just view
as the sum of a sequence.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.890
Now, how would we denote this?

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.950
Well, we can use
summing notation.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.880
We could say that this
is equal to the sum.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.060
We could say that this
is equal to the sum.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.851
Let me make sure I'm not
falling off the page.

00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:12.600
Let me just scroll
over to the left a bit.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.060
The sum from n equals 1
to infinity of a sub n.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.530
And a sub n is just
1/2 to the n minus 1.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.480
1/2 to the n minus 1 power.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.980
So you just say OK,
when n equals 1,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.804
it's 1/2 to the 0, which is 1.

00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:30.220
Then I'm going to
sum that to when

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.690
n equals 2, which is 1/2,
when n equals 3, it's 1/4.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.730
On and on, and on, and on.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.240
So all I want to do in this
video is to really clarify

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.780
differences between
sequences and series,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.410
and make you a little bit
comfortable with the notation.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.120
In the next few
videos, we'll actually

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.820
try to take sums
of geometric series

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.139
and see if we actually
get a finite value.
