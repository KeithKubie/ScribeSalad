 please 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.290
 I would like to tell you simply 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.680
 how happy I am to be among 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.710
 you and how much I am moved by the honor 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.030
 you did not give me this 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.030
 Nobel Prize in literature 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.560
 this is the first time I have to 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.500
 give a speech in front of a 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.730
 large assembly 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.300
 and I feel some 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.430
 apprehension 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.390
 we would be tempted to believe that for a 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:27.310
 writer it is natural and easy to 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:31.150
 deliver on this exercise but a writer 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.570
 or at least a novelist often has 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.690
 difficult relationships with speech 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.800
 and if we remember this distinction 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.990
 school between the written and the oral 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.380
 a novelist is more talented for 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.050
 creeks for the oral one he used to 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.500
 keep quiet and if he wants to penetrate a 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.740
 atmosphere it must blend into the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.410
 crowd he listens to conversations without 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.130
 look and if he intervenes in 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.350
 this one 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.890
 it's always to ask a few 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.040
 discrete questions in order to better 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.730
 understand the women and men who 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.590
 surround 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:19.540
 he has a hesitant word because of his 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.120
 usual erasures and his writings of course 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.660
 after multiple erasures his style 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.110
 may sound limpid but when he 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.220
 speaks he no longer has the resource 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.220
 to correct his hesitations 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.350
 and then I belong to a generation where 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:46.120
 we did not let the children speak 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.599
 except on certain occasions without enough 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.840
 rare and six ask for permission 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:55.050
 but we do not listen to them so well that 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.310
 often they were cut off 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.150
 that explains the difficulty 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.630
 speech of some of us 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.490
 sometimes hesitant sometimes too fast like 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.330
 if he feared every moment to be 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.550
 interrupted from where undoubtedly this desire 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.300
 to write that did not take as much 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.690
 others at the end of childhood 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.990
 you hope adults will read you 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.320
 they will be obliged to listen to you 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.419
 without interrupting you and they will know a 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.509
 times for all you have on the 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.509
 heart 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.409
 the announcement of this prize seemed unreal and 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.759
 I was anxious to know why you 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:46.520
 I had chosen that day I believe 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:50.009
 never felt so 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.039
 how much a novelist is blind screwed to 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.229
 from his own books and how much 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:59.189
 voters know more than him 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:01.560
 on what he writes a novelist can only 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:05.639
 never be his reader except for 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:10.050
 correct in his manuscript mistakes 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:12.870
 of syntax repetitions or delete 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.590
 a paragraph too much he only has one 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:19.949
 confused and partial representation of 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.190
 his books as a painter busy at 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:26.520
 to make a ceiling mural and who 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:30.719
 lying on a scaffolding work in 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.960
 the details of too closely without vision 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.960
 aggregate 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.870
 curious lonely activity than that 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.060
 to write you go through moments of 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.349
 discouragement 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.949
 when you write the first pages 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:49.520
 of a novel you have every day 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.630
 the impression of going astray 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.910
 so what 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.530
 if we are great to go back 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.880
 and to take you on another path 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.570
 do not succumb to this 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.740
 temptation 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:07.050
 but following the same road is a bit 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:10.050
 like to be driving a car the 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:14.130
 night in winter and ride on the ice 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.730
 without any visibility you do not have 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.680
 the choice 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.650
 you can not go back 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:23.430
 you must continue to advance in you 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.380
 saying that the road will end up being 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.580
 more stable and that the fog is 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:32.340
 will dissipate about to complete a 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.430
 book it seems to you that this one 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:38.880
 starts to break away from you and he 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.460
 already breathe the air of freedom like 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.320
 children in the class the day before 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.690
 summer holidays 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.840
 they are distracted and noisy and 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.430
 no longer listen to their teachers I 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.950
 would even say that at the moment you write 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:57.780
 the last paragraphs the book 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:08:01.860
 shows some hostility in its 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:06.720
 to free yourself from you and he leaves us 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:09.360
 scarcely have you drawn the last 

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.020
 words it's over he does not need anymore 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.760
 you have already forgotten you are these are the 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.990
 readers now who will reveal it to 

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:22.280
 himself you are experiencing at that moment a 

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:26.720
 big empty and the feeling of having been 

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:29.100
 abandoned is also a kind 

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.980
 of dissatisfaction because of this link 

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.660
 between the book and you who has been sliced 

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.000
 too fast 

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.120
 this dissatisfaction and this feeling of 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.840
 something unexplained is pushing to 

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.270
 write the next book to restore 

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.290
 balanced without you getting there 

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.880
 never as the years go by 

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.920
 books 

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:56.840
 succeed and readers will talk about the 9 

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.730
 may you feel that it does not 

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.910
 was you a tail of a long 

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:06.950
 flight forward 

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:09.620
 yes the reader years and longer than on 

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.480
 a book that its author himself himself 

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.790
 passes between a novel and his reader a 

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.360
 phenomenon analogous to that of 

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:19.460
 development of photos as it is 

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.890
 practiced before the digital era 

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.310
 at the time of drawing in the room 

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.480
 black 

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:31.370
 the picture gradually became visible 

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.240
 how far we advance in reading 

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.490
 of a novel 

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:37.940
 the same process takes place 

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:41.240
 chemicals but for there to be such 

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.970
 agreement between the author and his reader he 

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.360
 is necessary that the novelist does not force 

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:51.800
 never his reader in the sense that one dida 

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:55.340
 singer that he forces his voice but 

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.160
 drive him imperceptibly and he 

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.220
 leaves enough room for the 

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:05.000
 book impregnates it little by little and that by 

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:07.580
 an art that looks like acupuncture or 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.490
 it is enough to peck the pointer a 

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.840
 very specific place and the flow that 

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.840
 spread in the nervous system 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.420
 this intimate and complementary relationship 

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.330
 between the novelist his reader I believe 

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.670
 that we do not find the equivalent in 

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.560
 the musical field 

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.820
 I always thought that writing was 

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.430
 close to music 

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.960
 I always thought that writing was 

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.350
 close to music but much less 

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.720
 pure that this one and I always envied 

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.690
 the musicians who feel me practices 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.370
 is an art superior to novels and 

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.070
 poets who are closer to 

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.750
 musicians that novelists I 

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.750
 started writing poems in my 

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:53.130
 childhood and it's probably thanks to that 

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:56.840
 that I understood better 

00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:00.210
 the reflection that I read somewhere 

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:05.820
 it is with a bad poet that one 

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:06.900
 does prose writers and then with regards 

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.340
 regards music 

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.560
 it's often for a novelist 

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.660
 to train all people 

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.120
 landscapes the streets he could observe 

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.910
 in a part in a partition 

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.420
 musical where we find the same 

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:23.100
 melodic fragments from one book to another 

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.630
 but a musical score that 

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.620
 will seem imperfect 

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:31.410
 there will be in the novelist the regret of 

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.080
 have not been a pure musicians and 

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:39.060
 did not compose the nocturnes of 

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:42.450
 chopin the world slips of lucidity from 

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.570
 Critical retreat of a novelist vis-à-vis 

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.160
 from all of his own books 

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.110
 also holds a phenomenon that I have 

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.970
 noticed in my case and in that of 

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.590
 many others 

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.060
 every new book time to write it 

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.980
 clears the previous 

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.740
 to the point that I have the impression of 

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.180
 to have forgotten it I thought I had 

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.150
 written one after the other 

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.400
 discontinuous way ac or oblivion 

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:08.580
 successive but often the same 

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.500
 faces the same names the same places 

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.570
 the same sentences come from one to 

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.300
 the other as the reasons for a 

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:20.460
 tapestry that would have been woven into a 

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:25.170
 half a half sleep sleep or a half 

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:28.020
 waking dream a novelist is often a 

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:31.080
 sleepwalker time they have penetrated 

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:33.780
 because he has to write and one can 

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.900
 fear that he will be crushed when he 

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:40.320
 crosses a street but we forget this 

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:44.300
 extreme precision of sleepwalkers who 

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.300
 walking on the roofs have never fallen 

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:48.369
 in the statement that followed 

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:50.619
 the announced of this nobel prize 

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:52.269
 I retained the following sentence that was 

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:55.449
 an allusion to the last war 

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:58.660
 world he unveiled the world of 

00:12:55.449 --> 00:13:02.319
 the occupation I am like all those 

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:05.259
 and those born in 45 a child of war 

00:13:02.319 --> 00:13:05.769
 and more specifically since I was born to 

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:08.709
 Paris 

00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:12.369
 a child who owed what had to 

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:14.369
 birth in paris the occupation of 

00:13:12.369 --> 00:13:18.579
 people who lived in this paris there 

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:22.029
 wanted to quickly forget about it or not 

00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:23.949
 remember that daily detail of 

00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:26.859
 those who give the illusion that after 

00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:29.259
 the whole life of every day had not 

00:13:26.859 --> 00:13:33.189
 been so different from the one they 

00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:36.759
 normally led a bad dream 

00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:41.429
 is also a vague remorse for having been 

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:44.229
 somehow survivors and 

00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:47.019
 when their children questioned them 

00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:47.739
 more later on this period and on 

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:51.399
 this paris there 

00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:53.139
 their answer is elusive or else he 

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:54.339
 keep silent as if he wanted to 

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:57.369
 strike out of their existence 

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:59.309
 those dark years and hide us 

00:13:57.369 --> 00:14:02.049
 Something 

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:05.169
 but in front of the silences of our parents 

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:10.239
 we all guessed as if we 

00:14:05.169 --> 00:14:11.079
 had lived strange city that this paris 

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:13.899
 occupation 

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:14.309
 in appearance life go on as 

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:17.230
 before 

00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:19.389
 the theaters the cinemas the halls 

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.839
 paul music the restaurants were 

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:23.379
 open 

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:24.759
 we could hear songs on the radio 

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:27.579
 were even in theaters and 

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:30.519
 cinemas a lot more people than before 

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:32.709
 war as if the elite these places 

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:35.079
 were shelters where people get 

00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:38.230
 gather and squeeze each other 

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:41.319
 against others for reassurance but 

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.579
 unusual details indicated that paris 

00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:45.069
 was not anymore 

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:47.529
 the same as before because of 

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:48.420
 the absence of cars was a city 

00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:50.949
 silent 

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.299
 a silence where we heard the 

00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:55.420
 rustle of trees 

00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:57.129
 the clattering of horses' hooves 

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.089
 noise of the footsteps of the crowd on the 

00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:03.569
 boulevards and the hubbub of voices in 

00:15:01.089 --> 00:15:05.860
 the silence of the streets and the blackout which 

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:09.189
 fell in winter around five o'clock 

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.439
 evening and during which the slightest 

00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:14.999
 light at the windows were forbidden 

00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:18.639
 this city seemed absent to itself 

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:21.429
 the city without a look as they said 

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:22.989
 Nazi occupants the adults and the 

00:15:21.429 --> 00:15:25.720
 children could disappear from a 

00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:26.170
 moment to another without leaving any 

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.649
 trace 

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:32.829
 and even between friends we talked half 

00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:33.600
 words and conversations was never 

00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:36.279
 free 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:41.709
 because we felt a threat was hovering 

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:44.350
 in the air in this bad dreams bet 

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:46.989
 where one might be the victim of a 

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:50.980
 denunciation and a raf at the exit 

00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:53.049
 a metro station meetings 

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.629
 was between 

00:15:53.049 --> 00:15:59.470
 people who would never have 

00:15:55.629 --> 00:16:02.829
 crossed in peace time love 

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:05.829
 precarious was born in the shadow of the covers 

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:10.119
 fire without being sure of 

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:12.189
 find the next days it's at the 

00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:15.160
 following these meetings often without 

00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:17.619
 next day and sometimes its bad 

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:21.220
 dating than guys that kids 

00:16:17.619 --> 00:16:23.999
 are fighting etc that's why betting 

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:28.059
 of occupation has always been for me 

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:31.089
 like an original night without him I do not 

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:34.269
 would never have been born this bet there has not stopped 

00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:40.499
 haunt me and his light sees the donuts 

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:42.449
 sometimes my books here is also the proof 

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:45.119
 that a writer is marked in a way 

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:47.729
 indelible by his date of birth and 

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:49.649
 by his time even though he does not have 

00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:52.019
 participated in a direct way to 

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:54.799
 political action even if it gives 

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:58.089
 the impression of being a loner 

00:16:54.799 --> 00:17:02.750
 folded into what's called that all 

00:16:58.089 --> 00:17:05.420
 and if he writes poems they are at 

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:09.429
 the image of the time he lived and would not 

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.429
 could not be written at another time 

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:16.790
 so the yeats poem this big 

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.360
 Irish writer whose reading but 

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.199
 always deeply moved the swans 

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.550
 wild 

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:29.840
 cool ah in a park liszt is watching 

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:32.330
 signs that slips on the water the 19th 

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.340
 autumn has come down on me since 

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.580
 I counted them for the first time 

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:40.160
 I saw them before I could finish 

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:43.370
 account he was rising suddenly and 

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.900
 were laughing while swirling around 

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:49.400
 circle break on their tumultuous room 

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.890
 but now and slip on the waters 

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:56.000
 majestic tranquil and full of 

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:59.000
 beauty by mikel people will do 

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.500
 nor on the bank of what act she 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.720
 stretches out they have other heavens 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:10.340
 when I wake up ray and find a 

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:12.380
 day they flew the signs 

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.410
 often appear in the poetry of the 

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:18.200
 19th century in Baudelaire or scheme 

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:21.290
 the army but this yeats poem would have 

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:24.770
 could not be written in the 19th century by his 

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:27.230
 particular rhythm and its melancholy there the 

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:32.780
 part it belongs to the 20th century and 

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:35.630
 even the year it was written there 

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:38.240
 happens even if it happens also that a 

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:40.460
 21st century writer 

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.710
 shame at times prisoner of his 

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.590
 time and that reading the big ones 

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:48.010
 novelists of the 19th 

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:50.100
 safty can not stop 

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:53.110
 inspires a certain nostalgia 

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.460
 at that time time was running out 

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.410
 in a slower way 

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:59.810
 today and this slow 

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.690
 to the novelist's work because he could 

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.330
 better focus his energy and his 

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.370
 Warning 

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.450
 since time has accelerated ahead 

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.210
 by jerks 

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:14.360
 which explains the difference between 

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:16.820
 large Romanesque massifs from the past to 

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.890
 architectures of cathedrals and 

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.340
 works discontinue fragmented 

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.920
 of today in this perspective 

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.870
 I belong to a generation 

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.910
 intermediate I would be curious 

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:32.660
 know how the following generations 

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:36.650
 who are born with the internet the laptop 

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:40.400
 the males and all express by the 

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:44.270
 literature this world to which everyone is 

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.900
 permanently connected and where the networks 

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:50.120
 social partners are starting to share intimacy and 

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:54.500
 of secret that was still our good 

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:56.540
 until recently the secret that 

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.500
 gave depth to people 

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:02.960
 and could be a great romance m 

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.430
 but I want to remain optimistic about 

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.130
 the future of literature 

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:10.610
 I am convinced that the writers of the 

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:14.020
 future will ensure succession as 

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:18.650
 fact that every generation since homer 

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:21.380
 is by the way a writer like any 

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:24.710
 another artist may be related to his 

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:27.020
 time so narrowly that there 

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.790
 not escape and that the solar he 

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.580
 breathe this is called the era of 

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:35.120
 time he always expresses in his 

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:36.530
 works something timeless in 

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.390
 stagings of root pieces 

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.730
 or shakespeare 

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.530
 it does not matter if the characters are 

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.380
 dressed in antique lens or that 

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:48.350
 director wants to dress them up in 

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.020
 blue jeans a leather jacket these are 

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:54.080
 unimportant details 

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:57.230
 we forget by reading tolstoy that anna 

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.220
 karenin wears dresses from 1870 when 

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.620
 she is close to us 

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:04.110
 after a century and a half 

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:07.290
 and then some writers like edgar 

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:10.980
 melville poe or stendhal are better 

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:13.940
 understood in 200 years after their death that 

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:18.030
 by those who were their contemporaries 

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:21.120
 ultimately how much exactly 

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.430
 stands with a novelist in the march of the 

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.080
 life to describe it 

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:29.480
 because if you are immersed in it in 

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:33.080
 the action you have a confusing image 

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:36.960
 but this slight distance does not prevent 

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.390
 the identifying power that is the 

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.100
 his vis-à-vis his characters and 

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.890
 those who inspired them in 

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:47.250
 real life flaubert said madam 

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:48.870
 bovary it's me and tolstoi c-17 

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.390
 identify right away 

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.900
 the one who had seen him throw himself under 

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.340
 train 

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:58.580
 a night in a russia station and those 

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:01.830
 whose identification she is so far 

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:04.080
 that tolstoy was confused with the sky 

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.720
 and the landscape was describing and who 

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:10.200
 to absorb everything up to the lighter 

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.240
 anna karenin eyelash beat this 

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:15.330
 second state is the opposite of the 

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.150
 narcissism because it assumes both a 

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:21.330
 forgetfulness of oneself and a very strong 

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.970
 concentration in order to be receptive to 

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:26.630
 every detail 

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:29.460
 it also presupposes a certain loneliness 

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:33.210
 it is not a retreat on itself 

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:36.840
 but it achieves a degree 

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:39.960
 of attention and 10 pairs of cid 

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:43.370
 vis-à-vis the outside world for the 

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.370
 transpose into a novel 

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:49.260
 I always thought that the poet and the 

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:52.020
 novelist give mystery to beings 

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:57.150
 who seemed overwhelmed by life 

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:59.670
 daily to things in appearance 

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.940
 banal and that by dint of observing them 

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:06.060
 with sustained attention and so 

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:08.370
 almost hypnotic under their eyes 

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:11.730
 everyday life ends up wrapping 

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:14.190
 of mystery and by taking some kind of 

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.680
 phosphorescence that she did not have to 

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:19.110
 first sight but which were hidden in 

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.580
 depth 

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.490
 it's the role of the poet and the novelist 

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:27.390
 and the painter also to unveil this 

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:29.750
 mystery and 7 phosphorescence that 

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.400
 find at the bottom of each person 

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:35.910
 I think of my distant cousin 

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.740
 the painter amedeo modigliani whose 

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:42.140
 most moving paintings are those 

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:47.220
 where he chose as anonymous model 

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:50.310
 street children and girls 

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:54.000
 maids of small peasants of young people 

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:56.690
 apprentices painted them a very acute 

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.400
 reminiscent of the great Tuscan tradition 

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:02.940
 that of botticelli and painters 

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:06.450
 Sienese quattrocento he will have to give 

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:08.970
 well or rather he unveiled the whole 

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:12.630
 grace and the nobility that was in them 

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:14.870
 in their humble appearance the work 

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:18.420
 of the novelist must go in that direction 

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:22.980
 his imagination far from distorting the 

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:26.010
 douala reality penetrate deeply and 

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.690
 revealed this reality to itself with 

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.880
 the infrared power of the 

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:32.610
 ultraviolet light to detect what is 

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.890
 hide behind appearances and I do not 

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.500
 will not be far 

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:39.500
 in the best case the novelist 

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:42.350
 is a kind of seers and even of 

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:46.340
 visionary is also a seismograph 

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:49.630
 ready to record the movements the 

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.630
 more imperceptible 

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:55.740
 I always hesitated before reading the 

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:58.650
 biography of this or that writer 

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:01.110
 I admired the biographers his task 

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:04.470
 sometimes to small details to 

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:08.210
 not always accurate testimonials to 

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:12.240
 character traits that appear 

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:13.950
 disconcerting or disappointing and all of that 

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.220
 evokes me it is sizzling which 

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:19.200
 scramble some radio shows 

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:22.380
 and make inaudible the music or 

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.060
 the players only reading his 

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.700
 books takes us into intimacy 

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.890
 of a writer and this is where he is at 

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.320
 better of himself and that he speaks to us 

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:35.690
 in a low voice without his voice being 

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:40.320
 scrambled by the least parasites but 

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:43.980
 by reading the biography of a writer on 

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:46.740
 sometimes discovers a milestone 

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:49.920
 from his childhood that was like a 

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:52.860
 matrix of his future work and without 

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.190
 that he always had a clear 

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.190
 consciousness 

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:03.610
 this milestone event came back under 

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:06.100
 various forms haunt his books 

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:08.539
 today I think 

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:11.450
 alfred hitchcock who was not a 

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:14.990
 writer but whose films yet the 

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:16.270
 strength and cohesion of a work 

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.850
 fiction 

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.950
 when his son was 5 years old father 

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.530
 from hitchcock had instructed him to bring 

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:27.260
 a letter to a friend of hers as serves of 

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:29.240
 police the child had handed him the 

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:32.270
 letter and the commissioner had 

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.539
 enclosed in this mesh part of the 

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:38.299
 police station acting as a cell 

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:41.299
 and where we keep overnight 

00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:43.640
 most diverse offenders 

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:45.590
 the terrorized child had been waiting 

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:49.090
 for an hour before the 

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:54.740
 Commissioner does not issue it and tell him 

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:58.030
 if you behave badly in life, you know 

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.030
 now what is waiting for you 

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:02.630
 this police commissioner who had 

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.330
 really funny principles 

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:08.480
 of education is undoubtedly at the origin 

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:10.789
 a climate of suspense and anxiety 

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.059
 that we find in all films 

00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:16.789
 Alfred Hitchcock 

00:27:13.059 --> 00:27:19.100
 I would not bother you with my 

00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:21.529
 personal case is believed only certain 

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:25.309
 episodes of my childhood served as 

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:27.169
 matrix to my books later I get 

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:29.120
 found most of the time away from my 

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:32.270
 parents are friends to whom he 

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.340
 confided and I did not know anything and 

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:38.029
 in places and houses that 

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:40.340
 succeeded on the moment a child does not 

00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:42.200
 is surprised at anything and even if they 

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.679
 find in unusual situations 

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.360
 that's perfectly natural to him 

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:50.240
 much later than my childhood did 

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.220
 appeared enigmatic and that I tried to 

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.620
 know more about these different 

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.520
 people my parents 

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.100
 had entrusted 

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:03.529
 and if different places that changed 

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:06.740
 constantly but I have never managed to 

00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:09.429
 identify most of these people niasse 

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:12.279
 locate with topographic accuracy 

00:28:09.429 --> 00:28:15.610
 all these places and its houses of the past 

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:19.669
 this desire to solve riddles 

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:22.309
 106 really succeed and try to 

00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:24.860
 breaking a mystery gave me the envi 

00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:27.740
 describe as if writing and 

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:34.850
 the imaginary you help me solve 

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:36.679
 finally these riddles and its mysteries and 

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:40.820
 because it's about mystery 

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:43.010
 I think by an association of ideas at 

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.760
 title of a French novel of the nineteenth 

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:48.980
 century the mysteries of paris 

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.690
 the big city in this case paris ma 

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.409
 hometown 

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:54.080
 elie to my first impressions 

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:56.679
 of childhood and his impressions were so 

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.300
 strong that since I never stopped 

00:28:56.679 --> 00:29:02.380
 explore 

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:04.360
 the mysteries of Paris it was happening to me 

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.970
 9 or 10 years of walking alone and 

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.970
 despite the fear of losing myself going 

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:11.710
 further and further into neighborhoods 

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.750
 I did not know on the shore 

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.400
 right of the Seine 

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:18.370
 it was in daylight and that's me 

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.860
 reassured in early adolescence I 

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.390
 I was striving to overcome my fear and 

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:26.230
 to venture at night to neighborhoods 

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:28.240
 even more distant by the subway is 

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.970
 as well as one makes learning of 

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.530
 the city and in that I followed the example 

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.840
 of most novelists that 

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:38.140
 I admired and for whom since 

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.150
 19th century the big city that she gets 

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:43.180
 name paris-london saint petersburg 

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:47.800
 stockholm was the decor is one of 

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:50.560
 main themes of their edgar books 

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.410
 poe in his new gives crowds a 

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.450
 been one of the first to evoke all 

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.450
 his human waves watching him 

00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:01.990
 behind the windows of a cafe and who is 

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:04.840
 succeed interminably on the 

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:07.150
 sidewalks they spot an old man to 

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.880
 the strange appearance and he follows it for 

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:12.250
 at night in different neighborhoods of 

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:15.160
 london to know more about him 

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:18.340
 but the unknown is the man of the crowds 

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:22.120
 and it is vain to follow him because he 

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:24.280
 will always remain anonymous and that's it 

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.700
 and there we will never learn anything about him 

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.410
 he does not have an individual existence he 

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.080
 is simply part of this 

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:35.230
 mass of passers-by walking in rows 

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:40.050
 tight or jostling and 

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:42.670
 lose in the streets and I also think 

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:45.100
 an episode of the poet's youth 

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:47.830
 thomass of queen is that he scored 

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.460
 forever in london in the crowd 

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.169
 oxford swift 

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.409
 he had bonded with a girl 

00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:56.630
 one of those chance encounters that 

00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:58.820
 we do in a big city they 

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:01.460
 had spent several days in his 

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:04.460
 company and he had to leave London 

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:07.399
 for some time it was agreed 

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:10.070
 that after a week she 

00:31:07.399 --> 00:31:13.850
 would wait for him every night at the same 

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:16.929
 hour at the corner of ticheville tweets but 

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:19.640
 they never found themselves 

00:31:16.929 --> 00:31:22.130
 certainly we have been good 

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.350
 time looking for one another at the same 

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.539
 moment through labyrinth standards 

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:29.720
 from london may be we did 

00:31:26.539 --> 00:31:32.330
 were separated only by such that m he 

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:37.279
 do not need more to achieve 

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:40.399
 an eternal separation for those who 

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:42.919
 were born having lived as the 

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:47.659
 years spend each quarter each 

00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:49.909
 street of a city evokes a memory a 

00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:53.480
 meet a sorrow 

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:55.460
 a moment of happiness is often the same 

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.590
 street is bound for you to memories 

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.720
 successive 

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:02.330
 so that thanks to the topography of a 

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.860
 city ​​it's all your life that you 

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:06.320
 returns to memory by layers 

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:09.740
 successive as if you could 

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:13.490
 decipher the superimposed scripts of a 

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:15.399
 palimpsest and also the lives of others 

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.049
 of these thousands and thousands of strangers 

00:32:15.399 --> 00:32:22.539
 crossed in the streets or in the 

00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:22.539
 subway corridors at rush hour 

00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:29.679
 that's how in my youth for 

00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:32.809
 help me write I was trying to find 

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:36.799
 old betting directories especially those 

00:32:32.809 --> 00:32:39.679
 where denounces are listed by street with 

00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:42.470
 the building numbers I had 

00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:44.539
 page after page printing to have 

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:48.860
 under the eyes an X-ray of the 

00:32:44.539 --> 00:32:52.250
 city ​​but of a sunken city 

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:55.760
 like atlantis and breathe the smell 

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:59.000
 of time because of the years that had 

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.410
 elapsed the only traces that had 

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.540
 left his thousands these thousands 

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:05.809
 from strangers it was their name their address 

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:08.720
 and their phone number 

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:11.990
 sometimes a name disappears it's from a 

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:15.080
 year to year there was something 

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:21.049
 dizzying to flip through his old 

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:23.530
 directories thinking that now the 

00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:26.150
 phone numbers will not answer 

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:32.330
 later I had to be struck by the 

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:34.520
 verse of a poem does it mandelstam I 

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:38.809
 came back to my familiar city 

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:41.929
 until the sobs until the camp glion of 

00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:46.220
 childhood up to and received journals the 

00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:49.640
 petersburg skin of my phones you have 

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:52.370
 the numbers Petersburg I have the 

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:57.260
 addresses of olden days where I recognize the 

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:59.510
 dead to their voice yes it seems to me that 

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.640
 it is by consulting his old friends 

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.169
 mayor of paris that I wanted 

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.980
 to write my first books 

00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:07.910
 it was enough to point out a pencil the 

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.590
 name of a stranger 

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:14.800
 his address and his telephone number 

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:17.659
 and to imagine what had been his life 

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:23.300
 among these hundreds these hundreds of 

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:25.970
 thousands of words one can get lost or 

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.700
 disappear in a big city on 

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:30.040
 can even change identity and live 

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.510
 a new life 

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.000
 we can indulge in a very long 

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:38.750
 investigation to find traces of 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:43.220
 someone starting out with one or 

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:45.139
 two addresses in a lost neighborhood the 

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.770
 brief indications that appear some 

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:52.700
 times on the research sheets has 

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:55.159
 always found an echo at home last 

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:57.960
 known home 

00:34:55.159 --> 00:35:00.809
 the themes of the disappearance of 

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:03.930
 the identity of the time that passes are 

00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:06.569
 closely related to the topography of 

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.799
 big cities that's why since the 

00:35:06.569 --> 00:35:09.720
 19th century 

00:35:07.799 --> 00:35:12.000
 they have often been the domain of 

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.710
 novelists and some of the most 

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.299
 great of them we associate are 

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:19.799
 associated with a city balzac and paris 

00:35:17.299 --> 00:35:23.750
 dickens and london of this gas what is 

00:35:19.799 --> 00:35:28.670
 saint Petersburg tokyo and nagai caf or 

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:28.670
 stockholm hjalmar soderbergh 

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:33.930
 I belong to a generation that has suffered 

00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:35.760
 the influences of these novelists and who 

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:39.599
 wanted to explore what 

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:43.940
 baudelaire is the most sinuous of 

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:46.200
 great capitals of course for 50 years 

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.140
 that is to say the time when teenagers 

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.700
 of my age experience very sensations 

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:54.299
 strong discovering their city 

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:56.700
 these have changed some in 

00:35:54.299 --> 00:35:59.819
 america and in what was called the 

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:02.849
 third world became megacities 

00:35:59.819 --> 00:36:05.730
 with disturbing dimensions their 

00:36:02.849 --> 00:36:08.220
 inhabitants are partitioned in 

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:11.339
 neighborhoods often abandoned and in a 

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:13.109
 social war climate slums 

00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:17.010
 are more and more numerous and more 

00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:18.930
 in addition to sprawling until the twentieth 

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:21.109
 century and novelist kept a vision 

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:25.530
 somehow romantic of the city 

00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:27.839
 not so different from that of dickens or 

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:30.839
 of baudelaire and that's why 

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:33.049
 I would like to know how novelists 

00:36:30.839 --> 00:36:35.970
 of the future will evoke these gigantic 

00:36:33.049 --> 00:36:38.510
 urban concentration in works 

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.510
 of fiction 

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:45.410
 you have the indulgence to refer 

00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:47.359
 about my books at the art of 

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.680
 memory with which its to evoke the 

00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:50.170
 most human destinies 

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.440
 elusive 

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:56.119
 but this compliment exceeds my person 

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.210
 this particular memory that are trying 

00:36:56.119 --> 00:37:01.160
 to collect some bits of the past 

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:04.010
 and the few traces left on 

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.200
 land of anonymous and unknown and 

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:11.660
 it also related to my date of birth 

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:13.630
 in 1945 to be born in 45 after cities 

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:16.940
 were destroyed and populations 

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:19.369
 whole had disappeared no doubt 

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:22.190
 like those of my age made more 

00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:24.339
 sensitive to the theme of memory and 

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.339
 forgetfulness 

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:30.079
 it seems to me unfortunately that the 

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:33.710
 search for lost time can no longer be 

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:36.920
 do with the strength and frankness of 

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:40.220
 marcel proust the company he was describing 

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:43.010
 was still stable a 19th century society 

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.930
 century the memory of proust actually 

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:47.890
 resurrect the past in its least 

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:50.480
 details as a living tableau 

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.890
 I have the impression that today 

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.289
 memory is much less safe 

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:58.299
 of itself and it must struggle without 

00:37:54.289 --> 00:38:01.760
 stops against amnesia and forgetting 

00:37:58.299 --> 00:38:05.630
 the cause of this touch of this mass 

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:09.170
 forgetfulness that covers everything we fail 

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:12.020
 to capture only fragments of the past and 

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:13.640
 interrupted traces of destinies 

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:18.589
 human fleeing and almost 

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:20.569
 elusive but it's probably the 

00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:23.779
 vocation of the novelist in front of this 

00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:26.770
 big blank page of oblivion makes you 

00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:30.500
 resurrect a few words half cleared 

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:33.430
 as these lost haysbert left shores to 

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.430
 the surface of the ocean
