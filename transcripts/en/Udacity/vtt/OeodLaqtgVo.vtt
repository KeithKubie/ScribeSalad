00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So even though Eratosthenes and Archimedes were both spending

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a lot of time thinking about the earth and,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in fact, the earth's circumference, Erathothenes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
seemed to have an advantage.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So because he was so well-traveled,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Erathosthenes knew that, here in Syene,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the sun's rays struck vertically on the Summer Solstice,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which happens on about June 21st or the 22nd.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
He knew this because these rays of the sun

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
actually made it all the way to the bottom of the well,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which wouldn't happen if they were coming in at some other angle.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He also knew that in a city a little bit north of Syene

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
called Alexandria, the sun's rays

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
did not strike exactly vertically.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He knew this because he could hold a metal bar

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or any other straight object vertically

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so that it pointed directly into the ground at Alexandria.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And if the sun were overhead, this shouldn't cast any shadow,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but it did.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It turned out this actually made

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a small shadow.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Okay.  So now we're getting somewhere.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It looks like to solve this problem,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we're going to need to really explore the geometry involved,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and since we use geometry all the time in physics,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
now's a good time to learn or if you already know,

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
review some of the basics, so let's back up a bit.
