00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.920
Anyone who lives in a major city knows that
traffic is one of those niggling, persistent

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
annoyances.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.910
And a new study has identified a potential
cause: you’re not keeping the right distance

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.620
from the car behind you.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.000
Which sounds like it can’t be your problem
since you can’t control the guy that’s

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.200
staying uncomfortably close to your bumper.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200
True.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.040
But mathematical models show that if every
car on the road kept the same distance between

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.880
the car in front of AND behind it, traffic
would move seamlessly and potentially even

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.470
twice as fast!

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.670
But of course it’s not that simple.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.320
Traffic is a great example of EMERGENT PROPERTY,
a philosophical term used to describe the

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.540
phenomenon of many small things compiling
to create something bigger.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.170
With traffic, it’s the many individuals
cars together forming a complex traffic mess.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.460
That’s because humans bring a lot of variables
to the mix.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.719
A driver is usually — and rightly — most
focussed on the car she’s following, but

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.590
if she brakes hard the car behind her will
have to brake a little harder.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.620
If she gets close to another car the density
in that one area will cause a slowdown.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.360
Mathematical models have shown that, basically,
at a certain density there are enough variables

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.040
brought by human reaction time and individual
driving habits to cause a traffic jam.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.600
We have a little on that right here.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.659
Interestingly, this is a human problem.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.960
Ants don’t experience traffic jams; they
move as quickly in small groups as they do

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.220
en masse.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.220
Bats are the same.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.580
They fly in large groups, each one tracking
the bats around him with echolocation.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.780
They play follow the leader, even if that
leader is in the back of a pack, in an impressive

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.810
display of group coordination.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.810
But we’re not a colony, we’re individuals!

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.740
Yeah, except that self-driving cars could
bring this colony-like behaviour to humans.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.399
A simple solution the new research offers
is sensors to improve bilateral control in

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.399
cars.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.950
Current adaptive cruise controls monitors
the car ahead of you…

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.060
providing it’s not miles down the freeway.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.560
A similar rear-facing sensor would be an easy
change to that same system.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.740
Looking back is really no harder than looking
forward, and we wouldn’t even need to change

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.750
the roads.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.560
The result would be well worth it.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.320
Not only could we reduce the stress of rush
hour driving, minimizing start-stop traffic

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.869
would cut CO2 emissions and help you save
fuel… and also make driving safer.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.010
It could really be a win-win-win all around.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.610

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.040
And speaking of weird traffic patterns, is
anything truly random?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.650
Jules dove into that one right here.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.220
Fun driving fact: driving while blindfolded
is, weirdly, explicitly illegal in the state

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.790
of Alabama…
