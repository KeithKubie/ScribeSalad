Vsauce. Are you still paying money for
things you have to wait to do in real

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.830
life?

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.230
Well, no worries, because I've got more free
stuff you can do online now, guys.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.920
DONG. Lots of great suggestions from
WeSaucers today. First

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.630
from 'fippoolive', Google search.
Why be all floaty

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.199
when can use Google gravity? As soon as your mouse touches it, it collapses, but

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.240
remains usable. Is it too slow for you?
Well, try to kill yourself with caffeine.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.599
This site suggested by 'illustr8r777'
lets you pick your favorite drink,

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.800
enter your weight and find out how many
energy drinks you'd have to drink

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.570
to die.
Before you do, use the energy to multitask.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.930
This game comes from 'matti1310199'

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.190
and 'OVER9000ACCOUNTS'. As you play, more and more things come up that you have

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.860
to do.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.250
Here I am using the left and right arrows to balance a ball,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.910
up and down to avoid triangles and shift to jump.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.800
Too much stress, too many buttons to push? Well, 'hall0fgamez'

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.930
asks us why not just hit your head
against a wall?

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.360
Press left then right over and over
again. The more times you hit your head,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.360
the more freaked out and trippy the game becomes. Too simple?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.840
Well, 'Sicvicious' thinks big - World's Biggest

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.430
Pac-Man. On this site you can choose
which board to play.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.009
Everything's normal, except when you escape out the side you shift

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.960
to the next board. Once that game makes
you sick of Pac-Man, do the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.500
opposite like 'ARealCoolUsername' - Anti Pac-Man.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.220
Here, you play as a ghost and try to get Pac-Man. Of course,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.189
when he turns you blue you've gotta run.
Now, I've been a fan of this site for a long

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.250
time. Girl Talk

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.180
makes great mashups and this site
visually lays out in real time

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.940
where every sample is coming from.
Take a look.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.100
Well, make your own music on this site,
suggested by lots of WeSaucers.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.810
Click a box and it will rhythmically generate a tone. Draw whatever you want.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.430
For instance, this is the sound of Vsauce.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.860
Or get symphonic with 'Killerzac's'
recommendation. You have to manipulate

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:08.750
arrows to direct

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.950
energy into boxes to hear new instruments.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.080
Or be darker with Webby nominee 'Ana Somnia'.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.170
This site uses your web cam to detect
brightness and you actually have to turn

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.150
out the lights or find a dark place

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.970
in order for her to dream. Now every
dream she has is unique

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.430
and completely crazy, but as soon as you
turn the lights back on or even

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.459
check your phone, she'll know and wake up

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.830
and end the dream.
Even more crazy is psycho paint.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.790
This site is also up for a Webby and
it let's you mimick the brushstrokes of great

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.480
painters

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.690
on your own pictures. Here's Lauren and I.
Let me just jazz it up a little over here

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.330
and there.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.750
Beautiful.
I leave you with something new.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.090
Vsauce Leanback. It's a playlist I hope to make

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.599
every week that contains videos from other
creators that I think are really cool.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.230
The playlist lasts as long as an actual
television episode, so it's like

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.610
Vsauce, but grown-up. So if you ever wanna lean back and relax and let the videos

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.580
change themselves and have Vsauce be your tour guide,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.590
check it out. There's a link in the description
and let me know what you think, because

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.760
I'm very interested to know.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.080
And hey, as always,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.500
thanks for watching.
