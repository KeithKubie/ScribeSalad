00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.170
ANTONIO PADILLA: Imagine you
had a universe which was a

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.520
googolplex meters across,
OK, so a big universe.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.230
Then, that's very big.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.990
And if you actually traveled far
enough in that universe,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.050
you would start to
see repetitions.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.030
You would start to see exact
copies of yourself.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.770
RIA SYMONDS: Today, we've
got a googol.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.530
ANTONIO PADILLA: A Google.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.340
RIA SYMONDS: A googol.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.400
ANTONIO PADILLA: As
in the website.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.350
RIA SYMONDS: Kind of,
not spelt the same.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:38.300
It's spelt G-O-O-G-O-L, 10
to the power of 100.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.750
So imagine that's a 1 with
100 0's after it.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.070
ANTONIO PADILLA: And it came
about because it was--

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.750
a guy called Kasner, who
was a mathematician.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.450
He was also very famous
in cosmology.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.690
RIA SYMONDS: And it wasn't him
that came up with the name.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.550
He just thought of a
really big number.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.880
He thought, what's a big
number, 1 with 100 0's.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.450
ANTONIO PADILLA: And he wanted
to sort of explain infinity.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.790
And he wanted to come up with
a very big number--

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.420
that wasn't really big at all
compared to infinity.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.630
RIA SYMONDS: And he actually
asked his nephew, his

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.390
nine-year-old nephew, what's a
good name to call this number?

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.430
ANTONIO PADILLA: His nephew
came up with the word

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.270
"googol." But it's quite
a big number.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.800
I don't think it's that
big a number.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.780
But it's quite a big number.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.970
I mean to put it into
perspective, you might ask

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.500
yourself well, OK, how many
grains of sand could you fit

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.180
inside this room?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.540
You think that's a lot, right?

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.290
That's going to be a lot
of grains of sand.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.600
It's only about 50 billion,
not that much.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.562
So you might ask well, let's
have something more dramatic.

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:42.110
Well, how many particles are
there in the universe?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.820
Now, that's 10 to the 80, a
1 with 80 0's after it.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.620
That's how many particles there
are in the universe.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.390
So a googol is bigger
than that.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.020
And you could ask yourself OK,
well how many grains of sand

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.450
could I fit in the universe?

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870
Say the universe was full of
just grains of sand, how many

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.860
grains of sand can I fit
in the universe?

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.450
And that would be about 10
to the 90, so a 1 with

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.920
90 0's after it.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.080
It's quite a big number.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.930
But it's not that big.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.280
There's certainly stuff that's
a lot bigger that that.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.020
BRADY HARAN: You're saying it's
not big a number, and yet

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.685
all these things that we think
of as big, like the size of

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:14.270
the universe, and atoms in the
universe, and particles,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.960
aren't even touching it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.585
So it must be big.

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:18.580
ANTONIO PADILLA: Well yeah,
OK, but I can think of

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.120
something that is bigger than
it, that you can think of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.060
physically.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.320
So if you take the smallest
volume in the universe, which

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.580
is a Planck volume, so it's
basically a little cube that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.630
its radius is a Planck length,
which is 10 to the minus 35

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.910
meters, and you see how many
of them you can fit in the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.960
observable universe.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.960
And you get about 10 to the 183,
so that's a 1 with 183

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.740
0's after it.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.260
So that is bigger
than a googol.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.400
So googols aren't
that impressive.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.140
We can think of things
that are bigger.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.620
RIA SYMONDS: He then thought,
well what's a bigger number

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.855
than a googol?

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:03.610
And for that he took 10 and
raised it to this power, the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.780
power of a googol,
10 to the 100.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.930
So this is taking 10 and
timesing it by 10 and 10 and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.900
10 and 10 and 10, and timesing
it googol amount of times.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.780
And this number is called
a googolplex.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.030
ANTONIO PADILLA: We start
writing down a googolplex.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.800
And let's suppose-- well, we're
writing on a piece of

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.280
paper here.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.380
But let's suppose we
actually tried to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.380
write it down on particles.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.320
So for each particle, we're
going to write down a 0.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.560
So first particle, we write down
a 0, second particle we

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.660
write down a 0.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.580
And we carry on doing
that on every

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.095
particle in the universe.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:43.780
And we still would not be able
to write down a googolplex.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.660
It's too big a number.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.160
And there's something else
remarkable about the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.140
googolplex.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.640
And I find this astonishing.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.390
This should emphasize how
big a googolplex is.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.030
Imagine you had a universe which
was a googolplex meters

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.290
across, OK, a big universe.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.430
And some models of eternal
inflation and things like

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.830
that, you do get universes which
could be as big as this.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.320
So we have a universe which is
a googolplex meters across.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.029
Then, that's very big.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.800
And if you actually traveled far
enough in that universe,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.850
you would start to
see repetitions.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.200
You would start to see exact
copies of yourself.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.300
Now, you might think,
what the hell am I

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.700
talking about here, Brady?

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.100
But let's take you, Brady.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.380
Let's ask how many quantum
states can describe the volume

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.960
that you occupy, OK?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.500
The number of quantum states
that can occupy that volume,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.650
the total number is, and
you can work this out.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.970
It's something to do with
entropy and black holes and

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.040
stuff like that.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.550
But you can work it out.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.020
And it is 10 to the
10 to the 70.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.680
That's the number of different
quantum states, different ways

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.690
that you could actually put
together that volume of space.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.040
So that number is less
than a googolplex.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.540
BRADY HARAN: So the space I'm
in could be me, it could be

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.040
you, it could be a dog,
it could be a vacuum.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.330
ANTONIO PADILLA: Yes.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.400
BRADY HARAN: It could
be anything.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.430
ANTONIO PADILLA: All those
particles are arranged in any

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.750
number of different ways.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.410
Particles might not
even be there.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.150
But all those possible states,
given that volume that you

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.150
occupy, the number of possible
states you could have is 10 to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.025
the 10 to the 70.

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.730
A big number, but not as
big as a googolplex.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:35.470
But 10 to the googol is equal
to 10 to the 10 to the 100.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.310
So this number is clearly
less than this number.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.880
So you occupy roughly about
a meter cubed of space.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.430
There's that many different
possible states that

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.600
you could be in.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.650
So if you go this many meters
away from yourself, you would

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.000
start to expect to
see repetitions.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.020
So that means if you're in a
universe which is so big, as

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.880
big as a googolplex meters
across, that eventually you

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.720
would start to see repetitions
of those

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.450
volumes of 1 meter cubed.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.700
BRADY HARAN: So just by chance,
I would run into

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.185
another arrangement of atoms
that matches me.

00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:12.570
ANTONIO PADILLA: Exactly.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.380
Exactly.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.235
Exactly.

00:06:14.235 --> 00:06:15.410
It matches you exactly.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.830
And then you'd go even bigger,
and you would start to see

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.610
sort of the entire observable
universe is repeated.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.820
So this is truly remarkable.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.850
I think the fact that you would
go there and see your

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.620
doppelganger if you went far
enough away in a googolplexing

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.580
universe, I think it just sort
of emphasizes how big that

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.610
number really is.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.210
The size of the universe is 10
to the 26 meters sort of all

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.840
cubed, that's the size
of the universe.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.760
So this number is tiny
compared to that.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.140
BRADY HARAN: So there's probably
not another me in

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.830
this universe.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.670
ANTONIO PADILLA: Probably not.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.390
But if we live in a universe
which is a googolplex across,

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.830
then there probably is.
