00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.365
MANO MARKS: Hi, I'm Mano
Marks, Developer Advocate

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:13.360
on the Google Maps API team.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.900
This is the second
video in a series

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.850
of four designed to show you how
to get started with the Google

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460
Maps JavaScript API.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.950
In the first episode
of the series,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.450
we covered creating and
customizing your first map.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.580
In this episode, we'll
cover creating an API key.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.060
Using an API key enables you to
monitor your application's Maps

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.310
API usage and ensure that
Google can contact you

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.890
about your application,
if necessary.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.100
If your application's Maps API
usage exceeds the usage limits,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.040
in a very rare
condition, you must

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.160
load the Maps API using
an API key in order

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.590
to purchase additional quota.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.740
To get an API key, visit the
Google API console at this URL.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.290
If necessary, log into
your Google account.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.470
A quick note about
which account to use.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.010
If you're planning to use the
map for your own personal use

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.670
and it'll always
be in your control,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.780
you can go ahead and
use your own account.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.490
However, if you're
planning to use it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.240
for an organization
you work for,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.630
consider using a
shared Google account

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.100
that other people can access.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.670
That way, if you're no longer
working on the Maps project

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.720
or you aren't available
for some reason,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.670
others can access the account
and receive any notifications

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.450
that might be necessary.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.670
You can also accomplish
this by sharing the project

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.410
with others.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.070
But the ownership of the account
and ownership of the project

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.389
should probably
stay with the map.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.930
That's doubly true
if you're creating

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.896
the map for a customer.

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:43.900
To create a key, either
select an existing project

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.920
or create a new one.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.750
To create a new project,
select the project list

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.140
and click on Create Project.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.870
After you load or
create a project,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.980
click on the Services tab.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.160
Then scroll down to
Google Maps API v3

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.850
and click the button
to turn it on.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.260
Finally, click on
the API Access tab.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.450
Then click on the
Create New Browser key.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.880
You should see this
box asking for domains.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.050
Put the domains that you'll be
using for this Maps API key.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.010
This will prevent others
from using the API

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.260
key on their sites.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.250
OK, that's all there is to it.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910
In the next video, we'll
cover using the API key

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.890
when you load the JavaScript
API and the basic parameters

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.460
of the JavaScript loader.
