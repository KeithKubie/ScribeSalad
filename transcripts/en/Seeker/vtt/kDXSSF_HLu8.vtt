00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.490
What’s the best way to burn fat while you
sleep?

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.320
Easy - just crank the A/C up!

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.950
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and you know
what sucks?

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.950
Exercise.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.300
So what if there was a way we could burn fat
in our sleep?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.960
Well according to a new study published in
the journal Diabetes, there is - and all you

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.199
have to do is turn your thermostat down!

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.259
A team of researchers from Virginia Commonwealth
University conducted a study recently on how

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.189
different temperatures affect our metabolism
when we’re sleeping.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.160
And they found that prolonged exposure to
mildly cold temperatures, is optimal in helping

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.989
expand the amount of brown fat in our bodies.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.329
Now that might seem counterintuitive, but
remember that brown fat, unlike white fat,

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.020
is actually good for you.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.510
White fat is basically large droplets of fat
that your body uses to store energy.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.530
Brown fat consists of much tinier droplets
- that are packed with mitochondria, which

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.510
contain iron and give the fat its brown color.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.789
But unlike white fat, which stores calories,
brown fat actually burns calories.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.309
That’s why infants, and animals that hibernate,
have much more of it than regular adults.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.470
It allows their bodies to generate enough
heat to keep them warm.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.009
It used to be thought that brown fat disappears
by adulthood - but now, scientists are realizing

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.330
that many of us do contain trace amounts - maybe
2 to 3 ounces, for every 20 pounds of white

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.590
fat - but adults who have more of it, tend
to be leaner.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.899
It makes sense, then, that we’d want more
brown fat - to burn off our excess stores

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:26.899
of white fat.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.030
Which is exactly what sleeping in the cold
does.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.189
For this study, researchers recruited 5 male
volunteers - and had them spend 4 consecutive

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.850
months sleeping in a temperature-controlled
room.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.860
For the first month, they kept the thermostat
at 75 degrees F, followed by 66, 75, and 81

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.909
degrees, for the second, third, and fourth
months, respectively.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.170
And they found that when subjects slept in
the 66 degree room - their bodies produced

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.680
double the amount of brown fat, compared to
the other 3 months.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.149
They also displayed better insulin sensitivity,
and better regulation and disposal of glucose

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.530
- both of which are known to reduce the risk
of diabetes.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.979
Of course this study was performed on HEALTHY
volunteers, so it’s unclear how these conditions

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.800
might fare for someone who’s obese, but
if anything - it’s an important proof of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800
concept.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.430
And it shows just how important of a role
brown fat plays - in reducing our risk for

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.430
diabetes.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.430
What do you guys think?

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.490
What’s your ideal sleeping temperature?

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.800
Personally, I prefer a cool 67.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.480
But, I also sleep next to a 200-lb heat rock.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.440
So, I need that extra cold.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.100
