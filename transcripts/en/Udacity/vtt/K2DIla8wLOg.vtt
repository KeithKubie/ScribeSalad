00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.524
In this unit, we'll explore radicals and rational exponents. It's likely that

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:08.330
you've seen radicals before, but before we get into all these symbols and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.477
different definitions, let's just look at some squares. We can think of a

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:17.504
square root as the side length of one of these squares. This square has an area

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:23.615
of 4, this square has an area of 25, And this square has an area of 81. Knowing

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:26.970
each of these areas, what do you think would be the square root, or the side

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.780
length of each of these squares? Write the side length for each of these sides

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.533
here and the same for the other squares.
