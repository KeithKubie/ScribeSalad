00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:01.475
- [Instructor] We're told that a car

00:00:01.475 --> 00:00:05.642
with wheel radius r moves
at a linear velocity, v,

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:09.450
and this is a bolded v, to
show that it's a vector.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.942
Suddenly, the car
accelerates to velocity 2v.

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:16.867
How does the angular velocity
of the wheels change?

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:18.050
So pause this video

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.408
and see if you can figure
this out on your own.

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:23.800
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.658
So just to visualize what's going on,

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:29.808
let's just draw at least the
front wheel of a car here,

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:33.141
so let me draw the wheel first actually.

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:37.108
So this is the front wheel of the car

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:41.300
and I'll draw the part of the car.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.866
So this is our car right over there.

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:48.050
It might look something like that.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.950
We got the windshield right over there,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.450
so you can visualize this car.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.683
So our car looks something like,

00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:57.725
we got our headlights and all the rest.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.958
All right, enough of drawing the car.

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.825
So let's imagine this car right over here

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:05.908
has a velocity v, let's
say it's going forward,

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:07.226
so let me draw that.

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:10.208
So its velocity, I'll just
draw it right over here,

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:11.041
it is v.

00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:15.650
So this is a velocity of v.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.500
And since it's hard to
hand draw something bolded,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.975
I put a little arrow on it,

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:22.192
but this is equivalent
to this bolded vector v

00:01:22.192 --> 00:01:23.925
that you might see
sometimes in your textbook.

00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:24.883
Bold would be a vector

00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:27.541
or you put an arrow on
it to show it's a vector.

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.350
Now I wanna make notation clear.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.950
If we talk about the
magnitude of this vector

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.700
and the magnitude of
velocity is just speed,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.186
I'm gonna denote that as
just v without an arrow on it

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:42.817
and not bolded, so this is
going to be the same thing

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:45.419
as the magnitude of our velocity vector,

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.917
which is the same thing as our speed.

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:53.325
Now let's take a point on
the outer end of our wheel,

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:54.808
any point on the outer end of the wheel.

00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:56.983
Let's say we take this
point right over here

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.950
and the center of our
wheel is right over here.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.692
So if the car is moving forward

00:02:01.692 --> 00:02:03.867
to the right with velocity v,

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:07.189
what's the velocity of
this point right over here?

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.850
Well, the velocity of this point,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.700
it is going to have the same magnitude

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.300
but in the opposite direction,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.383
so it's gonna look something like that.

00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:16.900
I don't know if those
lines are exactly equal

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.075
but these are supposed to
have the same magnitude.

00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:20.942
And so you can even imagine this would be,

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:24.550
you could say that this would
be negative v, just like that.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.391
But for the purposes of this question,

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:30.342
I wanna think about its speed.

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:32.208
So the speed here,

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:35.791
the speed here is just
going to be v again.

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:37.933
So the speed of this point,

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:40.083
which is gonna be the same
as the speed of this point,

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.608
the direction here is different,

00:02:41.608 --> 00:02:43.958
but all of these points along the rim

00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.983
or along the outside of
the tire, I should say,

00:02:45.983 --> 00:02:50.000
are all gonna have the
same speed, speed v.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.392
And we already have a
relationship that we've explored

00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:57.375
in previous videos between
speed and angular velocity.

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.700
We have seen that the speed,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.142
I'll do it in a new color here.

00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:05.342
I'll say v for speed with
no arrow, not bolded,

00:03:05.342 --> 00:03:06.792
is going to be equal

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:10.942
to the magnitude of our angular velocity,

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:15.033
so the magnitude of our angular velocity

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:16.450
times our radius.

00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:20.325
Times our radius.

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:22.734
Or another way of saying this,

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:26.067
we could say that our speed is equal to,

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:27.900
instead of writing it like this,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.350
let me just write just an
omega without an arrow over it

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.717
to say this is the magnitude
of our angular velocity.

00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:36.800
So that times our radius.

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:40.041
So here I'm dealing with
all scalar quantities.

00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:41.307
I'm saying speed is equal

00:03:41.307 --> 00:03:44.033
to magnitude of my angular velocity

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.366
times my radius.

00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:51.167
So if I wanted angular velocity
as a function of speed,

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:53.592
I could just divide both sides by r.

00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:56.167
And so I could say angular velocity

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.834
is going to be equal to my speed

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.083
over r.

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:05.175
So let's think about what
happens, and let me be clear,

00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:07.983
this right over, this distance
right over here, that is r.

00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:10.467
That is r right over there.

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:13.358
So if our velocity goes to 2v,

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.342
so if this goes from v to,

00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:17.858
I'm gonna use a different color,

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.025
if that goes from v to 2v,

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:26.959
then this is gonna go from
negative v to negative 2v.

00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:31.025
And our speed is gonna go from v

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:33.692
to just 2v, the twice the speed.

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:37.817
And if you have twice the speed,

00:04:37.817 --> 00:04:40.275
if this goes by two,

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:43.400
well, then the angular velocity

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.775
is going to increase by a factor of two.

00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:48.633
So this is going to
increase by a factor of two,

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:50.558
not squaring this or something else.

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:52.900
You're just multiplying
this by one over r.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.775
You're just dividing it by r.

00:04:54.775 --> 00:04:58.250
And r is not changing,
just the speed is changing.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.175
And since omega is equal to v over r,

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:03.200
if you double v, you're
gonna double omega.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.342
So how does the angular
velocity of the wheels change?

00:05:06.342 --> 00:05:08.025
Well, it's going to double.

00:05:08.025 --> 00:05:09.275
It will double.

00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:14.600
And we are done.
