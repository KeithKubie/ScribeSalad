PETER LUBBERS: Hi everyone!

00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:04.010
Peter Lubbers here, organizer
for the San Francisco HTML5

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.000
user group.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.980
Everybody knows that
performance matters

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.130
when you're building
your app, so last year we

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.250
held a #perfmatters event at
the Google San Francisco office.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.070
It was a smashing success
with over 300 attendees live

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.170
and 57,000 views on
the video since then.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.220
Now, the best part was that it
was held on International Talk

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.970
Like A Pirate Day.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.966
PIRATE: Arr matey!

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.310
Which means that we be
doing it again this year.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.550
So secure your cargo and get
ready to sail, 'cause it's time

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.050
to perf like a pirate!

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.950
