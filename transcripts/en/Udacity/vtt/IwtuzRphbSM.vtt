00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, we can solve for the acceleration of block 1.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, the acceleration is going to be caused by how much bigger this force is in this force or FT - m₁g

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that's going to equal m₁  a₁.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, the problem is we can't just go and solve this for a₁, not yet anyways.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This equation has two unknowns, the a₁ and the tension.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
One equation will never be able to solve for two unknowns.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Maybe we can get more information by analyzing the second block. Well, let's do the diagram.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And before we go any further,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to move this equation over here to emphasize that the blank is at block 1.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, previously we showed the FT is bigger than m₁g since it's accelerating that way.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Well, m₂ we know must be accelerating this way, so m₂g must be bigger than FT

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I've crossover an important point here--is this FT here the same as this FT here?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the answer is yes, it is.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
A rope always maintains the same tension throughout.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Maybe you prove it to yourself by trying to think about what would happen

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
if somehow the rope's tension change.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What would happen at the boundary point where the tension change?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That's something you should talk about in the forums.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Well, now the force doing the acceleration is how much bigger m₂g is over FT

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and we can write a very similar equation m₂g - FT = m₂a₂, net force = mass  acceleration,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and once again we have two unknowns, a₂ and FT, well that consist a total of three unknowns,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
FT, a₁, and a₂.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Two equations can never solve three unknowns, but hey, I realized something,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
these blocks are connected by a string.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Any motion downwards from this guy has to correspond to motion upwards from this guy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That means this acceleration has to be identical to this one.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We've done a little strange here what we called acceleration on this side,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
positive when it's up, and on this side, positive when it's down,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but that's okay, we can do that.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So, now instead of the a₁ and a₂, I can just write a.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We're almost there--we're almost at something very cool

00:01:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because now we only have two unknowns and two equations can solve two unknowns.
