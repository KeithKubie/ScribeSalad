00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The really important property of heaps is at the smallest value of all has to be at the top.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Why is that? Because a node can't be below anything larger than that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The only place that the smallest number can be is at the tippe top.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There may be copies of this number so you might find them at other places.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In fact, the whole tree can consist of 13s, but the smallest one is still at the top.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It may also be other places. The second smallest value can be, maybe immediately below it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What's the deepest level where you can find the third smallest?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Level I will be here, level 2 is here, level 3, level 4, level 5, and so on.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In this particular example, the third smallest, here's the smallest,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
here's the second smallest, and here's the third smallest.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Well, it seem like a natural place for it but can it be any deeper? Write your answer in the box.
