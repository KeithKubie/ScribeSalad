because sometimes the random comments

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320
because sometimes the random comments
 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.259
because sometimes the random comments
drown out the substantive ones but for

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269
drown out the substantive ones but for
 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.819
drown out the substantive ones but for
the most part I think the comments are

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829
the most part I think the comments are
 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.619
the most part I think the comments are
actually quite helpful and I think that

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629
actually quite helpful and I think that
 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.780
actually quite helpful and I think that
we get a much higher proportion or

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790

number of comments compared to our other

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890
number of comments compared to our other
 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.800
number of comments compared to our other
main competitors and I think that is an

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810
main competitors and I think that is an
 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.510
main competitors and I think that is an
advantage for us it can also be a

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520
advantage for us it can also be a
 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.969
advantage for us it can also be a
