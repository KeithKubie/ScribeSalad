&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: I
think the number one thing

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:11.396
that has been most effective
here has been really focusing

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:14.816
on relationships, knowing the story
of each member of my community

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.536
and that has been one of the
most impactful parts of the work

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:22.286
and also enabled me to
do large chunks of change

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.066
with a receptive group
of people behind me,

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.766
because we already had kind of a
foundational relationship happening,

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:30.966
and then, secondly, really seeing
the children are this wonderful,

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:37.016
messy mush of needs that range from
academic to emotional to physical,

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:39.706
and so how do we meet
all those on our campus?

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:54.006
&gt;&gt;We have three key things
that support student outcomes.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.196
Dialogue Circles are a great way
for students and teachers to get

00:00:57.196 --> 00:00:59.086
to know each other and
learn how to communicate

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:00.746
about hard things in a safe place.

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:03.076
It's an essential practice
of Restorative Justice

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:04.696
and a great place to get started.

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:06.486
&gt;&gt;Student: I think you
should just walk away

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:10.306
and if they still bully you,
then you should tell the teacher.

00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:12.936
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: Every teacher,
every day, uses Circle to check

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.006
in with students to see how
they're doing and uses mindfulness

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.256
to prepare them for learning.

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:18.616
&gt;&gt;Allison Kenny: Would that work?

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:19.976
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: We
have art partnerships

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:23.236
with community organizations
that come in and use art as a way

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:27.256
to support critical thinking and
communication skill development.

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:28.576
&gt;&gt;Allison Kenny: And the
only one we're really

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:31.246
in charge of is ourselves.

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:34.156
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: Every student
gets two art classes per week

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:35.186
as part of their core day.

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:39.756
And then we offer a range of classes
outside of the school day for kids

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:41.386
to participate here on campus.

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:45.136
Many students who maybe are
not as traditionally successful

00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:47.616
in the classroom that's the reason
why they want to come to school

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:50.816
and a reason why they want
to engage in academic work,

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:54.486
because they're having another
part of themselves satisfied.

00:01:54.486 --> 00:02:01.806
&gt;&gt;Jahi: And all you have are two
index cards and some Sharpies.

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:04.656
What would you create?

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.076
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: We've worked
very hard to create a community

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:09.096
where teachers want to step
outside their classrooms,

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:12.746
talk and work together and
really ask the hard questions.

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:14.036
One thing I found when I came

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:16.946
to Glenview was the staff had a
hard time questioning practice

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:19.666
or being a critical friend and
kind of probing on questions.

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:22.146
So we've worked to develop
a culture where you have

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:25.376
to have ask a constructive question
and that has allowed us to go deeper,

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:26.756
faster during our PD time.
