00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.916
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:09.060
JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm
Jessica and today I'm

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.790
going to be talking about a
chemical demonstration called

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.410
the Briggs-Rauscher Reaction.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.110
This reaction was discovered
by two San Francisco-area

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.100
high school chemistry
teachers, Briggs and Rauscher,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.690
who were working
in a lab to come up

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.720
with a visually striking way
to demonstrate an oscillating

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.630
clock reaction,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.860
Let's watch MIT's Dr. John
Dolhun show us the reaction.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.620
Here he is at the
Cambridge Science Festival.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.290
JOHN DOLHUN: OK.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.910
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to pour three colorless

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.630
solutions into this beaker.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.560
Solution number one, and I'm
going to use kitchen chemistry,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.200
so I'm using my eye here.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.400
Let me just see.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.480
OK, there we are.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.375
Second solution.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.575
And the third solution.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.290
JESSICA HARROP:
So what happened?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.000
Dr. Dolhun mixed three clear,
colorless solutions together.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.130
The first solution
contains potassium

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.160
iodate and sulfuric
acid dissolved in water.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.680
The second solution is malonic
acid and manganese sulfate

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.449
monohydrate in water.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.520
And the third is hydrogen
peroxide in water.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.400
And when mixed together,
things get complicated.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.320
The overall reaction is this.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.120
So iodate, hydrogen
peroxide, malonic acid

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.280
in the presence
of sulfuric acid,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.160
reacts to produce this
compound-- oxygen and water.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.710
But think about the
reaction this way.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.800
It's equivalent to saying
that metal and plastic react

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.600
to produce a bicycle.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.460
In reality, there
are many steps that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.310
occur between those raw
materials and the finished

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.450
result.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.960
And the Briggs-Rauscher
Reaction is similar.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.360
Here are the many
subreactions that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.320
occur to get from the
reactants to the products.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.870
What we see is a
cycle from colorless

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.020
to amber to dark blue.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.580
And as these reactions
run, the relative amounts

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.860
of the reactants
and the products

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.230
dictate the color
of the solution.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.810
I2 is amber.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.610
I minus is colorless.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.820
And I3 minus is deep
blue when it interacts

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.470
with starch in the solution.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.600
Triiodide is formed when
iodine and iodide interact.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.060
And this cycle continues until
all the reactants are used up.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.470
Hope you enjoyed the video
and I'll see you next time.
