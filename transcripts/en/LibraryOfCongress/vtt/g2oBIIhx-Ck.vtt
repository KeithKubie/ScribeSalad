00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.430
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good evening.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.730
I'm Anne McLean.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.860
I'd like to welcome all of
you on behalf of the Library

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.930
of Congress Concert Office and also
the Poetry and Literature Center.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.230
Tonight we're delighted

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.520
to be presenting the world
premier performance of a work

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.320
by Michael Hersch, performed
by members of the Atos Trio,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.770
titled "Carrion-Miles to Purgatory:

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.330
13 Pieces After Texts
of Robert Lowell".

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.130
His composition for violin and
piano -- sorry, violin and cello,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.260
is a commission from the Library's
Hans Kindler Foundation Trust Fund.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.850
We're very pleased to have
Michael with us tonight,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.200
and fortunate to be able to present
him as a speaker in conversation

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.620
with psychologist and
author Kay Redfield Jamison.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.540
This premier is an
important feature in our rich

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.760
and very diverse 2015-16 lineup.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.030
A wonderful season that
celebrates our 90 years

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380
as a vibrant concert
presenter on the world stage.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.910
For the music division,
it's a great pleasure

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.400
to see this commission
came into being.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
Michael Hersch is internationally
admired as the distinguished

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.780 position:56%
and thoughtful composer and pianist.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.220
In our program tonight you can read
several comments about his career

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.630
and there are wealth of
statements that you can find online

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.310
and in the literature by
critics and commentators

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.830
that attest to his stature.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.490
The Financial Times of London
states that he is considered "one

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.650
of the most fertile and musical
minds to emerge in the U.S.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.950
over the past generation."

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.200
And The Baltimore Sun talks
about music of "stark, settling,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920
seemingly implausible beauty."

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.300
I won't mention the prizes and
awards, but you can see them

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.540
in tonight's program and
it's an impressive list.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.520
I would also like to
acknowledge three guests

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.820
that we are very delighted

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.430
to welcome this evening
Dr. Ronald Daniels,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.290
President of The Johns Hopkins
University, and his wife,

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.620 position:56%
Joanne Rosen, and Dean Frederick
Bronstein from Peabody Conservatory.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.830
It's unusual to find the
leading research institution

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.350
of global repute with the rare
attribute of being home to one

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.830
of the world's leading
conservatories.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.490
Tonight's free concert
presentation definitively points

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.810
up the commitment of these
institutions to a philosophy

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.490
of creative and provocative
interdisciplinary ventures.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.520 position:56%
In especially resonant confluence
for our own institution, Dr. Jamison

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.630
and Michael Hersch will be talking
about work of Robert Lowell,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.540
who was the Library's
Poet Laureate Consultant

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.450
in Poetry in 1947 and 1948.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.230
Kay Jamison is the Dalio Family
Professor in Mood Disorders,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.730
Professor of Psychiatry at the
Johns Hopkins University School

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.550 position:56%
of Medicine, and co-director of the
Johns Hopkins Mood Disorders Center.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.830
She's an acknowledged international
authority on depressive illnesses.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.180
Also, she is a good friend
to the Library of Congress,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.230
convening in 2008 a very successful
Music and the Brain Speaker Series,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.630
which is still very much
in circulation online.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.370
Dr. Jamison is also a
Robert Lowell scholar

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.930
and will shortly be publishing
a book about the poet.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.710
Afterwards, she will
be in the lobby.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.350
You can great her and I
wanted to say that we are --

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.200
we have for sale copies of
her book "Touched With Fire:

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.440
Manic-Depressive Illness and
the Artistic Temperament".

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.510 position:56%
Please welcome Kay Redfield Jamison.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:50.200
[ Applause ]

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.500
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Thank you.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.250
It's wonderful to be back at the
Library of Congress, a great,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.110 position:56%
great place, and an honor to be on
the same platform as Michael Hersch.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.970
Robert Lowell was born

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.710
into a prominent New
England family in 1917.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.660
He was a poet of great
originality and huge influence

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.590
in American poetry and
Western poetry in general.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.290
He was twice awarded the Pulitzer
Prize for Poetry and, as Anne said,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.560
in 1947 and 1948 he was a
Consultant in Poetry here

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.400
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.720
That was the early title for
Poet Laureate of United States.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.730
Lowell suffered throughout
his life from manic-depressive

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.000
or bipolar illness, from a
particularly terrible form of it

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.950
and was hospitalized for
mania nearly 20 times.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.220
He died in 1977, at the age of 60.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.200
So, I'm gonna talk just for a
little while, for a few minutes

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.460
about Robert Lowell and his poetry,
and then a little bit about some

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.410
of the overlapping similarities

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.610
between Robert Lowell
and Michael Hersch.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.760
Not the mental illness
side of things,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.890
but the genius side of things.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.250
And then, Michael and I are
going to talk, not so long,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.140
because we'd like to leave it
open for a lot of questions.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.870
"Darkness honestly lived
through is a place of wonder

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.200
and life," Robert Lowell wrote.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.120
"So much has come from there."

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.020
It was October 1957, and he was
40 years old, writing poetry

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.780
like a house on fire, and taking
darkness into a new country.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.190
It was, he said, the best
writing he had ever done.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.620
His new work became the
heart of life studies,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.290
described by one critic as "the
most influential book of poetry

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.770 position:56%
since T.S. Eliot's 'The Waste
Land.'" The poems, most written well

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.980
and in few months time,
left their mark.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.050
"They have made a conquest,"
wrote The Reviewer.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.310
"They have won a major expansion
of the territory of the poetry."

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.530
In December 1957, after a summer
and fall blaze of writing,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.640
Lowell was admitted to
psychiatric hospital in Boston.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.490
He was psychotic, manic, insane.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.760
It was his fifth psychiatric
hospitalization in 8 years.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.130 position:56%
These were long hospitalizations,
not like our modern hospitalizations

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.040 position:56%
where people get admitted and leave
almost as soon as they get admitted.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.440
Oh, these were hospitalizations
of many months.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.940
These were severe manias, where he
would be put in straight jacket,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.060
taken in hospital by six or
seven Boston police officers.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.690
Lowell told the doctor
who admitted him

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.740
that the preceding
months had been some

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.550
of the most productive
months of his writing poetry.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.990 position:56%
It was a pattern he had come to know
well - first the weeks of intense,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.380
fiery writing, then the spike
in the mania, and finally,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.620
as night follows day, the dusts
in the blood of depression.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.250
The psychiatrist wrote in
Lowell's medical chart what many

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.660
of his doctors were to observe.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.030
"The patient's had a series
of breaks," she wrote,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.410
"all in light of unusual
literary output."

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:32.090
Much had come from the
darkness, but not without a cost.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.520
Mania and imagination
many times come together

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.490
to help create great art.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:44.090
But disciplining character
makes art from inborn gift.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.130 position:56%
"Poetry may come from a unhappy and
disordered life," Lowell once wrote,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.350
"but a huge amount of health
has to go into the misery."

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.720
Without question, Lowell's attacks

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.520
of mania splurged some
of his finest works.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.380
They also brought great pain
to him and to those he loved.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.260 position:56%
Things he had done, when he was
manic, haunted him when he was well.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.570
He was mortified and ashamed.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.350
So too did his terror that he
would become psychotic again.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.230
Yet, Lowell came back from madness
time and time and time again,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.540
re-entered the fray and
kept intact his friendships.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.390
He kept his wit, he
kept his capacity

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.080
to love, he went back to work.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:37.190 position:56%
This faculty for regeneration is
not a common one, nor is the courage

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.470
to face and to rate from the
certainty of impending madness.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.650
Courage is unusual.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.370
So too is creating poetry
that expands the territory.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.730
Lowell's poetic imagination
was tethered to an unstable,

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.560
but fiercely disciplined mind.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.240
It forged his work and
it branded his life.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.910
"When I'm dead," Lowell
once told a friend,

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.390
"I don't care what
you write about me.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.680
All I ask is that it be serious."

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.810
Lowell's seriousness of purpose
was matched by a vaulting ambition,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.480
that had been his since childhood.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.080
It was a desire and a capacity
for rashness, ambition,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.710
the great sweep of great ideas.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.690
It was something he
admired in other writers.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.510
"Melville and Hawthorne he loved,"
Lowell once wrote, "pour out more

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.340
than the measure will hold.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.580
What wonderful dangers,
errors, condescensions

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.200
and breathless abundance."

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.030
Lowell, Hawthorne,
Melville, Whitman --

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.810
all like Coleridge were
habituated to the vast.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.060
They swung for the fences.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.540
They wrote to change the game.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.550
Many of Lowell's early poems,
including several of those chosen

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.550
as texts for this evening's
music by Michael Hersch,

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:07.380
are dominated by themes of
moral decay, of pain, suffering,

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.230
a fallen New England, retribution,

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.040
and the unforgiving
puritanism of his ancestors.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.230
He wrote of the complex
burden of heritage

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.130
and of the dark, ambiguous
grace of God.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.910
The battle that raged between
Calvinism, his native tongue,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.160
the New England protestantism
that he had known longest

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.190
and breathed most deeply, and
the catholicism that he had

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.310
as an adult taken to heart
and mind, and then quit,

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.190
was one that was reflected
in part in his mental wars.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.080 position:56%
It was a clash that entered into his
work violently and unforgettably,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.380
in his early poems, work that
the most influential critic

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:57.970
of the time said would be read
as long as men remember English.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:04.030
These were poems of ambition, elegy
and blood, coiled and unstable

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.480
in force and fury, and
crafted with brilliance.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.080
Lowell's great poem "The
Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket,"

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.150
which Michael Hersh has drawn
from this evening, in part,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:24.380
was a debt to Melville and The Old
Testament, to Thoreau, to Hopkins.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.230
It is Homeric in force, mythic in
scale and spelled by the violence

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.580
of God in Lowell's home
North Atlantic waters.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.860
It is the battleground
for the contrasting forces

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.140
that defined his mind
as a young poet.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.310
The poem, as Seamus Heaney said,
is one where "the percussion

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.590
and brass section of the
language orchestra is driven hard"

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.290
and "the string section
hardly gets a look-in."

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.930
Michael Hersch has essential things
in common with Robert Lowell.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.460
He's an unrelenting
way serious artist.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.050
His work is rooted in a profound
knowledge of grief and death

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:13.370
and life of the human condition,
in art, literature and in music.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.670
He has, like Lowell, a
restless, tectonic imagination

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.080
and the courage of his beliefs.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.450
He takes risks.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.780 position:56%
Lowell, it is always said, and there
is somebody who is writing a book

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.450
about him, it is the first thing
if anybody has actually heard

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.950
of Lowell, the first
thing that people say is,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.410
"He is a really difficult poet."

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.220
Lowell is a difficult poet.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.300
It's part of what makes him great.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.330
So too is Michael a
difficult composer.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.780
His work is complex,
unpredictable, dark, and wonderful.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.450
It is beautiful.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.660
It is piercingly human.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.510
And I am honored to be
here with him tonight.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.040
[ Applause ]

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.660
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison:
Please just sit.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.450
We're going to just
keep this very informal.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.950
So, why Lowell?

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:17.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: You know,
when -- I've always been drawn,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.900
especially since I
got out of school,

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:29.180 position:56%
I tend to find much more inspiration
and more friendship, if you will,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:37.370 position:56%
and camaraderie and company in text,
whether it's literary or poetical.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:44.140
There's very little of it that
jumps out and grabs hold of me

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.050
in that way, I think, that
all artists are looking

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.820
for on some level, where
we react very strongly

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.880
to when we see something of
ourselves somewhere else.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:06.000
I don't make any presuppositions
or suppositions

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.940
about what Lowell meant,
felt, any of these things.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.200
But it doesn't change
the fact that in a lot

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.410
of his work I saw something
of myself.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.940
Then, again, I understand that's
one to zero correspondance,

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:26.480
it's all in my own mind, in my
own sensibility or sensitivity.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.890
But when I started
combing through his work,

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.460
sometimes it's just a word.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.570
It's often not more than a word or
a pair of words or trio or quartet

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.210
of words, or maybe a phrase.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.730
Very rarely will it be an
entire tract of poetry.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.940
These are the things that
ignite something in me.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:55.460
It's incredibly exciting, it's
a feel like there's someone

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.030
who saw the world through
similar eyes,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.060
even though the experiences
couldn't be more different.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.210 position:56%
And in a way, it doesn't really
matter to me what it is that he saw.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.060
It's how I perceive it on the page,
what's real and what's in front

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.330
of me - an abstract biography.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.800
And so, like all the arts and
literature and poetry and music

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.450
that I respond to, there was
something there that just touched

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:30.660
to the merrow of what it is
that I'm looking for in art.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.630
And then in turn it has an impact
in one way or another on things

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.460
that I attempt to make myself.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.370
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: So, of
all of his poetry, which is huge

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:52.910
and collected verse of his,
you focus on the early poems?

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.610
Was that because there was such
a long collection of poetry

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.440
to read through or was it --

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:05.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: No, I think there
was something actually in what I do.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:16.890
If anybody ever went through all
of my books, you might take a book

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.450
of the shelf that contains some
of the most consequential material

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:27.810
in terms of material that I've
somehow had a conversation with,

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.660
in service of literature
or poetry, through music.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.360
But often times, if someone
looked at one of those books,

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.310 position:56%
they wouldn't notice anything in it.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.680
They have to look very carefully,
because it would be two words

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.920
on this page, and then 60 pages
later there may be a sentence here

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.280
and another 45 pages
later something else.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.840
It's incredibly specific to me and
there is oftentimes no real method

00:16:51.840 --> 00:17:01.030
or obvious methodology to how
I'm engaging with these texts.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.250
So that was really notable
and, in Lowell's case,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:12.170
that terrain of the expression
that I was feeling myself,

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:17.910 position:56%
looking for companionship and
certain text fragments came to mind.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.530
So, when I was writing this music,
I started the music before I went

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:30.110
to the Lowell, but certain text
fragments of Lowell came to mind.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:35.000 position:56%
Maybe one of the first was a line in
poem; it's just something as simple

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.140
as "Canaries beat their
bars and scream",

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.190
and that just popped into my mind.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.140
Or, another image of two
angels fighting over the soul

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.440
of the man with billhooks.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:57.110
These kinds of images that were
just incredibly searing images

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.300
and I would just be writing and
then they would come to mind

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:05.620 position:56%
and then I would go and try to track
down where did I remember that from?

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.880
And sometimes there would be
musical allusions to leave talk --

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.850
there is a rhyme where he talks
about hell being burned out

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.310
and heaven's harps-strings
going slack.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:24.550
And then somehow these all start
to tie together, to tailor together

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.640
and ultimately it makes sense -
they were from the same collection.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.800
But that surprised me, because
usually people are trying

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.960
to make sense of what
the relationships are

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.660
between different text fragments.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.100
But in this case it was
very clean that way.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:47.370
But that just speaks to the
consistency of rendering

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.500 position:56%
of his own imagination at that time.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.800
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Right,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.270
anything that would have exist
very clear and fascinating

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.660
about Lowell is he's one of these
writers, rather like Beethoven,

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.240
who just moved from effort.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.780
He just moved and changed
and went on and recreated,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:13.770
and so that Lord Weary's Castle,
which is made of mostly fragments,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:22.500
is completely different from so
much of the work he did after that.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.750
So, very, very different.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:32.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: Yes, and
there's no real explanation as to --

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.750
the interesting thing -- really,
it's not so interesting --

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:43.060
is that I'm not looking for
something that is trying

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:48.280
to capture a sort of
emotional or psychological --

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.090
there's something that's
going to click

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.120
with a feeling, with that feeling.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.640
I'm not after an image
and I think that's one

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.280
of the complicating factors
in a piece like this.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.440
I'm certainly not the first person
to engage with text this way,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.660
but a lot of times
people like the idea.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.510
It's a very clean idea to take
an image that's laid out in words

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.530
that we all understand and then
the idea of composer taking that

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.990
and trying to render that or
transform that into sound.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.850
That's too fastle.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.770
I don't know if that's
the right use of the word.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.650
It's more nuance than that.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:36.310
These images are a byproduct
of something that's a feeling,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.600
a state of mind, a state of being.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.030 position:56%
I think that one of the things
that's extraordinary about Lowell is

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.460
that he's able to take
something as simple as an image,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.760
though, and capture that.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.550
That's a very hard thing to do.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.750
I found that for me, what was
different about these texts

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:59.720
versus others is how visual they
are, or to me they are visual.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.750
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: He
described capturing experience

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.830
in talks, you know, and
you would look at them.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:13.600
I think one of his famous
images was meat-hooked --

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.010
words "meat-hooked
from the living steer."

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.530
I mean, it's that incredibly
graphic imagery that, you know,

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:25.740
you have to have a heart of stone
to remain unresponsive to, I think.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.340
No, I --

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.840
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison:
Do you see anything kind

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.030
of intrinsically musical
about Lowell's work?

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.890
I mean, by definition poetry is
musical, but is there anything

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.180
that sets him apart in that?

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:49.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: You know, for
me what's interesting is most

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.580
of the texts that I've ended up
connecting really strongly with me

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.730
over my life - they
tend to be texts written

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.020
in non-English languages
and they're translated.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.050
Sometimes I can handle
the original languages,

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:12.650
but in the end I'm the product
of English and the admiration

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.120
that I have and the
gratitude that I have

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.270
for great translators
can't be overstated.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.350
Of course, Lowell translated
as well.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.640
So, what was interesting was along

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.370
with just a few other people
here was some writing in English.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.810
So there's just something
inherently musical to me

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:36.780
about seeing these thoughts, these
feelings, these recollections,

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.410
these terrors, these premonitions,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.920
whatever you might
call them, in English.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.490
They were originally
conceived in English and,

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.890
because that's my language,

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.190
that's the language I'm
most comfortable with,

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.560
there's something inherently
musical to me.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.790
That's not answering your
question exactly, but yes,

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.210
I do find there's something
particularly musical

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:04.850
about these words and the way
that they are laid out on page.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.850
But, of course, in this case I'm
not setting any of these words.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:14.180
I just told someone earlier
that I've written a lot of music

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.580
that has relationships with
text in one way or another.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.690
Just like this piece -
it accompanies the piece

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.840
in a certain way, but
it's comunication more

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.460
between me and the writer.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.250
But I think this piece, more
than any other that I've done,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:37.960
I do feel it's, if not necessary,
than important for people,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.590 position:56%
when they're listening to the music,
to read the accompanying text.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:49.660
Again, in the past I would have
felt that there had not been --

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.590
the texts certainly don't
need my music and I would hope

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.940 position:56%
that the music doesn't need any text

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.720
that may have accompanied
me personally

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.020
on the journey of writing.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.680
But in this case, I think
that they are very unified

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.230
in a way that's much
more pronounced and so,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:15.310
in this case I encourage
people to read and listen.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.770
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: I think
that Lord Weary's Castle is just

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:27.370 position:56%
so marked by movement and energy and
force and madness, it just moves.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:33.500
There's something, there's a
velocity to Lord Weary's Castle

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.220
that is not unlike
his subsequent work,

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.700
but it's much much more pronounced.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: Yes, I would
agree there's an immediacy to it

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:51.830 position:56%
that it compels itself, I'd say even
in small fragments it does that.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:25:01.810
I think for me in all art, whether
it's a building, a sculpture,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.890
a painting, a poem, a novel -

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.990
something for me that's
important is a sense of momentum.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.310 position:56%
You can achieve momentum in absolute
stasis and never have anything other

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.870
than absolute stasis, and there
still can be a shocking momentum

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.170
to it.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:27.010
I think he achieves that, he
definitively achieves that kind

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:32.310
of momentum, whatever he's
doing, when he's at his best.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.810
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: I
think it's sure and I think one

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:40.470
of the things is striking in his
work is this change over time.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:47.760
But that incredible rhythm,
particularly in the early works -

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.030
it's the sea over and over again,
or it's a turmoil of people over

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.540
and over again, but it's
in waves, unremitting.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: One thing
I thought was interesting was

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.610
when I realized how relatively
young he was when he wrote,

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.950
as I was becoming very not
relatively young anymore.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:16.730
It always struck me as a bit
odd that I was drawn to be

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.150
where he was, in his light.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.420
There's that period in all of
our lives, whatever is happening,

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:34.630 position:56%
that's always a bit tempestuous and
on some level I was puzzled by this.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:42.020
But what's interesting is that for
him that was his life, at the time.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.190
For me, life -- for all
of us as we get older --

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:50.400
becomes defined more and
more by advance and actions

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.470
and things that have boundaries.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.210
Sometimes these boundaries
become unclear

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.410
or broken and then they spill.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.640
But it was interesting how
something that very clearly

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.740 position:56%
for him was all-encompassing, a sort
of his state of mind over a period

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.410
of years, applied so nicely
to something where I was put

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.220
in this state of mind of
something very specific

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:25.650
that does recapture the sort of
generic trauma of being younger.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:31.580
In this case it was real traumas
and so I was able to take something

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:35.260
that on the surface didn't
seem to match so much

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.560
with where I was in my life.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.130
But then taken and put inside,
encapsulated in a series of events

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.930
in my life, it actually
worked really nicely.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.170
I'm only thinking about
this right now,

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.890
I haven't actually thought
too much about that.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:55.630 position:56%
So, in that sense, the period in his
life is not really relevant to me.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:59.220
Many artists have done a lot
of great things at that period,

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.300
it's not such an extraordinary
age to do the work.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.770
But there's a totality to
his state of mind and a sort

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:13.230
of all-encompassing-ness to that
state of mind that he's able

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.630
to sustain without seeming like --

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:23.990
he's able to avoid these traps that
lot of people, when we're younger,

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:33.560
fall into - self-pity or
just sort of undefined angst.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.240
It just translates so nicely to
real world of grown up things

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:44.240
that are defined in advance,
and in that sense it's

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.420
that mature level that's
quite extraordinary, I think.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.700
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Gee, can
you write a chapter for my book?

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.830
That's very good.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.170
That's very true.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.080
I think too, with Lowell,
as you say,

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:04.200
he was 29 when he got Pulitzer
Prize for his body of work.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.340
By that time he had been

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.830
through just an incredible
series of life-times.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:17.290 position:56%
I think partly he was born
tempestuous and he died tempestuous,

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.990
but this was a period of
time that was just striking

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:25.180
for the changes in
his emotional being.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.410
And then in just a few years time
that he would be hospitalized

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.350
for the first time for mania.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.390
But you can feel the mania
in the work and certainly

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.710
in the lines of the works.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:41.670
I think what's also interesting
is that, not unlike many people,

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.880
of course, he had great love for
music and he wrote about music.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.700
So he wrote a sonnet
about [inaudible],

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.120
a sonnet about the Archduke trio
that's being played tonight.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.870
He wrote sonnets about
Beethoven, Schubert,

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.460
the two great composers
that he most loved.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.710
There was something always
in the back of his mind

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.360
that you had the sense
was being formed by music,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.640
his being classicist by
education and training and heart.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.610
By other poets, by
other writers, by love.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.060
I mean, this is hugely
broad and not this kind

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.260
of picky or manicured life that -

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: You know, he
seemed to me looked around him

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.210
and he had that sense, you know.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.510
And, you know, and
it's - I knew the --

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:32.160
for me, you know, I feel
that all the early years

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.430
that I was composing, certainly
through my late teens and 20s,

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:44.700
I didn't feel like I had
my head above the clouds,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.380
until I got on the far side of 25.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.190
I just feel like there was
so much I just wasn't seeing

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:57.350
and for me it took some time.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:02.470
It took me into, such
as read something

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.180
where someone had this sort
of control of his materials

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.570
and had a sense of
what was around them.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.940
I don't mean sense of
influence, I mean just a sense

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:18.050
of the human landscape
that surrounded him.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:23.840
I feel like I'm still
noticing things.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.480
We all of us are going to
notice things hopefully always,

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.560
but what was interesting just
looking back from that perspective,

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.280
to be able to see someone
who had figured that out

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.730
and there was a clarity of
thought in a relatively young age.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.140
Well, I was sure that I had
that clarity of thought then,

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.880
but it's interesting and a lot
of times I've found that writers

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.200
and poets have that clarity
of thought before musicians.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.920
I don't know why that may be.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.830
I don't know if I have any clarity
of thought yet, but there's sense

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:01.410
of one's self changes and the
sense of being in the dark.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:07.630
But he just had this sort of
omniscience that comes through.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.820
Whether it was real or not, it is a
sort of force of personality also.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:15.920
And I think that's also one of
things that characterizes him -

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.260
the force of his personality
just comes

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:23.310
through very strongly
from very early on.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.310
And that's a rare thing.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:32.890
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: You see,
he once quoted about John Berryman,

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:39.740
who was similarly forceful and
manic, that there was no one

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.940
so loyal as John, but you'd like
to have him living in another city.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:49.150
There is that element
of pure intensity,

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.640
but I think it's also true that
people who knew him very well

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.590 position:56%
and who loved him very much also
describe this incredible gentleness.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:00.170
So it's always, he's
opposing sort of forces

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.630
of just incredible
gentleness and kindness

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.200 position:56%
and talkingness and soft-spokenness.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.470
He's a calm, good man.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:14.900
So, what about the writing of
it and the words and the music,

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.640
and then maybe open
it up to questions.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:23.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: I mean,
there's really not much to say.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:29.840 position:56%
The piece, you can read in the notes
or everybody has, is in 13 movements

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:35.430
and the piece just
unfolds on it's own.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:42.890
It is what it needs to be,

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:49.410
what I made improvising it
a lot in the coming weeks.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:57.960
This particular piece was
writing for violin and cello.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.620
I've found it difficult, but it
was a real sort of metal testing,

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.680
it was -- the two instruments
I feel very close to,

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.890
but I've never written just
for the two of them together.

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:13.470
And so there was a lot of --

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:19.500
the Lowell's text provided some of
these landscapes that he provided

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:26.560 position:56%
in my own mind, create certain
sonorities or certain sounds that --

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.810
but all kinds of things
are going into writing it,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:33.520
that I don't know how important
it is for people to really know.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.850
It's like looking at the wiring
or the piping of the building.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:43.950
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Maybe
a little bit more than that.

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:47.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: How does that
reiterate what I've said before?

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:51.170
That more than any other piece
that I've written that is engaged

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:56.760
with text, where the
text is not song.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.250
It's essential to this piece.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.700
This piece wouldn't have been
written had I not been engaging

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.080
with these texts.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.600
As I said before, the fact that
so many of them just came to mind

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:16.790 position:56%
in an involuntary sort of way speaks
to how important they were to me,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:21.210
or have been, maybe
without even knowing it.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:26.450
So, even on some level it
may even be OK to refer

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.130
to these center pieces as a
kind of songs without words.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:37.380
Except that the words are there,
but they're just not song.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.650
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Thank you.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.950
Just open up for questions?

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.920
Yes?

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.730
&gt;&gt; What prompted this
particular choice of pieces?

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch:
That was just simply

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.550
when the Library approached me.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:57.600
They wanted something
that had featured cello,

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.180
so normal thing would
probably be to do a sonata

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.980
for piano or maybe a solo cello.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.320
But after thinking about that -- I
had to think about it for a while,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.290
and if I hadnt, you know, even

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:15.400
with this incredibly generous
opportunity, exciting opportunity,

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.940
I still needed to feel - I have
to feel excited about if I'm going

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.290
to undertake any kind of project.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:28.090
At a bare minimum, I have to be
excited about the possibility

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.240
of writing for whatever
the medium is.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.830
And so I went to them and I said

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:38.120
that it would be a bit unorthodox
perhaps, but would they allow me

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.470
to write something for violin
and cello, so they said, "yes."

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:47.760
So that's all.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.470
&gt;&gt; What did Lowell die of --
what did Lowell die of again?

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:55.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: She wants to
know what he died -- how he died.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.510
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: This is
the composer's daughter, Abby.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.220
Abby Hersch.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.510
We're delighted you're here.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:10.400 position:56%
Mr. Lowell died of a lot things, but
I would actually turn to my husband,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.580
who's a cardiologist and
who's doing that side

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.660
of the work, but he died of?

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.000
&gt;&gt; He died of a heart attack.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.300
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Yes.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.800
After years of 4-5 packs
a day of cigarettes,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.300
not inconsiderable amount
of drinking, and mania,

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.830
which actually elevated
rate for heart disease.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:39.710
So he was under intense stress,
so it was a culmination of things.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:43.080
And both of his parents had
heart disease, so he was living

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:47.810
under shadows of disease.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:49.340
Great question.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:38:03.640
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm trying to see if I can
put this into words, my question,

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:09.010
but as Dr. Jamison said,
Lowell was very difficult,

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.650
just reading this here.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:18.380
And it seems more -- what
struck me about it is

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:24.250
that it's more a collection of
impressions than it does draw

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:27.770
on a single visual
descriptive kind of thing.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:35.610
So if it is a collection
of impressions, I wonder,

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:44.910
in reading this it would call
to mind either ideas or images,

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:54.070
and which of them will help me
to better understand the music?

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch:
If it's the music --

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.430
if I've succeeded in any way in
writing what I hoped to write,

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.650
then you hopefully won't need help,

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:10.330
there shouldn't be anything
referential that you have to do.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:16.080
So, when I say it's good
to have those texts there,

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.060
it's like having a passing glance.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.850
You can read them all at once
and not look at them again,

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:25.210
you can read -- usually I'm
antagonistic towards the idea

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:30.410
of reading and listening: I
think listening requires all

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:38.200
of our faculties and any
distraction is not a good thing.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.920
So, I guess my expectation would
just be that if you listen to it

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.250
and you have a certain
reactions and you read the text,

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:50.970
you might just kind of, say
-- you would just sort of nod,

00:39:50.970 --> 00:40:00.080
there would be some sense that
there was a rightness to it.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.840
And if there wasn't, that
can be expected, too.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.090
But, again, I just want
to reiterate that I hope

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.920
that the music doesn't
need the poetry.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.300
I know that those texts
don't need my music.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.600
That's for sure.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.300 position:56%
I just think that the presence of
those texts, perhaps, might heighten

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.020
or augment the experience
of listening to music

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.840
through their proximity -
meaning them being on the tip

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.280
of your mind if you read.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:37.670
You might just recognize
something of each and in each pole,

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.880
the literary or the
poetical or the music,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.860
that there's some common
ground there.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:49.560
I think, frankly, for people who
don't have a lot of experience

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.420
with musical expression
that's beyond, say,

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:58.640
the standard repertoire, it
provides a way in, for some people.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.780
They're hearing sounds that
they've never heard before

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.720
that and that can be jarring.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.000
So the words can act
as a sort of bridge.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.210
I doubt there is anybody
who can read those texts

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.680
and not have an informed
feeling about it.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.360
For as the music, people
might listen and say,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.350
"I'm not sure what I've heard."

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.590
Everybody's experiences are
so different with music,

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.600
but our experience with
language is pretty uniform.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.800
And our experience with
music is uniform, too,

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.080
but every composer is
speaking in different languages

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.540
and if you have no
experience with the language,

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.300 position:56%
it's probably not a bad idea to
ground oneself into it a little bit.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.810
It doesn't mean that you
have to be liking it.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:51.260 position:56%
But, you see, I'm quite inarticulate
about these relationships with --

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:56.090
because I have never
been asked before.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:42:00.740
So, it's okay to read
those texts, though.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.040
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison:
You might say

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.800
that there is a certain dark thread
that runs through these texts?

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: I would say
that the thread that I perceive

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.480
through those texts, that is
shared with the music, certainly.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.820
Mainly what we're dealing
with are issues of loss,

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.500
grief and their appending
in the tentacles.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.320 position:56%
So, yes, those are the broad strokes

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:33.390
of expressive territory
that they share.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.230
Again, whether I succeed
in communicating

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.400
that is certainly an
open-ended question,

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.110
but from my standpoint
those were the things

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.660
that I was trying to express.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.120
And it seems to me
that Lowell was too.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.740
But I'm also well aware that the
context of a lot of those poems -

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.900
that if you read them in
context, what you take away

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.630
from these fragments would
probably be unrecognizable.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.440
So, that's a whole another thing,
which is a whole another issue,

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.870
which is for another day - whether
if it's even right for a person

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.270
to extract things like this.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:14.360 position:56%
To take these things out of context.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.390
I imagine there are a lot of
people who have a real problem

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:25.640
with one artist, with a composer
taking fragments of a poem

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.550
which was clearly intended
to be read in it's entirety.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.240
But, that's a risk out there.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.060
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Well,
apparently Lowell would not be one

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.800
of those, because he actually
was a great translator

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.030
to many perspective, but
he got huge criticism.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:47.450
He took poems in languages
he didn't know,

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:51.420
took texts from different
language to translate from,

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.860
and then wrote his own poetry.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:59.570 position:56%
He saw language as living and he saw
language as - you contributed to it.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.690
And he would be the
first, I think, to say --

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: Okay,
good, all's good to that.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.680
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Yes.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:12.180
And he actually -- Benjamin Britton
wrote music based on Lowell's work

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.710
and he said it was one of the
greatest honors of his life.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.450
Hhe liked the idea of
being written from.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: That's good.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:32.120
&gt;&gt; Michael, can you just say
something about the interplay

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.380
between the text in your
composition, as to say --

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:40.120
I understand that you read,
there's impressions that you take,

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.240
there's parts of the poems
that moved you and then

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:49.730
that inspires composition, but are
you composing, re-reading, refining

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.190
or -- can you say something
about your own creative process

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.410
in the interplay between
text and composition?

00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:00.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: Yes, now that's
the part that is a bit puzzling.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:06.190
It's actually -- I'll be writing
and then the words come to mind.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:09.660
So, something I do
reminds me of something

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.240
that Lowell did, in this case.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.370
Then that acts as accelerator,
somehow.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:19.250
Like it then feeds whatever
it was that I was --

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:25.590
so, that's the part that's
a little backwards, I think.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:30.420
Maybe more at expected
circumstances, where it is a sort

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:35.550
of you start with the
non-musical object

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.880
that then inspires
something in the composer.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.660
The composer then -- so, that's
all something like Pictures

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.020
at an Exhibition of Mussorgsky,
that sort of basic idea, right?

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.370
He's capturing these
paintings in music.

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:54.990
In this case the process comes
from writing and then some

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:59.960
of these text writings
pop into mind.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.150
If that happens, that's
very meaningful to me,

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.500
because there was no reason for me
to be thinking about these at all.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.240
I'm into writing this piece, not
thinking about Lowell at all,

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:17.700 position:56%
but from the outside, somehow, these
text fragments start to come to mind

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.800
and then I have to go
back and find them.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.840
I stay true to what occurred to me,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.420
that's why they are what they
exactly need to be for me.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:34.830
So, sometimes all I need
is one word, it's a back

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:38.940
and forth in real time, sort of.

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:44.270
But once I've identified the
text, then that is exciting.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:48.830
Then that feeds more, then
I'm getting more from that

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:52.090
and it might oscillate
back and forth.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:47:00.380
So, it really is exciting, because
it's having this living dialogue.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.460
He's not there, I'm
not talking to him,

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:08.700
but through his work it
really does feel very much

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:13.780
like collaboration,
in a strange way.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:19.950
&gt;&gt; Lowell was glad to advise
that himself and allow images

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.940
to coagulate, so to speak?

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kay Redfield Jamison: Absolutely.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: Yes.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:30.040
&gt;&gt; There is one thing in the
program that's interesting,

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:38.160
they mentioned quarter tones and it
seems like in the second movement,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.550
which also has the
word Purgatory in it,

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.500
maybe even suggesting
some sort of threshold.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:50.270
Is that the only place with quarter
tones and although you're speaking

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.560
in the music, would you want
to say anything about that?

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Hersch: Yes, that is one
of the only places that I have --

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:03.530
there was no conscious one-to-one
correspondence between the idea

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:14.180
of Purgatory, but where the
quarter tones do appear,

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:19.110
they are very frequent in
the piece and I just think

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:24.760
of the quarter tone, it's
just another shade of harmony.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.080
So, it doesn't have
any specific meaning.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.660
Also, just for the
record, Purgatory --

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:35.600
I just did a song dealing with
a lot of text on Purgatory

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.520
with texts of Pound and Dante.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.480
It's just interesting, for whatever
reason - when I was younger,

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.970
a number of the texts
that I initially read

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:52.980
of Dante really presented Purgatory
in a relatively beautiful and sort

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.070
of tranquil, sort of
at ease, in at ease.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:59.590
That doesn't mean there's not
a sort of darkness hovering

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.730
around these things, but it's
interesting that in a lot

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:07.600
of Purgatory, a lot of writing
about it, the way we use it

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.780
in our common parlance
is much more grim than --

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.930
at least in my reading of
Dante or specific parts of it.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.640
So it's very -- since
you bring up that word,

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.290
it's a very complicated
word, I mean, for me.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:27.510
I mean, it has alot --
it's imbued with all kinds

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:32.950
of complexities and contradictions.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.590
Anyway, but still, the
quarter tones are just

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.810
because that's what the
harmony needed in that spot.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.420
Anything else?

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:45.270
No? Well, thank you very much.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.220
It was a -- thank you.
