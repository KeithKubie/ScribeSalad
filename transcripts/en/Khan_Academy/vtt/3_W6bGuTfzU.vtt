00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.900
Let's now evaluate this green
surface integral right over

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.660
here.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.460
And to do that, we need
to parameterize surface 2.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.080
So let's say surface
2 can be represented

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.810
by the vector position function.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.280
I'll just call it t-- t
for two-- so t-- which

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.610
is a vector-- it's going to
be a function of x and y.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.680
Those are going are going
to be our parameters.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.430
And it's going to
be equal to-- and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.530
we can do this, once again,
because our surface is

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.730
a function of x and y.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.150
So it's going to be equal
to x times i plus y times j

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:47.980
plus f2 of xy times
k for all the xy's

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.555
that are a member of our domain.

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:52.930
Now, with that
out of the way, we

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.400
can re-express
what k dot n ds is.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.130
So let me write this over here.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:08.431
k dot n ds is equal to-- and
we could put parentheses here

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:10.180
that we're going to
take this dot product.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.138
That's, at least, how I
like to think about it.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:19.080
This is the exact
same thing as k

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.140
dotted with the cross
product of the partial of t--

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.394
let me make this clear.

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:30.810
I'm going to do
the magenta color.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.870
The partial of t with respect
to x crossed with the partial

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.270
of t with respect to y times
a little chunk of our area--

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.360
times da.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.900
A little chunk of our
area in the xy domain.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.570
We've done this
multiple times as we

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.250
evaluated surface integrals.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.230
And we got the intuition
for why this works.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.165
And so then, we're
essentially just evaluating

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:54.040
the surface integral.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.360
And the one thing
we want to make sure

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.130
is make sure this has
the right orientation.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.629
Because, remember, in order for
the divergence theorem to be

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.080
true, the way we've
defined it is,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.400
all the normal vectors
have to be outward-facing.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.600
So for this top surface,
the normal vector

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.830
has to be pointing straight up.

00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:12.010
Not necessarily straight up.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.842
At least, upwards.

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:15.300
If this is a curve, it wouldn't
be necessarily straight up.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.990
But it needs to be up kind
of outward-facing, like that.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.290
On the sides, it would be
outward-facing like that.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.890
And down here, it
would be outward-facing

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.550
going in the general
downwards direction.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.090
So let's just make sure
that this is upwards-facing.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.630
If we're changing
with respect to x,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.030
we're going in this direction.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.540
Changing with respect to y,
we're going in that direction.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.580
Take the right-hand rule with
the cross product-- index

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.080
finger there, middle finger
there, your right thumb,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.910
I should say, will
go straight up.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.710
So it goes in the
right direction.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.610
So this would be an
upward-pointing vector.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.301
So we got the right
orientation for our surface.

00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:54.800
Now, let's think
about what this is.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.995
And it's important to
realize we could calculate

00:02:56.995 --> 00:02:58.870
all of the components
of this, but then we're

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.100
just going to take the dot
product of that with k.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.280
So really, we care about
the k component only,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.250
but I'll work it out.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:17.290
This is equal to k
times a matrix i, j,

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.180
k of the partial of
t with respect to x.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.200
Well, the partial
of t with respect

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.190
to x-- I'll do this
in blue-- is going

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.800
to be 1, 0, and the partial
of f2 with respect to x.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.580
And then the partial
of t with respect to y

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.410
is just going to be
0, 1, and the partial

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.420
of f2 with respect to y.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.720
And then, of course, we
have to multiply times da.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.460
And this is all going to be
equal to unit vector k dotted

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.090
with-- and I don't even
have to work it all out.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.730
It's going to be
something times the i unit

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.760
vector minus
something-- checkerboard

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.790
pattern-- minus something times
something else necessarily--

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.010
times our j unit vector.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.980
And now, we can think
about the k unit vector.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.630
So the k unit vector is going
to be 1 times 1 minus 0.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.300
So it's just going to be
plus the k unit vector.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.690
We know it's 1 times
the k unit vector.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.220
And of course, we have
our da out right here.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.920
But when you take
this dot product,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.310
you only are left
with the k components.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.845
And it's essentially
just 1 times 1.

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:35.470
You end up with a
scalar quantity of 1.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.930
All of this business
just simplified to da.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.260
So now, we can rewrite
our surface integral.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.010
And we're going to rewrite
it in the xy domain

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.170
now-- in our parameters domain.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.941
So our surface integral
right up here--

00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:55.440
so this will be
good for this video.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.160
And then, we'll do the same
thing with this surface here.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.800
Just making sure that we
get the orientation right.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.500
So this surface
integral, s2-- and I'll

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.520
even rewrite a little bit--
s2, which is a function.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:18.550
r is a function of x, y,
and z times k dot n ds--

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.540
I just rewrote all of
this right over here--

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.750
is equivalent to
the double integral

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.953
over our parameters domain--
which is just D-- of r of x, y,

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:31.000
z times all of this business.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.600
All of this business
just simplified to da.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.830
And since I want to write it
in terms of my parameters,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.070
I'll write it as R of xy.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.500
And while we're on that
surface, z is equal to f2.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.550
So it's xy and f2 of xy.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.635
And then, all of this business
we just saw simplified to da.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:56.010
So you might be
saying, hey, Sal.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.300
It didn't look like you
simplified it a lot.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.600
But at least now put it in terms
of a double integral instead

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.020
of a surface integral.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.311
So at least, in my mind,
that is a simplification.

00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:07.560
In the next video, we're
going to the exact same thing

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.810
with this-- just making sure
that our vectors are oriented

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.310
properly.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.140
And we could just
introduce a negative sign

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.080
to make sure that they are.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.800
And then, we're going to think
about the triple integrals

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.329
and try to simplify those.
