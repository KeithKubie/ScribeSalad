00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:01.735
((Intro))

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:02.965
*pop*

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:05.355
 

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:15.285
There's a common misconception that depression

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.315
is easy to spot. Hollywood often depicts it as

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.335
somebody who is always sad or looks worn out.

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:24.075
But, depression isn't always

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:27.015
obvious, which is why so many of us struggle with it

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:28.235
silently.

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:41.085
Sometimes, even smiling on the outside

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:43.740
when we're really dying on the inside.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.100
Here are 5 hidden signs of depression.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.095
1) You have habitual remedies.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.145
Therapy and medication can help with depression,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.020
but if you find yourself making extra changes

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.105
to your lifestyle, then it can indicate that you're struggling more

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:02.065
than usual with it.

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:08.185
I'm going through this one myself. If you are too,

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.425
you may find yourself exercising more frequently,

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.580
listening to music more often, or doing your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.005
favorite hobbies to distract yourself from the pain you're feeling.

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:23.585
Hidden depression exists when you're trying to

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:25.495
quiet the the loud demons in your head.

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.615
2) You have irregular eating and sleeping

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:37.725
patterns. People with depression struggle with

00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:40.625
consistent sleeping and eating patterns

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.265
You may find you're either sleeping and eating too much,

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.285
or too little. Depression can work in extremes,

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:49.055
and slows us down when we get little

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:52.245
energy from our irregular daily patterns.

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.705
3) You're highly philosophical.

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:58.545
Do you constantly find yourself seeking a purpose in life?

00:01:58.545 --> 00:02:01.465
Do you also think about the "What ifs",

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.755
and have frequent deep conversations about life and death?

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:08.175
Although you sound very scholarly and smart,

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:11.585
there can also be a downside to thinking too much.

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:14.665
People with hidden depression have a tendency to ruminate

00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:16.865
about their uncertainties in life.

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.335
They usually feel directionless, lost,

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:21.335
and scared.

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:25.185
4) You have trouble with abandonment.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.345
People with depression understand how much of a burden

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:31.235
it can be. I can strongly relate to this.

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.425
I have a hard time letting people in, afraid that

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:37.165
it'll be harder for them to be there for me when I

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:38.165
need their support.

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.215
I realize I have abandonment issues,

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:44.335
but I'm trying harder to be more vulnerable.

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:47.115
I realize I can't fight depression alone,

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:50.075
and neither should you. No one should have to.

00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:54.065
5) You're losing your patience. Have you been

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:56.995
feeling irritable or angry with others lately?

00:02:57.075 --> 00:02:59.835
Depression doesn't always have to look like sadness

00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:02.275
or dejection. Instead, you might

00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:05.435
find yourself frustrated and impatient with everyone.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.455
If you feel like you're at your last straw, your

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:10.535
depression might have intensified.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:14.275
Do you resonate with any of these hidden signs?

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:17.375
We want you to know that you're not alone, and together,

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:19.435
we can fight depression.
