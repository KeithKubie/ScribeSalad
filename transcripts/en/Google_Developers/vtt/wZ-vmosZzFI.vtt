[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.010
PAVOL MAGIC: My
name is Pavol Magic.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.130
I'm from Sygic, and I work
there as a product manager.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.350
I would like to tell you more
about how we use beta testing

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.960
and Google+ communities
to build better products.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.110
Beta testing communities
feature Google [? Allowance ?],

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.450
just a few months ago.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.760
And first we started to use it
for our main product, the Sygic

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
GPS navigation, which already
has more than 50 million users.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040
So getting feedback
is tricky sometimes.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.660
But using the Google+ community
connected with Google Play

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.070
account of Sygic, we started
getting a lot of really

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.320
valuable feedback, directly from
our users-- from real users.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.040
So we also created communities
like this for other apps

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.790
we have.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.800
Releasing beta is very easy.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.305
You just go to your
Developer Console.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.610
You connect your
Google community,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.200
which you previously created.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.570
Or you can search for
it, and add it here.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.250
Or you can share the
link with your testers.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.150
And the they can ask to be
a part of the community.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.450
Then you just upload a new
APK, and it's already there.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.350
As you can see, we've already
posted several beta versions.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.960
Then the best part
is, that when you're

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.200
satisfied with the beta APK, you
just promote it to production.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.690
And it's rolled out to
all users in just hours.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.240
So of course, the issues
we address as of first

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.790
are crashes.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.640
So when somebody reports
they had a crash of our app,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.350
we ask what device
was the user using,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.510
and some other questions.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.810
Usually reinstalling
the app works.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.090
But sometimes we need to address
this issue with our developers,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.400
and make some fixes
for the app directly.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.690
But here, it was a case
that reinstalling helped.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.840
So we got into a conversation
about some other issues.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.290
Right now we have around 200
members in our community,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.445
and most of them
are really active.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.260
But to keep them active,
you have to respond a lot.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.460
You just can't let them
share their thoughts.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.730
Because in just
a few weeks, they

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.140
will forget about the community,
because they have other issues.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.210
They have other
problems to solve.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.670
So you have to be really
active; post new beta versions

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.690
quite often.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.620
Or you have to ask them
questions, or even do

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.510
a little promotion.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.760
Because you can't
forget they are

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.850
doing this for free,
and in their own time.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.130
So doing a little competition
or something like that

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.460
would be really awesome.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.120
And this is how we use beta
testing for Speedometer

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.830
by Sygic.
