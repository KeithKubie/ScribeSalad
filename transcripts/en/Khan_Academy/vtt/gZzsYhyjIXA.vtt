00:00:02.476 --> 00:00:06.323
- [Voiceover] Amelia
started a puzzle at 12:56 pm

00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:08.406
and solved it at 1:33 pm.

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:13.922
How long did it take
Amelia to solve the puzzle?

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:17.834
So we can see she started at 12:56 pm

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.370
and ended at 1:33 pm.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.722
These are both pm and we'll
assume on the same day,

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.199
so that means it didn't take all the way

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.307
from morning to night.

00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:28.379
They're both afternoon.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.296
So she started at 12:56

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.583
and we want to know how long it takes

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:40.250
to get to 1:33 when she
finished the puzzle.

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:44.594
Well, from 12:56 to 1:00 pm,

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:49.222
we can figure out how long that is.

00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:53.973
That's only four minutes,
there's only four minutes

00:00:53.973 --> 00:00:55.890
between 12:56 and 1:00,

00:00:57.258 --> 00:01:01.341
and then to get from 1:00
all the way to 1:33 pm,

00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.691
is another 33 minutes, so Amelia worked

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.857
for four minutes, plus another 33 minutes

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:16.912
after one o'clock.

00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:19.227
She worked for four minutes before 1:00,

00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:23.264
33 minutes after one, so
she worked for a total

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:27.097
of 37 minutes on her
puzzle before solving it.
