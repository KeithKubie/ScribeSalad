00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.417
- The Second Great Awakening
was one of the most

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:05.834
important social, religious, and cultural

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.437
aspects of the early 19th
century in the United States.

00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:12.196
In fact, I might even
make the argument that

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:15.743
it's impossible to understand
the early 19th century

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:18.524
without understanding The
Second Great Awakening

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:20.274
because as you can see here,

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:23.168
it's kind of connected with everything,

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:24.834
so what was The Second Great Awakening

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.562
and why was it such a big deal?

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:30.729
The Second Great Awakening was
a period of religious revival

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:35.052
in the United States

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.758
where church membership really soared.

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:44.217
A lot of people had
conversion experiences,

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:49.667
meaning that they had a moment where they

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:53.401
came to understand their
personal relationship with God

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:56.215
and want to change their
ways to become a more

00:00:56.215 --> 00:01:00.382
religious individual and give
up their ways as sinners.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.995
So church membership really soared

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:08.162
and lots of new people joined
churches, particularly women.

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:12.606
Now, you'll note that this is called

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.692
The Second Great Awakening
because there was,

00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:16.346
in fact, a First Great Awakening,

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:19.524
which happened in the 1730s, 1740s

00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:22.074
and that was the era of Jonathan Edwards

00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:24.785
and sinners in the hands of an angry God.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.971
It was very localized in New England

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:28.999
and specifically, with Calvinism

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.908
or Puritan religious awakenings,

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:33.151
so that was a separate event

00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.185
that happened about 100 years before

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:36.537
and The Second Great Awakening,

00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:38.569
as I have drawn here, generally,

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.652
historians say it lasted
from about 1790 to 1850,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.421
but I would say that the real heyday

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:49.181
of The Second Great Awakening would be

00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:51.181
from about 1820 to 1840.

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:55.600
Those are hazy dates, but that's kind of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.355
the hot period of The
Second Great Awakening.

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:00.671
In this series of videos, I wanna explore

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.552
some of the aspects that led
to The Second Great Awakening,

00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:05.484
particularly the market revolution

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:08.786
and a bunch of other
social, political, cultural,

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:11.969
and even religious changes
that were happening beforehand

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.684
and then also explore some of the

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:16.928
consequences of The
Second Great Awakening.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:20.640
What parts of early 19th
century American culture

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.621
are really tied up with
this wave in religiosity?

00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.927
So what was The Second
Great Awakening like?

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:30.299
Well, here's a painting
of what I would call

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.324
kind of the central aspect of
The Second Great Awakening,

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:37.159
which were camp meetings.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.743
So unlike The First Great Awakening,

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:43.387
which was definitely a New England thing,

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:45.251
The Second Great Awakening took place

00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:48.407
largely more on the Western
part of the United States.

00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:50.085
Now, when we're talking
about Western part,

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.723
we're talking about
Western part circa 1820,

00:02:52.723 --> 00:02:55.208
which is gonna be Western New York,

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.541
Kentucky, around Appalachia.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.469
These were places that didn't have

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.083
the kind of strong
established church religion

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.829
that you might have found in
a place like Massachusetts

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.162
and so preachers would
set up camp meetings.

00:03:10.162 --> 00:03:12.141
They'd have a big stage.

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:14.135
People would come in tents

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:17.151
and they would listen to these preachers

00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:20.956
and these preachers
would attempt to convert

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:23.456
the audiences to a more active

00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:28.989
and particularly, evangelical
form of Christianity.

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.672
Evangelical Christianity
comes from this word,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.975
evangelical, evangelist,

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:40.249
like the four evangelists of the Bible,

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.829
who were the men who wrote the gospels

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.014
and the idea of evangelical Christianity

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:48.952
was a real strong attachment to the Bible

00:03:48.952 --> 00:03:52.869
and an attempt to make
kind of heaven on Earth,

00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:56.516
so to make the world below

00:03:56.516 --> 00:03:59.400
the same as heaven above.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.407
So they're kind of trying to bring about

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.521
a terrestrial paradise, if you will

00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:08.018
and many of the religious
movements that come out of this

00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:10.468
are particularly concerned with

00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:12.777
what we would call, really, the apocalypse

00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:15.542
or in more contemporary terms,

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.875
sort of millennialism or millenarianism.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.394
I know this is a big
word, but more or less,

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:26.647
the idea that they want Jesus Christ

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:30.230
to return to Earth and
rule for 1,000 years

00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:34.867
over a perfect earthly paradise.

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.502
Now, when you and I
think of the apocalypse,

00:04:36.502 --> 00:04:38.427
we usually think that's a bad thing,

00:04:38.427 --> 00:04:41.143
but most evangelical
Christians in this time period

00:04:41.143 --> 00:04:43.661
really wanted the apocalypse to happen

00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:46.683
because it meant that heaven
would happen on Earth.

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:48.903
Now, these camp meetings
were really interesting.

00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:51.431
You know, they're happening
kind of out on the frontier,

00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:53.983
so it's kinda the coolest show in town,

00:04:53.983 --> 00:04:56.773
to go see this itinerant preacher.

00:04:56.773 --> 00:04:59.467
They're often called circuit riders,

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:03.634
so that is a preacher who
literally rides around on a horse

00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:07.168
because he does not have an

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:09.675
established congregation of his own,

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:13.131
so he goes from town to
town, setting up meetings,

00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:15.392
preaching, and hopefully converting people

00:05:15.392 --> 00:05:16.973
to evangelical Christianity,

00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:19.775
but the camp meetings of
The Second Great Awakening

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:21.985
were characterized by a really

00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:24.804
emotional response from individuals.

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:27.286
People who were having
conversion experiences

00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:30.997
and you can see it here in this painting.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.195
They would kinda go into fits.

00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:37.219
They might fall over and
shake or bark like a dog

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.461
because they had been so overcome

00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.954
by this religious spirit.

00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:43.433
So you can imagine how
camp meetings like this,

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:45.188
as people heard about them,

00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:47.864
would've really affected
the general populous.

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:50.293
If you heard about a
story where your friend

00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:51.974
went off to this camp meeting and they had

00:05:51.974 --> 00:05:54.023
this incredible conversion experience

00:05:54.023 --> 00:05:56.165
where they realized how important it was

00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:59.659
to give up sin and devote
one's life to Christianity

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.624
and working to bring heaven on Earth,

00:06:01.624 --> 00:06:04.030
you might go check it out yourself.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.255
So two of the most famous preachers

00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:11.162
of The Second Great
Awakening were Lyman Beecher,

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:15.141
who was based out of
Ohio later in his life,

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.984
and you might be familiar
with this name, Beecher,

00:06:17.984 --> 00:06:20.260
because Lyman Beecher was the father of

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.427
Harriet Beecher Stowe, who
wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:27.990
One of Beecher's concerns was

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.635
just that society in
general in the United States

00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:34.303
was becoming more
secular and taking a very

00:06:34.303 --> 00:06:36.609
rational approach to religion,

00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:39.654
as opposed to an emotional
approach to religion.

00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:43.081
He wanted people to feel
religion very deeply.

00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:47.666
He was kind of working toward
a period of religious revival

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:50.367
and got one in The Second Great Awakening.

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:52.402
The other really famous
preacher from this time period

00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:54.959
was Charles Grandison Finney

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:57.473
and Finney traveled around

00:06:57.473 --> 00:07:00.971
and drew just crowds in the thousands.

00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:05.639
20,000, 30,000 people might
gather to hear him preach

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.298
and you can notice here that I have

00:07:07.298 --> 00:07:11.039
Finney and Beecher facing
away from each other

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.376
'cause they didn't entirely get along.

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:14.737
One of the reasons they didn't get along

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:18.546
was because Finney approved
of women preaching in public,

00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:22.629
which was definitely a
no-no for the time period.

00:07:25.104 --> 00:07:29.044
So what was unique and
new about the theology

00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:30.738
of The Second Great Awakening?

00:07:30.738 --> 00:07:33.505
Well, let me give myself a
little bit more space here.

00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:35.806
Well, I've already
mentioned some things here.

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:39.146
One that, it's taking
place out on the frontier

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.646
in huge ecstatic camp meetings

00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:44.157
where people were behaving in a way

00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:47.379
that would have been very
strange in a Puritan church,

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:50.269
falling down, shaking, shouting aloud

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.848
and also that it was concerned with

00:07:51.848 --> 00:07:53.662
this idea of millenarianism

00:07:53.662 --> 00:07:56.028
or trying to create heaven on Earth

00:07:56.028 --> 00:07:57.568
to bring about the rapture,

00:07:57.568 --> 00:07:59.918
to bring about the return of Jesus Christ

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:02.100
to Earth for 1,000-year reign.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.175
Also, that it served to inspire

00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:08.008
many converts to be better people,

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:11.489
to do good on Earth,

00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:13.922
to try to bring about
this heaven on Earth.

00:08:13.922 --> 00:08:17.837
Now, contrast this with some
of the religious establishment

00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:21.297
in the United States,
specifically the Puritans.

00:08:21.297 --> 00:08:23.964
Right, Puritans were Calvinists,

00:08:25.494 --> 00:08:29.618
which meant that they followed
the doctrine of John Calvin,

00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:33.189
which meant that they
believed in predestination.

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:37.356
Predestination is the idea
that before you're born,

00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:41.847
God already knows and has decided

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:46.467
whether or not you are
saved, one of the elect

00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:50.134
or whether you are
damned and going to hell,

00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:53.988
so there's really nothing you can do

00:08:53.988 --> 00:08:56.647
because either you are one of these elect

00:08:56.647 --> 00:08:58.265
or you're one of the damned,

00:08:58.265 --> 00:09:01.162
so your personal actions
make no difference

00:09:01.162 --> 00:09:03.657
in whether or not you're
going to get into heaven.

00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:07.824
The Second Great Awakening
really kinda rejects this notion.

00:09:08.744 --> 00:09:10.685
You can see that in
kinda two different ways.

00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:14.852
One, they do think that it
matters if you do good, right?

00:09:16.361 --> 00:09:19.230
So your time on Earth is not just kind of

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.231
wading through a veil of tears,

00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:24.018
waiting until you get to heaven or don't,

00:09:24.018 --> 00:09:26.014
depending on what your status is,

00:09:26.014 --> 00:09:27.681
so doing good works,

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:32.455
trying to improve the world around you

00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:36.027
does make a difference in your salvation

00:09:36.027 --> 00:09:37.704
and we'll see as this goes forward

00:09:37.704 --> 00:09:40.726
how that really animates people toward

00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:43.809
all kinds of social reforms
in this time period.

00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:47.976
The other thing this does is
really democratizes religion.

00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:53.027
Right, if the world
isn't already separated

00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:55.289
into the elect and the damned,

00:09:55.289 --> 00:09:58.466
then anyone has a chance of salvation

00:09:58.466 --> 00:09:59.873
and you see that in many aspects

00:09:59.873 --> 00:10:01.523
of The Second Great Awakening.

00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:03.773
They allow women to preach.

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:08.307
Women become really strong members,

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:12.364
influential members of
these communities of faith.

00:10:12.364 --> 00:10:14.864
They preach to whites, blacks,

00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:18.532
free, and enslaved people alike,

00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:21.782
so all races are eligible for salvation

00:10:24.218 --> 00:10:27.877
and you also don't have to
be a wealthy church father

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.779
to be influential in religion.

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:32.458
You know, people like Lyman
Beecher and Charles Finney.

00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:34.152
They weren't born wealthy.

00:10:34.152 --> 00:10:36.896
They weren't born as the scions of,

00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:40.041
say, the Mather family in Massachusetts,

00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:42.692
which had been one of the most important

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:45.126
religious families in Massachusetts,

00:10:45.126 --> 00:10:48.638
so The Second Great
Awakening really attracted

00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:52.035
lots of poor people,
people on the frontier.

00:10:52.035 --> 00:10:54.825
It wasn't a religion of the elite.

00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:56.869
Now you don't have to be educated

00:10:56.869 --> 00:10:59.845
at the seminaries of Harvard or Yale

00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:02.527
to have a Christian conversion experience.

00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:05.477
So this is the essence of
The Second Great Awakening

00:11:05.477 --> 00:11:07.906
and in the next video,
I'll talk a little bit more

00:11:07.906 --> 00:11:10.381
about the social forces that caused

00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:13.512
The Second Great Awakening
and the consequences

00:11:13.512 --> 00:11:17.679
of its proliferation in
early 19th century America.
