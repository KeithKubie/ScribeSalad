FLORENCE ION:
Hiroshi Lockheimer,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.430
what's a day in the
life like for you?

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.950
Do you eat an acai
bowl in the morning?

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.500
Do you like to ride
your bike to Google?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.350
What's it like when you get
into the office every morning?

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.683
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Well,
first of all, hello, everyone.

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:24.510
Good to see you, and
thanks for coming.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.772
Today is Bike to Work Day.

00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:27.230
I don't know if
you know knew that.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.540
FLORENCE ION: Oh, is it?

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.800
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: It
is, actually, at Google.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.970
I don't know.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.995
Is it a US-wide thing,
or is it a Google thing?

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:31.620
I have no idea.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.703
But it's Bike to Work Day.

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:34.240
There's a bunch
of people biking.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.778
I was not one of those
people, because I

00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:38.070
live a little bit further away.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.620
And you were asking me,
do I have an acai bowl?

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.520
I do not.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.290
I actually don't even know
how to pronounce that word.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.010
I'm just copying
how you said it.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.375
FLORENCE ION: It took me
a while to figure out.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:48.000
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
I drop off the kids

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.180
at school in the morning.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.430
I come to work.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.270
And I'm in meetings
all day, basically,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
either with the team internally
or a large chunk of what

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.370
we do across Android or Chrome.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.319
Chrome OS, Play, we
deal with partners,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.740
whether that's manufacturers
or developers or operators.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.040
So I have a lot of meetings with
internal and external people.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.870
I travel a lot also.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.090
I get to see the world,
which is kind of nice.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.590
FLORENCE ION: I see
your Instagrams.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.040
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.877
FLORENCE ION: Yes.

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:23.460
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: So yeah, so
that's kind of my typical day,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.860
is meetings, kid
stuff, family stuff.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.170
FLORENCE ION: Meetings,
yes, and good stuff, yes--

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.408
exactly, the balance of life.

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:32.700
So there were a ton of new
features announced this week

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.880
for Android Q coming out, if
anybody listened to the keynote

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.320
the other day.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.820
And you go to work every day.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.330
How did you and
the team figure out

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.470
what the heck to put into
the next version of Android?

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.970
How do you guys come up with
we need to tackle this feature,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.390
we need to tackle this
setting, that sort of thing?

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.765
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, I think

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.730
it's a combination of things.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.570
We have some ideas,
things that we

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.620
want to pursue that we
think are important.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.530
So there's ideas that
we generate ourselves,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.650
but also ideas that come
from our partners, too.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.440
For instance,
manufacturers may say, hey,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.009
we're going to build
a phone that folds.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.025
And then we'll be
like, oh, OK, let's

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.150
figure out how that's going
to work from a software

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.488
perspective.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.030
Maybe there's a
screen on the outside

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.210
and a screen on the inside.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.930
How should these
things interact?

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.843
Or someone might
say, you know, we're

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.010
going to add a fingerprint
sensor to the Chromebook.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.620
OK, let's support that.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.040
So there's external
influences like that.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.730
There's internal
ideas, as I mentioned.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.830
We also look at feedback
from developers.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.020
FLORENCE ION: I was going
to ask if you're ever

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.950
going around the internet--

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.350
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Of course.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.510
FLORENCE ION: --and see
what people are saying.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.260
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
We definitely do that.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.280
And Steph isn't here right here.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.980
She's not here
right now, but she

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.750
runs a process, her and her
team, Steph Cuthbertson,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.070
who was up at keynote.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.520
She meets with developers
regularly and gets a wish list,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.090
if you will.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.800
And she helps prioritize that.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.470
And so your voice really
matters in terms of what we do.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.950
FLORENCE ION: Do you ever use
Android and/or the platforms,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.795
the ecosystem that you
manage, and go, dang,

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:12.420
I really need to fix
that, or we really

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.772
need to get people on that?

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:15.230
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, I mean, I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.480
think everyone has their own--

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.900
I'm a user, too, right?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.398
So I have my own pet things
that I feel a little bit--

00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:23.940
like, I'll send
feedback to the team.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.700
I'll be like, why?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.570
Why does this work this way?

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.790
And so usually, they say,
uh-huh, and then they just

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.085
keep on doing what they're
doing, which is, you know,

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:34.390
great, great for me.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.475
But yes, absolutely, everyone
has their [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:39.600
FLORENCE ION: So was that
how Dark mode came about?

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.652
You were saying, this
is too darn bright.

00:03:41.652 --> 00:03:43.110
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
I, personally--

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.367
I actually saw that someone
tweeted this yesterday,

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:46.200
and I have to agree.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.688
I'm personally not a
huge Dark mode person.

00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:49.980
I don't know if that makes me--

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.522
I don't know.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.570
How many of you are
excited about Dark mode?

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.410
Yeah, OK, a lot of you are
excited about Dark mode.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.970
So I'm an outlier.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.680
I'm fine with how it
has been, but you all--

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.360
your feedback was heard.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.790
And that became sort of
the roadmap item, for sure.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.110
FLORENCE ION: Absolutely.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.030
So I want to switch
gears a little bit

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.130
and talk a little bit
about privacy and security,

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.680
a particularly hot topic in
this day and age, especially

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.959
recently.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.459
So there are a couple of new
features announced on Android Q

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.029
to give more control to
both users and developers

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.080
to let people decide
when and where their data

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.200
and certain elements of the
interface or the operating

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.620
system are shared, both with
Google and third parties.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.790
Can you talk a bit about how
and when the team decided

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.020
to head into this direction.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.450
How did you all
decide that it was

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.800
going to be something as
obvious as just having

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.460
a full readout of
permissions and just ticking

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.690
on and off what you wanted?

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.950
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, maybe
I can talk a little bit about--

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.800
not to sound dramatic, but a
little bit of the history, too.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.290
Security-- you've mentioned
privacy and security.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.640
Let me talk about
security first.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.880
I think security has
been-- not I think.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.390
I know.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.255
Security has been an important
part of Android from--

00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:05.130
I think your question
was about Android,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.190
so I'll answer about Android--

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.940
for Android, very
important from day one--

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.340
Chromebook OS, too, by the way.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.670
And if you think about
it, the Android team,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.570
we have the benefit of
having seen how computing

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.510
evolved throughout the decades.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.590
We saw, for
instance, how Windows

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.100
and how security was dealt with
on Windows in the '80s, '90s,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.610
and so on.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.240
So we built this system with
a lot of security built in

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.452
from the ground
up, how sandboxing,

00:05:33.452 --> 00:05:35.410
or things like that, the
fact that there's even

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.050
a Play Store, where we know
who you are as a developer,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.467
and we can have a relationship,
and so on, and have policies--

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:43.300
some of which you may
not like, but at least

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.390
we have some ground rules.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.300
And so Android has been
developed with security in mind

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.620
from day one.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.120
And so that's always
been important,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.630
and we've been continually
improving on that front.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.760
Privacy is interesting.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.340
It wasn't that privacy
wasn't important before,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.490
but I think how people think
about privacy, in light

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.010
of technology,
has really evolved

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.100
a lot, especially in
the past year or so.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.340
And I think a lot of us here,
we're all in the tech industry.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.330
We're reading the news.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.250
We're seeing what's happening.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.920
We're hearing about
the conversations.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.920
And so I would say there's
definitely been a renewed

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.940
effort around privacy.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.540
Even though it's been
important from before,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.880
I think what's important
and how people think

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.020
about privacy has evolved.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.730
So we wanted to adapt to that
and expose new capabilities

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.570
and new controls and
transparency urgently.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.280
So that's what we worked on Q.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.883
And it won't end in Q.
Security and privacy

00:06:41.883 --> 00:06:44.050
is one of those things, I
think, it will continually

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.230
be evolving, and something
that we'll continue to work on.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.685
I think that we took a
big step in Q, however.

00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:51.060
FLORENCE ION:
Well, it just seems

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.130
to be more part of the
conversation these days.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.030
And I feel like even users
are more aware of what privacy

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.310
and security means, and
little devices that we

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.897
have in our hands.

00:07:01.897 --> 00:07:03.730
Perhaps it's something
that maybe some of us

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.493
haven't thought
about until recently.

00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:07.660
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
well, I think one of the--

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.940
even if you have thought
about it, I think--

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.870
I'll give you.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.780
Maybe this is I'm going to
get booed for bringing up SMS

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.770
and call log.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.560
I know a lot of developers
were a little bit frustrated

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.250
with the changes that
we made on that front.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.810
The thinking 10, 12 years ago,
when that capability first-- we

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.800
made that available, was, well,
of course, it's a permission.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.455
And the developer asks
the user for permission.

00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:35.830
And if the user understands
it, and they say yes to this,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.760
then that's fine.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.430
Because our assumption
was developers

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.410
have the user's best interests
in mind, and users understand.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.430
Users and developers
understand each other.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.680
But what I think what we
realized over the past decade

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.550
is sometimes that's
not always the case.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.983
All of you have
great intentions,

00:07:52.983 --> 00:07:54.400
but there are some
developers that

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.950
don't have the best intentions
and will use capabilities

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.270
in ways that we hadn't
really anticipated.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.320
An example, by the
way, is there's

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.117
different cases
where it's not really

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:05.950
that you're trying to
do anything nefarious.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.650
It's just these capabilities
are not granular enough.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.530
I'll give you an example.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.570
Some of you may have
used the SMS permission,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.695
because you wanted to do
two-factor authentication.

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:19.478
And you just wanted an SMS
to be able to authenticate.

00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:21.520
But the whole permission
was like you have access

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.430
to everything.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.410
And so it was it
wasn't granular enough.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.790
So we've created APIs for
two factors specifically.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.635
So its scoped to
that purpose only,

00:08:29.635 --> 00:08:31.510
and you can't really
use it for other things.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.429
That's the kind of thing that
our evolving the platform.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.132
And so I think our understanding
of the world is evolving.

00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:38.590
FLORENCE ION: How
do you figure out

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.070
how to make that user-friendly
just for the average user,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.715
versus somebody who may be
a seasoned Android user?

00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:46.090
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, I think

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.600
that's a really key point.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.090
Another thing that
I think we're--

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.470
all this sounds
obvious in retrospect,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.680
but it wasn't that obvious
to us 10 years ago,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.910
is what we thought was
obvious to a user, turns out

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.350
a lot of these things
were not obvious to users.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.650
So one of the, if
you all remember--

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.470
I forget before
which release it was.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.990
But we used to have installed
time permissions, as opposed

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.090
to runtime permissions.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.940
And one of the reasons, not the
only, but one of the reasons

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.620
why we switched to
runtime permissions

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.622
is because we
realized most users,

00:09:17.622 --> 00:09:20.080
they are at the Play Store, or
they hit the Install button.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.190
And they're just going
to right away hit

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.418
the Accept all permissions,
because they're just

00:09:23.418 --> 00:09:24.460
trying to install an app.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.550
They're not really
thinking about--

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.080
FLORENCE ION: You should
be using the app, darn it.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.560
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.320
And like, why do I have to
decide now whether this app can

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.790
use my camera or not?

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.830
And it made a lot
more sense in context.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.710
When the user says,
yes, I want to use

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.200
a camera, that's when you
get the permission dialogue.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.950
And so these kinds of
things I think we're

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.390
learning as an industry, on
how to make it easier for users

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.130
to understand and interact.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.850
And I think developers
and the platform provider,

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:53.680
we need to continually
experiment and learn and try

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.585
to help users understand.

00:09:56.585 --> 00:09:58.210
This is what we do
for a living, right?

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.450
We think about technology.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.658
We build stuff.

00:10:00.658 --> 00:10:02.200
Most people, that's
not what they do.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.320
Most people are like,
a phone is a tool

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.240
to get on with their life.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.120
So they don't want to be
thinking about this stuff,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.990
right?

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.090
So how do we make it
easy for them, I think,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.050
is the key point.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.690
And sometimes, I think
sometimes we know too much.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.270
FLORENCE ION: It's also nice
to be able to go back and fix,

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.700
if you are rushing through
some dialog windows,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.442
to make sure that maybe the
camera is no longer accessible.

00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:25.900
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Right, exactly.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.130
FLORENCE ION: Or
your location, too,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.590
which is another big
feature of Android.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.290
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
No, that's great.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.415
Yeah, so those are exactly.

00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:32.110
Those are, as you
point out, those

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.550
are the screens
that we've added,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.130
so that you can go back and
audit and say, OK, what did I?

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.510
Who did I give permission to do?

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.140
What again?

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.517
And you can decide.

00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:41.100
Maybe that doesn't
make sense anymore.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.620
And at least,
there's transparency,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.810
and then there's controls.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.852
FLORENCE ION: Absolutely.

00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:47.600
So being that this is
a crowd of developers,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.250
and we have a lot
tuning in right now,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.540
what should they know about
these new privacy and security

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.212
features and about implementing
them into their apps?

00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:58.420
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: In terms
of technology, you mean?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.690
FLORENCE ION: Just in terms of
making it friendly for users

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.950
who are coming to Android.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.240
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
I think that's a key point.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.550
I mean, some of these
things are obvious, I think.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.620
But don't do things that
you don't need to do.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.460
A lot of times--

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.010
we do this at Google, too,
where we'll be like, well, maybe

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.630
eventually we'll
want this permission,

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.470
or maybe eventually we'll
want to be able to do this,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.080
or you asked for these
capability right.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.663
But if you're actually not going
to need it, don't ask for it.

00:11:22.663 --> 00:11:25.150
Because otherwise, the user
is going to be confused, too,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.658
and it's just unnecessary.

00:11:26.658 --> 00:11:29.200
So things like that, just being
really thoughtful and mindful

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.190
about what you're
trying to do, or trying

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.130
to scope as much as
possible the access

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.650
to the bare minimum of what you
need, I think, is important.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.330
Because people do
notice this stuff,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.240
and it is an important part
of how people, I think,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.700
also decide whether they want
to use an app, versus another.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.200
Yeah.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.610
FLORENCE ION: I like that
idea of mindful developing.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.310
I feel like that's
a good [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.060
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Just out of curiosity,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.050
how many in the crowd, how many
of you are Android developers?

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.240
Well, OK, most of you?

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.190
Web?

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.390
Yeah, a lot of you also.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.320
OK, other platforms?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.120
Yeah, well, a good mix.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.750
FLORENCE ION: Yeah,
that's a good mix.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:13.020
So you manage more
than just Android.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:18.250
You are also overseeing a Play,
and you're overseeing Chome OS.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.220
How do you try to keep
the ecosystems on track?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.290
Is there a shared
ethos or philosophy

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.560
that helps drive the
decisions that you all

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.770
are making as a team?

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.820
And how do you
ensure that you stick

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.850
to that philosophy or that
ethos with every new release

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.930
of Android.?

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.543
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
I think one of the--

00:12:37.543 --> 00:12:39.460
I'm going to make it
sound very dramatic-- one

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.090
of the key insights that we
have is that you all are busy,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.740
and you have a lot
of things to do,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.800
and you have your own
plans and own roadmaps

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.050
and own priorities and
maybe your own bosses.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.760
Maybe your own boss,
but you have bosses

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.300
who have other priorities.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.030
So the last thing
you want to deal with

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.310
is the platform
provider telling you

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.520
what your priorities should be.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.580
So we try to minimize
that as much as possible.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.280
Obviously, whenever
we change platforms,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.260
we realize we introduce
work for you--

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.390
opportunities, too.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.118
So there's a balance there.

00:13:09.118 --> 00:13:11.410
So that's one of the things
that we think about deeply.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:16.690
So keeping that in mind,
to answer your question,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.990
across Android and
Chrome OS, for instance,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.860
I see Play as being
one unifying ecosystem.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.610
You can run, as
many of you know,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.300
you can run Android apps
on many Chromebooks now.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.770
And that's going to continue.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.580
And that's a way for you
to have your investment,

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.030
like in this example,
in an Android app,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.790
be useful in the context
of a different form factor,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.400
even a different
platform, Chrome OS.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.340
And so we're sharing as
much technology as possible

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.160
and making it so that,
when you do your work,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.290
it is useful in as many surfaces
or in as many ways as possible.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.880
That's one of the key things.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.797
You're asking, how do
we think about all this?

00:13:56.797 --> 00:13:58.540
That's a key thing
we think about.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.710
We also focus a lot--

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.252
I was talking to
Steph the other day,

00:14:01.252 --> 00:14:04.520
and she was talking about how
it's really important for us--

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.630
and we're not always successful
in doing this, especially as

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.940
the industry evolves,
but as much as possible,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.930
to keep compatibility.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.710
So that APIs you rely
on today will still

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.082
be reliable two years from now.

00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:18.790
Obviously, sometimes
we're not able to do

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.748
that, especially with--

00:14:19.748 --> 00:14:22.495
SNS call log is a
perfect example.

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:24.370
But that's something
that's important for us,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.920
because we know that's
important for you, as well.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.290
And also just
having great tools--

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.780
you saw us investing in--

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.818
a lot of you are Android
developers, so the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:36.610
We're bringing Android
Studio to Chrome OS.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.230
We announced that
here and made it

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.838
really easy for people
to download these tools

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:41.380
and use them.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.610
So those are also areas that
we're investing a ton in.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.380
FLORENCE ION: So as
a platform, Android

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.500
has been very open
for a very long time.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.450
Do you feel like it's a delicate
balancing act to just getting

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.330
OEMs and others to adhere to
exactly what Android is trying

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.017
to do for mobile computing?

00:15:01.017 --> 00:15:02.350
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, it is.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.755
We have literally hundreds
and hundreds of OES.

00:15:04.755 --> 00:15:06.880
FLORENCE ION: Literally
hundreds and hundreds, yes.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.210
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yes, and
many hundreds and hundreds

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.800
of operators
throughout the world,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.690
and many, many, many developers,
you around the world, as well.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.042
So it's this melting
pot of a lot of--

00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:24.250
I mean, we're all interested
in the same thing, which

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.610
is being successful
in our businesses

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.002
and building creative,
innovative things

00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:31.210
and bringing it to consumers.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.740
I think that's what
we're all about,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.102
if I were to simplify it.

00:15:34.102 --> 00:15:36.310
But we all have different
motivations and different--

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.360
we play different roles.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.193
FLORENCE ION: Right.

00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:41.500
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: And so we
see, as a platform provider,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.740
we see our role as
being the party that

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.430
brings a lot of these
perspectives together.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.360
And sometimes they
don't always line up.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.820
And even, just in
the OEM space, if you

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.930
think about we work
closely with Samsung,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.770
we work closely with LG, we work
closely with the pixel team--

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.690
who, by the way,
we treat as a OEM.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.830
We treat them as just another
OEM alongside Samsung and LG.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.260
And you name how ever many
OEMs there are in the world,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.430
and they all compete with
each other, these OEMs.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.040
And so they share
their secrets with us,

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.310
and we're careful not to share
their secrets with anyone else,

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.750
because they're trusting us.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.240
And they have
different opinions.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.740
And so then it becomes our job
to try to figure out the best

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.308
way to navigate that.

00:16:25.308 --> 00:16:27.100
And I think that's the
same for developers,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.900
the same for operators.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.670
And so we spend a lot of--

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.645
I mentioned earlier,
when you asked me

00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:35.020
what my typical day is, and
I said, I spend a lot of time

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:35.603
with partners.

00:16:35.603 --> 00:16:38.380
That's part of the
reason, is to understand

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.270
everyone's
perspectives, understand

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.840
what's important for you and for
the operator and for the OEM,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.750
and try to bring it
together that way.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.410
It's fun.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:47.950
It's fun.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.492
Sundar sometimes
says, you're kind of

00:16:49.492 --> 00:16:50.760
like the United Nations.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.510
I've never worked with
the United Nations.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.450
I don't know what that's like.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.173
But I assume-- at least,
I don't know if he has.

00:16:55.173 --> 00:16:55.940
FLORENCE ION: I hear
it's a very hard job.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.440
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, but that's

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.080
what it seems like sometimes.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.107
But it's fun.

00:17:00.107 --> 00:17:01.690
FLORENCE ION: When
did you guys decide

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.589
that you were going to
you just make Android work

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.109
on foldable displays?

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.170
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
well that, again, that

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.099
came up because Samsung--

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.526
but Samsung wasn't the only one.

00:17:14.526 --> 00:17:17.109
There are many OEMs, some which
have been announced, some that

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.119
haven't been announced yet.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.577
FLORENCE ION: I mean, this was
going around for years, it's

00:17:20.577 --> 00:17:21.700
been, this idea.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.619
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, this
idea, and now it's possible.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:29.362
And so a lot of OEMs have
approached us over the years.

00:17:29.362 --> 00:17:31.570
Another example of this, if
you talk about foldables,

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.540
but now it seems like
all phones are like this.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.590
But just a few years ago, the
aspect ratio of most phones

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.960
were more sort of square.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.200
They became taller.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.910
They grew notches.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.010
Do you grow a notch, or
do you subtract a not--

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.780
I don't know what
direction a notch goes.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.380
But those are all things
that happened roughly

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.502
at the same time for
the whole industry,

00:17:52.502 --> 00:17:54.460
because that's just how
the supply chain works.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.190
These vendors who
build displays are

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.990
able to do this,
and then the OEMs,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.590
the manufacturers
buy these displays.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.350
So that's why they roughly
happen at the same time.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.310
And so foldables, I think,
will follow a similar pattern,

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.730
where these display technologies
are now there for OEMs

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.440
to adopt in their products.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.490
So in the case of foldables,
they approached us, saying,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.310
we want to do this.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.640
We think we can do it now.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.400
We're worried about
the ecosystem impact.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.740
By ecosystem here,
the OEMs were talking

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.532
about you, the developers.

00:18:25.532 --> 00:18:27.490
They wanted to make sure
this was easy for you.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.970
They wanted your apps to work
really well on their devices,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.215
hopefully with no work from you.

00:18:33.215 --> 00:18:35.590
That's always the hope, is
that you don't want developers

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.270
to have to do work.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.367
Because, again, you have
your own work to do.

00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:41.700
Why should you have to do
special work for someone else?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.080
That's how they think about it.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.830
And so we work really
closely together with them

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.920
on figuring out, how
can we use existing APIs

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.740
and make them work that way?

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.170
And by the way, just to go
back to one of your earlier

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.863
questions, there's
a nice benefit here,

00:18:57.863 --> 00:18:59.530
too, because a lot
of that work that you

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.330
may be doing for
foldables will be

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.433
useful for Chrome OS
your app on Chrome OS,

00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:06.100
because re-sizeable
apps and things like

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.140
that are very useful.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.140
So again, it's kind of a
two birds, three birds,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.130
one stone type of moment.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.130
That's what we live for.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:12.860
We like that.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.860
FLORENCE ION: I do want
to talk about Chrome OS.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.490
But before we go there, I want
to ask, what foldable phone are

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.972
you using these days?

00:19:20.972 --> 00:19:22.930
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: I
didn't bring it on stage,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.940
but I am using a Fold still.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.810
FLORENCE ION: OK.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.473
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: And I
was actually with some folks

00:19:28.473 --> 00:19:30.640
with the press, and they
were a little bit surprised

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.557
that I still have one.

00:19:31.557 --> 00:19:33.723
The reason why I still have
one is because, well, we

00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:34.870
work closely with Samsung.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:35.290
FLORENCE ION: You're testing it.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:35.620
You're working on it.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.078
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: I'm making
sure these APIs are working,

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:38.867
and so on.

00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:39.700
But it's really fun.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.840
Actually, I really like it.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.113
Let's set aside manufacturing
and et cetera for a second--

00:19:44.113 --> 00:19:46.280
FLORENCE ION: Yeah, let's
talk about folding phones.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.360
That's a new concept for us.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.330
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, it's
really interesting for me.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.640
I found that I'm much more
intentional about when I

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.530
use my phone, which surprised--

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.760
I didn't expect that.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.890
I thought foldable equals
more screens, bigger screens,

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.720
so I'm going to get
lost in my phone more.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.470
But it's actually had
the opposite effect,

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.715
because the display
on the outside,

00:20:09.715 --> 00:20:11.840
in the same case of the
Samsung device, the display

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.212
on the outside, I use it
mostly for quick triage,

00:20:15.212 --> 00:20:16.670
if someone sends
me a text message,

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.400
and I do need to quickly reply.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.070
Or maybe I'm dealing
with my notifications.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.917
But then, when I actually
want to use my phone,

00:20:24.917 --> 00:20:26.000
I'm much more intentional.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.070
Because I physically
open the thing up,

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.923
and so it's much less
that I accidentally,

00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:33.590
30 minutes later, I'm
still on my phone.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.040
It's much more intentional.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.260
And I actually like
that quite a bit.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.810
And I'm very
productive on it, too.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.030
It's getting a lot
of work done on that.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.125
Because the extra screen
size really does help.

00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:45.500
FLORENCE ION: Are you using
it with a Bluetooth keyboard?

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.240
Are you doing the
whole little [CLICK]??

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.000
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, just a
on-screen keyboard works great.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
FLORENCE ION: All right.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.292
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: So I'm
pretty bullish on foldables,

00:20:55.292 --> 00:20:57.610
in general, not talking
about any specific OEMs,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.730
but just in general.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.230
As a concept, I don't think
it's going to be a fad.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.890
It will take a few
years, obviously.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.500
A, they're very
expensive right now,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.453
and it's not yet available
commercially to buy yet.

00:21:11.453 --> 00:21:13.370
So it's going to take a
while for these things

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.590
to become more mainstream.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.260
But I think they will.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.948
Remember 3D TVs?

00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:21.990
You would go to a store--

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.740
FLORENCE ION: Yes.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.923
I remember the three
CESes of the 3D TVs.

00:21:24.923 --> 00:21:26.090
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Exactly.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.140
I don't think it's
going to be like that.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.557
I think it's going to actually
be a thing that a lot of us

00:21:29.557 --> 00:21:31.270
will be using.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.440
FLORENCE ION: Honestly,
I feel like everybody's

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.360
feeling the same way
about foldable phones,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.410
just this is a thing
that is going to happen,

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.700
and a lot of buzz around
it, a lot of people excited.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.750
I was surprised
by it, but I also

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.570
think it's interesting how
quickly Android adopted

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.060
the idea of the foldable
to make it say, well, this

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.882
is happening, so there you go.

00:21:48.882 --> 00:21:50.340
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
And by the way,

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.800
that is one of the benefits,
if I may, of Android.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.730
It's open source.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.440
You all know this.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.920
And so foldables
or anytime there's

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.880
a big disruption or a new
idea or a new technology,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.770
just the open source
nature of Android

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.590
and how manufacturers can
take it and modify it and do

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.390
what they want to it,
while remaining compatible,

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.880
is an advantage
for the platform.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.172
So that's why you're seeing
foldables first on Android.

00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:18.590
You're seeing 5G
first on Android.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.252
You saw 4G first on Android.

00:22:21.252 --> 00:22:23.210
We talked about it a
little bit at the keynote,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.370
a lot of firsts on Android.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.040
And that's not just bragging.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.290
It's just pointing
out the benefits

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.900
of how we've developed the
system and the ecosystem.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.360
Of course, that means a little
more burden in some ways,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.360
depending on how you look
at it, for developers.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.030
Because you're like, oh god,
there's yet another thing.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.920
But it's also an
opportunity for you

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.600
to be able to do
interesting things

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.700
for various different
types of devices.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.825
And it might unleash
new use cases for you.

00:22:49.825 --> 00:22:51.200
FLORENCE ION: It
seems like a lot

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.033
of the tools that are
offered for developers

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:55.220
are very thoughtful.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.990
Especially, I've noticed
a lot of things being,

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.550
not necessarily sequestered.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.640
But so many little
pieces make up

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.720
the OS now to just make it
easy to put in the right puzzle

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.510
piece when it needs to
be shined and cleaned,

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.532
to offer a metaphor.

00:23:12.532 --> 00:23:14.240
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, well mainline--

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.407
I don't know if you literally
mean it in this sense.

00:23:16.407 --> 00:23:19.100
But yeah, we're trying to
modulize the operating system

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.550
more.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:21.740
There are benefits.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.990
There are benefits from
a security standpoint,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.430
update-ability standpoint.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.405
Frankly, there's also
benefits just from--

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:29.280
sorry, this is a little
bit inside baseball--

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.280
but within the group.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.090
It's easier for us.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.950
If things are more
modular, it's just

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.760
like your code, modular code, is
easier to maintain and release,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.267
and so on.

00:23:38.267 --> 00:23:39.350
FLORENCE ION: Copy, paste.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.317
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
so there's benefits there.

00:23:42.317 --> 00:23:44.150
And so we're definitely
moving more and more

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.490
into that direction for sure.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.350
FLORENCE ION: All
right, switching gears,

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:53.130
you are a big user of Chrome
OS, and you are overseeing it.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.580
So Chrome OS has really
increased in popularity

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.810
in the last couple of years.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.440
And I personally see a lot
more of it out in the wilds.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.620
And I'm using it
daily to do my work.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.870
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Thank you.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.412
That's great.

00:24:04.412 --> 00:24:08.497
FLORENCE ION: Well, it helps
that it's being worked on.

00:24:08.497 --> 00:24:10.580
So can you talk a little
bit about the trajectory?

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.320
Because I mean,
people want to know,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.600
what is the future of
Chrome OS, and especially

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.088
about Chrome OS's
favorite color,

00:24:19.088 --> 00:24:20.130
which I heard is fuchsia?

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.770
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: That's yeah.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:25.550
Wow.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.360
You predicted this.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.000
By the way, Flo and I
were talking earlier,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.010
and I was like, what
are you going to ask me,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.968
like my favorite color?

00:24:30.968 --> 00:24:32.900
And she's like, as
long as it's fuchsia.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.310
So she's been trying to get
this in, and I guess, yeah.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.060
FLORENCE ION: Yes.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.600
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: So we can
talk about future in a second.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.960
Chrome OS, I'm very
excited about, actually.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.550
Of course, I'm
going to say that.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.990
But I genuinely--

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.840
I think Chrome OS
has a real shot,

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.730
just to step back for a second.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:55.445
I think it was developed
in the modern age.

00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:58.190
There are many other
computing systems

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.773
available for those
form factors, PCs.

00:25:01.773 --> 00:25:04.190
But I think Chrome OS had the
advantage of being developed

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.050
in a modern age-- again,
similar to Android,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.200
where we were able to learn
from some of the past.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.830
And so security is one of
the most important things,

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.950
and a lot of technology is built
into Chrome OS around that.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.410
The statelessness, the
stability, the speed,

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.940
the four Ss makes it a really
interesting operating system,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.670
I think, for the
future of computing.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.350
And so we're investing
a lot in Chrome OS.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.730
I think we have a real shot.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.230
Commercially, it's
been doing great.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.605
You said, you know you're
starting to see a lot of people

00:25:35.605 --> 00:25:36.620
use Chrome OS.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.100
I see that too, which I'm
super excited to see that.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.950
The PC industry has
been generally flat.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.660
Chrome OS has been
growing like crazy.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.252
In Q4 of 2018 in the US,
we were a little over 20%.

00:25:49.252 --> 00:25:50.960
FLORENCE ION: I remember
that stat, yeah.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.850
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
And so we're growing.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.240
We're growing significantly.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.710
And by bringing the Play
Store-- and there's also,

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.110
if you're a web developer,
obviously, PWAs,

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.830
and we have a lot of ideas on
how we can make web apps feel

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.430
like native apps, whatever
that means, on Chrome OS,

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.460
as well-- so the
best of both worlds,

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.130
with the goal of making
this something that people

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.792
can use every day as their main
and maybe even only-- like,

00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:17.500
that's what I do.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.370
I use a Chromebook--

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.830
I use a Pixel Slate,
for what it's worth--

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.935
every day as my
primary and only PC.

00:26:24.935 --> 00:26:26.810
And then, of course, I
have my Android phones

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.660
with me for the
mobile scenarios.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.260
And I think a lot of people,
a lot of you especially,

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.920
should be able to
do that already.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.795
And we want pretty much
everyone in the world

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:38.550
to be able to do that, as well.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.640
So developer support,
your support of Chrome OS,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.270
is really, really important.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.750
Like I said, it's
a growing segment,

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.322
so really interesting stuff.

00:26:46.322 --> 00:26:48.530
And I think we can do some
pretty interesting things.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:54.190
I feel like the
difference between--

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.960
remember when tablets
first came out,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.055
everyone predicted
the death of a PC?

00:26:58.055 --> 00:26:59.858
They were like, well,
PCs are going away.

00:26:59.858 --> 00:27:01.150
Tablets are going to take over.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.490
But that really hasn't happened.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:08.170
Tablets are popular, too, but
PCs are still around, too.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.690
So it wasn't a mutually
exclusive thing.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.540
And so I think PCs
are going to continue

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.180
to be important
in people's lives,

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.430
and I feel like we can do
some very interesting things

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:23.890
around blending touch and
traditional PCs, [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.220
keyboards, detachable
devices, new experiences.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.190
And so you're starting to see
us dabble in that a little bit,

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.980
and we'll continue
to invest there.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.230
FLORENCE ION: There's a lot
of little usability tweaks

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.670
that you can really
take off from there.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:38.962
So back to this Fuchsia thing--

00:27:38.962 --> 00:27:40.712
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:27:40.712 --> 00:27:41.580
I forgot about it.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.540
Yes.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.540
FLORENCE ION: Can you
tell us anything about it?

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.832
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, sure.

00:27:45.832 --> 00:27:48.700
FLORENCE ION: What's
the ethos behind it?

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.453
What do we have to look forward
to as users of these platforms?

00:27:51.453 --> 00:27:52.870
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Good question.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.750
So Fuchsia, for those of you--

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.500
there might be one
person in this room who

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.760
doesn't know what Fuchsia is.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.263
Has everyone heard of Fuchsia?

00:27:59.263 --> 00:28:00.430
Who hasn't heard of Fuchsia?

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.410
Don't be embarrassed
if you haven't.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.118
OK, a few people.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.630
Google has many
projects underway,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.880
and we're a technology
company, so we

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.170
invest in various technologies
and experiment, and so on.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.550
And some of those
experiments and investments

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.190
we do in the public
as an open source

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.660
or as open source projects.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.720
Fuchsia is one of them.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.180
So it's an open source
project by Google,

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:28.210
and it's an investment by us
in modernizing and trying out

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.420
new concepts around
operating systems.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.265
So naturally, a lot
of people assume,

00:28:36.265 --> 00:28:37.900
well, it's a new OS
from Google, so it

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.570
must be the future of
the one OS from Google.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.040
But that's not
how we look at it.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.650
We look at it as a place where
we can try out new ideas.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.102
And so whenever you
see someone saying,

00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:50.560
oh, here's a phone
running Fuchsia,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.360
that's really not our goal.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.780
It's not about replacing
Android or replacing Chrome OS.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.580
It is about learning
new technologies.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.590
And maybe Fuchsia
can be launched

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.977
on certain form factors,
different form factors.

00:29:01.977 --> 00:29:04.560
There are all kinds of devices
that require operating systems.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.590
It's not just phones and PCs.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.070
And in the world of IoT,
there are an increasing number

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.200
of devices that require
operating systems

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.090
and new runtimes, and so on.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.000
So I think there's a lot of
room for multiple operating

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.120
systems with different
strengths and specialization.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.880
So Fuchsia is one
of those things.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.722
And so stay tuned.

00:29:21.722 --> 00:29:22.930
We'll continue working on it.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.708
And we enjoy that you
love the intrigue in it,

00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:27.250
but there's really
not much intrigue.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.470
It's just more [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.140
FLORENCE ION: Intrigue makes
being a user of these things

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.780
fun, because it's much safer
than other types of gossip,

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.570
in some cases.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.110
So back to Chrome OS
just as a platform,

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.940
are we seeing it go more the
way of the Mac and Windows

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.580
in terms of usability
and compatibility

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.788
and just like what it can do?

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.330
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, we're going

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.080
to be better than those things.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.210
No, honestly, I think
this is what I'm saying.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.870
I really do think
Chrome OS has a lot

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.020
of the guts of being the
future of the next generation

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.702
of computing.

00:30:02.702 --> 00:30:03.910
We need your support, though.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.457
We need the use cases,
and we need that.

00:30:06.457 --> 00:30:07.540
I think you all know this.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.260
People don't buy products
for the operating system.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.190
But much as an operating
system provider,

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.650
I want to think that way, the
reality is people buy devices

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.150
and products,
because of what they

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.700
can do with it, which is where
you come into the picture.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.070
And so I think, with the
right set of applications,

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.130
it really has the ability
to be the next generation

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.660
of this touch and
keyboard-melded experience,

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.640
with new types of form
factors, whether they're

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.450
detachables or other things
that haven't been invented yet.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.835
So yeah, I think it is.

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:41.290
FLORENCE ION: Or third
party operating system.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.590
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: What
do you mean third party?

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:47.360
FLORENCE ION: Well, oh,
OK, so we have Linux apps.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.770
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Oh, I
see, I see, got it, got it.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.700
Yeah, no, for sure,
running Linux,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.877
I mean, Android Studio is a--

00:30:53.877 --> 00:30:55.460
the way we're deploying
Android Studio

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.627
is a perfect example, right?

00:30:56.627 --> 00:31:00.200
It's running in a
Linux container.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.760
I guess from Chrome
OS perspective,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.430
Android is another operating
system in a way, right?

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.280
So it supports many runtimes.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.105
The web is one runtime
and I would say,

00:31:10.105 --> 00:31:11.480
the primary runtime,
where that's

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.920
what Chrome OS started from--

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.878
FLORENCE ION: That's a
really good point, yeah.

00:31:14.878 --> 00:31:16.910
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: --runs
the Android Runtime,

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:17.900
the Linux Runtime.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.608
And maybe there are
others in the future.

00:31:19.608 --> 00:31:22.727
As the world evolves, we'll
make sure we can support those.

00:31:22.727 --> 00:31:24.560
FLORENCE ION: How do
you balance making sure

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.980
that you can support those
things compared to what

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.040
is possible with the
hardware that's available,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.670
like processors and
that sort of thing?

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.670
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah,
we work really closely

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.410
with the industry on this.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.030
We have reference
designs, where we

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.880
work with chip providers,
chipset providers, and then

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.020
OEMs.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.870
And so we're involved in the
road-mapping of these products.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.950
So we make sure that the
hardware and the software

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.540
match, capability-wise.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.540
FLORENCE ION: All right.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.970
We have time for just a
couple more questions.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.960
So I think if we want to
just chat a little bit

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.180
about that thing
you said earlier,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:08.810
about the Play Store being this
unifying link between Android

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.257
and Chrome OS--

00:32:12.257 --> 00:32:14.590
can you speak to that just a
little bit more, just about

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.670
like the vision for that, how
to make it more than just--

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.178
because I think a lot
of users, in particular,

00:32:20.178 --> 00:32:21.970
see it as just like,
this is the app store.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.585
This is store where
I get my apps.

00:32:24.585 --> 00:32:25.960
But how do you
want to explain it

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.840
to the people who see it more
than just this is where I get

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.477
the apps for my Google stuff?

00:32:31.477 --> 00:32:34.060
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, well,
I think a lot of people today,

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.397
if you were to ask the
people not in the industry,

00:32:37.397 --> 00:32:38.980
they would say the
Play Store is where

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.620
you get your Android apps.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.500
And this is where
the connective part--

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.040
we want the Play Store and the
Android Runtime, if you will,

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.470
to be something that you think
of crossing multiple form

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.970
factors.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.310
Again, we're talking about
Chrome OS in that context.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.680
So it's the unifying layer.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.980
And what unifies it is these
APIs, the console, the tools,

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.470
the policies, all these things.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.720
And this is where we talked
a little bit about privacy

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.100
earlier.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.210
that comes into the
picture, as well.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.740
Internally, my group
is known as-- well,

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.800
you can see it on the slide--
platforms and ecosystems.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.680
That's how we
think of ourselves.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.490
We pride platforms
and ecosystems,

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.400
and Play is the main ecosystem.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.570
FLORENCE ION: Right.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.400
So to round off our
conversation here,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.250
in the spirit of it
being Google I/O, what

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.190
was one of your
favorite announcements

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:36.880
that was made this week, just
your personal favorite, maybe

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.070
something you were
really excited for people

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.985
to hear about, or just something
you're particularly proud of?

00:33:42.985 --> 00:33:45.130
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Well, a number of things,

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.338
I'm not going to cheat and
give you multiple answers.

00:33:47.338 --> 00:33:49.615
FLORENCE ION: OK, no problem.

00:33:49.615 --> 00:33:52.240
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: I do think--
you mentioned that the privacy

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.742
topic is an important one.

00:33:53.742 --> 00:33:55.700
And I think, especially
for you as a developer,

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.610
it's important that we
stay in sync on this

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.000
and that we understand
each other well on this

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.420
and the motivations behind it.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.910
We want to make sure
that we're adapting

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.213
to the modern way in which
people think about privacy,

00:34:06.213 --> 00:34:07.630
consumers think
of it, and we want

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.750
to make sure we're adapting to
that technologically together.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.364
So I think that's
an important part.

00:34:12.364 --> 00:34:13.989
There have been many
sessions about it,

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:15.531
and we talk about
it at the keynotes.

00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:18.340
Sundar talked about it
general terms, as well.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.230
So that's, I think,
an important part.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.145
I also think--

00:34:21.145 --> 00:34:23.980
I was talking to someone
about this earlier.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.760
A lot of the work that we're
doing that has a positive

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.070
impact on people's lives--
around accessibility,

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:30.898
for instance--

00:34:30.898 --> 00:34:31.940
I'm really proud of that.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.460
I think that to be able--

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.570
FLORENCE ION: Live
Captions is going to be--

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.290
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yeah, Live Caption's

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.150
a great example, right?

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.550
And I think that, Live
Captions, or there

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:44.302
was that video we showed of that
mother in India who now can--

00:34:44.302 --> 00:34:45.010
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:48.190
And so I think
these are really--

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.820
I know it's going
to sound corny,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.120
but it makes me feel
really proud that we're

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.659
able to be a part of
creating that sort of thing.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.240
And many of you do that, too,
through your applications

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.470
and through your innovations.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:00.790
You're helping people.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.010
And I think having
that sense of purpose,

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.560
I think, makes it
really important

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.080
and makes me feel
like we're working

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.705
on important stuff,
which is fun.

00:35:09.705 --> 00:35:11.080
It's always easy
to get caught up

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.420
in, like, how many
gigabytes, or how many what?

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.480
How many lines of code?

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.120
But really just stepping
back and thinking, like, OK,

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.980
we've helped people
accomplish something--

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.217
that's really important.

00:35:21.217 --> 00:35:23.050
FLORENCE ION: I would
say, at the same rate,

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.810
the technical achievement of
being able to whittle down

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:30.880
2 gigs of data into just
merely kilobytes and files is

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.570
really neat.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.520
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
Yes, the language model?

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.820
Yeah, that's very cool, yeah.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.290
FLORENCE ION: Did that have
anything to do, by the way,

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:35.998
with Now Playing?

00:35:35.998 --> 00:35:37.590
Was that derived from that?

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.210
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
No, I don't think.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.260
FLORENCE ION: It
sounded similar to me.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.052
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER:
It's similar in concept

00:35:41.052 --> 00:35:42.910
in that they're both on device.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.403
These models are on device, so
it's not leaving the device--

00:35:46.403 --> 00:35:47.320
similar in that sense.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.987
But yes, they're very
different domains.

00:35:48.987 --> 00:35:52.560
And that one's music,
and one's words--

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.532
but yeah, very similar
concept in that sense.

00:35:54.532 --> 00:35:55.990
FLORENCE ION: All
right, we're just

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:01.040
about nearing the end here,
so I feel like, you know what?

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.240
It's the last day.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.870
Let's be a little
philosophical and dreamy.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:11.460
So look into your crystal ball
for Android and the platforms

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.210
that you manage.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.690
What are you just really looking
forward to in the future,

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.310
beyond a little beta that
we have going on right now?

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.410
HIROSHI LOCKHEIMER: Yeah, I
think it's rewind a little bit,

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:22.910
right?

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.160
If we think back to even just
five years ago, or maybe even

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.890
less, we're doing so many
things on our devices,

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.410
whether they're
phones or laptops

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.480
or whatever, home devices.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.670
We're doing things
on these devices

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.100
that really, we couldn't do
before, where we would talk

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.750
about it in the abstract,
like, wouldn't it

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.958
be cool if you could do this?

00:36:40.958 --> 00:36:43.600
Well, we can now do a
lot of these things.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.480
And so I'm excited
about the future

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.880
in terms of just not
even knowing where

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.350
these things are going to head.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.360
There's just so
many opportunities,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.370
and we have, I think,
the right foundations

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.620
in place, the right
security and privacy

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:59.130
mindset, the right mindset
around helping users,

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.060
and all that.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.510
With that in mind, how to
evolve technology together,

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.940
with the OEMs, with
you as developers,

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.040
with the network providers--

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.150
a lot of possibilities,
that gets me really excited.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.350
