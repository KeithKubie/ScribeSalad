00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.233
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:03.233
Welcome to another amazing day at Google.

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:04.767
Today is particularly amazing

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:09.233
since we have Jake here
for a Musicians@Google performance.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:13.867
It's our pleasure to introduce
Jake Shimabukuro to be here at Google

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.300
to share his love for life,
his love for the ukulele,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.867
and his love for traditional Hawaiian culture.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:25.166
With a very "Google-y" mantra of peace,
love and ukulele,

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.200
Jake has taken ukulele to new
heights throughout the world,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.100
from his beloved rendition of
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps, "

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.333
which really was my first
introduction to his work,

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.367
to his self-composed virtuosic Toastman

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:42.567
and everything else that's on his recorded works.

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:45.333
He's an ambassador of Hawaiian
culture.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:49.834
He's actually shared his love for the ukulele
with everyone from the Queen of England

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:54.900
to legions of Parrot Heads, such as myself
as a member of the Coral Reefer Band,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.367
and that's not to mention his big role at YouTube
where he has popularized the ukulele.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.266
And also, you know, just really touched
the lives of millions of people

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.934
that have seen his YouTube videos.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.233
He has an enthusiasm for life
and music that is really unparalleled

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.467
and that's why we're particularly honored
to have him here at Google today.

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:19.567
So he'll be speaking to us today about his life,

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.133
his work, and his music.

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:24.133
And as he says,
music is good medicine.

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.467
So ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:26.834
Mr. Jake Shimabukuro.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.867

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:31.934
Jake Shimabukuro: Thank you, Cliff.

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.700
[Applause]

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.734
Well, thank you so much.

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:36.934
You know, as I said earlier,

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.200
I'm just ecstatic to be here today.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.567
This is really great.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.533
Just to give you a little bit of background,

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:47.767
you know, myself, I was born
and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii.

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:50.600
And I started playing the ukulele
when I was four years old.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.400
And my mom played and so
she was my first teacher.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.066
And from the moment that
she first put it in my hands,

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.734
I mean, I immediately fell in love
with this instrument.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:02.166
You know, just something about
the sound of it.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:05.033
You know, because of the high range
of the instrument,

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:12.033
you know, it's -- it always kind of --
it's very similar to like a child's voice,

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:15.867
you know, and I think that this instrument
kind of makes people feel like,

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:16.900
feel like a kid again.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.266
It's just one of those things,
and it's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.166
And I'm always, you know,

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.600
one of the things that
I truly believe is that, you know,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.200
the ukulele is really the instrumen of peace

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.500
because if everyone played the ukulele
I think this world would be a happier place.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.767
So I hope to share some of
my happiness with you today.

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.400
So I'm going to start off with a little song here.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400
This is a tune called "143."

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.667
It's a new tune that I just --
I just composed.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:51.934
And I thought it would be
appropriate to kind of open this up

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:55.233
because I remember when I was --
when I was in school,

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:59.066
you know, we didn't have cell phones
or the Internet or anything like that.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:03.500
You know, it was just -- if you were cool,
you had a pager, you know?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.266
[Laughter]

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.066
And so there was no text messaging back then.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:10.066
So I remember we would have these numeric codes

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:13.300
and 1-4-3 was the numeric code
for "I love you"

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.333
and so if you had your girlfriend or your
boyfriend or whatever you would text them

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:19.066
or send them the page 1-4-3,

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.433
so this is a song about that.

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:22.767

Jake Shimabukuro: Thank you very much.

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:44.133
So, when I first started playing the ukulele,
growing up in Hawaii,

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:45.567
it was a lot of traditional
Hawaiian music,

00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:47.834
so I started out playing things
like

But with three chords,
with those simple three chords,

00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:58.433
you can play over 300 traditional Hawaiian tunes.

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:01.300
So it kept me busy for a long time.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.567
But, of course, then when I was a teenager,

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:05.600
you know, I started listening
to different styles of music

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.100
and then those three chords became things like

"Oh, this is so cool."

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:17.467
I was like, wow, I can listen
to all different kinds of,

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:21.667
you know, instruments and try to
mimic like guitar players

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.400
and pianists and horn players
and all those things.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.567
And I could find these melodies
and try to play them on the ukulele.

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:32.166
So I started, you know,
experimenting with different styles.

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:35.133
And this next song was kind of
what happened

00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:38.967
when I stumbled on to
Carlos Montoya record, you know,

00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:41.433
who was a master Flamenco guitar player.

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:45.667
So here is a Flamenco ukulele piece for you.

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:51.000
And this is an original composition
entitled "Let's Dance."

So this next tune that I like
to perform is a song

00:14:49.767 --> 00:14:52.600
about growing up in Hawaii and being a kid.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.266
And one of my favorite --

00:14:55.266 --> 00:15:00.100
one of my favorite drinks as a child was
a good old Shirley Temple, you know.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.266
And I'd drink, like,

I'd always be -- I'd always have that.

There's a lot of sugar in a Shirley Temple.
I was one of those, you know,

00:15:10.767 --> 00:15:14.066
and I'd drive my parents crazy sometimes.

drinking one too many Shirley Temples.

you know, music is all about
communicating just pure emotion.

enjoy performing is because,

you know, you connect with people
on a level that,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.900

whose grandmother was very ill.

She was in the hospital.

00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:27.667
And while she was in the hospital,
she was under a lot of medication.

00:20:27.667 --> 00:20:34.333
And she would have these hallucinations
of blue roses on the ceiling above her bed.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:38.633
And at night she'd see the
petals fall on top of her.

00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:41.033
And when she shared this with me, you know,

00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:44.133
I thought it was such a beautiful vision

00:20:44.133 --> 00:20:46.900

a song that was completely

composed to --
for a certain instrument.

00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:22.834
And this is a Japanese folk tune
that is usually --

00:26:22.834 --> 00:26:25.300
well, it was normally played on the
koto,

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.967
which is a 13-stringed instrument that sits on
the floor and you play it with these finger picks.

00:26:29.967 --> 00:26:33.800
And it has the most incredible sound,
you know.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.100
And I remember hearing this instrument
while I was in Japan

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.834
and I was just completely blown away.

00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:44.000
It just took me to another place, you know.

when I went back home to Hawaii,

season in Japan.

This next tune, um, is a song.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.800
You know, a few years ago
my dad told me, he said,

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:15.567
"You write all these songs but how come
you never wrote a song for me, you know?"

00:31:15.567 --> 00:31:17.967

But it was -- it's a song,

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.066
cause I remember
when I was a kid and my dad would --

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:31.667
he had this green pickup truck
and for some reason,

00:31:31.667 --> 00:31:34.233
he was always low on gasoline,
you know.

00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:38.367
So as soon as we got in his truck the first
stop was always the nearest gas station.

00:31:38.367 --> 00:31:40.233
And I remember when we would pull in,

00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:44.533
the attendant would come to the car
and my dad would say, "$5 unleaded."

00:31:44.533 --> 00:31:47.000
You know, and I just thought oh,
that's so cool, you know.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.934
So this song is about those times
when we'd go to the gas station

00:31:52.934 --> 00:31:55.900
and I wrote the piece --
I wrote this song in three parts.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.100
The first part reflects all the emotions
that you feel

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.233
when you're driving around
on a full tank of gasoline.

00:32:02.233 --> 00:32:05.166
So it's very bouncy, upbeat, and happy.

00:32:05.166 --> 00:32:07.567
And the second part is everything that --

00:32:07.567 --> 00:32:11.533
is everything you feel
when that fuel light starts to flash.

00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:12.500
The music changes a bit,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.767
you get a little stressed out and worried
looking for that nearest gas station.

00:32:16.767 --> 00:32:20.133
And then the third part is when you, um,

00:32:20.133 --> 00:32:22.467
you actually find the gas station.

00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:25.000
And you pull in and then you stop, right?

00:44:31.734 --> 00:44:35.133
because here you have

in the digital age and,

you guys are so much on this end of the spectrum,
you know, just leading the way.

00:44:47.934 --> 00:44:49.667
And the ukulele is kind of like
on the complete opposite of the

00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:51.100
spectrum,

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:51.800
you know,

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.333
it's kind of like -- it's the
most simple of all instruments.

00:44:55.333 --> 00:44:59.633
And it's the most humble and
it's so -- I don't know.

00:44:59.633 --> 00:45:02.734
It's just there's something
really magical about it.

00:45:02.734 --> 00:45:07.033
It's the only instrument that you can just mention
the name to someone and they'll smile.

00:45:07.033 --> 00:45:10.333
Like sometimes I travel and I'll be sitting
at the airport with my case

00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:11.567
and someone will come up to me,

00:45:11.567 --> 00:45:14.567
hey, what's in the case and they're expecting me to say violin or something

00:45:14.567 --> 00:45:17.367
but I'll be like "Oh no, it's a ukulele."

00:45:17.367 --> 00:45:19.667
And they would be like
"Oh, it's a ukulele?

00:45:19.667 --> 00:45:22.500
Wow, you play the u-ka-lay-lee"?
You know,

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.066
but what other instrument would
provoke that, right?

00:45:26.066 --> 00:45:27.934
And so,

00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:30.734
there's something really special
and magical about it

00:45:30.734 --> 00:45:32.233

00:45:32.233 --> 00:45:34.700

00:46:16.266 --> 00:46:18.100
&gt;&gt; Hi Jake, thank you.
That was outstanding.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:23.734
How do you structure your
practice time when you're --

00:46:23.734 --> 00:46:25.734
I imagine you're kind of mature
in your craft now,

00:46:25.734 --> 00:46:31.033
but how is that -- how is your practice
time different than it was growing up?

00:46:31.033 --> 00:46:34.000
And then how -- how do you
structure like songwriting

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.467
versus skill maintenance, et cetera,

00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:37.433
while you're practicing?

00:46:38.133 --> 00:46:41.367
Jake Shimabukuro: Yeah, well, when I was--
when I was growing up, you know,

00:46:41.367 --> 00:46:46.734
I never--
it was really no such thing as,

00:46:46.734 --> 00:46:49.967
you know, oh, you better practice your ukulele,
you better practice ukulele.

00:46:49.967 --> 00:46:52.800
Growing up, you know, people
are always you always hear like--

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.734
I got to practice piano.
I got to practice violin.

00:46:55.734 --> 00:46:58.800
That's -- those were considered
serious instruments

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.000
where you need to spend time practicing.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
But the ukulele was definitely
not one of those instruments.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.767
I mean it was, you know,
it was like if you play the ukulele,

00:47:06.767 --> 00:47:07.934
it was just more of a fun thing.

00:47:07.934 --> 00:47:10.166
It was like playing video games
or something.

00:47:10.166 --> 00:47:12.900
That's -- that's how I looked at it.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:19.300
And a lot of times my parents would
have to take the instrument away from me

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.500
so that I would eat dinner or I would,
you know,

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.767
go do my homework
or clean my room.

00:47:24.767 --> 00:47:29.433
Because they -- I never wanted to --
I could never put it down, really.

00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:31.333
So I never thought of it as practice.

00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:32.700
To me, growing up it was never,

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.266
oh, I better put in my three hours
of ukulele practice or four hours

00:47:36.266 --> 00:47:37.400
or whatever it was.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.834
It was just every time would
I come home from school,

00:47:39.834 --> 00:47:41.266
I would pick it up and I would play,

00:47:41.266 --> 00:47:43.967
do some homework and pick it up
and play, after I shower,

00:47:43.967 --> 00:47:45.400
pick it up and play.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.166
You know, I just absolutely loved it.

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:53.066
So it was -- now looking back,

00:47:53.066 --> 00:47:54.500
I realize that that was --

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.900
that's I was so passionate
about that instrument.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.433
And I never wanted to play anything else.

00:47:58.433 --> 00:48:01.066
Most people start out with the ukulele
but after that,

00:48:01.066 --> 00:48:05.033
they want to move on to the guitar
or another instrument

00:48:05.033 --> 00:48:07.700
where they can -- they can play
different styles of music.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.500
But the ukulele for some reason,

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.133
I just fell in love with it.

00:48:11.133 --> 00:48:13.600
And I fell in love with the limitations
of the instrument

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.834
because I never saw the limitations
as something that would hold me back.

00:48:17.834 --> 00:48:20.834
I always -- I always believe that,

00:48:20.834 --> 00:48:25.400
you know,
the -- the instrument is what it is.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.700
It's -- it's beautiful just the way it is.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.667
And I think it's, it's, you know,
is the people who pick it up,

00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:36.000
we're the ones that put
limitations on the instrument.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.934
The instruments aren't limited
by themselves

00:48:38.934 --> 00:48:43.033
and a lot of times we just have to look
to ourselves to use your imaginations

00:48:43.033 --> 00:48:44.767
and expand on other ways.

00:48:44.767 --> 00:48:48.333
And the way that I see the ukulele is because

00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:51.767
you know it has such a small range
and it's only four strings,

00:48:51.767 --> 00:48:55.633
I find a lot of power in that, you know,
because then it challenges me to--

00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:58.667
to really, um,

00:48:58.667 --> 00:49:01.133
to really expand on the other,

00:49:01.133 --> 00:49:02.834
the other aspects of music.

00:49:02.834 --> 00:49:04.300
You know, if you play the piano,

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:09.433
there's so many notes that you can pretty
much cover whatever you want to cover.

00:49:09.433 --> 00:49:12.767
But it's like the way I like to think of it is,

00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:14.567
you know, you have all your senses
but like,

00:49:14.567 --> 00:49:18.333
for example, like someone who is blind,
someone who is visually impaired,

00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:22.667
you know, their sense of hearing,
their sense of touch, smell,

00:49:22.667 --> 00:49:27.266
becomes so incredible because
they're not relying on their vision anymore.

00:49:27.266 --> 00:49:30.200
So it's like with the ukulele
I can't rely on its range

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.767
because it doesn't have the kind
of range that --

00:49:32.767 --> 00:49:35.233
that a piano or any other instrument
would have.

00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:36.367
So in that sense,

00:49:36.367 --> 00:49:39.500
now I have to take advantage of
the other aspects of music:

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.900
Tone color, timbre,
you know, dynamics.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.233
You know, all these rhythmic things,

00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:49.200
chord voicings and expanding on
harmonies and things like that.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.967
So for me a lot of the practice
that I would put into

00:49:52.967 --> 00:49:55.467
wasn't just so much sitting
with the instrument and playing,

00:49:55.467 --> 00:49:58.567
but was just kind of
experiencing life, you know,

00:49:58.567 --> 00:50:01.433
just kind of going out and seeing things and --

00:50:01.433 --> 00:50:06.200
and trying different things, you know.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.467
All of that, that's --
whenever I pick up the ukulele,

00:50:08.467 --> 00:50:09.734
that's what I'm playing.

00:50:09.734 --> 00:50:10.667
That's what I'm doing.

00:50:10.667 --> 00:50:13.767
And when I'm composing songs,

00:50:13.767 --> 00:50:18.000
a lot of times I'll just focus
on a specific moment in my life

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.734
and how I felt and then I try to --

00:50:20.734 --> 00:50:24.800
I try to, um, you know, express
that through the ukulele.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.433
So for me, practice time is 24 hours a day.

00:50:28.433 --> 00:50:29.967
It's when I'm sleeping.

00:50:29.967 --> 00:50:31.734
It's when I'm having lunch.

00:50:31.734 --> 00:50:33.233
It's, you know, visits like these,

00:50:33.233 --> 00:50:36.200
surrounding myself with --

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.467
in a room full of geniuses
and just being inspired.

00:50:39.467 --> 00:50:41.800
That's really what it's all about.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.800
And I think for me the, you know, as far as
like practicing all the technical stuff,

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.233
what I do instead of just
sitting in front of the --

00:50:49.233 --> 00:50:52.734
instead of just sitting in my room and
practicing one technique over and over

00:50:52.734 --> 00:50:55.567
what I do -- because that's --
that's meaningless.

00:50:55.567 --> 00:50:57.800
If you just sit there and you
practice right-hand tapping,

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.200
you just -- over and over,
then it's like so what?

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.133
Okay, you can do that,

00:51:02.133 --> 00:51:05.467
but what I would do is
I would take one technique

00:51:05.467 --> 00:51:09.500
and I would just write a song
around that one technique.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.367
So that way I'm not just practicing
the technique,

00:51:12.367 --> 00:51:15.567
but by practicing a song and playing the song,

00:51:15.567 --> 00:51:18.333
you know, essentially I'm mastering
that one technique.

00:51:18.333 --> 00:51:21.433
So if I'm playing a Flamenco
piece and I'm doing these things,

00:51:21.433 --> 00:51:23.467
these Flamenco strums, and all that,

00:51:23.467 --> 00:51:25.100
I won't do that in any other song,

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.166
I'll keep it specific for that song.

00:51:27.166 --> 00:51:28.734
So that becomes my song.

00:51:28.734 --> 00:51:31.166
You know, if I'm doing a tapping tune
that becomes that song.

00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:34.767
Or if I'm doing a crazy banjo-like
bluegrass-y thing

00:51:34.767 --> 00:51:36.967
that just becomes for that song,

00:51:36.967 --> 00:51:39.633
all the techniques that I use is
just for that song.

00:51:39.633 --> 00:51:44.100
So -- and I think that that
really helped me to focus on --

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:49.400
that really helped me to keep each song
a little bit unique.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.667
Because with instrumental music,
it's so difficult.

00:51:51.667 --> 00:51:53.834
They all pretty much sound the same,

00:51:53.834 --> 00:51:57.767
you know, after awhile and especially
with the ukulele my goal was

00:51:57.767 --> 00:52:02.033
always to make every, every song sound different.

00:52:02.033 --> 00:52:03.700
Because I didn't have a vocalist,

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.800
I'm a horrible singer,

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.800
so that's why I would have to do
a lot of instrumental music.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.500
Thank you.

00:52:10.867 --> 00:52:12.066
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:17.433
First of all, I think you're God's
gift to music, at least to me.

00:52:17.433 --> 00:52:22.567
[Applause]

00:52:22.567 --> 00:52:25.233
And I just had a couple of
questions about -- did you ever

00:52:25.233 --> 00:52:28.500
get formal training in music?

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.500
Just that your form and your melodies
sound so intricate,

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.934
did you ever go to formal music school?

00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:38.500
And do you ever experiment with
your instrument as with effects

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.667
and all those fancy things?

00:52:40.667 --> 00:52:41.300
Thank you.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.700
Jake Shimabukuro: Yeah, well,
thank you very much first of all.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.500
Thank you.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.867
You know, I started out just playing by ear and just having fun with the

00:52:48.867 --> 00:52:50.467
ukulele.

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:57.633
And then later on when I was a teenager,
someone turned me on to music theory,

00:52:57.633 --> 00:53:00.934
and I was like music theory,
what is that?

00:53:00.934 --> 00:53:03.367
And then, that's when I just started,

00:53:03.367 --> 00:53:07.233
you know, I started buying these books
and just reading about notes

00:53:07.233 --> 00:53:11.600
and reading about like when you see
like a C7 chord -- what is the 7?

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.166
What does the 7 mean?

00:53:13.166 --> 00:53:15.800
Why do we have these numbers in chords?

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.767
So then I got turned on to music theory
and then I became really obsessed with it.

00:53:19.767 --> 00:53:25.500
I started -- it was my --
see normally, when people --

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:30.333
I think when most students of music
begin their journey,

00:53:30.333 --> 00:53:32.333
they start off reading music, right?

00:53:32.333 --> 00:53:33.667
They start off reading music,

00:53:33.667 --> 00:53:36.233
they learn all the proper way to
hold their instruments,

00:53:36.233 --> 00:53:37.667
they learn -- traditionally,

00:53:37.667 --> 00:53:42.533
there is a sequence of things that
you learn to get to where you want to,

00:53:42.533 --> 00:53:43.900
where you want to do.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.867
But the interesting thing I
think for me,

00:53:46.867 --> 00:53:49.166
is starting with the ukulele,

00:53:49.166 --> 00:53:52.433
I really started backwards.

00:53:52.433 --> 00:53:56.266
I really started --
when I first started playing,

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:57.100
people would tell me okay,

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.700
put your fingers here and strum that.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.867
Now, the next chord,

00:54:00.867 --> 00:54:04.233
put your finger here and just do
this and I would be like okay.

00:54:04.233 --> 00:54:05.233
And it was fun.

00:54:05.233 --> 00:54:07.700
I didn't -- I didn't know anything about notes.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.567
I didn't know anything about rhythms
or anything like that.

00:54:10.567 --> 00:54:13.934
It was just, okay, this sound and this sound
and getting familiar with what --

00:54:13.934 --> 00:54:17.333
you know, it's like speaking,
when you talk.

00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:21.266
You're not so worried about the words that
you're using when you're learning to speak.

00:54:21.266 --> 00:54:22.934
Just whatever comes out,

00:54:22.934 --> 00:54:26.900
when babies talk they make all
kinds of weird sounds,

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.266
but that's how they learn.

00:54:28.266 --> 00:54:31.600
And that's kind of how I learned
to play music.

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.934
I had absolutely no idea what I was playing,

00:54:34.934 --> 00:54:37.867
and I couldn't make any sense of
it but I knew that I liked the sound.

00:54:37.867 --> 00:54:38.567
It was like, okay.

00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:40.433
And then I'd hear other people play
and it would be like,

00:54:40.433 --> 00:54:43.533
okay, let me try and sound like that,
you know.

00:54:43.533 --> 00:54:45.000
And that's how we learn when we speak,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.033
we just -- we're just surrounded
by people who speak the language

00:54:48.033 --> 00:54:49.367
that we want to learn.

00:54:49.367 --> 00:54:52.800
And then we just start, we're hearing it
all the time and we try to mimic

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.867
and that's--
that's how I started playing the ukulele.

00:54:55.867 --> 00:54:58.300
And then later on,
once I got familiar with--

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.200
with hearing other musicians play something,

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.934
and then I could --
I was like I know that sound.

00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:05.066
And I could just play it,

00:55:05.066 --> 00:55:07.100
even though I don't know what
I'm doing or what they're doing,

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:11.967
I could mimic them and that's kind of like
how we learn how to talk, right?

00:55:11.967 --> 00:55:15.500
Then after that, once I developed my ear,

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.367
then it kind of went --
then I started getting into like,

00:55:18.367 --> 00:55:23.567
okay, there's a way that you can notate
this and you can actually write music.

00:55:23.567 --> 00:55:24.900
And I was like, what is that?

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.467
And then I started learning about notes.

00:55:26.467 --> 00:55:28.500
Then I started learning about theory.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.367
You know, in college,

00:55:29.367 --> 00:55:33.233
I took some -- some music theory
courses.

00:55:33.233 --> 00:55:35.734
I took classes in composition

00:55:35.734 --> 00:55:39.400
and all these things that I've been doing
when I was kid made sense.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.767
I was like, oh, I see.

00:55:41.767 --> 00:55:43.967
Oh, that's what I'm doing. Okay.

00:55:43.967 --> 00:55:47.233
And so it was -- it was just --

00:55:47.233 --> 00:55:49.533
it was a different kind of feeling,
I think for me.

00:55:49.533 --> 00:55:51.000
I had a different experience, you know,

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.533
because I was -- I was kind of
already doing some of this stuff.

00:55:54.533 --> 00:55:57.867
And then for a professor to sit
there and tell me okay, this is what --

00:55:57.867 --> 00:55:58.967
this is what you're doing.

00:55:58.967 --> 00:56:02.667
And I would be like oh, okay.
Now I understand.

00:56:02.667 --> 00:56:06.233
And because I was already doing it,

00:56:06.233 --> 00:56:10.834
you know, it's kind of weird
because even like improvising,

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:14.567
my whole life basically I was improvising.

00:56:14.567 --> 00:56:18.533
But then going from there to how
learning how to read music and

00:56:18.533 --> 00:56:21.533
to sit in front of a sheet and
then learn how to play, you know,

00:56:21.533 --> 00:56:25.133
what I'm told to play
became a totally different experience.

00:56:25.133 --> 00:56:27.900
And then learning it that way,

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:32.200
it was -- I think it really helped me
to become more of a natural,

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.900
instinctive player.

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:39.900
So if I'm in a situation and I'm playing with
a string quartet or if I'm playing, you know,

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:47.767
with a jazz trio or a rock band
or a blues band whatever it is,

00:56:47.767 --> 00:56:51.533
I could just sit there and listen
and figure out what to do.

00:56:51.533 --> 00:56:55.900
And with the ukulele it's a little tricky
because there aren't, you know,

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.700
you don't -- it's not like you can --
if you play the trumpet,

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.400
you can go and listen to a Miles Davis
record and learn how to play jazz.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.633
But with the ukulele,

00:57:03.633 --> 00:57:07.133
it's like, if you want to learn
how to play Flamenco ukulele,

00:57:07.133 --> 00:57:11.367
you're not really going to able to find
a Flamenco player and listen to them,

00:57:11.367 --> 00:57:15.233
you just have to, you just have
to create your own path, you know.

00:57:15.233 --> 00:57:18.900
And I think for me, that was --
that was key, you know,

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.066
is by learning the way that I did,
starting out the way that I did.

00:57:22.066 --> 00:57:23.767
I had no rules.
There were no boundaries,

00:57:23.767 --> 00:57:27.600
nothing told me that you have to do this
way you have to do that way, you know.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.133
But I was just free to do whatever
I wanted and experiment with anything.

00:57:32.133 --> 00:57:34.633
And going to the effects and all that,

00:57:34.633 --> 00:57:38.100
I actually went through a whole period
of playing through Marshall Stacks

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.700
and wa wa pedals and all of that,
you know.

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.100
And it's funny because you go through
that whole phase,

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.400
you know, I went through a phase
where I had a pedal board

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.200
that had like 13 different effect pedals on
there.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.633
You know, everything from like see-quas,
to delays,

00:57:51.633 --> 00:57:57.633
and you know all these crazy echoes and phasers
and flangers and all of that, you know.

00:57:57.633 --> 00:58:01.600
And then, and then about four years ago,

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.900
four or five years ago,

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.333
I just kind of,
I put that aside and I --

00:58:06.333 --> 00:58:11.367
and I went back to just the pure basic
acoustic sound of the instrument

00:58:11.367 --> 00:58:14.367
because I realized that that's where --

00:58:14.367 --> 00:58:19.900
that's where the instrument's strength
lies in its simplicity.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.233
And so ever since then, yeah,
I've just --

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:29.467
I've just gone back to just the pure
sound of the instrument.

00:58:29.467 --> 00:58:35.266
&gt;&gt; So you have videos on YouTube
that have over a million views.

00:58:35.266 --> 00:58:36.934
Were you initially aware of that?

00:58:36.934 --> 00:58:40.166
And how has that contributed to your success?

00:58:40.166 --> 00:58:45.533
Jake Shimabukuro: Well, you know, the video of
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps" in Central Park,

00:58:45.533 --> 00:58:51.300
that video, I think got put up on YouTube
five years ago

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.300
so it was when YouTube just kind of started,
so at the time,

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:58.700
I'll be honest, at the time I didn't know what YouTube was.

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.700
But there was, but this was five years ago, right?

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.166
So you know, now everybody knows what it is.

00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:07.200
But I was getting e-mails from friends

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.633
because I had a lot of friends that were up here
on the mainland in college and stuff

00:59:10.633 --> 00:59:11.934
and they'd e-mail me and they'd be like,

00:59:11.934 --> 00:59:16.166
"hey, man there's like this crazy video
of you like going around our campus.

00:59:16.166 --> 00:59:17.834
Did you know about this?"

00:59:17.834 --> 00:59:20.667
And I was no -- I was just
sitting at home and you know,

00:59:20.667 --> 00:59:23.900
really doing just surfing and stuff.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:28.133
But the whole time while I was in Hawaii
there was this little viral video

00:59:28.133 --> 00:59:31.133
that was going around
and then I started getting --

00:59:31.133 --> 00:59:34.066
I was getting contacted
by people all over the world.

00:59:34.066 --> 00:59:35.500
People saying, oh my gosh,

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:40.500
I just saw this video of you playing
in Central Park and I love the ukulele.

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.767
Do you have --
do you have any music or CDs or --

00:59:43.767 --> 00:59:48.200
I want to get your stuff or can you come
and you know play in our city?

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.667
And all this kind of thing.

00:59:49.667 --> 00:59:52.834
It was just -- growing up in Hawaii,

00:59:52.834 --> 00:59:56.867
you know, I started out playing in coffee shops
and the coffee shops I started playing in,

00:59:56.867 --> 00:59:59.600
you know, you couldn't hold more than
four or five people.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.800
That was a full house.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.300
So, I mean, it really --

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.033
it really I mean I was just blown away.

01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:09.633
I didn't know what to think of it.

01:00:09.633 --> 01:00:11.200
I couldn't wrap my head around it.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.567
I still can't.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:16.000
I still can't because, you know,
I mean to this day,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.433
I still get people that come to
the shows and they say that,

01:00:20.433 --> 01:00:23.033
you know, oh, I discovered you
through YouTube.

01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:25.467
I discovered you through YouTube.

01:00:25.467 --> 01:00:27.767
Nine out of ten people will tell me that.

01:00:27.767 --> 01:00:29.433
And it's really been amazing.

01:00:29.433 --> 01:00:32.600
And I feel so blessed, you know,
because of that.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:39.133
And you know, I guess it's really changed.

01:00:39.133 --> 01:00:44.667
It's changed the way that people
hear music and discover artists now.

01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:46.166
You know for -- even for me,

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:49.400
I spend hours and hours on YouTube,
you know, looking up --

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.300
like, for example,
if I just want to --

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.433
if I want to, you know,

01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:56.900
get a guitar lesson from Jimmy Bruno,

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.900
I just type in his name and bam!

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:03.834
You know, I can learn all of his licks
and all of his guitar methods.

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:06.433
It's insane.

01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:09.266
Anytime that I need a little jolt of inspiration,

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:14.333
you know, I'll go pull up some YouTube
video of one of my favorite artists,

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:18.266
you know, and that's something
that you could never do before.

01:01:18.266 --> 01:01:21.800
When I growing up learning music
and everything was like cassette tapes

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.967
or then CDs just you came out
and I was like okay, this is great.

01:01:25.967 --> 01:01:29.834
I would have to actually have to sit with
the cassette tape, if I wanted to learn a song,

01:01:29.834 --> 01:01:33.734
I'd have to sit there rewind it
over and over and listen stop it,

01:01:33.734 --> 01:01:36.400
rewind, listen again,
oh, stop, rewind.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.233
I'd have to do that over and over
and I couldn't even --

01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:41.233
and still that's just using my ears.

01:01:41.233 --> 01:01:44.867
I could not visually see what
was happening.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:48.633
You know, but now, these young kids now
they learn so fast.

01:01:48.633 --> 01:01:50.166
There's all these virtuosos now

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:56.133
because they have unlimited access to
any artist that they want of any instrument.

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:59.533
So they can -- they can if
they're interested in ukulele,

01:01:59.533 --> 01:02:01.000
they can just type in ukulele,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.233
you know they can Google it or YouTube it

01:02:03.233 --> 01:02:07.734
and it will come up all these videos and
they can just sit there from front of their computer

01:02:07.734 --> 01:02:11.734
and actually watch someone playing it
for them like right in front of them --

01:02:11.734 --> 01:02:14.800
right in front of their eyes.
And they can pause it, learn it,

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.934
get the right fingering,
you know, go back and pause it again.

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.867
And it's tremendous.

01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:22.333
I wish I had that
when I was a kid, you know.

01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:27.900
Because I -- I don't know -- I don't know
how that would have changed what I do today.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.066
I don't know, maybe --
I mean,

01:02:30.066 --> 01:02:33.800
I really don't know how that's going
to effect these younger musicians.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.900
Because now -- sometimes I do workshops

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.700
and the thing that I find with a lot of these students
that come to these workshops is

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:47.633
they want to just--

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:48.800
they don't want to -- they don't have the patience
to learn the fundamentals of music anymore.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.567
It's like they want that immediate.
I want to learn this song.

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:52.900
How do you do this?

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.333
Before they even know exactly,

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:59.900
you know, the proper fingering or the proper
right-hand technique of strumming.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.467
They don't want to do that as long as --
they just want to learn the song.

01:03:03.467 --> 01:03:06.900
They just want to, oh no, I want to learn
how you played that on --

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.900
and that ending on YouTube,
how are you doing that?

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.667
All that fast stuff. I mean,

01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:14.633
so it's changing the way that people think.

01:03:14.633 --> 01:03:19.800
People want that instant gratification now
in music I find that, you know.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.800
So you know, I mean in some ways,

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.633
I think in some ways it's good
but in some ways it can be bad too.

01:03:25.633 --> 01:03:27.233
So I think that, you know,

01:03:27.233 --> 01:03:30.633
even with all the technology and
all that we still have to remember that

01:03:30.633 --> 01:03:35.100
okay we have to instill in this kids that
you know sometimes do take work.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.467
Sometimes you have to work hard
to achieve something

01:03:38.467 --> 01:03:42.100
and not everything can be
as simple as just being a click away.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.600
You know, like my--
my little nephews and stuff,

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.900
they don't even know what a library is.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.000
They're like what's a library?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.500
It's like, what?

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:59.300
They don't -- they have no idea what it is
to go and do research at the public library.

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.100
So I mean, so it's different, you know.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.000
I think with certain things
we have to remind,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.133
remind the younger generation
that we have to slow down a little bit.

01:04:08.133 --> 01:04:12.800
And we have to appreciate certain things
because there are some things in life

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.400
that's not worth just speeding through.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.767
And I think music is one of them,
you know, playing the ukulele,

01:04:19.767 --> 01:04:24.600
music is a great way to kind of step away
from that world for a bit

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.367
and then kind of connect yourself again with
everything that's happening in the moment.

01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:32.400
&gt;&gt; So we have time for one more brief question.

01:04:33.934 --> 01:04:39.934
&gt;&gt; Hi. So you're really well-known internationally
for playing like rock and pop and country,

01:04:39.934 --> 01:04:41.166
but you got your start --

01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:43.800
and I remember hearing you from like
playing contemporary Hawaiian music

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.500
and like "Pure Heart" and all of that,

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.400
how often do you go back and revisit
that style and compose in that?

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.266
Jake Shimabukuro: Oh, well, all the time,
whenever I'm back home in Hawaii,

01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:57.767
I mean, all of my buddies
all play traditional Hawaiian music.

01:04:57.767 --> 01:04:59.767
And so whenever I'm home --

01:04:59.767 --> 01:05:04.166
you know, traditional Hawaiian music will
always be my first love.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.500
That's because what I grew up playing.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.500
And -- which is very strange,

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.033
because, you know, if you're a jazz musician and you start playing jazz,

01:05:15.033 --> 01:05:17.500
you start learning all these --

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.900
you start learning all these complex harmonies
and you learn all these standards.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.433
There's a set of standards that you learn.

01:05:23.433 --> 01:05:25.567
All these complicated chord changes

01:05:25.567 --> 01:05:28.433
and you start learning how to improvise
over these chord changes.

01:05:28.433 --> 01:05:29.633
It's a whole language.

01:05:29.633 --> 01:05:31.066
It's the same thing with classical music,

01:05:31.066 --> 01:05:33.033
same thing with Flamenco music

01:05:33.033 --> 01:05:36.900
or bluegrass or any style of music
that you can think of.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.667
You know, Blues,
but whatever it is,

01:05:39.667 --> 01:05:42.200
you know, R&amp;B,

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.200
there is kind of --
you know, there's structure.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.166
And but Hawaiian music is kind of --

01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:58.300
it's one of the only forms of music
in the world that is so simple.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.800
And the reason it's so simple is because
Hawaiian, traditional Hawaiian music,

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.100
you know, when -- traditionally,
there was absolutely no --

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.734
there was no harmonic structure.

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:13.200
There was really no melody or anything like that.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.400
That came much, much later.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.867
You know, traditional Hawaiian music
was all about rhythm, drum beats,

01:06:19.867 --> 01:06:24.533
this little Hawaiian rhythmic things and chanting.

01:06:24.533 --> 01:06:25.800
It was all chanting.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.166
And because -- in Hawaii,
there was no written language,

01:06:30.166 --> 01:06:32.900
you know, everything was preserved in song.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.800
So songs were -- were created to just,
you know, I mean, historically,

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.200
so that they could -- they could,

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.800
so the stories of each generation
could be passed down.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:50.767
So once -- once instruments like harmonic
instruments like the ukulele or guitar

01:06:50.767 --> 01:06:52.600
were introduced into Hawaiian music,

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.400
you know, it started out very simple.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.834
Sometimes only two chords
or sometimes just one chord.

01:06:59.834 --> 01:07:02.000
Sometimes if you listen to chanting,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.433
like old traditional chanting,

01:07:03.433 --> 01:07:05.700
it will only be two notes.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.767
Just -- it would be aaaaah, uuuuh, aaaah
and they'll be chanting all this stuff.

01:07:10.767 --> 01:07:14.200
And that's -- that's all it was.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.133
You know, so the music is very, very simple.

01:07:19.133 --> 01:07:20.467
It's so simple.

01:07:20.467 --> 01:07:25.300
And I think that's -- and I think, you know,
for me starting out with that,

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.567
you know, I have a great appreciation.

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:34.166
Like I can sit with a ukulele and just strum
a C chord for an hour and not get bored.

01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:38.000
But you try to tell a jazz guy to do that,
he's going to,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.900
I can't just hold a C chord for an hour
and strum that because harmonically,

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.834
they just get bored.

01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:46.400
They won't -- they can't even hold a C triad,

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.533
it's got to be a Major 7 or a Major 9

01:07:48.533 --> 01:07:51.166
or they got to add the Sharp 13
or something you know,

01:07:51.166 --> 01:07:53.633
they got to change it up because it's not --

01:07:53.633 --> 01:07:57.834
it doesn't -- it doesn't stimulate anything
for them. It's not enough.

01:07:57.834 --> 01:08:00.133
But I think playing the ukulele,

01:08:00.133 --> 01:08:03.567
you learn to appreciate music
in its most simplest form

01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:06.400
and then in its most complex form.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.200
And that's a great,
to me there's a great power in that.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.834
You know and I think with --
with playing traditional Hawaiian music

01:08:13.834 --> 01:08:17.400
and going back to that for me always
helps me to keep balance.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.700
Whenever I go back home and I'm
playing with my buddies,

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:24.266
and we're just sitting around
the -- the roasted pig,

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:26.467
you know, the big pig on the stick or whatever,

01:08:26.467 --> 01:08:29.400
we're just like -- we're just
have a little jam session

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.166
and playing all these traditional Hawaiian tunes

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:37.066
that I grew up with really helps to bring me
back to my roots and kind of keeps me,

01:08:37.066 --> 01:08:42.934
you know, keeps my mind --
it keeps that window open.

01:08:42.934 --> 01:08:45.066
So it's -- it's all about balance, I think.

01:08:45.066 --> 01:08:48.400
And that's what I always try to
maintain when in what I do.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.166
Cliff: Awesome. Well, thank you very much Jake.

01:08:51.166 --> 01:08:52.633

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.734
