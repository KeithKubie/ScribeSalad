00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
Is this a super depressing ending to this course,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.240
and can't we decide anything?

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.050
Well, of course, Rice's Theorem and undecidability in general

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.480
is prone to a certain criticism.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.920
I mean a crucial thing to notice is that

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.360
Rice Theorem means that there is no algorithm

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
that can decide a functional property for any program that we through at it,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.890
but this is a very general case.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.740
Rice's theorem an also the halting problem, of course,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.040
can only concern this very general case.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.710
If you're trying to prove something about a program you know very well,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.830
you might be in a very different situation,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.840
so if you're trying to find out, for example

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960
if a program you wrote even halts,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.470
and you can't prove that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.610
or can't even show that,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.510
then maybe you should consider writing some better understandable code.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.460
But what it does mean is that there's no fully automated software testing

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.190
without trade off.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.280
So it means that fully automated testing

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.140
basically the dream of a program

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.420
and you throw any other program at it,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.360
and it will tell you if it's correct,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.310
if it stops, if it crashes,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.140
and that's the dream that we probably can't fulfill,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.590
but if accept certain trade offs, so for example,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.390
if we accept that the automated testing program

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.610
will be right most of the time

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.120
or that it only works on special cases,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.200
then we might be in a better situation,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.930
so I would interpret Rice's theorem not as a general negative message,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.070
but rather as a piece of caution

00:01:17.070 --> 99:59:59.000
as to what computers can do and can not do.
