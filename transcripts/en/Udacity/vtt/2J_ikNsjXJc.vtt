00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.700
So when you finish the first step,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.260
the, the DNA extraction, you essentially have taken

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.870
our sample and like you said, sort of purified the DNA, from it gotten rid

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.490
of all the other stuff. The proteins, the other molecules that might be part of

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.160
cells and other kinds of contaminants. And you

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.380
pretty much just have a purified DNA product.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.234
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.770
&gt;&gt; Now is, is that enough, already to do what you

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.490
want to do with it? Or what do you have to do next?

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.020
&gt;&gt; Not really.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.930
It's common in many situations like this to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.270
want to amplify the DNA. So you always want

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.910
to give yourself the best opportunity to sequence

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.390
what's in there. And the easiest way to do

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.110
that is to take the DNA you've got and amplify it, or copy it, as many times

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.320
as you can so that you just have

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.939
enough signal that you make it easy on yourself.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.420
&gt;&gt; I see. So when you see say you, you're

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.260
amplifying or you're, you're making copies, I mean, you controlling

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.710
kind of how many copies you make. You just, you know, you are

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.680
making like, ten more, 20 more, you know, 100 more. How does that work?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.040
&gt;&gt; Its not tightly controlled, but in essence,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.070
at the end of the process, you end up

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.780
with 1000 fold enrichment of the DNA. So you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.050
really do end up with a lot more DNA.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.690
&gt;&gt; So do you end up with DNA left over? You know, after

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.620
you're done with the procedure, you actually have leftover DNA for, for people?

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.090
&gt;&gt; Sometimes we do.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.470
but usually we store your DNA in its in the saliva form, so that we're

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.530
going back to the original copy. One

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.110
issue with amplification is that every time you

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.750
copy just like in DNA replication in

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.230
humans, there is a possibility for error. So,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.890
those errors could compound if you keep copying

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.450
the copy, just like Xeroxing a Xerox, right.
