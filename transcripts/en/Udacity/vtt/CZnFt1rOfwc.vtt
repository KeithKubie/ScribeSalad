Okay so let's do a quiz. What I'd like you to do, is use the developer tools

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.050
in whatever browser you're using, to figure out exactly

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.200
how many parameters we're going to need to pass

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.520
as form data, in order to successfully execute requests

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.260
against this website. You can do that, by following

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.400
the steps I followed to get here, and scrolling

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.140
down further, to see all of the form data.
