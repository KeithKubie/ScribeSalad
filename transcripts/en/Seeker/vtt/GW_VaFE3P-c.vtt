00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.909
Every time I read the news lately, it seems
I’m reading about another region plagued

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:11.900
by drought. But is the world really running
out of water?

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.280
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.369
Here in the Western developed world, we like
to think of water as a renewable resource.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.220
It’s everywhere and it’s such a huge part
of our lives. It flushes our waste down the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.890
drain, keeps our power plants cool, and keeps
our food growing in fertile plains. And we

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
basically get fresh and safe drinking water
for free out of the tap. But many parts of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.800
the world aren’t so lucky. According to
the UN, 85% of the world lives in the driest

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.329
half of the planet and hundreds of millions
of people don’t have access to clean drinking

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.239
water. And it could get worse. Way worse.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.579
Over the next few decades, by 2050, the global
population will grow by 3 billion more people.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.010
And that means, global water demand is projected
to increase by 55% as many nations become

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.680
more populous and more developed. At the same
time, climate change will change weather patterns

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.390
across the globe, causing some regions to
become wetter and others to become drier.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.610
While a true global drought seems unlikely,
I mean the water cycle is a closed system.But

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.400
as these changes occur, dry areas will become
worse and larger. The water that used to flow

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.540
into fertile fields won’t permeate the soil
and evaporate into the atmosphere, eventually

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.549
finding it’s way into the ocean. But how
will these changes affect our we get our water?

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.159
Our earth is mostly water. But most of that
isn’t usable for us, because most of us,

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.530
including the UN, believe access to fresh
drinking water is a basic human right. So

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.549
we want clean and cheap accessible water,
and that leaves us less than 1% of the Earth’s

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.780
water in the form of lakes, rivers, streams,
and groundwater for us as potable drinking

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.780
water, and water for other uses like agriculture,
manufacturing, and energy production.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.450
If you’re a frequent DNews watcher you might
know that here in San Francisco we get our

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.159
water from Hetch Hetchy, a man-made reservoir
high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Snow

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.180
falls onto mountains in the area, and when
spring returns, the snow melts and runs into

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.579
hetch hetchy. But this past year we’ve only
see a fraction of the amount of precipitation

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.909
we usually do.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.750
California is in a major drought and at the
same time the American West could be facing

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.560
the worst drought in a millennium. And we
aren’t the only ones left high and dry.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.390
Many regions of the world are facing historic
droughts. Brazil, China, Kenya, and Australia,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.540
just to name a few.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.239
One of the reasons for widespread droughts
is a lack of snowfall. New research published

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.400
in the journal Environmental Research Letters
found that snowpack is on the decline around

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.230
the world. So much of the Northern Hemisphere
depends upon annual snowpack for its freshwater,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.950
that accounts for nearly 2 billion people.
Yet the researchers find that nearly 67% of

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.150
those people could have insufficient snowpack
in the coming century. One the study’s authors

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.610
said that “Water managers have to make arrangements
at a lot of places for alternatives as the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.660
snow reservoir will no longer exist.”

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.890
And it’s not just a lack of water from above.
Water supplies from below are dwindling too.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.950
In June of 2015, NASA announced that the water
table is dropping all over the world. Of the

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.120
37 largest underground aquifers on Earth,
21 have passed their sustainability tipping

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.930
point. That means more water is being taken
out than is finding it’s way back in. And

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.819
the thing about aquifers, most of the water
is old, really old and it takes a while to

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.989
refill. Some aquifers could take anywhere
from 500 to 1,300 years to refill.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.500
So it’s a pretty large problem. Even the
UN said that the world could suffer a 40%

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.470
shortage of water just 15 short years from
now. In it’s World Water Development Report

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.060
the UN highlighted high population growth
and poor urban design as two main areas of

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.709
concern. And unfortunately, the report says
“This convergence is certain to intensify

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.629
the water insecurity of poor and marginalized
people in low income countries.”

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.170
So what happens when we run out of fresh water?

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.269
Well here in California we’ve already started
to adjust our lives. There’s a state mandated

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.470
water conservation plan in place, to reduce
consumption. So that means no washing the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.900
car or watering the lawn. It means asking
for water at a restaurant rather than having

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.189
it on the table. Relatively small changes
for us, but losing most of the world’s fresh

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.330
water could mean major upheaval and major
costs for some countries. Especially when

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.400
to comes to food.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.069
Most of the world’s water, 70%, goes to
agriculture!

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.120
So droughts have a huge impact on food availability.
The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.690
current droughts around the world cost six
to eight billion dollars a year in agricultural

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.000
losses. And that can drive up the cost of
food, causing a similar food crisis to one

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.560
in 2008, which saw prices of staples like
rice double in just a few short months. As

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.830
food prices soared, people got hungry and
nervous and soon unrest erupted around the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.919
world as citizens demanded their government
take action.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:34.919
Droughts already cause tens of millions of
deaths every year. If these trend continue,

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.790
millions more will needlessly die. But while
this sounds all doom and gloom, there is hope.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.810
The UN hopes that by 2050, we’ll have learned
new techniques like widespread adoption of

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.729
advanced agro-technology and highly efficient
irrigation techniques that will ease the strain

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.690
on agriculture. Power companies will adopt
water efficient techniques like dry cooling

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.669
and use more sustainable forms of energy like
solar and wind. Cities will have more efficient

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.790
water systems which take full advantage of
recycling water.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.880
But that’s a long way off. And in the meantime
every day the earth gains more people and

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.789
at the same time the climate becomes increasingly
volatile, causing many regions to be vulnerable

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:09.800
to drought.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.930
If you want to know more about California’s
drought and how it affects the rest of the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.340
world, check out my earlier episode right
