00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.140
If we dumped a puddle of liquid nitrogen

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:04.710
Straight into the palm of our hand

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.750
How long do you think it would take for the skin to cool down enough to where the nitrogen can latch on and bite it?

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.319
Now in previous videos, I showed you that you can take liquid nitrogen and splash it in your face

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320
Or roll it off your hands with little to no effect

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.260
And that's because the Leidenfrost effect basically vaporizes the nitrogen into a gas which shields you from the intense cold of this liquid

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.909
But what do you think would happen if we left the nitrogen in one place for a little bit too long? For example...

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.219
What if we pour this into our hands and just let it sit?

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.058
Now for it to take a little bit this liquid and just pour it in the palm of our hand

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.439
But we keep our hand moving fast enough. You can see the liquid doesn't actually do any damage

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.959
Just skittles around kinda like playing a game of air hockey until the nitrogen completely evaporates

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.760
But what would happen if we stop moving our hand and let the liquid nitrogen settle down and stay in one place for a little bit longer?

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.389
Okay, so this is where I start getting a little bit more nervous

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.870
I don't want to stop moving my hand because I know what's gonna happen

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.879
But watch this if I do stop for a second watch right there you can see it actually instantly frostbites the skin

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.420
Let's do that again with a little bit more liquid, that's quite a bit Just gonna-

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.650
Whoa, you can see immediately it starts frostbiting me and as it warms up it disappears as quickly as it can

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.409
Now to me this feels like a little bit of a bee sting

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.129
Almost like he got stung and the pain lingers for about 10 to 20 seconds

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.140
You can see the skin is turning a little bit red there

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.089
It's not to the point will be a first-degree burn just yet, but it would be if we left it exposed a little bit longer

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.059
Let's try a smaller bead here let that settle down. Oh my, ooh, ok I chickened out

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.009
I don't really want to keep this going much longer

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.799
I'm gonna try one little bead and see if I can make it all the way through

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.919
This may not be the smartest idea, but I'm doing this for you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.430
There we go, there's a nice little bead will let it settle down and oh

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.799
Oh man that kinda actually hurt

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.239
You can see it's turned my skin completely white as it warms back up though it starts to fade and see this is taking about

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.460
10 to 15 seconds now I do feel a little bit of pain there it is a lingering sensation that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.260
Feels like after you got stung by a bee you see the coloration in hand is a little bit more red

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.280
but even at this point

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.330
I wouldn't consider that a first-degree burn you might be an extreme case of frostnip

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.490
But I wouldn't expect that to blister up you can see it only takes a fraction of a second for nitrogen to actually grab on

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.279
your skin and start burning it and the reason I say burn is because

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.530
Frostbite is actually very similar to first second and third-degree burns depending on how long you're exposed

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.800
I want to show you this reaction because I've done a lot of experiments with liquid nitrogen

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.630
And I didn't want you to get the impression that it was super safe stuff to play with you can see that it will burn you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.609
And it'll burn you very quickly and it does hurt and leaves a mark. You might be wondering what this feels like and right now

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.610
I have lingering

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.119
Sensations all over my hands if I was stung by bees multiple times there is a lingering pain in that part of my hand almost

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.670
Like somebody's taking a nail and pressing it down into my skin

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.830
I get an itchy tingling sensation that makes you want to scratch it. So if you do happen to get frostbitten

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.220
This is the way that you want to treat it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.910
Get yourself a bowl of Lukewarm water you do not want it to be hot and you don't want to be called just lukewarm room temperature

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.309
And just soak the area for a couple of minutes until it starts to feel better then take a warm dry cloth and press it

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.429
To the affected area and just hold it until it starts to warm back up

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.809
Now depending on the severity you might want to go seek medical attention and see what your doctor has to say

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.139
So how long does it take for liquid nitrogen to freeze your skin?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.059
According to my experiments it only takes a fraction of a second if you leave your skin exposing longer than that

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.940
It's going to start freezing the muscles freezing the tendons you could actually get to the point where you freeze your entire hand solid that would

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.960
Not be a very good day. That's all I got for this experiment. I'll see in the next video. Talk to you then

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.460
 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.960
 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.640
*punching sound effect*

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.020
*leaf crunching*

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.620
*punch*

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.620
