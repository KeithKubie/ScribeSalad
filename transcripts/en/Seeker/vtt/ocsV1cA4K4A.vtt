00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.700
Now THAT is air…

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.160
But what is THAT?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.740
And how did it GET HERE?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.889
WHAT'S WITH THE AIR?

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.670
Hey nose and/or mouth-breathers, Trace here
for DNews.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.210
There's a question going around Reddit Science
right now that caught my eye: Where did Earth's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.980
atmosphere come from?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.020
And we started talking about it, and we weren't
sure either… "atmosphere" literally means,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.980
"sphere of air," but "air" isn't really right
either -- because that's just what we have

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.980
on earth.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.850
Venus and Titan have atmospheres, in that
gases permanently cover their surface; in

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.310
fact, a number of the bodies in our solar
system have atmospheres -- even the Sun.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.630
The gases surrounding the celestial bodies
are held, suspended in space by the gravity

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.540
of their host planets, which determines a
lot about their makeup and potential to support

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.540
human life.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.320
Our atmosphere came into being not long after
the Earth cooled 4.6 billion years ago.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.580
As hydrogen and helium are extremely prevalent
in the universe chances are our atmosphere

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.220
contained them too, early on.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.230
The sun is 98 percent helium and hydrogen...

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.860
However, as we were so close to the sun and
pretty hot ourselves, much of those lighter,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.250
faster-moving elements escaped Earth's gravity.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.780
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus got to keep theirs
because they were so far away, and so much

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.110
more massive.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.390
Scientists believe as radioactive elements
decayed and the Earth cooled, our remaining

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.980
elements coalesced into solids, liquids and
gases.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.640
A 2009 paper published in the journal Science
says, at this point, the Earth was hit by

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.270
many, many comets and meteors -- bringing
water vapor, krypton, xenon and other atmospheric

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.270
materials.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.300
Another, older, theory states it was volcanoes
that spewed water vapor into the sky.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.320
We'll leave it up to the researchers, but
needless to say, at this point we know there

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.370
was water vapor, carbon dioxide, ammonia,
methane, and neon that they think was already

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.640
swirling over our hot crust.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.520
And yet ANOTHER theory proposes that 4.5 billion
years ago, when the proto-earth was getting

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.710
hit by asteroids including a GIANT one that
formed the moon, the neon in our atmosphere

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.840
was BLOWN OFF and a beneficial ratio of gasses
were left behind.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.940
From there, a secondary atmosphere began to
form from those volcanic blasts and the leftover

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.050
heat inside the planet.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.370
Heavier elements like nitrogen split out forming
78% of our atmosphere today as well as the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.980
carbon dioxide and water…

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.900
As the planet cooled … life began to form
and they did the rest.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.190
2.7 billion years ago, when the first primitive
life forms began to form, they lived anaerobically,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.190
or without air.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.520
These extremophiles digested sulfates for
energy!

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.819
Completely ignoring the atmosphere.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.140
Later, cyanobacteria or blue-green algae evolved
to suck in carbon dioxide and output oxygen

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.600
using photosynthesis.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.709
These guys are still around today.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.250
They use the energy from the sun, and carbon
dioxide to produce oxygen.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.340
Eventually, and scientists know it happened,
but are unclear HOW, there was so much oxygen

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.750
in our air, that it poisoned organisms that
couldn't process it, causing a mass extinction.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.220
Microorganisms that COULD burn O2 survived
as did the cyanobacteria and over millions

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.320
of years, they added enough O2 to support
the evolution of oxygen-sucking animals, which

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.430
evolved into the living animals today like
you and me.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.400
As the planet continued to cool, the water
vapor began to rain down, dissolving the CO2

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.780
gases into it.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.920
The oceans were formed in this way, and the
cyanobacteria spread creating more oxygen.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.849
Oxygen is hard to find on most planets because
it tends to react with everything.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.459
It rusts metals, it burns easily, it can make
water.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.560
So how it got to the balance of 21-percent
that we have today is still being studied.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.510
By final count, according to HowStuffWorks.com,
our air is "78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.319
oxygen, 0.9 percent argon and 0.03 percent
carbon dioxide.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.569
The remaining 0.07 percent consists of water
vapor, hydrogen, ozone, neon, helium, krypton

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.569
and xenon."

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.800
*breathes* and it's pretty nice.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.720
