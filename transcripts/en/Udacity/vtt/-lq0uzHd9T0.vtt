00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the correct answer is: of course they will eventually matter.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So No is the correct answer, and let me show this to you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Again, assume our 4 landmarks

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and consider our robot facing to the right, to this direction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We get a certain set of distances

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that is invariant to the orientation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But now this robot moves, and we get a new set of distances.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And now orientation matters.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If we assume a different initial orientation,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
like this one over here--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that robot moves--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
its measurements will be very, very different.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So orientation does matter in the second step of particle filtering

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because the prediction is so different for different orientations.

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's go and program this.
