00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.720
We're on problem 21.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.190
Stan's solution to an equation
is shown below.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.440
All right, and I haven't looked
at it yet, but let's

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.540
just see what they ask us.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.440
Which statement about Stan's
solution is true?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.550
So let's just work through it
and see if he got it right or

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.920
if he made a mistake.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.220
So let's see.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.490
Let's think about it
how we would do it.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.980
So if we had n plus 8 times
n plus 20 is equal to 110.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.380
So the first thing you want to
do is you'd want to distribute

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.330
this 8 times n plus 20.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.730
You don't want to multiply
this whole n plus 8.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.680
Remember, you're doing order
of operations, so it's

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.480
multiplication first.
Let's do that.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.330
So you get the n plus and
you distribute this 8.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:47.520
So it's 8n plus 160
is equal to 110.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.080
8 times n plus 8 times
20 is 160.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.660
And already I see a discrepancy

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.670
between ours and his.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.560
We have n there.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.580
We have plus 8n there.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.410
But where he has a
20, we have 160.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.400
He didn't distribute the 8.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.810
8 times n plus 20
is 8n plus 160.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.470
So that's wrong.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.220
So he made a mistake
in step 1.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.560
Unfortunately, he got all that
other work that he had to do

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.935
just because of his-- it's all
going to be wrong because of

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:16.300
his mistake.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.060
Problem 22.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.380
When is the statement true?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.085
The opposite of a number is less
then the original number.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.910
Well, I mean, if I have a
negative number, the opposite

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.670
of a negative is positive.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.720
So it's not going to be less.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.580
But if l positive number, then
the opposite of it is

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.520
negative, which is
less than it.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.390
Because a negative is less
than a positive.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:52.280
Or if we say that x is greater
than 0, then minus x is going

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.760
to be less than x.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.580
If we say x is positive,
then definitely.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.170
You know, minus 3 is less
than positive 3.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.130
So the statement is true
for positive numbers.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.380
So that's C.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.930
It's definitely not
never true.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.960
I mean we showed a case
where it's true.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.210
If I have positive 3, negative
3 is less than that.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.830
Statement B.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.550
The statement is always true.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.650
Well no, if we start with
negative 3, the opposite is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.620
going to be larger.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.840
The opposite's going
to be positive 3.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.290
And D.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.710
The statement is true for
negative numbers.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.910
No, it's not.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.550
Negative 3, the opposite is 3.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.730
And that's larger
than negative 3.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.570
Problem 23.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.230
What is the y-intercept
of the graph?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.520
OK, let me see.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.060
So 23.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.330
They say 4x plus 2y
is equal to 12.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.960
So if you were to graph this
line, not that I'm going to--

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.210
the y-intercept is when it
intersects the y-axis.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.120
So it's that point there.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.350
It's what's this y-coordinate.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.660
Well the x-coordinate, it's
when x is equal to 0.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.940
So it's going to be 0 comma
some y-intercept.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.690
So the easiest thing to do
is say when x is equal

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.550
to 0, what is y?

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.990
So when x is equal to 0, this
4 times 0 is equal to 0.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.030
So that just becomes 0.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.950
So you get 2y is equal to 12.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.000
y is equal to 6, and
that's choice C.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.020
All they want to know is, of
this line, when x is equal to

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.790
0, what's y?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.110
That's what the y-intercept
is.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.120
Next problem.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.090
OK, they've drawn us a graph.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.750
They say-- let me copy
and paste this one.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.990
OK.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.230
Copied it.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.460
OK, which inequality is shown
on the graph below?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.160
So first of all, let's figure
out the equation of

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.690
this line right now.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.250
So what's its y-intercept,
first of all?

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.300
So when x is equal to 0,
y is equal to minus 1.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.320
If we put it in slope y
intercept form, the equation

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.300
of really, any line is y
is equal to mx plus b.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.970
Where m is the slope and
b is the y-intercept.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.560
Here, when x is 0,
y is negative 1.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.740
So the y-intercept is minus 1.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.920
So b is minus 1.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.630
So we know that y is equal
to mx minus 1.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.470
And now we just have to
figure out the slope.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.720
And the slope is just change in
y for a given change in x.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.920
So if we say change in y for a
given change in x is equal

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.420
to-- let's see.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.930
When I increase x by 2,
I increase y by 1.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.280
So change in y is 1 when
the change in x is 2.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.030
And you could say when you
increase x by 4-- I'm going

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.290
four spots-- I increase
y by 2.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.110
So you could have done that.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.490
You could have said change in
y over change in x is 2/4,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.030
which is also equal to 1/2.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.000
But either way, we now
know the slope.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.320
The slope is change in
y over change in x.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.570
So the equation of the line is
y is equal to 1/2 x minus 1.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.930
That's the equation
of this line.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.820
Now they want to know what the
equation of the inequality is.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.520
So first of all, they're
including-- they have this

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.720
grey area and they put
this line in bold.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.800
So that means that we're
including the line.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.940
If they had drawn a dotted line
here that means we're not

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.540
including the line.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.130
But since they're including
the line, it's going to be

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.600
either greater than or less
than or equal to.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.560
That equal to is because we're
including the line.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.310
But just think about it.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.830
So our choices are y is greater
than or equal to 1/2 x

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.900
minus 1 or y is less than or
equal to 1/2 x minus 1.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.230
Now think about for
any given x.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.550
Let's say when x
is equal to 2.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.600
When x is equal to 2, if you put
it into this equation you

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.440
get y is equal to 0 and that's
this point on the line.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.890
Now is the grey area all y
values greater than 0 or all y

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.140
values less than 0?

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.440
Well clearly, it's all y
values greater than 0.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.760
It's all the y values
above the y value

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.010
dictated by this equation.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.810
The equation of this inequality
or this area is y

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.040
is greater than 1/2 x minus 1.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.390
And just a very easy way to
eyeball it is OK, they're

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.280
including the line, so I'm
going to have this equal

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.900
then-- it's going to either be
greater than or equal to or

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.930
less than or equal to, and since
it's the area above the

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.020
line it's going to be greater
than or equal to.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.280
And that is choice D.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.220
Next problem, problem 25.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.720
This is another one where I
think it makes sense to copy

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.970
and paste it.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.630
It's a big one.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.880
OK.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.560
Which best represents
the graph of y id

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.180
equal to 2x minus 2.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.870
So the slope is 2.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.940
Its positive 2 and its
y-intercept is minus 2.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.290
So the y-intercept is
easy to eyeball.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.280
Here the y-intercept
is minus 2.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.130
That's right.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.150
Here it's minus 2 as well.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.260
In both of these, the
y-intercept is plus 2.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.850
So neither of these are
going to, right?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.430
It intersects the y-axis
at positive 2.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.180
But we know that the y-intercept
is minus 2.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.540
So we know-- whoops.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.580
Where'd I go?

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.620
There we go.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.010
So we know our choices are
one of the top two.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.170
It's either A or C.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.790
And which of these has
a positive slope,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.980
positive slope of 2?

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:48.680
Well in choice A when I go to
the right by 2, I go up by 4.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.590
So change in y over
change in x.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.420
I go up by 4, when I
go up in x by 2.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.760
I go up in y by 4 when I go up
in x by 2, so the slope is 2.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.020
So this has a positive slope
of 2, so that's choice A.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.000
But just for seeing why choice C
doesn't work or figuring out

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.940
the slope, think about
it this way.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.380
Let me start at a random
point here.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.220
If I increase x value
by 2, what's

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.540
happening to my y value?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.040
Is it increasing by 2 or
is it decreasing by 2?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.330
Well it's decreasing.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.420
Well it's decreasing by 4.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.740
It's decreasing at
twice the rate.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.000
It's decreasing by 4.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.299
So in this case, change
in y over change in x.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.400
Whenever x is positive 2,
we increased by 2 here.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.559
What happened to y.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.480
It went down 4.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.669
So here the slope is minus 2.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.600
And you can look at that.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.270
You can kind of eyeball it
because it's going from the

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.750
top left to the bottom right,
so it's going to

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.680
be a negative number.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.790
But the easiest way I always do
is to draw these arrows and

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.390
say, OK, when I increase
x, y is decreasing.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.700
So that's going to be
a negative slope.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.240
Let's do it.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.560
So the answer was A.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.810
Next problem.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.150
OK, so they're giving us another
one of these where

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.520
they shaded a graph.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.350
These are good.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.110
Thank God I have the cut
and paste feature.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.860
So they ask us, which inequality
does the shaded

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.160
region of the graph represent?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.550
So once again, it'll be good
just to figure out what the

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.780
equation of this line is.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.230
We could immediately say, OK,
the y-intercept is 2.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.910
And what's its slope?

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:40.930
When x increases by 1,
what happens to y?

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.685
y is going down by 3.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.830
So the y-intercept
is equal to 2.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.850
We figured that out.
b is equal to 2.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.710
The slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.500
When x increases by 1,
the slope-- sorry.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.330
The change in y is minus 3.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.960
It goes down by 3.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.490
So the slope is equal
to minus 3.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.820
So the equation of this
line is y is equal to

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.300
minus 3x plus 2.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.540
mx plus b.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.050
And if I look at the choices,
already it looks a little bit

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.400
different than that, but
we'll get to that.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.410
But let's see what the
inequality is.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.700
So first of all, it's going to
be either greater than or

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.430
equal or less than or equal.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.900
And we say the or equal
because they

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.610
filled in the line.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.540
So let's think about it.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:37.870
If we pick any x, say when x is
equal to 2, then according

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.060
to this equation, according
to this line, y would be

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.880
equal to minus 4.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.610
Now, are we including the y's
that are greater than that

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.110
value as well or are we
including the y's that are

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.165
less than that value?

00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:50.980
Well, we're including the ones
that are less than that point

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.230
for a given x.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.460
So the shaded region is y
is less than or equal to

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.770
minus 3x plus 2.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.710
And you can eyeball this.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.060
You can kind of say, oh, this
is below the graph, so it's

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.260
less than or equal.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.720
And that equal was because
they shaded in the line.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.350
If it was a dotted line it
would just be less than.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.820
Once again, this isn't
the exact format

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.610
that they have here.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.040
They put all the x's and the y's
on the same side, and we

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.110
can do that.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.200
Let's just add 3x to both sides
of this equation and you

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.800
get 3x plus y is less
than or equal to.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.245
When you add 3x on the
right-hand side that

00:11:26.245 --> 00:11:27.690
just becomes 0.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.690
So less than or equal to 2.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.800
And that is 3x plus y is less
than or equal to positive 2.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.760
And that is choice A.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.700
And I'm all out of time, see
you in the next video.
