I saw you've described it before as the

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090
I saw you've described it before as the
 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.970
I saw you've described it before as the
slowest aha moment in history perhaps

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980
slowest aha moment in history perhaps
 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.999
slowest aha moment in history perhaps
but you were coming to this realization

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009
but you were coming to this realization
 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.140
but you were coming to this realization
that you were going to have a result

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150
that you were going to have a result
 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.109
that you were going to have a result
that which you were not expecting how

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119
that which you were not expecting how
 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.820
that which you were not expecting how
did you individually deal with it

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830
did you individually deal with it
 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.380
did you individually deal with it
because the world welcomed it when it

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390
because the world welcomed it when it
 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.540
because the world welcomed it when it
came out but as you were analyzing the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550
came out but as you were analyzing the
 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.919
came out but as you were analyzing the
data I'm beginning to see that this

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:23.929
data I'm beginning to see that this
 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:24.519
data I'm beginning to see that this
result

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529

were you doubtful were you thinking this

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810
were you doubtful were you thinking this
 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.720
were you doubtful were you thinking this
is not this is not what we should be

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730
is not this is not what we should be
 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.220
is not this is not what we should be
seeing there's something wrong I just

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230
seeing there's something wrong I just
 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.560
seeing there's something wrong I just
thought it was wrong but just it was

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570
thought it was wrong but just it was
 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.270
thought it was wrong but just it was
gonna be wrong for sure as simple or

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280
gonna be wrong for sure as simple or
 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.100
gonna be wrong for sure as simple or
dumb it isn't like we would say math

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110
dumb it isn't like we would say math
 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.680

that usually means a bug in a computer

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520
that usually means a bug in a computer
 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.040
that usually means a bug in a computer
program but that it would be wrong for

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050
program but that it would be wrong for
 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.900
program but that it would be wrong for
that reason and as it evolved I started

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910
that reason and as it evolved I started
 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.760
that reason and as it evolved I started
thinking maybe at least it's wrong for

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770
thinking maybe at least it's wrong for
 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.920
thinking maybe at least it's wrong for
an interesting reason something that you

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930
an interesting reason something that you
 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.450
an interesting reason something that you
know we won't kick ourselves and say we

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
know we won't kick ourselves and say we
 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.450
know we won't kick ourselves and say we
should have known that I'm pretty amazed

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460
should have known that I'm pretty amazed
 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.099
should have known that I'm pretty amazed
that it survived to this day at face

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109
that it survived to this day at face
 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.680
that it survived to this day at face
value of what we I thought it was right

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690
value of what we I thought it was right
 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.119
value of what we I thought it was right
and I guess there's the other element

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129
and I guess there's the other element
 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.369
and I guess there's the other element
which is there's a chain of analysis

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379
which is there's a chain of analysis
 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.770
which is there's a chain of analysis
that we all have to do and many steps in

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
that we all have to do and many steps in
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.870
that we all have to do and many steps in
the chain you have to calibrate and so

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880
the chain you have to calibrate and so
 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.600
the chain you have to calibrate and so
in the very first days of the of the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610
in the very first days of the of the
 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.010
in the very first days of the of the
measurement wave when you first put the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
measurement wave when you first put the
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.840
measurement wave when you first put the
chain together you often put the chain

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850
chain together you often put the chain
 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.980
chain together you often put the chain
together and put the point in the plot

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
together and put the point in the plot
 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.420
together and put the point in the plot
just to make sure that you show that the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430
just to make sure that you show that the
 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.679
just to make sure that you show that the
chain of all holds together then it

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689
chain of all holds together then it
 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.450
chain of all holds together then it
works and then you plan to go back and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460
works and then you plan to go back and
 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.850
works and then you plan to go back and
fix you know and you know tune each of

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860
fix you know and you know tune each of
 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.140
fix you know and you know tune each of
the different operation steps the wrong

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150
the different operation steps the wrong
 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.179
the different operation steps the wrong
way to make sure that there's you've got

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189
way to make sure that there's you've got
 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.469
way to make sure that there's you've got
all your eyes dotted and your t's

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479
all your eyes dotted and your t's
 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.420
all your eyes dotted and your t's
crossed but that's what we also I think

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430
crossed but that's what we also I think
 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.980
crossed but that's what we also I think
in the very earliest stages thought that

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990
in the very earliest stages thought that
 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.870
in the very earliest stages thought that
as we start to put back into all the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
as we start to put back into all the
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.319
as we start to put back into all the
calibrations the plots would home in to

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329
calibrations the plots would home in to
 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.090

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100
sank a little more sensible and of
 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.910
sank a little more sensible and of
course as we do those checks it just

course as we do those checks it just
 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.060
course as we do those checks it just
told you no more but not sensible I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070
told you no more but not sensible I
 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.889
told you no more but not sensible I
think I think the flavor of our analysis

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899
think I think the flavor of our analysis
 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.870
think I think the flavor of our analysis
was different yes didn't that I think we

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880
was different yes didn't that I think we
 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.870
was different yes didn't that I think we
had our tool kit and we were going to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
had our tool kit and we were going to
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.240
had our tool kit and we were going to
take the data through that and see the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250
take the data through that and see the
 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.330
take the data through that and see the
answer at the end and when we saw it we

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
answer at the end and when we saw it we
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.429
answer at the end and when we saw it we
were kind of stuck only with maybe we

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439
were kind of stuck only with maybe we
 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.670
were kind of stuck only with maybe we
have made a mistake in a state we have

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680
have made a mistake in a state we have

recalibrate really just want

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080
recalibrate really just want
 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.740
recalibrate really just want
and you're like oh that's not so let's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750
and you're like oh that's not so let's
 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.960
and you're like oh that's not so let's
go through each step I gave and what

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970
go through each step I gave and what
 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.910
go through each step I gave and what
went wrong right so that was me I just

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920
went wrong right so that was me I just
 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.670
went wrong right so that was me I just
said uh all right where'd we miss nice

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
said uh all right where'd we miss nice
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.000
said uh all right where'd we miss nice
look but you should say that and most of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010
look but you should say that and most of
 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.520
look but you should say that and most of
what a scientist does I think is look

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
what a scientist does I think is look
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.110
what a scientist does I think is look
for your own mistakes okay that's not

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120
for your own mistakes okay that's not
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.700
for your own mistakes okay that's not
unusual that you're spending a lot of

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710
unusual that you're spending a lot of
 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.190
unusual that you're spending a lot of
your time trying to figure out is what

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200
your time trying to figure out is what
 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.170
your time trying to figure out is what
I've done today correct is what I did

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
I've done today correct is what I did
 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.870
I've done today correct is what I did
last month correct and sometimes it's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
last month correct and sometimes it's
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.270
last month correct and sometimes it's
this notion that you know you came to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
this notion that you know you came to
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.890
this notion that you know you came to
ask the question so what did you set out

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
ask the question so what did you set out
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.170
ask the question so what did you set out
to prove I don't think any of us have to

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
to prove I don't think any of us have to
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.460
to prove I don't think any of us have to
prove anything you know in the in these

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470
prove anything you know in the in these
 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.960
prove anything you know in the in these
things we actually just don't have to

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970
things we actually just don't have to
 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640
things we actually just don't have to
make a measurement and make measurements

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
make a measurement and make measurements
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.260
make a measurement and make measurements
right we were trying to prove we're

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270
right we were trying to prove we're
 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.090
right we were trying to prove we're
trying to prove was the universe slowing

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100
trying to prove was the universe slowing
 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.470
trying to prove was the universe slowing
down a little or was it slowing down a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480
down a little or was it slowing down a
 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.300
down a little or was it slowing down a
lot you had gone through the idea of

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310
lot you had gone through the idea of
 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.120
lot you had gone through the idea of
testing this I mean we knew we could do

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130
testing this I mean we knew we could do
 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.680
testing this I mean we knew we could do
that but I just kind of figured that was

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690
that but I just kind of figured that was
 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.350
that but I just kind of figured that was
an irrelevant question
