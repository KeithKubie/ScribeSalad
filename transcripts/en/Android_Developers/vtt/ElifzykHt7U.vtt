00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:05.390
PATRICK CLARY:
There are estimated

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.000
to be 35 million
people in the US

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.730
with some level of
motor impairment.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.240
Designing your application to
support accessibility services

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.150
not only opens up your
application to these users,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.830
but it has the
potential to improve

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.240
your design for everyone.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.430
Users with motor impairments
have a wide range

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.370
of conditions, including
spinal cord injuries,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.450
multiple sclerosis,
ALS, cerebral palsy,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.420
essential tremor,
and Parkinson's.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.970
These users may find it
difficult to use a touch

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.270
screen, particularly if your
app relies on small touch

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.770
targets or complex gestures.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.950
Google has developed the
accessibility services Switch

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.940
Access and Voice Access in
order to provide these users

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.200
with alternate means of
operating their devices.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.160
With Switch Access, users press
one or more physical hardware

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.770
buttons to scan through
items on their screen

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.830
and select the one they want.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.820
Voice Access lets users speak
their commands to the device

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.730
in order to tap,
scroll, or enter text.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.605
OK, Google, start Voice Access.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.240
Go home.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.870
Open phone.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.315
Click 17.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.240
Go home.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.200
Tap 8.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.920
Go back.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.280
Swipe right.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.250
By keeping a few design
considerations in mind,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.380
you can radically
transform the quality

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.660
of user interaction
between your app

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.015
and Switch Access
and Voice Access.

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:53.510
A Switch Access user usually
scans the screen from top

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.380
to bottom.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.360
Therefore, it's a good
idea to keep elements

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.490
on the screen
logically organized.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.040
Small touch targets can be
difficult for users to select,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.910
so we recommend that touch
targets be at least 48

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.600
by 48 dp.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.910
In addition, users
can have difficulty

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.860
interacting with
touch targets that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.690
are closely grouped together.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.555
Therefore, we suggest
having low density layouts.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.700
Ensure that clickable and long
clickable items are correctly

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.300
labeled and that the clickable
attribute hasn't been added

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.430
to any non-clickable items.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.060
You can easily try out
Switch Access in your own app

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:45.960
by going to Settings,
Accessibility, Switch Access,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.160
opening Switch Access
settings, and then

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.695
by assigning a volume
key to act as a switch.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.125
You can also use a USB
or Bluetooth keyboard.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760
Then, ensure that you
can perform every action

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.190
in the app with the switch.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.980
Make sure that each item
can be scrolled through,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.840
and it is clear
what each one does.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.630
