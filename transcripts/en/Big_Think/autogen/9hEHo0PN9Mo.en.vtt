00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
discrimination in terms of the work that
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.900
discrimination in terms of the work that
we're doing but largely speaking the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
we're doing but largely speaking the
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.460

upper-class you know white folks who
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340
upper-class you know white folks who
have been leading the charge on this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
have been leading the charge on this
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290
have been leading the charge on this
stuff and I think that's unfortunate i

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
stuff and I think that's unfortunate i
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.790
stuff and I think that's unfortunate i
mean i think there's some kind of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
mean i think there's some kind of
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.460
mean i think there's some kind of
reasonable explanations for that but

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470
reasonable explanations for that but
 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.490
reasonable explanations for that but
it's it's unsustainable because it had a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
it's it's unsustainable because it had a
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.830
it's it's unsustainable because it had a
couple of x first of all we're failing

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
couple of x first of all we're failing
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.130
couple of x first of all we're failing
to reach a large segments of the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
to reach a large segments of the
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530
to reach a large segments of the
population that are actually being even

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
population that are actually being even
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.060
population that are actually being even
more hammered by environmental pollution

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
more hammered by environmental pollution
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.060
more hammered by environmental pollution
than a lot of the kind of you know upper

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
than a lot of the kind of you know upper
 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.719
than a lot of the kind of you know upper
middle-class folks who are who are part

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
middle-class folks who are who are part
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730
middle-class folks who are who are part
of these organizations so they have even

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
of these organizations so they have even
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.370
of these organizations so they have even
more at stake if you live in a turban

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
more at stake if you live in a turban
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.340
more at stake if you live in a turban
area or a low income area whether it's a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
area or a low income area whether it's a
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.010
area or a low income area whether it's a
you know or a rural area and so on a lot

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
you know or a rural area and so on a lot
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.359
you know or a rural area and so on a lot
of times you're more subjected to air

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
of times you're more subjected to air
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.800
of times you're more subjected to air
and water pollution than other

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
and water pollution than other
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.919
and water pollution than other
communities I also think that we have

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929
communities I also think that we have
 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.340
communities I also think that we have
not done a good job of appealing to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
not done a good job of appealing to
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.739
not done a good job of appealing to
folks as well and I think that that's

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749
folks as well and I think that that's
 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.859
folks as well and I think that that's
why we've tended to be vulnerable to the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
why we've tended to be vulnerable to the
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.590
why we've tended to be vulnerable to the
tree hugger or the kind of elitist type

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
tree hugger or the kind of elitist type
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.149
tree hugger or the kind of elitist type
of tag and I think that we fail to do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
of tag and I think that we fail to do
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830
of tag and I think that we fail to do
that you know luckily I think that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
that you know luckily I think that
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.480
that you know luckily I think that
that's really changing first of all a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
that's really changing first of all a
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.940
that's really changing first of all a
lot of environmental justice oriented

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
lot of environmental justice oriented
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.719
lot of environmental justice oriented

that's vitally important and it's long
overdue but I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410
overdue but I
 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.470

environmental problems we have this is
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.450
environmental problems we have this is
no longer a fringe issue this is front

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460
no longer a fringe issue this is front
