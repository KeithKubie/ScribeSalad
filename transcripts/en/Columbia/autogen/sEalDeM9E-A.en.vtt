occurs in the u.s. it's a what an
 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.890
occurs in the u.s. it's a what an
epidemic right the mortality rate is

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900
epidemic right the mortality rate is
 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.560
epidemic right the mortality rate is
usually not a factor because it's the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570
usually not a factor because it's the
 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.020
usually not a factor because it's the
geographic spread that's important but

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030
geographic spread that's important but
 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.120
geographic spread that's important but
many pandemics in the past have had high

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130
many pandemics in the past have had high
 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.570
many pandemics in the past have had high
rates of mortality and they're often

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580
rates of mortality and they're often
 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.910
rates of mortality and they're often
emerging infections associated at the

emerging infections associated at the
 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.610
emerging infections associated at the
human and interface so those are some

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620
human and interface so those are some
 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.160
human and interface so those are some
defining points for a pandemic can

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170
defining points for a pandemic can
 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.320
defining points for a pandemic can
anybody think of any more defining

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
anybody think of any more defining
 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.570
anybody think of any more defining
points you're happy with these okay well

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580
points you're happy with these okay well
 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.270
points you're happy with these okay well
then let's go on because we'll talk

then let's go on because we'll talk
 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.110
then let's go on because we'll talk
about some of the diseases that really

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120
about some of the diseases that really
 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.090
about some of the diseases that really
formed history and made history what are

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100
formed history and made history what are
 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.370
formed history and made history what are
the I want you to think of for diseases

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380
the I want you to think of for diseases
 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.790
the I want you to think of for diseases
that you believe throughout history have

that yellow fever and it still goes on
 

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.310
that yellow fever and it still goes on
today sporadically in Latin America but

today sporadically in Latin America but
 

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.000
today sporadically in Latin America but
also in Africa in parts of Africa and if

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.010
also in Africa in parts of Africa and if
 

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.000
also in Africa in parts of Africa and if
it gets into an urban area it causes

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.010
it gets into an urban area it causes
 

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.660
it gets into an urban area it causes
major threat who knows how yellow fever

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:58.670
major threat who knows how yellow fever
 

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.330
major threat who knows how yellow fever
spreads nobody know yeah

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:01.340
spreads nobody know yeah
 

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.890
spreads nobody know yeah
mosquito yeah it's a disease that's in

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:03.900
mosquito yeah it's a disease that's in
 

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.560
mosquito yeah it's a disease that's in
monkeys that live high in the canopy in

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.570
monkeys that live high in the canopy in
 

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.300
monkeys that live high in the canopy in
the forest and they have their

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.310
the forest and they have their
 

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.340
the forest and they have their
mosquitoes and then there are mosquitoes

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:10.350
mosquitoes and then there are mosquitoes
 

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.620
mosquitoes and then there are mosquitoes
on the ground well when a monkey drops

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:12.630
on the ground well when a monkey drops
 

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.870
on the ground well when a monkey drops
dead with yellow fever and falls down

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880
dead with yellow fever and falls down
 

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.600
dead with yellow fever and falls down
the land mosquitoes can feed on it and

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:17.610
the land mosquitoes can feed on it and
 

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.340
the land mosquitoes can feed on it and
then they feed on humans give them

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:19.350
then they feed on humans give them
 

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.770
then they feed on humans give them
yellow fever and then humans can pass it

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:21.780
yellow fever and then humans can pass it
 

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.030
yellow fever and then humans can pass it
to other humans if they're not sleeping

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040
to other humans if they're not sleeping
 

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.280
to other humans if they're not sleeping
under bed beds so a very important

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:25.290
under bed beds so a very important
 

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.530
under bed beds so a very important
disease that shaped infectious diseases

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540
disease that shaped infectious diseases
 

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.620
disease that shaped infectious diseases
and so there's always been a concern

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:30.630
and so there's always been a concern
 

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.780
and so there's always been a concern
about these diseases throughout the ages

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:32.790
about these diseases throughout the ages
 

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.750
about these diseases throughout the ages
in the 14th century remember the plague

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760
in the 14th century remember the plague
 

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.240
in the 14th century remember the plague
in Venice that was the first time that

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.250
in Venice that was the first time that
 

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.980
in Venice that was the first time that
anybody tried to do anything about it

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:39.990
anybody tried to do anything about it
 

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.920
anybody tried to do anything about it
and what did they try to do quarantine

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:42.930
and what did they try to do quarantine
 

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.470
and what did they try to do quarantine
and who knows what a quarantine is yes

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480
and who knows what a quarantine is yes
 

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.710
and who knows what a quarantine is yes
how many 40 days that's right 40 days

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720
how many 40 days that's right 40 days
 

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.800
how many 40 days that's right 40 days
keep that ship at bay keep it up and the

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:54.810
keep that ship at bay keep it up and the
 

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.350
keep that ship at bay keep it up and the
harbor don't let it in did it work no

00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360
 

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.180
didn't work the rats died they didn't

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.190
didn't work the rats died they didn't
 

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.800
didn't work the rats died they didn't
they had no idea why they were doing

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:03.810
they had no idea why they were doing
 

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.300
they had no idea why they were doing
this they just wanted to keep people out

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.310
this they just wanted to keep people out
 

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.400
this they just wanted to keep people out
thinking that if they kept them 40 days

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.410
thinking that if they kept them 40 days
 

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.530
thinking that if they kept them 40 days
they would either all die if they had

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540
they would either all die if they had
 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.630
they would either all die if they had
plague or they would not have it then

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640
plague or they would not have it then
 

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.850
plague or they would not have it then
they left them in or they took things

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860
they left them in or they took things
 

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.850
they left them in or they took things
out so quarantine was attempted it

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860
out so quarantine was attempted it
 

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.680
out so quarantine was attempted it
didn't work and as you know the

pandemics continued around the world but

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.030
pandemics continued around the world but
 

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.350
pandemics continued around the world but
then in the 19th century there was

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360
then in the 19th century there was
 

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.780
then in the 19th century there was
really a lot of interest in Europe and

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:26.790
really a lot of interest in Europe and
 

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.490
really a lot of interest in Europe and
the Americas and there were ten

and those sanitary conferences ended up

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120
and those sanitary conferences ended up
 

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.960
and those sanitary conferences ended up
with requirements that countries report

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:44.970
with requirements that countries report
 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.360
with requirements that countries report
to each other when a disease one of

to each other when a disease one of
 

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.010

which required that certain measures
were taken at seaports and airports so

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279
were taken at seaports and airports so
 

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:19.139
were taken at seaports and airports so
diff vectors of disease came in they

longer required because it wasn't

longer required because it wasn't
 

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:17.910
longer required because it wasn't
effective but these were the things that

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920
effective but these were the things that
 

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.920
effective but these were the things that
could be done predetermined measures

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:19.930
could be done predetermined measures
 

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.819
could be done predetermined measures
when it was published and here's how it

00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:23.829
when it was published and here's how it
 

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:26.189
when it was published and here's how it
worked a country in countries only could

00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199
worked a country in countries only could
 

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.079
worked a country in countries only could
report cholera plague yellow fever or

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:28.089
report cholera plague yellow fever or
 

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:30.829
report cholera plague yellow fever or
smallpox it was published in the weekly

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839
smallpox it was published in the weekly
 

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.519
smallpox it was published in the weekly
epidemiological record there's the

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:32.529
epidemiological record there's the
 

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:35.069
epidemiological record there's the
publication and the national country the

00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079
publication and the national country the
 

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:37.110
publication and the national country the
country was able to stop it if they

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120
country was able to stop it if they
 

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.160
country was able to stop it if they
wanted to they stopped the operation

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.170
wanted to they stopped the operation
 

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.439
wanted to they stopped the operation
they tried to stop it and other

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:40.449
they tried to stop it and other
 

00:14:40.449 --> 00:14:42.300
they tried to stop it and other
countries could apply predetermined

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:42.310
countries could apply predetermined
 

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.110
countries could apply predetermined
measures a very passive system very very

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120
measures a very passive system very very
 

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.439
measures a very passive system very very
passive system now do you think the

00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:49.449
passive system now do you think the
 

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:51.749
passive system now do you think the
regulations were an effective means of

00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759
regulations were an effective means of
 

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.069
regulations were an effective means of
dealing with the international spread

00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079
dealing with the international spread
 

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:55.019
dealing with the international spread
infectious diseases did they work does

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:55.029
infectious diseases did they work does
 

00:14:55.029 --> 00:15:00.590
infectious diseases did they work does
anybody know

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600
 

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:12.960
anybody have any ideas yes good point

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:12.970
anybody have any ideas yes good point
 

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.180
anybody have any ideas yes good point
that's right especially in today's world

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:15.190
that's right especially in today's world
 

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.610
that's right especially in today's world
that's why in 1969 there was a little

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:17.620
that's why in 1969 there was a little
 

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.080
that's why in 1969 there was a little
bit different thinking there and there

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.090
bit different thinking there and there
 

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.210
bit different thinking there and there
is today so you can be carrying a

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:21.220
is today so you can be carrying a
 

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.800
is today so you can be carrying a
disease from one country to another in

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:22.810
disease from one country to another in
 

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.900
disease from one country to another in
the incubation period and nobody can

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:24.910
the incubation period and nobody can
 

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.330
the incubation period and nobody can
pick it up until you get sick anything

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:27.340
pick it up until you get sick anything
 

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:50.040
pick it up until you get sick anything
else what happened to you you and you

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.050
else what happened to you you and you
 

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.420
else what happened to you you and you
can't even assume that the country has

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:51.430
can't even assume that the country has
 

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.580
can't even assume that the country has
good public health it's a very difficult

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:53.590
good public health it's a very difficult
 

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:59.280
good public health it's a very difficult
issue so I think in general in 2003 and

00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.290
issue so I think in general in 2003 and
 

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.080
issue so I think in general in 2003 and
it's important that we start we stopped

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.090
it's important that we start we stopped
 

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.940
it's important that we start we stopped
at 2003 because that was a turning point

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:02.950
at 2003 because that was a turning point
 

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.930
at 2003 because that was a turning point
in many ways but in 2003 it was clear

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:06.940
in many ways but in 2003 it was clear
 

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.070
in many ways but in 2003 it was clear
that the international health

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:08.080
that the international health
 

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.200
that the international health
regulations were not effective what

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.210
regulations were not effective what
 

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.850
regulations were not effective what
happened if a country refused to report

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:11.860
happened if a country refused to report
 

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.760
happened if a country refused to report
a disease anybody know what do you think

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:17.770
a disease anybody know what do you think
 

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.610
a disease anybody know what do you think
happened yeah there's no international

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:20.620
happened yeah there's no international
 

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.680
happened yeah there's no international
police of course there's no police force

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:22.690
police of course there's no police force
 

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.870
police of course there's no police force
that can recommend go after a country if

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880
that can recommend go after a country if
 

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.700
that can recommend go after a country if
they don't report so countries didn't

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:26.710
they don't report so countries didn't
 

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.650
they don't report so countries didn't
report and they had reason not to report

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:28.660
report and they had reason not to report
 

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.590
report and they had reason not to report
and we'll talk about that first I just

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600
and we'll talk about that first I just
 

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.310
and we'll talk about that first I just
want to say about between 1996 and 2003

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:35.320
want to say about between 1996 and 2003
 

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.560
want to say about between 1996 and 2003

situation well you get a good evidence

00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:09.769
situation well you get a good evidence

and continue which we did and there was

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:18.169
and continue which we did and there was
 

00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:19.869
and continue which we did and there was
a good director general who said yes we

00:25:19.869 --> 00:25:19.879
a good director general who said yes we
 

00:25:19.879 --> 00:25:23.369

yeah yeah so there were certain gaps in
 

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.300
yeah yeah so there were certain gaps in
what's going on yeah there's there lots

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:51.310
what's going on yeah there's there lots
 

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:54.300
what's going on yeah there's there lots
of gaps in them but they are regulations

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:54.310
of gaps in them but they are regulations
 

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.020
of gaps in them but they are regulations
they're international law but

is the wrong slide I'm sorry this should

is the wrong slide I'm sorry this should
be h5n1 and it should be Phase three

be h5n1 and it should be Phase three
 

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.390
be h5n1 and it should be Phase three
because h5n1 was a Phase three alert

back in 2007 it was a Phase three
this is the wrong slide so it was a

this is the wrong slide so it was a
 

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.350
this is the wrong slide so it was a

there was only infrequent spread
 

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.770
there was only infrequent spread
remember this is a disease that comes

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:37.780
remember this is a disease that comes
 

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.560
remember this is a disease that comes
from chickens into humans and it was

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:54.290
public health risks this is a
 

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.040
public health risks this is a
requirement w-h-o must be sure that

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:57.050
requirement w-h-o must be sure that
 

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.620
requirement w-h-o must be sure that
that's met the only way that you can

00:40:59.620 --> 00:40:59.630
that's met the only way that you can
 

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.420
that's met the only way that you can
prevent protect against control and

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:01.430
prevent protect against control and
 

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.010
prevent protect against control and
provide a public health response to the

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:03.020
provide a public health response to the
 

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.050
provide a public health response to the
International spread of disease is to

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:05.060
International spread of disease is to
 

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.600
International spread of disease is to
know where that disease is occurring to

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:07.610
know where that disease is occurring to
 

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.450
know where that disease is occurring to
know where h5n1 was occurring you needed

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:10.460
know where h5n1 was occurring you needed
 

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.340
know where h5n1 was occurring you needed
to have laboratory tests that could

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:12.350
to have laboratory tests that could
 

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.770
to have laboratory tests that could
detect h5n1 and the only way you could

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:14.780
detect h5n1 and the only way you could
 

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.560
detect h5n1 and the only way you could
develop those tests was if you had

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:16.570
develop those tests was if you had
 

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.090
develop those tests was if you had
viruses that you could test them against

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:19.100
viruses that you could test them against
 

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.520
viruses that you could test them against
so number one you needed to add those

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:21.530
so number one you needed to add those
 

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.500
so number one you needed to add those
viruses coming into w-h-o

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:23.510
viruses coming into w-h-o
 

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:27.610
viruses coming into w-h-o
in addition w the the there was a

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:27.620
in addition w the the there was a
 

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.320
in addition w the the there was a
requirement to protect in the only way

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:29.330
requirement to protect in the only way
 

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.610
requirement to protect in the only way
you can protect is with vaccine the only

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:33.620
you can protect is with vaccine the only
 

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.990
you can protect is with vaccine the only
way you could get a vaccine was to

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000
way you could get a vaccine was to
 

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.420
way you could get a vaccine was to
develop a strain which could be used to

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:37.430
develop a strain which could be used to
 

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.610
develop a strain which could be used to
develop that gene now think about the

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:39.620
develop that gene now think about the
 

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.590
develop that gene now think about the
h5n1 virus what does it do to chickens

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:43.600
h5n1 virus what does it do to chickens
 

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:49.060
h5n1 virus what does it do to chickens
kills how is influenza vaccine made it's

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:49.070
kills how is influenza vaccine made it's
 

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.450
kills how is influenza vaccine made it's
made in eggs

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460
made in eggs
 

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.660
made in eggs
groaning fertilized eggs and embryos if

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:53.670
groaning fertilized eggs and embryos if
 

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.490
groaning fertilized eggs and embryos if
you have a virus that kills chickens you

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500
you have a virus that kills chickens you
 

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.710
you have a virus that kills chickens you
can't grow it in eggs it has to be

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720
can't grow it in eggs it has to be
 

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.720
can't grow it in eggs it has to be
genetically modified in a way that it

00:41:59.720 --> 00:41:59.730
genetically modified in a way that it
 

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:01.099
genetically modified in a way that it
won't kill those eggs so you can develop

00:42:01.099 --> 00:42:01.109
won't kill those eggs so you can develop
 

00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:03.380
won't kill those eggs so you can develop
a vaccine the only way you can do that

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:03.390
a vaccine the only way you can do that
 

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.079
a vaccine the only way you can do that
is if you have live virus and use it for

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:06.089
is if you have live virus and use it for
 

00:42:06.089 --> 00:42:08.510
is if you have live virus and use it for
those vaccines so there was every reason

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520
those vaccines so there was every reason
 

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:13.040
those vaccines so there was every reason
that Indonesia had to share that vaccine

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.050
that Indonesia had to share that vaccine
 

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.460
that Indonesia had to share that vaccine
it said it right here and x2 helped to

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:16.470
it said it right here and x2 helped to
 

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.320
it said it right here and x2 helped to
determine if an event constitutes an

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:18.330
determine if an event constitutes an
 

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.839
determine if an event constitutes an
emergency requires joint risk assessment

00:42:20.839 --> 00:42:20.849
emergency requires joint risk assessment
 

00:42:20.849 --> 00:42:23.690
emergency requires joint risk assessment
a whole series of reasons why that virus

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700
a whole series of reasons why that virus
 

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.339
a whole series of reasons why that virus
was needed and clearly Indonesia was in

00:42:28.339 --> 00:42:28.349
was needed and clearly Indonesia was in
 

00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:30.140
was needed and clearly Indonesia was in
abeyance of the international health

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:30.150
abeyance of the international health

regulations that had just been revised
 

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:36.010
regulations that had just been revised
through a tremendous amount of work did

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:36.020
through a tremendous amount of work did
 

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.160
through a tremendous amount of work did
w-h-o countries decide to use these

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.170
w-h-o countries decide to use these
 

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.990
w-h-o countries decide to use these
regulations to enforce reporting or to

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000
regulations to enforce reporting or to
 

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.440
regulations to enforce reporting or to
say let's get on with the job no

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:45.450
say let's get on with the job no
 

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.930
say let's get on with the job no
countries decided instead through a

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940
countries decided instead through a
 

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:51.859
countries decided instead through a
resolution less strong to develop an

00:42:51.859 --> 00:42:51.869
resolution less strong to develop an
 

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:54.020
resolution less strong to develop an
intergovernmental process which has

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:54.030
intergovernmental process which has
 

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:58.700
intergovernmental process which has
involved meetings since 2007 and you can

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:58.710
involved meetings since 2007 and you can
 

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.280
involved meetings since 2007 and you can
see that the Intergovernmental meetings

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:01.290
see that the Intergovernmental meetings
 

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:04.730
see that the Intergovernmental meetings
have now ended in 2011 and they finally

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740
have now ended in 2011 and they finally
 

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.520
have now ended in 2011 and they finally
come to a way of maybe sustaining a

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:07.530
come to a way of maybe sustaining a
 

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.140
come to a way of maybe sustaining a
little bit of this but still haven't met

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:09.150
little bit of this but still haven't met
 

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.720
little bit of this but still haven't met
the requirement for pandemic vaccine so

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:11.730
the requirement for pandemic vaccine so
 

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.300
the requirement for pandemic vaccine so
a whole series of things that cost over

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:14.310
a whole series of things that cost over
 

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.910
a whole series of things that cost over
five million dollars instead of using

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920
five million dollars instead of using
 

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.800
five million dollars instead of using
the international health regulation so

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:18.810
the international health regulation so
 

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:22.300
the international health regulation so
countries may not use it and I guess I

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:22.310
countries may not use it and I guess I
 

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.560
countries may not use it and I guess I
asked you why you thought they chose not

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:24.570
asked you why you thought they chose not
 

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:26.349
asked you why you thought they chose not
to use it

00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359
to use it
 

00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:28.609
to use it
they worked hard to revise them why

00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619
they worked hard to revise them why
 

00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:30.620
they worked hard to revise them why
didn't they use them anybody have any

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:30.630
didn't they use them anybody have any
 

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:36.980
didn't they use them anybody have any
ideas well think of the US this is the

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:36.990
ideas well think of the US this is the
 

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.920
ideas well think of the US this is the
u.s. one people to put sanctions on them

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:39.930
u.s. one people to put sanctions on them
 

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.020
u.s. one people to put sanctions on them
if they don't report a disease and do

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:42.030
if they don't report a disease and do
 

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:45.109
if they don't report a disease and do
they report all diseases who knows they

00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119
they report all diseases who knows they
 

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:48.200
they report all diseases who knows they
don't sometimes so you know countries

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:48.210
don't sometimes so you know countries
 

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.240
don't sometimes so you know countries
when it came to implementing these are

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.250
when it came to implementing these are
 

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.890
when it came to implementing these are
enforcing these regulations all of a

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900
enforcing these regulations all of a
 

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.770
enforcing these regulations all of a
sudden put themselves in the seat of

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780
sudden put themselves in the seat of
 

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.829
sudden put themselves in the seat of
Indonesia and said well if we do this to

00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839
Indonesia and said well if we do this to
 

00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:59.420
Indonesia and said well if we do this to
Indonesia maybe they'll do it back to us

00:43:59.420 --> 00:43:59.430
Indonesia maybe they'll do it back to us
 

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.260
Indonesia maybe they'll do it back to us
and so in the end they made it a less

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:03.270
and so in the end they made it a less
 

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.240
and so in the end they made it a less
strong response and they didn't use the

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:05.250
strong response and they didn't use the
 

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.250
strong response and they didn't use the
international health regulations are

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260
international health regulations are
 

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.750
international health regulations are
there any questions at this point I

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760
there any questions at this point I
 

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.859
there any questions at this point I
think we're probably running out of time

00:44:09.859 --> 00:44:09.869
think we're probably running out of time
 

00:44:09.869 --> 00:44:16.660
think we're probably running out of time
are we - and when do we 20 we and 7:00

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:16.670
are we - and when do we 20 we and 7:00
 

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.120
are we - and when do we 20 we and 7:00
7:30 okay so are there any any

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:20.130
7:30 okay so are there any any
 

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.430
7:30 okay so are there any any
observations at this point how could you

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440
observations at this point how could you
 

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.840
observations at this point how could you
make sure they're used the next time is

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:23.850
make sure they're used the next time is
 

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:27.560
make sure they're used the next time is
there any way it's really tough

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:27.570
there any way it's really tough
 

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.240
there any way it's really tough
it's really tough we've got a beautiful

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:29.250
it's really tough we've got a beautiful
 

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.100
it's really tough we've got a beautiful
international tool just like we have a

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.110
international tool just like we have a
 

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:34.070
international tool just like we have a
beautiful tobacco convention and now the

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:34.080
beautiful tobacco convention and now the
 

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.720
beautiful tobacco convention and now the
u.s. is going to decide whether or not

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:35.730
u.s. is going to decide whether or not
 

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:37.640
u.s. is going to decide whether or not
they're going to sign up to that

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:37.650
they're going to sign up to that
 

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.890
they're going to sign up to that
convention but it's really tough to make

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900
convention but it's really tough to make
 

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.980
convention but it's really tough to make
things happen internationally very tough

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:42.990
things happen internationally very tough
 

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.130
things happen internationally very tough
but anyway um the regulations are there

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.140
but anyway um the regulations are there
 

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.200
but anyway um the regulations are there
and they're there just in time because

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:48.210
and they're there just in time because
 

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.109
and they're there just in time because
of the emerging infections agenda and

00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119
of the emerging infections agenda and
 

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:53.510
of the emerging infections agenda and
you all know this did somebody talk to

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520
you all know this did somebody talk to
 

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.030
you all know this did somebody talk to
you about emerging infections well these

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040
you about emerging infections well these
 

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.830
you about emerging infections well these
are the important ones for international

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:57.840
are the important ones for international
 

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.810
are the important ones for international
health regulations because they zoom

00:44:59.810 --> 00:44:59.820
health regulations because they zoom
 

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.630
health regulations because they zoom
across borders very easily and they

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640
across borders very easily and they
 

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.100
across borders very easily and they
usually occur at the human-animal

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:04.110
usually occur at the human-animal
 

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.320
usually occur at the human-animal
interface and this shows you some of the

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:06.330
interface and this shows you some of the
 

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.250
interface and this shows you some of the
selected ones since 1976 and you can see

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260
selected ones since 1976 and you can see
 

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.680
selected ones since 1976 and you can see
that there are many different ones

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:11.690
that there are many different ones
 

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:17.000
that there are many different ones
occurring Jones at all in nature in 2008

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:17.010

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.580
occurring Jones at all in nature in 2008
showed that these emerging infections

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:19.590
showed that these emerging infections
 

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.160
showed that these emerging infections
were all classes of organism that we

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:22.170
were all classes of organism that we
 

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.770
were all classes of organism that we
know their bacterial their viral their

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780
know their bacterial their viral their
 

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.840
know their bacterial their viral their
parasitic and their fungal all these

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:26.850
parasitic and their fungal all these
 

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.700
parasitic and their fungal all these
emerging infections can be of any and

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:28.710
emerging infections can be of any and
 

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.130
emerging infections can be of any and
they occur everywhere in the world and

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140
they occur everywhere in the world and
 

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.380
they occur everywhere in the world and
there are some hotspots but they do

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:33.390
there are some hotspots but they do
 

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:37.820
there are some hotspots but they do
occur everywhere in the world now the

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:37.830
occur everywhere in the world now the
 

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.650
occur everywhere in the world now the
reason that these diseases are so

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:39.660
reason that these diseases are so
 

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.540
reason that these diseases are so
difficult to deal with is because they

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:41.550
difficult to deal with is because they
 

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.080
difficult to deal with is because they
can take three different pathways

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:44.090
can take three different pathways
 

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:48.080
can take three different pathways
anybody know those pathways well the

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.090
anybody know those pathways well the
 

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.240
anybody know those pathways well the
first pathway is they can cross the

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:50.250
first pathway is they can cross the
 

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:51.620
first pathway is they can cross the
barrier between an animal and a human

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:51.630
barrier between an animal and a human
 

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.720
barrier between an animal and a human
they infect a human and they go no

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:53.730
they infect a human and they go no
 

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:54.170
they infect a human and they go no

what's a good example of that does
 

00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.880
what's a good example of that does
anybody know any examples of that sorry

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:00.890
anybody know any examples of that sorry

let's see West Nile comes yeah I guess
it could be spread from human to human

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380
it could be spread from human to human
 

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.070
it could be spread from human to human
by mosquitoes but it's usually from an

influenza viruses and poultry but then
there's one that emerges and it

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:10.450
there's one that emerges and it
 

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.630
there's one that emerges and it
continues transmission and then it

continues transmission and then it
 

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.790
continues transmission and then it
becomes endemic and you've already said

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800
becomes endemic and you've already said
 

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.400

the classic example of that is HIV and
 

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:21.810
the classic example of that is HIV and
this shows you HIV it probably came most

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:21.820
this shows you HIV it probably came most
 

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.960
this shows you HIV it probably came most
likely came from non-human primate and

did this outbreak occur at this time

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:42.380

that's one thing
 

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:49.339
that's one thing
breeding ground for mosquitoes what else

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:49.349
 

00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:53.599
okay drowns cattle yeah it could drown

line up five holes and so this was the

00:52:15.859 --> 00:52:15.869
line up five holes and so this was the
 

00:52:15.869 --> 00:52:17.390
line up five holes and so this was the
beginning of a Swiss cheese event and

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400
beginning of a Swiss cheese event and
 

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.479
beginning of a Swiss cheese event and
it's a very complicated event first of

00:52:20.479 --> 00:52:20.489
it's a very complicated event first of
 

00:52:20.489 --> 00:52:22.370
it's a very complicated event first of
all there was flooding for humans and

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:22.380
all there was flooding for humans and

animals were infected with Rift Valley
 

00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:27.799
animals were infected with Rift Valley
fever and there was an increase in

00:52:27.799 --> 00:52:27.809
fever and there was an increase in
 

00:52:27.809 --> 00:52:29.539
fever and there was an increase in
mosquitoes that could transmit the virus

00:52:29.539 --> 00:52:29.549
mosquitoes that could transmit the virus
 

00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:33.229
mosquitoes that could transmit the virus
from animals to humans you with me the

00:52:33.229 --> 00:52:33.239
from animals to humans you with me the
 

00:52:33.239 --> 00:52:37.969
from animals to humans you with me the
next whole routine vaccination of Rift

00:52:37.969 --> 00:52:37.979
next whole routine vaccination of Rift
 

00:52:37.979 --> 00:52:39.829
next whole routine vaccination of Rift
Valley fever in East Africa this is a

00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839
Valley fever in East Africa this is a
 

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:41.599
Valley fever in East Africa this is a
requirement if you want to export

00:52:41.599 --> 00:52:41.609
requirement if you want to export
 

00:52:41.609 --> 00:52:43.309
requirement if you want to export
animals from East Africa they have to be

00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319
animals from East Africa they have to be
 

00:52:43.319 --> 00:52:45.680
animals from East Africa they have to be
vaccinated against Rift Valley fever and

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:45.690
vaccinated against Rift Valley fever and
 

00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:47.989
vaccinated against Rift Valley fever and
this shows you the vaccination that was

00:52:47.989 --> 00:52:47.999
this shows you the vaccination that was
 

00:52:47.999 --> 00:52:50.539
this shows you the vaccination that was
occurring in East Africa but there was

viruses belong to a country and if that

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:30.569
viruses belong to a country and if that
 

00:59:30.569 --> 00:59:32.329

they will get a global response yeah
 

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:03.460
they will get a global response yeah
they also hopefully the bilateral donors

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:03.470
they also hopefully the bilateral donors
 

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.589

better job than so yeah so there is an
incentive and if countries take the

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400
incentive and if countries take the
 

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.130
incentive and if countries take the
international health regulations and go

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:15.140
international health regulations and go
 

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.349

earlier slides in your talk you

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:48.530
earlier slides in your talk you
 

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:51.640
earlier slides in your talk you
mentioned defining first of all defining

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:51.650
mentioned defining first of all defining
 

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:53.440
mentioned defining first of all defining
a pandemic and then what you saw is the

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:53.450
a pandemic and then what you saw is the
 

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:55.270
a pandemic and then what you saw is the
four most important pandemics and I was

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280
four most important pandemics and I was
 

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.300
four most important pandemics and I was
just wondering why and I'll mention just

01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:58.310
just wondering why and I'll mention just
 

01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:00.099
just wondering why and I'll mention just
a detail or two but why you didn't

01:03:00.099 --> 01:03:00.109
a detail or two but why you didn't
 

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:03.430
a detail or two but why you didn't
include the the 1918 influenza pandemic

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440
include the the 1918 influenza pandemic
 

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.230
include the the 1918 influenza pandemic
on that list because in your definition

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240
on that list because in your definition
 

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.960
on that list because in your definition
you said that something about novel

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:07.970
you said that something about novel
 

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:09.940
you said that something about novel
antigenic recognition and like novel

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:09.950
antigenic recognition and like novel
 

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.770
antigenic recognition and like novel
that there is no population immunity

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:11.780
that there is no population immunity
 

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.050
that there is no population immunity
before him and I said before that you

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:14.060
before him and I said before that you
 

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.490
before him and I said before that you
listed to my knowledge they're not

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:15.500
listed to my knowledge they're not
 

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.230

cyclic diseases like they don't recur

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240
cyclic diseases like they don't recur
 

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.230
cyclic diseases like they don't recur
every season and I think that the 1918

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240
every season and I think that the 1918
 

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.730
every season and I think that the 1918
pandemic was a really good example of

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:21.740
pandemic was a really good example of
 

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.609
pandemic was a really good example of
how like antigenic drift and things like

01:03:24.609 --> 01:03:24.619
how like antigenic drift and things like
 

01:03:24.619 --> 01:03:26.660
how like antigenic drift and things like
that can cause a pen

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:26.670
that can cause a pen
 

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.210
that can cause a pen
make out of normal epidemic recurring

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220
make out of normal epidemic recurring
 

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.950
make out of normal epidemic recurring
diseases sigh I feel like that would be

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960
diseases sigh I feel like that would be
 

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.570
diseases sigh I feel like that would be
extremely important let me try to answer

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:32.580
extremely important let me try to answer

before the 20th century and and flu

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:42.050
before the 20th century and and flu
 

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:44.810
before the 20th century and and flu
probably occurred in pandemics that it

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:44.820
probably occurred in pandemics that it
 

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.210
probably occurred in pandemics that it
was never really described as was

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220
was never really described as was
 

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:51.230

cholera plague yellow fever those were

01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240
cholera plague yellow fever those were
 

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.360
cholera plague yellow fever those were
really clearly described in the

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:53.370
really clearly described in the
 

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.000
really clearly described in the
literature but flu was never really

literature but flu was never really
 

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:57.920
literature but flu was never really
clearly described it so it didn't play a

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:57.930
clearly described it so it didn't play a
 

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:00.320
clearly described it so it didn't play a
major role in the ihr or in the

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:00.330
major role in the ihr or in the
 

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:04.700

thank you it was very important yes
 

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:10.070
thank you it was very important yes
right and the other one is so you

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:10.080
right and the other one is so you
 

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.010
right and the other one is so you
discussed the ihr revisions during 2005

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020
discussed the ihr revisions during 2005
 

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.900
discussed the ihr revisions during 2005
and you said that regarding like

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:14.910
and you said that regarding like
 

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:17.060
and you said that regarding like
specific diseases and response plans and

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:17.070
specific diseases and response plans and
 

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.660
specific diseases and response plans and
things like that specific things were

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:20.670
things like that specific things were
 

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:22.370
things like that specific things were
highlighted like SARS for example and

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380
highlighted like SARS for example and
 

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.100
highlighted like SARS for example and
new incidences of the flu and I was just

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:25.110
new incidences of the flu and I was just
 

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.410
new incidences of the flu and I was just
wondering why you thought that this

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420
wondering why you thought that this
 

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.750
wondering why you thought that this
wasn't made more fluid in other words it

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760
wasn't made more fluid in other words it
 

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.090
wasn't made more fluid in other words it
wasn't left open completely to say any

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:32.100
wasn't left open completely to say any
 

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.490
wasn't left open completely to say any
novel outbreak like SARS for example was

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500
novel outbreak like SARS for example was
 

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.900
novel outbreak like SARS for example was
a novel outbreak so they'll have

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:35.910
a novel outbreak so they'll have
 

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.880
a novel outbreak so they'll have
precedence over any novel outbreak to

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:37.890
precedence over any novel outbreak to
 

01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:39.770
precedence over any novel outbreak to
take what measures they see fit SARS

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780
take what measures they see fit SARS
 

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.510
take what measures they see fit SARS
would have fit into that decision tree

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520
would have fit into that decision tree
 

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.400
would have fit into that decision tree
was made the decision tree is very

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:43.410
was made the decision tree is very
 

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.320
was made the decision tree is very
important and SARS would have fit the

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:45.330
important and SARS would have fit the
 

01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:47.470
important and SARS would have fit the
criteria in that decision tree in fact I

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480
criteria in that decision tree in fact I
 

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.370

occurred in the past 10 years and trying
 

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.200
occurred in the past 10 years and trying
to see how many of those would have fit

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:00.210
to see how many of those would have fit
 

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:02.570
to see how many of those would have fit
into the these are outbreaks which were

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:02.580
into the these are outbreaks which were
 

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:04.730
into the these are outbreaks which were
recorded as crossing borders how many

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740
recorded as crossing borders how many
 

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.620
recorded as crossing borders how many
would have fit into that decision tree

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:06.630
would have fit into that decision tree
 

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:10.820
would have fit into that decision tree
so there you know there it does include

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:10.830
so there you know there it does include
 

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:12.560
so there you know there it does include
other diseases and stars would have

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:12.570
other diseases and stars would have
 

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:17.990
other diseases and stars would have
probably fit into that so I have a

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000
probably fit into that so I have a
 

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.590
probably fit into that so I have a
question regarding the the health

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:21.600
question regarding the the health
 

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.160
question regarding the the health
ministers request for funds for creating

ministers request for funds for creating
 

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:27.470
ministers request for funds for creating
a local collaborative center I believe

01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480
a local collaborative center I believe
 

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.500
a local collaborative center I believe
to term those and and in general

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:30.510
to term those and and in general
 

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.750
to term those and and in general
creating more domestic and regional

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760
creating more domestic and regional
 

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.700
creating more domestic and regional
capabilities for for developing vaccines

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:35.710
capabilities for for developing vaccines
 

01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.150
capabilities for for developing vaccines
on a local level it seems to me that by

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160
on a local level it seems to me that by
 

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.560
on a local level it seems to me that by
starting the monitor and moving away

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:40.570
starting the monitor and moving away
 

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.780
starting the monitor and moving away
from self reporting the initiative has

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:42.790
from self reporting the initiative has
 

01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:44.700
from self reporting the initiative has
kind of been taken away from the

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:44.710
kind of been taken away from the
 

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:47.040
kind of been taken away from the
individual countries and it's it's more

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:47.050
individual countries and it's it's more
 

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:50.790
individual countries and it's it's more
of an active approach as you mentioned

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:50.800
of an active approach as you mentioned
 

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.460
of an active approach as you mentioned
so really countries can't decide anymore

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:53.470
so really countries can't decide anymore
 

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.670
so really countries can't decide anymore
whether or not to to report so it seems

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680
whether or not to to report so it seems
 

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.280
whether or not to to report so it seems
to me it would make sense to provide

01:05:59.280 --> 01:05:59.290
to me it would make sense to provide
 

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.500
to me it would make sense to provide
these capabilities and I don't know

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:01.510
these capabilities and I don't know
 

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:03.630
these capabilities and I don't know
maybe we can share some some light into

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640
maybe we can share some some light into
 

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.020
maybe we can share some some light into
whether or not that's feasible you know

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:06.030
whether or not that's feasible you know
 

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:08.310
whether or not that's feasible you know
electronic reporting in itself is

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:08.320
electronic reporting in itself is
 

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.589
electronic reporting in itself is
incentivizing because countries don't

01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599
incentivizing because countries don't
 

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.000
incentivizing because countries don't
want somebody else to report their

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:12.010
want somebody else to report their
 

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.370
want somebody else to report their
diseases today they'd rather report it

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:14.380
diseases today they'd rather report it
 

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.210
diseases today they'd rather report it
first and so what's happened is I showed

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:18.220
first and so what's happened is I showed
 

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.520
first and so what's happened is I showed
you a graph of 2003 if you look today

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:20.530
you a graph of 2003 if you look today
 

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.190
you a graph of 2003 if you look today
the majority of in fact of disease is

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200
the majority of in fact of disease is
 

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.740
the majority of in fact of disease is
being reported by countries it's changed

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:25.750
being reported by countries it's changed
 

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.630
being reported by countries it's changed
again it's come back to countries but

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640
again it's come back to countries but
 

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.010
again it's come back to countries but
now they're reporting more completely

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:29.020
now they're reporting more completely
 

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.770
now they're reporting more completely
and less is being detected by electronic

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:31.780
and less is being detected by electronic
 

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.630
and less is being detected by electronic
means it's being detected but it's

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640
means it's being detected but it's
 

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.329
means it's being detected but it's
already been reported so there has been

01:06:36.329 --> 01:06:36.339
already been reported so there has been
 

01:06:36.339 --> 01:06:37.980
already been reported so there has been
it changes that does that answer your

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:37.990
it changes that does that answer your
 

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:40.170
it changes that does that answer your
question I was wondering whether or not

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:40.180
question I was wondering whether or not
 

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.210
question I was wondering whether or not
funds are going to be made available or

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:42.220
funds are going to be made available or
 

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.099
funds are going to be made available or
whether that the process started of

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:44.109
whether that the process started of
 

01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:46.260
whether that the process started of
funds being made available for countries

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:46.270
funds being made available for countries
 

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:48.270
funds being made available for countries
such as Indonesia to create the messy

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:48.280
such as Indonesia to create the messy
 

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.599
such as Indonesia to create the messy
capabilities of of creating vaccines and

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:51.609
capabilities of of creating vaccines and
 

01:06:51.609 --> 01:06:53.430
capabilities of of creating vaccines and
kind of tackling the problem when it

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440
kind of tackling the problem when it
 

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.790
kind of tackling the problem when it
occurs there actually were the u.s. and

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:56.800
occurs there actually were the u.s. and
 

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.990
occurs there actually were the u.s. and
Japan provided funding to w-h-o to help

developing countries transfer technology

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:02.500
developing countries transfer technology
 

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.290
developing countries transfer technology
for influenza vaccine for pandemic

01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:04.300
for influenza vaccine for pandemic
 

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.810
for influenza vaccine for pandemic
vaccine and that program went under way

01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:06.820
vaccine and that program went under way
 

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.790
vaccine and that program went under way
it was very difficult program because

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:08.800
it was very difficult program because
 

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.380
it was very difficult program because
industry dug its heels in in most

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:10.390
industry dug its heels in in most
 

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:11.940
industry dug its heels in in most
instances and didn't want to transfer

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:11.950
instances and didn't want to transfer
 

01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:13.980
instances and didn't want to transfer
the technology because their solution

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:13.990
the technology because their solution
 

01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:16.020
the technology because their solution
was to develop their own companies their

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:16.030
was to develop their own companies their
 

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.030
was to develop their own companies their
own factories in those countries that

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:18.040
own factories in those countries that
 

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.940
own factories in those countries that
and have nationally do it so it wasn't

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:20.950
and have nationally do it so it wasn't
 

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:23.130
and have nationally do it so it wasn't
entirely effective but there was a

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:23.140
entirely effective but there was a
 

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.109
entirely effective but there was a
transfer of technology on a couple

01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119
transfer of technology on a couple
 

01:07:25.119 --> 01:07:27.990
transfer of technology on a couple
instances into Indonesia and Thailand

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000
instances into Indonesia and Thailand
 

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.050
instances into Indonesia and Thailand
one was from Russia technology transfer

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:31.060
one was from Russia technology transfer
 

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.280
one was from Russia technology transfer
into

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:32.290
into
 

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:35.829
into
Thailand and Indonesia from Japan so

01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839
Thailand and Indonesia from Japan so
 

01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:37.990
Thailand and Indonesia from Japan so
there were some successful and the World

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000
there were some successful and the World
 

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.549
there were some successful and the World
Bank bought into that as well so the

01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559
Bank bought into that as well so the
 

01:07:39.559 --> 01:07:41.500
Bank bought into that as well so the
countries could develop industries to

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:41.510
countries could develop industries to
 

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:43.900
countries could develop industries to
produce vaccines is that and then did

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:43.910
produce vaccines is that and then did
 

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.520
produce vaccines is that and then did
those countries then just choose to

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:45.530
those countries then just choose to
 

01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:47.740
those countries then just choose to
violate patents like Brazil would in

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:47.750
violate patents like Brazil would in
 

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:50.170
violate patents like Brazil would in
some cases or did they interesting flu

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:50.180
some cases or did they interesting flu
 

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.390
some cases or did they interesting flu
vaccine is not that there's nothing

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400
vaccine is not that there's nothing
 

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.789
vaccine is not that there's nothing
patented in flu vaccine today it's only

01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799
patented in flu vaccine today it's only
 

01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:56.770
patented in flu vaccine today it's only
when you have new genetic material it's

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:56.780
when you have new genetic material it's
 

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.289
when you have new genetic material it's
so so there were no patents involved it

01:07:59.289 --> 01:07:59.299
so so there were no patents involved it
 

01:07:59.299 --> 01:08:01.240
so so there were no patents involved it
was just the fact that what was patented

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:01.250
was just the fact that what was patented
 

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:03.910
was just the fact that what was patented
were procedures and some of the kind of

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920
were procedures and some of the kind of
 

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.230
were procedures and some of the kind of
companies wouldn't transfer those

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240
companies wouldn't transfer those
 

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:11.589
companies wouldn't transfer those
procedures thank you

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:04.809

surely that can be a model used it may

01:09:04.809 --> 01:09:04.819
surely that can be a model used it may

be fairly sophisticated now of course we

01:09:06.849 --> 01:09:06.859
be fairly sophisticated now of course we
 

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:10.150
be fairly sophisticated now of course we
know that the chances of what's in a

01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:10.160
know that the chances of what's in a
 

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.490

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:12.500
plastic bucket from some Island will
 

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:17.079
plastic bucket from some Island will
probably not turn out to be a sellable

01:09:17.079 --> 01:09:17.089
probably not turn out to be a sellable
 

01:09:17.089 --> 01:09:20.140
probably not turn out to be a sellable
drug but anyway there's there's a lot of

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:20.150
drug but anyway there's there's a lot of
 

01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:23.140

expertise there that that might be it

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:23.150
expertise there that that might be it
 

01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:27.300

for cancer yeah and you know I think

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:37.670
for cancer yeah and you know I think
 

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.910
for cancer yeah and you know I think
that's that's reasonable that's how we

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920
that's that's reasonable that's how we
 

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.439
that's that's reasonable that's how we
got a new ant

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:41.449

we can't produce it but those things are
 

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.390
we can't produce it but those things are
very important yeah and you know

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400
very important yeah and you know

much I'm just wondering how long does

the ihr remain relevant in terms of

the ihr remain relevant in terms of
 

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:17.260
the ihr remain relevant in terms of
endemic diseases you look at the case of

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:17.270
endemic diseases you look at the case of
 

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.229
endemic diseases you look at the case of
HIV clearly HIV isn't on the list but

01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239
HIV clearly HIV isn't on the list but
 

01:11:20.239 --> 01:11:23.169
HIV clearly HIV isn't on the list but
h5n1 is h5n1 s been around for 14 years

01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:23.179
h5n1 is h5n1 s been around for 14 years
 

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:25.000
h5n1 is h5n1 s been around for 14 years
and clearly some would argue that is

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:25.010
and clearly some would argue that is
 

01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:26.800
and clearly some would argue that is

the hir remain relevant to those

the hir remain relevant to those
 

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.540
the hir remain relevant to those
situations and and how do you how do you

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:31.550
situations and and how do you how do you
 

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:33.250

determine if it is a disease become

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:33.260
determine if it is a disease become
 

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.160
determine if it is a disease become
endemic or not early yeah it has to be a

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:36.170
endemic or not early yeah it has to be a
 

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:38.419
endemic or not early yeah it has to be a
disease which is is new

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:38.429
disease which is is new
 

01:11:38.429 --> 01:11:40.399

newly spreading HIV doesn't qualify

01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:40.409
newly spreading HIV doesn't qualify
 

01:11:40.409 --> 01:11:44.750
newly spreading HIV doesn't qualify
because if HIV had been detected much

01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760
because if HIV had been detected much
 

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.000
because if HIV had been detected much
much earlier back in the early 19th 20th

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:47.010

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:48.709
much earlier back in the early 19th 20th
century then it maybe something could

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719
century then it maybe something could
 

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.419
century then it maybe something could
have been done but by the time it was

01:11:50.419 --> 01:11:50.429
have been done but by the time it was
 

01:11:50.429 --> 01:11:51.860
have been done but by the time it was
detected it was already spread

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:51.870
detected it was already spread
 

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:52.640
detected it was already spread
throughout the world

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:52.650
throughout the world
 

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.550
throughout the world
so HIV wouldn't have fit in that but you

01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560
so HIV wouldn't have fit in that but you
 

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.010
so HIV wouldn't have fit in that but you
know I think that the HIV experience is

01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020
know I think that the HIV experience is
 

01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.750
know I think that the HIV experience is
what made countries more interested in

the spread of diseases so I think it

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:04.110
the spread of diseases so I think it
 

01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:06.830
the spread of diseases so I think it

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:14.690
 

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:21.020

afterward and you added to that it's
 

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:43.939
afterward and you added to that it's
sort of like the rule about breaking

with it okay well in both cases it seems
to me you know you're presenting in a

01:13:58.459 --> 01:13:58.469
to me you know you're presenting in a
 

01:13:58.469 --> 01:14:00.890
to me you know you're presenting in a
very positive way how it is that you

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900
very positive way how it is that you
 

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.629
very positive way how it is that you
need to be on you know you need to be

initiative and so on and that's all
 

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.660
initiative and so on and that's all
commendable but can you think of some

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:08.670
commendable but can you think of some
 

01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.669
commendable but can you think of some
examples where you know that readiness

01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679
examples where you know that readiness
 

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:13.520
examples where you know that readiness
to break the rules had had less salutary

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:13.530
to break the rules had had less salutary
 

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:16.069
to break the rules had had less salutary
you know consequences where some some

01:14:16.069 --> 01:14:16.079
you know consequences where some some
 

01:14:16.079 --> 01:14:18.470
you know consequences where some some
negative you know lessons you know about

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480
negative you know lessons you know about
 

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.290
negative you know lessons you know about
how it is I think clearly the fact that

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300
how it is I think clearly the fact that
 

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.879
how it is I think clearly the fact that
China broke the rules and didn't report

01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:22.889
China broke the rules and didn't report
 

01:14:22.889 --> 01:14:26.390
China broke the rules and didn't report
SARS was a good example of how it can

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400
SARS was a good example of how it can
 

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:32.899
SARS was a good example of how it can
happen they broke the rules sorry became

01:14:32.899 --> 01:14:32.909
happen they broke the rules sorry became
 

01:14:32.909 --> 01:14:34.669
happen they broke the rules sorry became
pandemics yeah you know there are

01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679
pandemics yeah you know there are
 

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.530
pandemics yeah you know there are
consequences both positive and negative

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:36.540
consequences both positive and negative
 

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.600
consequences both positive and negative
but that's why I say you need the

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:38.610
but that's why I say you need the
 

01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:40.310
but that's why I say you need the
evidence right before you break a rule

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320
evidence right before you break a rule
 

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.620
evidence right before you break a rule
well especially in working for an

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:42.630
well especially in working for an
 

01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:44.720
well especially in working for an
organization like w-h-o in many cases

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:44.730
organization like w-h-o in many cases
 

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.850
organization like w-h-o in many cases
these rules reflect the principle of

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:46.860
these rules reflect the principle of
 

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:50.089
these rules reflect the principle of
state sovereignty right and so the w-h-o

01:14:50.089 --> 01:14:50.099
state sovereignty right and so the w-h-o
 

01:14:50.099 --> 01:14:52.010
state sovereignty right and so the w-h-o
you know is nothing if it's not

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:52.020
you know is nothing if it's not
 

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:56.569
you know is nothing if it's not
accountable to the member states so you

01:14:56.569 --> 01:14:56.579
accountable to the member states so you
 

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:59.419
accountable to the member states so you
know if you think of it that way you

01:14:59.419 --> 01:14:59.429
know if you think of it that way you
 

01:14:59.429 --> 01:15:00.740
know if you think of it that way you
know there are many who would say more

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:00.750
know there are many who would say more
 

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.709
know there are many who would say more
generally that in the the whole realm of

international development assistance to

01:15:06.049 --> 01:15:06.059
international development assistance to
 

01:15:06.059 --> 01:15:09.290
international development assistance to
think of it that way that all too often

01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300
think of it that way that all too often
 

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.479
think of it that way that all too often
you know international organizations and

01:15:11.479 --> 01:15:11.489
you know international organizations and
 

01:15:11.489 --> 01:15:15.410
you know international organizations and
NGOs are ready to override you know kind

of local government government
 

01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:19.129
of local government government
structures you know and so on and so

01:15:19.129 --> 01:15:19.139
structures you know and so on and so
 

01:15:19.139 --> 01:15:21.049
structures you know and so on and so
that is kind of a more general problem

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:21.059
that is kind of a more general problem
 

01:15:21.059 --> 01:15:24.129
that is kind of a more general problem
so we had really positive examples of

01:15:24.129 --> 01:15:24.139
so we had really positive examples of
 

01:15:24.139 --> 01:15:26.629
so we had really positive examples of
you know leaders like da Henderson and

01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639
you know leaders like da Henderson and
 

01:15:26.639 --> 01:15:27.070
you know leaders like da Henderson and
and

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080
and
 

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.260
and
you know who ready to be flexible to put

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:29.270
you know who ready to be flexible to put
 

01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.420
you know who ready to be flexible to put
it that way but nonetheless it may be

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:31.430
it that way but nonetheless it may be
 

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:34.000
it that way but nonetheless it may be
part of the larger problem you know it's

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:34.010
part of the larger problem you know it's
 

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:36.460
part of the larger problem you know it's
a big problem it's an ethical problem I

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:36.470
a big problem it's an ethical problem I
 

01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:39.580
a big problem it's an ethical problem I

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:39.590
mean is it ethical to be giving aids
 

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:41.320
mean is it ethical to be giving aids
drugs when we don't know that that can

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:41.330
drugs when we don't know that that can
 

01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:43.990
drugs when we don't know that that can
be sustained in the long term to be

01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000

general of outbreaks are really
 

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.980
general of outbreaks are really
interesting because you know the CDC

something which could be prevented is it
ethical to have done the investigation

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:12.020
ethical to have done the investigation
 

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.990
ethical to have done the investigation
and that provided the vaccine to prevent

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000
and that provided the vaccine to prevent
 

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.030

a whole series of ethical issues it's

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040
a whole series of ethical issues it's
 

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.150
a whole series of ethical issues it's
very important metrics and I'm not I'm
