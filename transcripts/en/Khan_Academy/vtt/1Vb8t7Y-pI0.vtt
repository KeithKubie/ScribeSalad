00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.130
William and Luis are in
different physics classes

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.370
at Santa Rita.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.750
Luis's teacher always gives
exams with 30 questions

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.870
on them, while William's
teacher gives more

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.150
frequent exams with
only 24 questions.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.802
Luis's teacher also assigns
three projects per year.

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:20.260
Even though the two classes
have to take a different number

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.270
of exams, their
teachers have told them

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.250
that both classes-- let me
underline-- both classes will

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.040
get the same total number
of exam questions each year.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.850
What is the minimum
number of exam questions

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.807
William's or Luis's class can
expect to get in a given year?

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:38.390
So let's think about
what's happening.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.014
So if we think about
Luis's teacher who

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:44.590
gives 30 questions per test,
so after the first test,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.850
he would have done 30 questions.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.750
So this is 0 right over here.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.240
Then after the second test,
he would have done 60.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.150
Then after the third test,
he would have done 90.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.070
And after the fourth test,
he would have done 120.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.480
And after the fifth test,
if there is a fifth test,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.700
he would do-- so this is if
they have that many tests-- he

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.912
would get to 150
total questions.

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:10.620
And we could keep
going on and on looking

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.467
at all the multiples of 30.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.800
So this is probably a hint
of what we're thinking about.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.549
We're looking at
multiples of the numbers.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.710
We want the minimum multiples
or the least multiple.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.950
So that's with Luis.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.710
Well what's going
on with William?

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.650
Will William's teacher,
after the first test,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.220
they're going to
get to 24 questions.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.770
Then they're going to get
to 48 after the second test.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.420
Then they're going to get
to 72 after the third test.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.250
Then they're going to get to 96.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.820
I'm just taking multiples of 24.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.030
They're going to get to
96 after the fourth test.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.610
And then after the fifth test,
they're going to get to 120.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.160
And if there's a sixth test,
then they would get to 144.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.430
And we could keep going
on and on in there.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.300
But let's see what
they're asking us.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.180
What is the minimum
number of exam questions

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.200
William's or Luis's class
can expect to get in a year?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.710
Well the minimum
number is the point

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.380
at which they've gotten the
same number of exam questions,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.190
despite the fact
that the tests had

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.617
a different number of items.

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:12.950
And you see the point at which
they have the same number

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.880
is at 120.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.770
This happens at 120.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.300
They both could have
exactly 120 questions

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.840
even though Luis's teacher
is giving 30 at a time

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.240
and even though William's
teacher is giving 24 at a time.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.469
And so the answer is 120.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.510
And notice, they had a
different number of exams.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.650
Luis had one, two,
three, four exams

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.300
while William would have to
have one, two, three, four,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.570
five exams.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.270
But that gets them both
to 120 total questions.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.100
Now thinking of it in terms
of some of the math notation

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.370
or the least common multiple
notation we've seen before,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.650
this is really asking us what is
the least common multiple of 30

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.980
and 24.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.692
And that least common
multiple is equal to 120.

00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:04.150
Now there's other
ways that you can

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.399
find the least common multiple
other than just looking

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.870
at the multiples like this.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.440
You could look at it
through prime factorization.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.290
30 is 2 times 15,
which is 3 times 5.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.420
So we could say that 30 is
equal to 2 times 3 times 5.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:28.580
And 24-- that's a different
color than that blue-- 24

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.570
is equal to 2 times 12.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.846
12 is equal to 2 times 6.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:36.080
6 is equal to 2 times 3.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:44.660
So 24 is equal to 2
times 2 times 2 times 3.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.250
So another way to come up with
the least common multiple,

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.720
if we didn't even do this
exercise up here, says, look,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.820
the number has to be
divisible by both 30 and 24.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.810
If it's going to
be divisible by 30,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.060
it's going to have to
have 2 times 3 times 5

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.430
in its prime factorization.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.420
That is essentially 30.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.830
So this makes it
divisible by 30.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.050
And say, well in order
to be divisible by 24,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.750
its prime factorization is
going to need 3 twos and a 3.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.230
Well we already have 1 three.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.040
And we already have 1 two,
so we just need 2 more twos.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.740
So 2 times 2.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.340
So this makes it--
let me scroll up

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.080
a little bit-- this right over
here makes it divisible by 24.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.030
And so this is essentially
the prime factorization

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.920
of the least common
multiple of 30 and 24.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.300
You take any one of
these numbers away,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.251
you are no longer going to be
divisible by one of these two

00:04:40.251 --> 00:04:40.750
numbers.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.333
If you take a two away, you're
not going to be divisible by 24

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:43.950
anymore.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.830
If you take a two
or a three away.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.520
If you take a three
or a five away,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.145
you're not going to be
divisible by 30 anymore.

00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:55.020
And so if you were to
multiply all these out,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:04.170
this is 2 times 2 times 2 is 8
times 3 is 24 times 5 is 120.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.740
Now let's do one more of these.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.971
Umama just bought one
package of 21 binders.

00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:11.220
Let me write that number down.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.660
21 binders.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.800
She also bought a
package of 30 pencils.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.240
She wants to use all of
the binders and pencils

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.060
to create identical
sets of office supplies

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.650
for her classmates.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.540
What is the greatest
number of identical sets

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.456
Umama can make using
all the supplies?

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:31.330
So the fact that we're
talking about greatest

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.246
is clue that it's probably
going to be dealing

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:34.620
with greatest common divisors.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.710
And it's also dealing with
dividing these things.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.660
We want to divide these
both into the greatest

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.764
number of identical sets.

00:05:44.764 --> 00:05:46.930
So there's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.060
Let's think about what the
greatest common divisor

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.100
of both these numbers are.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.450
Or I could even say the
greatest common factor.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:00.500
The greatest common
divisor of 21 and 30.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.280
So what's the largest number
that divides into both of them?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.902
So we could go with
the prime factor.

00:06:05.902 --> 00:06:07.610
We could list all of
their normal factors

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.570
and see what is the
greatest common one.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:16.700
Or we could look at the
prime factorization.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.820
So let's just do the prime
factorization method.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.760
So 21 is the same
thing as 3 times 7.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.690
These are both prime numbers.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.140
30 is, let's see,
it's 3-- actually,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.210
I could write it this
way-- it is 2 times 15.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.110
We already did it
actually just now.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.620
And 15 is 3 times 5.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.680
So what's the largest
number of prime numbers that

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.780
are common to both
factorizations?

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.820
Well you only have a
three right over here.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.820
Then you don't have a
three times anything else.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.420
So this is just going
to be equal to 3.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.900
So this is essentially
telling us,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.760
look, we can divide both
of these numbers into 3

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.740
and that will give
us the largest

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.504
number of identical sets.

00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:00.170
So just to be clear
of what we're doing.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.260
So we've answered
the question is 3,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.360
but just to visualize
it for this question,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.070
let's actually draw 21 binders.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:13.728
So let's say the 21 binders so
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:19.320
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.760
And then 30 pencils, so
I'll just do those in green.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.700
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.480
Let me just copy and paste that.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.660
This is getting tedious.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.510
So copy and paste.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:41.630
So that's 20 and then
paste that is 30.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.030
Now, we figured out that 3
is the largest number that

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.750
divides into both
of these evenly.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.670
So I can divide both of
these into groups of 3.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.390
So for the binders, I could
do it into three groups of 7.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.400
And then for the
pencils, I could do it

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.320
into three groups of 10.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.050
So if there are
three people that

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.710
are coming into
this classroom, I

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:11.640
could give them each seven
binders and 10 pencils.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.290
But that's the greatest
number of identical sets

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.270
Umama can make.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.450
I would have three sets.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:22.000
Each set would have seven
binders and 10 pencils.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.500
And we essentially
are just thinking

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.960
about what's the number that we
can divide both of these sets

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.050
into evenly, the
largest number that we

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.263
can divide both of
these sets into evenly.
