00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.760
We're on problem 21.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.330
In the figure below, n
is a whole number.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.880
All right.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.720
What is the smallest possible
value for n?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.650
OK, both of these sides are n.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.380
And so this is something that's
actually really good to

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.190
get this intuition.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.870
Because this shows up on all
sorts of standardized tests.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.550
And so let's think about how
small can we make n.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.600
So the lower the top of
this pyramid becomes,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.550
the smaller n becomes.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.130
If we pushed this top of the
pyramid really high then n

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.720
would have to be really big.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.688
For example, if we made the
triangle into that.

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:37.380
Then clearly, this length is
shorter than that length.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.540
We want to keep lowering it to
get as small a possible n.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.310
But what happens if we lowered
it all the way?

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.350
If we flattened this triangle.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.970
If we just flattened it
all the way down.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.690
So essentially this would be the
top of it and this would

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.080
be n and this would be n.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.780
I hope you're visualizing
that properly.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.520
I've flattened the triangle.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.840
So these two sides would just
go flat with the base.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.010
And so this top if I
were to do it in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.420
magenta, is right here.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.170
So this is as small
as n could get.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.920
One could argue whether this is
a triangle at all anymore.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.340
It's really a line now, because
I've squished out all

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.530
of the area in there.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.070
But even in this case, n would
have to be, in the smallest

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.220
case, it would be 7.5.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.050
Each n would be half
of this 15.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.610
So, as we push this base down,
that's kind of the limit that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.390
n approaches.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950
n cannot be any smaller
than 7.5.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.640
And they tell us that
n is a whole number.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.500
So n has to be greater
than 7.5 in order for

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.680
this to be a triangle.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.460
And n is a whole number,
so n is equal to 8.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.880
That's choice C.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.920
And that's an important
intuition to have in general.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.830
That the third side of a
triangle can never be bigger

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.100
than two of the other
sides combined.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.540
Then you're dealing with
something else.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.010
You're not dealing
with a triangle.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.020
Even if the third side is equal
to the other two sides,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.190
then you're actually dealing
with a line.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.980
Because you'd have to squish
out all of the area of the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.910
triangle in order
to get there.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.520
Anyway, I like that problem.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.770
Next question.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.860
I think, just eyeballing
it, they want us

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.330
to do the same thing.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.580
Same type of intuition.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.170
And I had my rant in the last
video about how they weren't

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.090
doing problems that give
you intuition or

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.420
that test your intuition.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.650
But I'll take that back, because
I think that's what

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.010
they are testing now.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.250
Which of the following sets of
numbers could represent the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.760
lengths of the sides
of a triangle.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.670
2, and 2, and 5.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.190
So this is the same
thing again.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.150
How can I have two sides of
a triangle combined being

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.200
shorter than the third side.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.590
If I had a side of length 2, and
then I had another side of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.620
length 2, there's no way that
this last side could be 5.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.780
Even if I completely flattened
this triangle, 2 and 2, the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.615
longest that this last
side, this third

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:03.500
side, could be is 4.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.970
So that can't be a triangle.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.500
Same here, let's look
at the other ones.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.360
3, 3, and 5.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.970
That's no reason why that
can't be a triangle.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.260
3 and 3 is 6.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.590
So even if I flattened it out
a lot, then this side can be

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.920
as long as 6.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.590
And obviously I could squeeze
them together like this.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.550
3 and 3, and then this little
third side could be something

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.030
really small.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.970
Because it's anything
in between 0 and 6.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.210
So obviously it can be 5.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.900
So that's going to
be the answer.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.950
4, 4 and 8.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.840
Same problem.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.515
I would have to squish
the triangle so much.

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:40.890
If those are two of the sides,
4 and 4, this last side is

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.590
still going to be less than 8.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.370
The only way to get it to 8 is
if I push the top of this

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.280
triangle all the way down and
essentially make it a line.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.830
Once again, one side of a
triangle can't be bigger than

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.860
two of the other
sides combined.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.360
In fact, it can't be
equal to two of

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.320
the other sides combined.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.920
Then we're dealing
with a line.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.890
So they're really testing
that same intuition.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.890
And the choice is B.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.080
23.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.330
Copy and paste this.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.770
OK.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.220
I try to avoid talking when
I'm copying and pasting

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.630
because I think it slows
down my computer.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.910
In the accompanying diagram,
parallel lines L and M are cut

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.760
by transversal T.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.860
So it's a classic parallel
line with

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.300
a transversal problem.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.050
And they're parallel.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.760
That's why I did those arrows.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.575
Which statements about angle
1 and 2 must be true?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.350
I don't know if you've seen the
Khan Academy videos of the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.290
angle game, but that's what
we're going to play here, the

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.720
angle game.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.670
So angle 1, if you want to
look at its corresponding

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.020
angle, its corresponding angle
on the other parallel line, or

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.340
with the transversal and
the other parallel

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.980
line, is right there.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.580
And they're going
to be congruent.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.710
Those two angles are going
to be congruent.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.790
So you could say this is equal
to the measure of angle 1.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.530
I've picked up their terminology
well, I think.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.380
So this is equal to the
measure of angle 1.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.070
And this is obviously angle 2.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.380
You see immediately that they
have to be supplementary.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.450
Because when you add them
together you get 180 degrees.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.310
Together they go all the
way around and they

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.960
kind of form a line.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.700
So you know that if this angle
and this angle are

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.050
supplementary.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.330
And this angle is congruent to
angle 1, then angle 1 and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
angle 2 must be supplementary.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.760
So what do they say?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.600
Angle 1 is definitely
not necessarily

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.610
congruent to angle 2.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.370
It's congruent to
this angle here.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.980
Angle 1 is a complement
of angle 2.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.390
Complement means you
add up to 90.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.060
No, we're talking about
supplement.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.750
So it's not that.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.630
Angle 1 is a supplement
of angle 2.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.090
There you go.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.750
And there's nothing that says
that they're right angles,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.990
that's silly.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.240
All right, next problem.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.210
Let me copy and paste it.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.160
OK.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.810
And paste it.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.130
Ready to go.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.370
What values-- let me pick a good
color-- what values of A

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.070
and B make the quadrilateral
MNOP a parallelogram.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.620
For this to be a parallelogram,
the opposite

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.890
sides have to be equal.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.790
And I challenge you to
experiment to draw a

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.830
parallelogram where opposite
sides are parallel where the

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.120
opposite sides are
also not equal.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.110
If you make two of the sides not
equal, then the other two

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.550
lines aren't going to
be parallel anymore.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.190
And you can play with
that if you like.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.070
But if opposite sides are going
to be equal that means

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.820
4A plus B is equal to 21.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.570
Because they're opposite sides,
so they should be equal

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.780
to each other.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.370
Similarly, 3A minus 2B should be
equal to 13 because they're

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.860
opposite sides.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.750
So 3A minus 2B is equal to 13.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.400
And now we have two linear
equations with two unknowns.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.460
So this is really an Algebra
1 problem in disguise.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.860
So let's see, they want
us to solve for both.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.900
Let's see if we can
cancel out B.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.930
So let's multiply this
top equation by 2.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.980
And I'm doing that to
cancel out the B's.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:22.570
So you get 8A plus 2B
is equal to 42.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.720
And I did that so that the 2B
and the minus 2B cancel out.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.750
So let's add these two
equations to each.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.850
The left-hand side,
3A plus 8A is 11A.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.900
The B's cancel out; minus 2B,
plus 2B, that's no B's.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.720
Is equal to 42 plus 13 is 55.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.070
That worked out well.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.380
Divide both sides by 11, you
get A is equal to 5.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.460
Now if A is equal
to 5, what's B?

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.100
Let's substitute back into
that first equation.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.290
Because you picked either.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.940
So 4 times 5 plus B
is equal to 21.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.150
20 plus B is equal to 21.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.220
So subtract 20 from both
sides, B is equal to 1.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.340
So A is 5, B is 1.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.950
That is choice B.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.580
Problem 25.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.300
I think I have to
clear this now.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.960
Quadrilateral ABCD is
a parallelogram.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.010
If adjacent angles are
congruent, which statement

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.970
must be true?

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.570
All right.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.750
So let me draw a
parallelogram.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.860
Well, I'll do it quick
and dirty.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.210
So a parallelogram says that
opposite sides are parallel.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.490
That's parallel to that and
that's parallel to that.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.800
But they give us another
statement.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.690
They say if the adjacent
sides are congruent.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.760
So they're saying that this
is congruent to that.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.570
They are saying if adjacent
angles are congruent.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.200
So I don't know if they're
saying it's just one of them

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.660
or all of them.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.590
But it's the same
thing actually.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.970
If that angle is congruent
to that angle, something

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.840
interesting has to happen.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.520
They both have to
be 90 degrees.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.940
And I want you to think about
that a little bit.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.350
So let me just draw the kind
of bottom part of that

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.600
parellelogram.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.450
And I drew it more so if you say
that this line right here

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.700
is a transversal.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.370
And that since it's a
parallelogram, we know that

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.155
this line is parallel
to that line.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.320
So we have a transversal
between parallel lines.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.310
This angle is congruent
to that angle, they're

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.810
corresponding angles.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.670
And this angle is a supplement
to this angle.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.620
They have to add up to 180.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.910
So this angle, this red angle
and this brown angle have to

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.770
be supplements.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.760
Or if we said angle
1 and angle 2.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.200
They have to add up to 180.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.480
Measure of angle 1 plus measure
of angle 2 have to be

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.060
equal to 180.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.020
But then they tell
us even more.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.880
They tell you that they're
congruent.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.470
These are adjacent
angles, right?

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.950
That's angle 1 and
that's angle 2.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:19.910
They're adjacent.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.320
So if both of these are
congruent, if their measures

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.310
equal each other, they both
have to be equal to 90.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.290
So if adjacent angles
are congruent in the

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.430
parallelogram, then these
angles are 90.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.760
And if these angles are 90,
those are going to be 90 by

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.990
the same argument.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.430
So now we're not dealing with
just a parallelogram.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.815
Well, I did want to draw
it all filled in.

00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:44.170
It looks tacky.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.330
It's a rectangle.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.070
They say quadrilateral
ABCD is a square.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.550
It could be a square, but in
order for it to be a square

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.000
they'd have to tell us that
all the sides are equal to

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.040
each other.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.510
So it's not A.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.350
That could happen, it
doesn't have to be.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.230
ABCD is a rhombus.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.050
No, in a rhombus all the
sides have to be

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.330
equal to each other.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.610
They didn't tell us that.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.780
ABCD is a rectangle.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.330
Sure.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.280
Because we know all the angles
now are 90 degrees.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.180
And that is choice C.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.430
See you in the next video.
