RACHAEL O'MEARA: I'm Rachael
O'Meara and I'm really excited

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.880
today to introduce our
guest speaker at

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.585
Google, Robert MacPhee.

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:11.210
So a little bit about Robert
before we get started.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.380
Robert is a speaker, author,
coach, and consultant.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.870
His mission is to help people
connect in the world of

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.450
constant change.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.160
He is the author of the book
"Manifesting for Non-Gurus,"

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.330
and we have some of those
here for later.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660
He also has a book and companion
journal for it about

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.720
how to quickly and easily
attract lasting results.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.729
He's the former director of
training for Jack Canfield.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.900
Jack, if you've heard of him,
he's the co-creator of a book

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.270
you may have heard of, "Chicken
Soup for the Soul"

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.700
and all those books in the
series, and also the author of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.200
the book, "The Success
Principle." So

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.330
he knows his stuff.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.800
He's also a founding member
of the Transformational

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.810
Leadership Council, a group
of the world's leading

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.150
authorities in personal and
professional development.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.890
So without further ado,
please welcome Robert.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.410
ROBERT MACPHEE: Thank you.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.200
Thank you, everyone.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.610
I am thrilled to be here.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.520
I knew last night I was going to
be thrilled to be here, but

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.020
I didn't realize how thrilled
until I actually

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.760
flew in this morning.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.610
I live in San Diego, and I flew
in early this morning.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.970
And I realize while I was
driving here that you guys

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.430
have made my life so easy.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.560
I just really connected, while
I was driving in traffic on

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.720
the 101, this is my opportunity
to give back to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230
you and maybe make your lives
a little bit easier, too.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.490
Because I was jumping off the
plane, googling something

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.190
about my rental car company, and
then I was using my Google

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.660
Maps to get from where I
needed to be to here.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.960
And you guys just make my life
so easy, so I really am

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.420
thrilled at the opportunity to
share some things today with

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.660
you that I think will make your
lives easier as well.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.250
Would that be OK?

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.130
All right.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.960
So we're going to go
through some things

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.980
today relatively quickly.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.760
And I want to just set the stage
really quickly for how

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.230
we're going to do that.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.310
What we're going to do today
is going to be focused on

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.310
creating results but also on
creating the experience of

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.630
life that you want
to be having.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.840
When I looked at my work and
how I could really deliver

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.150
something that would be valuable
for you, it seems to

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.350
me that based on the nature of
this company and what's going

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.840
on here, and how quickly things
are moving, and the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.540
amazing things that are
happening here, it's probably

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.530
not so much about creating
results as it is making sure

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.880
the results you're creating are
really in alignment with

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.370
the experience that you
want to be having.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.850
So we're going to focus
on both of those.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.670
And as we get started here
today, I would just invite you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.510
to kind of put this conversation
into context.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.120
To think about your own life,
your own work, maybe the team

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.290
that you're on, and just think
about what kind of new

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.210
results, what kind of
new experience, do

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.740
you want to be creating?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.870
So that you can take what we
talk about today and just put

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.370
it into that context.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.040
Because my intention is by the
end of the day today, or the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.700
end of our hour together today,
you'll be in a position

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.550
to do some things a little bit
differently in order to create

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.410
the results you want more
quickly, more easily, and to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.550
have those results really
be lasting.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.400
So again, one of the things I'm
going to focus on today is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.750
the fact that this can affect
you personally.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.830
What we're going to go through,
what we're going to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.370
talk about today, you could
definitely apply it personally

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.820
in your own life, in your own
position, in your own role.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.080
But it can also affect
your team.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.170
So if you're a member of a team,
if you're a leader of a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.430
team, I would also invite you
to just look at what we're

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.010
going to talk about today
through that lens, of how can

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.930
this help my team?

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.350
And then I want to ask your
permission on two things.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.170
One-- is it OK if we
go fast today?

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.190
You guys are fast, right?

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.670
That's what this company is
all about, is fast, right?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.510
Because I really do have a lot
that I want to share with you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.990
in an hour.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.350
So just to let you know, I
am going to go quickly.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.790
And the other thing, if it's OK
with you, if it's OK-- it's

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.300
lunch time.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.550
Can we have a little fun?

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.870
Did you notice on that first
slide I shared at the bottom,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.340
there was a thing about
the YouTube Week.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.230
There's like some humor thing
going on this week and it

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.790
says, this had better
be funny.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.120
So that's kind of the model.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.960
This had better be funny.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.410
One of the things we've learned
is that you actually

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.750
learn more effectively when
things are fun, when there's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.510
laughter and fun involved.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.790
So I told you it's going to be
about results and experience.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.110
It's also going to be focused
on practical and

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.880
implementable.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.820
I want what we share today to
be something that you can

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.480
literally put into action and
put into use right away.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.230
The title of today's
presentation is "Mastering the

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.180
Art of Living a Purpose
Driven Life.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.149
And again, we're going to focus
on purpose, but I want

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.899
to start with that
first word--

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.120
mastery.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.430
And by mastery, I mean
attracting the results we want

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.810
quickly and easily.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.050
You all know the people
who do this.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.160
They just make it look easy.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.880
Things happen.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.960
They always have the resources
that they need.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.610
Things are easy and effortless
for them.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.550
That's the result we're
looking for.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.080
I'm going to add one other word
in there, which is I want

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.220
to help you do this in a way
that those results last.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.210
So it's not just a
one-shot deal.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.630
So did everyone get two wine
corks on your chair?

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.190
So I'm going to ask
two things.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.420
One, can I have maybe four
volunteers who would be

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.030
willing to come up to the front
of the room with your

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.480
wine corks?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.610
And I'm going to ask everyone
to set down your things and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.580
stand up with your wine corks.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.670
So can I get four brave
volunteers who would be

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.880
willing to just come up,
two on each side of me?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.880
And I'm going to demonstrate
mastery for you.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.230
I'm going to give you
all the opportunity.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.870
If you would, just set your
stuff down, stand up with your

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.470
wine corks.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.165
OK, so we have four
brave volunteers.

00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:18.070
Let's hear it for
our volunteers.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.480
They have no idea how brave
they really are right now.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.300
So I'm actually going
to pull a chair.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.140
This is probably an OSHA
violation, but this'll help

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.130
you guys who are further back.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.300
What I'm going to
ask them to do--

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.450
and you're all going to
do this with me--

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.740
is you're going to take your two
wine corks just like this,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.840
between your thumb and
your forefinger.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.110
Can you all see that?

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.540
And then you're going to take
them apart just like that.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.910
OK?

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.840
So I'll show you guys this.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.520
It's hard for you to see.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.060
You're going to start like this,
and you're just going to

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.640
take them apart like that.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.880
OK?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.860
So we start like this, and we
take them apart like that.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.360
You start like this,
and you just take

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.679
them apart like that.

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:06.130
AUDIENCE: Wait, how?

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.350
ROBERT MACPHEE: OK.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.700
So everyone was able to
do that, no problem?

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.520
By a show of hands, how many of
you were able to do that?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.560
One, two, three.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.160
OK.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.080
You might have gotten the
left-handed corks, so you

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.800
might need to switch them from
one hand to the other.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.190
OK.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.200
So can you see that I've
mastered this?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.700
We're talking about
mastery, right?

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.700
Of all the things I could have
mastered, I picked this.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.780
But you can see that
I've mastered it.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.870
But like many things, when you
tried to do it the first time,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.000
maybe it wasn't quite as
easy as it looked.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.380
How many of you got to this
spot, right here?

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.990
Right?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.880
And how did that feel?

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.220
Just give me some words to
describe how that feels.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.900
AUDIENCE: Stuck.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.803
ROBERT MACPHEE: Stuck?

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:42.530
AUDIENCE: Frustrating.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.470
ROBERT MACPHEE: Frustrating.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.410
AUDIENCE: Silly.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.820
ROBERT MACPHEE: Silly.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.670
OK.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.960
So is that how we feel when
someone comes in and

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.580
says, oh, it's easy.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.440
They come into your
office, they show

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.130
you how to do something.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.520
It's easy.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.070
Just hit Enter and it's done.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.390
And you go--

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.580
but then when you try to do
it yourself, you have this

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.550
experience, right?

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.190
So for my four brave volunteers
up here, and for

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.750
you guys, what do you need from
me to take your next step

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.390
towards being able to master
this silly skill?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.170
What would be helpful?

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.410
AUDIENCE: Show it
to us slowly.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.910
ROBERT MACPHEE: Show
it to us slowly.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.910
See, now this is one of the
interesting things that we see

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.590
about this metaphor.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.830
The women always
say two things.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.410
One is, do it slowly.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.100
And the other one
is, do it again.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.810
So I'm just saying, this may
be a metaphor for more than

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.400
just the mastery thing that
we're talking about, here.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.150
But anyway, men usually have a
completely different response.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.130
But better instruction?

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.670
Would that be helpful?

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.630
OK.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.110
So here's what I'm going
to ask you to do.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.780
Take your--

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.640
I'll just stand up here
again, so you can see.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.260
Take your thumb from one hand
and put it on the palm end of

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.290
the cork, the end of the cork
that faces your palm.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.020
Now bring your other thumb
around so it's

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.540
also on the palm end.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.610
Make sure it's on
the palm end.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.170
And once you have your
thumbs in place, just

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.320
reach over and under.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.260
Sometimes it's easier with
your middle finger.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.162
And they should come
right apart.

00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:08.560
Did you get it?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.470
Got it?

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.220
Get it?

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.760
OK.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.060
So by show of hands, with a
little bit better instruction,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.480
how many of you were able
to get it that time?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:15.750
OK.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.300
So most of the room.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.290
Now the rest of you, I'm going
to ask you a favor.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.890
Please don't leave here
today without

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.220
knowing how to do this.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.350
Because I came here to help, to
support, to make friends.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.690
I don't want anyone walking out
of here going, that was

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.680
the stupidest thing I ever--

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.530
[GRUMBLES].

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.710
OK?

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.540
But here's the thing.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.350
You've had the experience now.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.659
Have you mastered this?

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.964
For those of you who have done
it, have you mastered it?

00:08:36.964 --> 00:08:37.428
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:37.428 --> 00:08:38.820
AUDIENCE: I wouldn't
say mastered.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.230
ROBERT MACPHEE: Not quite
mastery, right?

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.059
You can do it.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:41.880
You know how it works.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.600
It's maybe still a little
awkward, still a little

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.900
uncomfortable.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.600
But I believe there are four
things-- you guys can go ahead

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.300
and have a seat, if you want.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.550
Actually, everyone can have
a seat, if you want.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.790
I believe there are four things
we always need to be

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.820
willing to do in order
to achieve mastery.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.170
And you guys already
were willing to

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.960
do a couple of them.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.590
The first thing we need
to be willing to do is

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.280
try something new.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.140
So here comes this crazy
guy from San Diego.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.790
He puts two wine corks
on everyone's chair.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.110
You have no idea what this is
about, but you're willing to

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.000
pick up the corks and give
it a try, right?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.940
Simple as that might seem,
you're willing to do that.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.070
Number two is you're willing
to ask for help.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.830
Now could you have figured
this out on your own?

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.040
Maybe.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.820
You guys, pretty smart group.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.850
I'm going to tell you I believe
you could have figured

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.670
it out on your own.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.980
There's only so many fingers.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.880
There's only so many
ends of the corks.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.870
You could have figured it out.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.540
But would it have
taken longer?

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.920
And can you get it done more
quickly and easily by asking

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.910
for help, getting some
instruction from someone who

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.170
knows how to do it?

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.560
The third thing is be willing
to be uncomfortable.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.500
In order to really master
anything, we have to be

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.800
willing to be uncomfortable.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.080
Did I make you a little
uncomfortable?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.110
Especially the four of you who
were brave enough to come up

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.520
to the front of the room?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.510
Not only can you not do it, how
many of you did that thing

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.950
where you kind of looked to the
left, looked to the right,

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.480
and see if you're the only
one who can't do it?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.970
But it's a little
uncomfortable.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.410
It's a little awkward.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.920
And that is the case whenever
we try something new.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.644
And then why is it
so easy for me?

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:11.588
AUDIENCE: Practice.

00:10:11.588 --> 00:10:12.420
ROBERT MACPHEE: What's that?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:12.860
AUDIENCE: Practice.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.100
ROBERT MACPHEE: Practice,
right?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.770
Thank you.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.210
Sometimes people say, you must
drink a lot of wine.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.880
But that's not it.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.870
ROBERT MACPHEE: Of all the
skills I could have mastered,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.790
this is the one.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.130
I learned this years ago, and
I saw the metaphor in it.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.730
I had that physiological
experience of what it's like

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.020
to be uncomfortable.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.880
And when we're uncomfortable,
what do we do, a lot of times?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.700
Go right back to what we were
doing before, right?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.080
So the fourth thing that you
need to be willing to do in

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.860
order to achieve mastery is be
willing to do it repeatedly.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.170
Practice, practice, practice.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.830
And any of you, whether it's
this silly little cork trick,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.890
or whether it's a skill at
work, or a skill in a

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.860
relationship, or mastering
health and fitness, whatever

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.720
it might be--

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.800
if you're willing to try
something new, if you are

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.230
willing to ask for help,
if you're willing to be

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.950
uncomfortable, and if you're
willing to do it persistently,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.770
you can absolutely
achieve mastery.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.630
So today when we're looking
at mastering living a

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.200
purpose-driven life,
that's what I mean.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.530
Being willing to do all
four of those things.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.270
So of those four things,
what do you think

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.730
would be the most difficult?

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.230
Which would be the
hardest one?

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.532
What's that?

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:24.400
AUDIENCE: Be uncomfortable.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.093
ROBERT MACPHEE: Be
uncomfortable.

00:11:26.093 --> 00:11:28.310
AUDIENCE: For me, I think
it would be number four.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.560
ROBERT MACPHEE: Practice,
practice, practice.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.840
This is different for
different people.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.130
But I'm going to put this
out as a possibility.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.450
I believe number three,
the willingness to be

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.410
uncomfortable, is the one
that gets more people

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.146
stuck than any other.

00:11:41.146 --> 00:11:44.280
The willingness to get outside
of our comfort zone, to

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.260
stretch, to do something
different, to risk the

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.730
response of other people.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.890
And if you look at the other
three and ask yourself, why

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.440
aren't people willing to
try something new?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.160
Often, it's because it's
uncomfortable.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.240
Why aren't people willing
to ask for help?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.020
It's often because it's
uncomfortable.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.330
And why aren't people willing
to do something repeatedly?

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.020
It's because it's
uncomfortable.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.130
So the next thing I want to take
a look at is this issue

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.830
of being uncomfortable.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.730
What does it really mean?

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.520
How many of you have ever had
someone say, you need to get

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.380
out of your comfort zone?

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.300
You could do more.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.900
You could expand yourself if you
were just willing to get

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.840
out of your comfort zone.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.420
And it sounds good, right?

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.080
But what the heck does
that even mean?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.090
Like how do we know if we're
outside of our comfort zone?

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.690
What is that all about?

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:30.120
So I want to share a model with
you that zeroes in on

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.460
this issue of being
uncomfortable.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.005
And most of the time,
what makes us

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.200
uncomfortable is change.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.500
So I'm going to ask you to
do something else here.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.810
Let me ask you all to take your
hands and just put them

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.710
together like this.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.130
And look down at your
hands and notice

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.810
which thumb is on top.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.420
Just notice which
thumb is on top.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.790
Now how many of you had your
right thumb on top?

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.720
And how many of you had your
left thumb on top?

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.670
And did we have anybody--
sometimes we have people who

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.580
kind of layer them right
next to each other.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.620
Did we have any of those?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.620
OK.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.840
So for those of you who had your
right thumb on top, what

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.110
that means is that
you're a thinker.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.810
You're an analytical, kind of
a think it all through, go

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.180
through all the steps
kind of a person.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.600
If your left thumb was on top,
that means you're sexy.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.500
ROBERT MACPHEE: And if you were
that rare person who has

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.540
their thumbs right next to each
other, that means you

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.820
think you're sexy.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.560
ROBERT MACPHEE: No, actually,
that's totally made-up.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.590
But take your hands like this
and put them together, just

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.630
like we did before.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.820
Notice which thumb's on top.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.020
Same thumb, or different
thumb?

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.980
Same one, right?

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.370
Now I'm going to ask you to take
your hands and take them

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.380
apart, and move all
of your fingers.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.990
Don't just move your thumbs, but
move all of your fingers

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.720
so your other thumb is on top.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.910
And how does that feel?

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.730
AUDIENCE: Weird.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.380
ROBERT MACPHEE: Strange?

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.560
Weird?

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.330
Uncomfortable?

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.350
Different?

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.670
What do you want to do?

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.795
Put them back the other
way, right?

00:14:05.795 --> 00:14:08.020
Aahhhh.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.340
I believe, in this simple little
metaphor, is why most

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.570
people don't achieve what they
really want to achieve.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.180
They'd rather go back to
being comfortable.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.120
Now what would happen if we just
held our hands in this

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.030
new position for maybe
10 minutes?

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.440
It would become comfortable.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.760
It actually becomes comfortable,
if we're willing

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.740
to do that.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.200
So this is what we mean by
getting outside of our comfort

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.030
zone, being uncomfortable.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.340
It's just that willingness
to do that.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.640
So I'm going to share a
four-part model with you

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.170
that's going to take a
look at comfort zone.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.990
And I already asked you to
consider what kind of result

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.240
you want to create in your life,
what kind of new result,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.570
what kind of new outcome
you want to create.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.550
So as we go through this, I'm
going to encourage you to look

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.860
at it again through that filter,
that lens, of what you

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.460
want to create.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.630
What's important to you.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.670
So it's going to start
with results.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.320
We're going to start in the
lower right-hand corner of

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.650
this diagram, with results.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.430
And we're going to look at what
goes on that leads to

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.850
creating new results
in our lives.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.590
Now what has to happen
before any new

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.780
result is going to happen?

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.210
What do we have to do
before any result is

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:16.690
going to show up?

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.823
Any new result?

00:15:17.823 --> 00:15:18.630
AUDIENCE: Take action.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.190
ROBERT MACPHEE: What's that?

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:19.780
AUDIENCE: Take action.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.510
ROBERT MACPHEE: Take action.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.460
OK.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.220
So I have a copy in
my book here.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.470
And it is signed, good.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.640
And I'm going to give you a
signed copy of my book, for

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.190
two reasons.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.570
One is because that is in fact
the word that I was looking

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.880
for, that we have to take action
before we're going to

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.850
get any new results.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.430
And the other reason I'm
sharing a book is

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.420
because it's lunchtime.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.760
You guys have been
working hard.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.240
It's the middle of the day.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.530
And you're thinking,
wait a minute.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.000
He asked a question.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.730
She answered the question.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.190
She got a free book.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.160
ROBERT MACPHEE: Next time he
asks a question, maybe I

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.720
should answer the question.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.900
So just going to kind of try
and keep you engaged here.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.640
But isn't it true?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.750
In order to create results, we
have to get into action.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.870
Now I wrote this book.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.910
It's called "Manifesting for
Non-Gurus." And I normally

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.040
don't even use the word
"manifesting" in a corporate

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.710
environment, because it
has me back out on the

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.000
street really quickly.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.950
Because manifesting has
this vision, right?

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.500
Like I'm just going to sit at
home, I'm going to be on my

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.560
couch, I'm going to hold my
hands in the right way, and

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.300
put on the right music, and
light the right number of

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.170
candles, and all my dreams
are going to come true.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.570
But in my experience
with manifesting,

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.120
that's not it at all.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.470
It absolutely has to come from
taking action, taking what I

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.010
call inspired action.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.060
So here's where it gets
a little tricky.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.320
What comes before any
action that we take?

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.092
What precedes any action
that we take?

00:16:38.092 --> 00:16:40.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.680
ROBERT MACPHEE: You're
ineligible.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.620
You already have a book.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.650
ROBERT MACPHEE: It sounds
like she may have

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:45.960
already read the book.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.600
Now I've got two people back
here raising their hands.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.670
How cool is that?

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.128
What was the answer?

00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:52.960
AUDIENCE: You have to really
think about your [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.090
ROBERT MACPHEE: You have to
really think about it.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.900
All right.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.550
So I can't do my Tony Robbins,
like charge up the aisle.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.460
Can you guys pass that
book back there?

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.380
And again, thank you.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.780
Thoughts.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.069
Before any action we take,
there's always some thinking.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.690
Sometimes it's very
well-thought-out, very

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.460
methodical, very orchestrated.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.510
We all think it all through.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.670
And other times, how many of you
have ever said the words,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.119
what was I thinking?

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.339
What was I thinking
before I did that?

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.720
But there's always
some thought.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.160
And if you notice, we
think in pictures.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.900
We think in imagery.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.700
So the next, as we go through
this, is to think, well, what

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.400
leads to the thoughts
we think?

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.670
What is it that's putting these
images in our minds that

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.426
are dictating the actions we
take and the results we get?

00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:40.420
AUDIENCE: Observation.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.166
ROBERT MACPHEE: Observation.

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:42.020
AUDIENCE: Desire.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.766
ROBERT MACPHEE: Desire?

00:17:42.766 --> 00:17:44.080
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.553
ROBERT MACPHEE: Emotion?

00:17:44.553 --> 00:17:46.430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.883
ROBERT MACPHEE: What's that?

00:17:46.883 --> 00:17:47.790
AUDIENCE: Stimulus.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.940
ROBERT MACPHEE: Stimulus?

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.660
AUDIENCE: Problems.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.876
ROBERT MACPHEE: Problems?

00:17:50.876 --> 00:17:51.688
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:51.688 --> 00:17:52.500
AUDIENCE: Experiences.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.250
ROBERT MACPHEE: Experiences?

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:53.480
OK.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.870
So this could be like
a whole hour-long

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.050
workshop, in and of itself.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.090
And I'm sorry to say, there's
no free book here.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.070
Because the reality is there's
so many different things that

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.100
are creating the images that
we hold in our minds.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.620
And I'm going to lump a bunch of
them into a category that I

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.330
call external influences.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.340
External influences.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.510
This is your boss.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.440
This is the media.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.460
This is the internet.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.550
This is the television, the
radio, the newspaper, the

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.050
magazines, the billboards.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.070
Your friends, your family,
your coworkers.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.910
All are bombarding us with
these external influences

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.330
that, in some cases, people are
letting dictate the way

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.330
they think, the way they
act, and the results

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.270
that they're getting.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.200
See how that works?

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.610
So there's got to be a
better way, right?

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.960
Because we don't want those
external influences to be

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.550
running our lives.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.730
And this is where we connect
into the real central theme of

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.810
today, about purpose.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.460
Because the one thing that
probably has more influence

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:53.430
than anything else on the
thoughts we think, the actions

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.760
we take, and the results
we get is our beliefs

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.020
about who we are.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.090
Our "I am" beliefs.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.500
And when we allow our beliefs
about who we are to really

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.040
dictate, to override, those
external influences, and

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.860
determine the way we think,
the way we act, and the

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.430
results we get, then we tend
to live a life that's much

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.320
more purpose-driven.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.810
We're going to have the
experience of life that we

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.470
want to be having.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.240
I used to do a lot of work with
people in the health and

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.360
fitness industry, and this
was eye-opening for them.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.450
Because what we've really
explained here is two

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.370
expressions that I know
you've heard before.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.570
Have you ever heard
the expression,

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.350
"self-fulfilling prophecy"?

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.390
So we just defined that.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.940
Because if I have a belief that
I'm overweight, out of

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.300
shape, and I don't have time
to exercise, I will think a

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.810
certain way.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.400
I will take certain actions--

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.010
or in this case, maybe not
take certain actions.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.560
And the results that show up
will tend to be in alignment

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.950
with, I'm overweight, out
of shape, and don't

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.650
have time to exercise.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.430
If, on the other hand, I think
of myself as an athlete, will

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.440
I think differently?

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.600
Absolutely, right?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.130
Will I act differently?

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.840
And will the results that
show up in my life

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.790
tend to be very different?

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.200
So it's a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.260
And the other thing that we've
defined here is the term that

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:16.960
we started with.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.420
Again, you've all heard
the expression

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.630
"comfort zone," right?

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.390
And of all the things I'm going
to share with you today,

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.380
this is probably the one to make
sure that you capture.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.610
Write this down.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.670
Because what a comfort zone
really is, when you are in a

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.040
comfort zone, is when your
beliefs about who you really

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.490
are match the results that are
showing up in your life.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.530
And this can be in the area of
finance, your income level.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.470
If your belief about what your
appropriate income level is

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.870
matching what's showing up in
your life, you tend to be in a

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:48.720
comfort zone.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.820
And there will usually be
resistance to change.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.410
In terms of health,
your body weight.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.900
In terms of your
relationships.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.900
Whatever your beliefs about
who you are, if they're

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.690
matching the results, even if
it's not what you want, you'll

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.930
tend to be in a comfort zone.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.110
So a lot of people do--

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.560
let's use New Year's resolutions
as an example.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.330
Health and fitness, New Year's
resolutions, January 1.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.100
Some external influence comes
in and says to this person

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.900
who's overweight and out of
shape, says you know what?

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.530
You ought to lose some weight.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.520
Yeah, I really want to
get in better shape.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.690
So they think differently.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.640
They get an idea.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.830
I could join the gym.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.570
They take an action.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.860
They go and join the gym.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.960
They start exercising.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.100
They might start losing
some weight.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.410
They might start
seeing results.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.210
But where are those people
on February 1?

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.070
We don't know where they are.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.430
We just know where they're
not, right?

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.060
They're not at the
gym anymore.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.000
And I believe this
is the number one

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.190
reason why that's true.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.480
The number one reason why
people start an exercise

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.210
program and quit is because they
don't address their own

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.930
beliefs about who
they really are.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.050
They're swimming upstream.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.620
They're dragging an anchor along
with them called, I am

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.940
overweight, out of shape, and I
don't have time to exercise.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.810
And until they change
those beliefs.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.940
So what we encourage people to
do, in my work, is to start

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.460
with that "I am" belief.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.370
To start by declaring, I
am worth twice as much

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.360
money as I am making.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.890
Or I am my ideal body weight.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.590
Or I am an athlete.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.220
Or I deserve to be in a
nurturing relationship.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.250
Whatever it is.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.290
Now pop quiz.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.150
If I encourage anyone in this
room to do that, to change

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.760
their belief about who
you really are--

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.413
how many of you talk to
yourselves, by the way?

00:22:31.413 --> 00:22:32.940
Anyone talk to yourselves?

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.030
OK.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.910
I've learned that there's
usually, in a room this size,

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.150
about three or four people who
are thinking to themselves,

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:38.800
talk to myself?

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.700
Do I talk to myself?

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.550
I don't think I talk to myself.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:41.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.460
ROBERT MACPHEE: But the reality
is we all talk to

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.840
ourselves, right?

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.740
So if I say to you to make
this new declaration--

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.810
double your income, lose
the weight, get into a

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.320
relationship, whatever it is--

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.390
what does the mind say?

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.640
What's the conversation?

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.094
What's the response?

00:22:58.094 --> 00:22:58.970
AUDIENCE: OK, how?

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.740
ROBERT MACPHEE: OK, how?

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.600
I have three kids.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.110
My youngest is now 15.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:09.370
When she was younger, she used
to say, yeah, right.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.660
Because there's that
self-doubt.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.970
There's, you've tried
before and failed.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.180
You've never been
able to do this.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.740
What makes you think
you can do that?

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.620
Trying to keep you in
your comfort zone.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.330
Because the belief that you're
declaring about doubling your

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.310
income or losing the weight or
whatever doesn't match the

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.720
results that are showing
up right now, right?

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.700
Because your income right
now is what it is.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.300
Your body shape, your weight,
is what it is right now.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.780
So this is you trying to stay
in your comfort zone.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.010
But here's the beauty of this
model, in terms of creating

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.980
lasting change, is that when
people are willing to start by

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.120
declaring a new belief, and
really connecting to that and

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.590
recognizing how important it is,
and to hold on to that and

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.560
allow the new ideas, the new
thoughts, the new approaches

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.890
to emerge that will lead them to
taking the actions that are

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.240
necessary to create change, to
do things differently at home,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.940
at work, wherever it is, and
then to allow those new

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.820
results to show up that'll match
the new belief, then

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.890
we've created a new
comfort zone.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.980
So you've literally created
a result that matches your

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.930
desired belief, and now you
let go of the resistance

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.270
because you've created
a new comfort zone.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.730
That make sense?

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.390
And again, it works in any
area of your life.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.690
And again, if you look at this
in the context of your teams,

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:32.020
it can work in groups just as
much as with individuals.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.580
Some of the conflict and issues
and turbulence that

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.680
shows up amongst teams is
because we have all these

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.810
different perceptions of
who we really are.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.490
And when the team gets really
clear about a shared vision

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.700
and purpose, and stays clear
about that, it's much easier

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.740
to go through this whole process
of ideas and actions

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.300
and results.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.240
So again, what I coach people
to do is start in that lower

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.990
left-hand corner, with "I am."
Our beliefs about who we

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.440
really are.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.830
And my work is really focused
in that area.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.800
I mentioned that I
have this book.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.070
I also have a partner journal.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.580
And when I was halfway through
writing the book, I created

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.100
this journal.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.420
Because like I told you guys
at the beginning, I'm

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.870
passionate about people
implementing what I teach.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.110
How many of you have heard
the term "shelf

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.540
help?" Ever heard that?

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.570
I don't want my book to
become shelf help.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.870
Which means people buy it with
the best of intentions, they

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.750
go home, they put it on a shelf,
and they never read it.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.810
That doesn't do anyone
any good.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.670
So the journal is a
way for people to

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.060
implement the approach.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.110
And what I'm going to do now
is I'm actually to show you

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.610
what that approach is, the
five-step approach that I

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.850
teach people to lead more of
the kind of life that they

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.760
really want to be leading.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.000
And we're going to go through
five simple steps.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.020
So the first question that
I teach, that I use--

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.750
and this is the connection
from the previous model--

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.830
is the question, who am I?

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.600
Who am I?

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.020
Now, if we were to walk out on
campus here and just start

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.056
asking people, who are you?

00:26:01.056 --> 00:26:01.542
Who are you?

00:26:01.542 --> 00:26:02.190
Who are you?

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.390
What kind of answers
do you think

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.632
would come up for people?

00:26:04.632 --> 00:26:05.810
AUDIENCE: Job title.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.900
ROBERT MACPHEE: Job
title, right?

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.600
AUDIENCE: Their name.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.850
ROBERT MACPHEE: Their name.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.450
It's usually the
roles we play.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.560
And that is one area of
who we really are, the

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.890
roles that we play.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.160
But I believe this is really
more how we express who we

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.310
really are.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.580
In my book and in the journal,
we look at the question, who

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.370
am I, from four different
points of view.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.850
The first is our roles.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.110
The second is our skills and
talents, the things that we're

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.750
really good at, we tend
to identify with.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.810
The third is what we
call contribution.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.610
And this is one of the really
powerful elements.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:43.400
When we really are connected to
our sense of contribution,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.730
what we're here to do, how we
can improve other people's

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.640
lives as well as ours, we get a
strong sense of who we are.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:55.860
And then the fourth part is
what we call core self.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.300
Who we are beyond this
human experience.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.890
Beyond the body, the car we
drive, the clothes we wear,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.640
the thoughts we think,
all that.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.050
Who are we?

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.600
And it's really quite profound
when people connect at a deep

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.850
level to a sense of
who we really are.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.420
So I invite you--

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.810
again, I do a two-and-a-half-day
weekend

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.990
workshop, and we spend a whole
day on this question.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.940
Who am I?

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.590
We have an hour today.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.810
So there's not that much we
can really do with it.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.070
But I invite you in this moment
to just ask yourself

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.670
that question.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.050
Who am I?

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.820
If we had more time, I'd
actually partner you guys up

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.650
and have you sit across from
someone and ask the question,

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.680
who are you?

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.690
Who are you?

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:36.320
Who are you?

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.000
Over and over again, for
about a minute to a

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.370
minute and a half.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.510
And the experience, for most
people, the first thing that

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.800
comes up, is what
you guys said.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.540
It's the roles.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.260
It's the things we do.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.400
But when someone keeps asking,
and you have to keep coming up

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.530
with different answers,
we tend to go deeper.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.360
We tend to connect to who we
really are, what's most

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.450
important to us.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.500
Things like the contribution
that we really want to make.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.540
One of the things I've loved
about looking at this company

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.050
is that I know that's
a really important

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.580
part of your culture.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.810
Making a contribution.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.100
Doing something worthwhile.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.150
Impacting other people's
lives.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.650
I would imagine most of you come
to work on a daily basis,

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.620
knowing that you're doing
something much bigger than

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.930
what your day-to-day
responsibilities are.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.490
And that's what we mean by
really being connected to that

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.020
sense of, who am I?

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.270
And it's also what I mean by how
it affects organizations

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.250
as well as individuals.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.980
So who am I?

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.870
So this second question's a
little more straightforward.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.400
It's called, what am I
intending to attract?

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.330
And I kind of asked you guys
this question at the beginning

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.490
of the presentation today.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.990
What are you intending
to attract?

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.030
What is the result that
you want to create?

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.170
And what I'm going to
ask you to do is--

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.140
a lot of you don't have
something to write with.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.370
But if you can, write it down.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:53.250
And in this moment, declare
an intention.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.880
Declare a desired result.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.560
A specific and measurable
result.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.550
Just think for a minute about
what that would be.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.480
What are you intending
to attract?

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.640
It could be something
personal.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.490
It could be something
professional.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:08.710
It could be health-related.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.390
It could be
relationship-related.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.830
Whatever it is, in your
mind or on paper,

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.425
declare your intention.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.490
And I invite you, as you do
that, to kind of peek back

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.890
over your shoulder at the first
question we looked at,

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.910
and ask yourself, is that
intention in alignment, with

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.160
who you really are?

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.320
The approach I teach is to get
people to be really clear

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.890
about their intentions, but also
to really know that those

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.985
intentions are in alignment
with who they really are.

00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:44.800
Because that's a very powerful
place to act from.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.140
Does everyone have something
in mind?

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.110
OK.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.820
So how many of you would be
willing to share your

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.500
intention with the group?

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.820
Even if you might
get a free book?

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.900
No, I'm kidding.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.270
Oh, another hand popped
up back there.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.190
OK.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.810
So I'm not going to ask you
to share your intention.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:01.920
But what I am going to do--

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.730
I want to ask for some feedback
from those of you who

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.460
didn't raise your hand.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.000
And remember, I asked you
how many of you talk to

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.775
yourselves?

00:30:08.775 --> 00:30:10.330
And you all pretty much
raised your hand.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.540
We all talk to ourselves.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.910
When I said, how many of you
would like to share your

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.710
intention, would be willing
to share your intention?

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.090
Something happened there.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.160
A conversation started, right?

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.240
And I'd just like to hear some
examples of what you told

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.610
yourself, that said, no,
don't raise your hand.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.840
What was your reason for not
raising your hand and sharing

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.580
your intention?

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.460
And there's no right or wrong
or good or bad answers.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.420
I just want to get a sense of
what kind of things come up

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.266
for people.

00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.890
AUDIENCE: I wanted to hear
what other people had.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.740
ROBERT MACPHEE: You wanted
to hear what other

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.510
people had to say.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.760
OK.

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:40.210
AUDIENCE: Gets really long,
really quickly.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.680
ROBERT MACPHEE: OK, so it
got kind of long-winded.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.450
OK.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.940
AUDIENCE: Only going to
make sense to myself.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.610
It was an inner thought.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:47.720
ROBERT MACPHEE: OK.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.320
So it's only going that
make sense to

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.030
you, versus the group.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.670
All right.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:53.710
AUDIENCE: It's too revealing.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.230
ROBERT MACPHEE: Too revealing,
too personal.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.370
OK.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:56.920
Anything else?

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.720
AUDIENCE: A little
bit shameful?

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.240
ROBERT MACPHEE: What's that?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.950
AUDIENCE: A little
bit shameful?

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:02.940
ROBERT MACPHEE: A little
bit of shame about the

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.890
choice that you made.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:04.840
OK.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.280
So here's what I'm going
to ask you all to do.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.710
First of all, I'm going to teach
you a little bit of a

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.700
facilitation technique.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.370
Because I'm about to a total
control of the room go to you

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:14.700
guys, instead of me.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.240
In a minute, I'm going
to ask you to stand

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.100
up and get a partner.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.200
But before we do that,
I want to teach

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.600
you a little technique.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.220
And you're going to be talking
amongst ourselves.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.230
And in order for me to get
control of the room back, and

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.480
keep us moving forward and
finish on time, I'm going to

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.390
raise my hand at one point.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.370
And when I raise my hand, if
you see my hand go up, I'm

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.430
going to ask you to raise
your hand as well.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.390
And when you raise your hand,
you're going to pretend like

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.060
there's a string attached to
your hand and your jaw.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.745
So when your hand goes
up, your jaw shuts

00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:44.950
and you stop talking.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.590
Right?

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.140
So this is just a way-- you guys
are going to be talking

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.670
amongst yourselves for just a
minute, and it's a way for us

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.940
to just bring the attention back
to the front of the room.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.760
So let's try that.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.340
Go ahead and just turn to the
person next to you, or the

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.220
person behind you, and just talk
to them about anything.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.270
What you're having for lunch,
whatever it might be.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.950
When you see my hand go up--

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.160
ROBERT MACPHEE: All right.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.780
Very good.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.430
All right.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.150
So I'm going to ask everyone
to stand up.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.190
And find yourself a
partner and sit

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.550
down facing your partner.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.700
The reason I asked you to stand
up first is for those of

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.070
you who are in between--

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.210
like this person goes that way
for a partner, this person

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.370
goes that way, and you're
standing there alone, once you

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.660
have your partner, sit down
facing your partner, it's

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.680
going to make it really easy for
the people who don't yet

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.930
have a partner to
find somebody.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.270
So just sit down facing
your partner.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.730
You guys are good.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:40.290
Very good.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:40.960
OK.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.430
So I need to--

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.920
let's see.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.870
In each partnership, I need you
to figure out who has the

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.310
longest hair.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.810
Person who has the
longest hair.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.390
If it's the exact same length,
it would be the darkest color

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:54.450
that we'll go with.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.450
And that person is going
to go first.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.770
And what you're going to do is
for one minute, you're going

00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.950
to share whatever it is you're

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:02.680
comfortable about your intention.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.240
What came to mind for you?

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.850
And if you don't want to,
if it's something really

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.540
personal, and you don't want to
go all the way into depth

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.430
about it, you can give
kind of an overview.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.010
But just for-- and I'm going to
give you like 45 seconds.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.030
Just share with your partner
about what came up for you

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.980
when you declared
that intention.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:17.730
OK?

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.170
So person with the longest
or darkest hair

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.360
is going to go first.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.780
You have 45 seconds.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.710
Go ahead and begin.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.130
I totally looked at the wrong
number on my clock, and I have

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.570
no idea how much time
that actually was.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.870
But it feels like about
45 seconds.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.290
So we're going to switch roles
now, and if you were

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.460
listening, you're going
to be sharing.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.910
If you were sharing, you're
going to be listening.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.740
This time, it really
will be 45 seconds.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.760

Now I want to hear from a couple
people, especially

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.060
those who didn't raise your
hand-- which is the vast

ROBERT MACPHEE: It was what?

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.655
AUDIENCE: Good to go second.

00:34:46.655 --> 00:34:47.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.475 --> 00:34:48.580
ROBERT MACPHEE: Good
to go second?

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.152
Why was it good to go second?

00:34:50.152 --> 00:34:52.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.179
ROBERT MACPHEE: OK.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:54.130
So he survived.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.730
It was OK for him.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:56.480
No, that's a good point.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.890
Because once we have a chance to
kind of see how we respond

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.960
to someone else, we can imagine
maybe they'll respond

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.860
the same way, right?

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.840
AUDIENCE: I realize other people
have the same issues

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.050
and concerns that I do.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.670
ROBERT MACPHEE: Realized other
people have the same kind of

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:09.430
issues that I do.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:10.440
They want the same
kind of thing.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.030
How many of you had that
experience, where you realized

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.430
there was some similarity
of intention?

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.090
OK.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.150
So again, we could take sharing,
we could do a full

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.990
hour just on this.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:21.570
But I asked you to do
that because every--

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.900
I actually thought it might
be different today.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.550
Every time, I think it
might be different.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.330
This is Google.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.570
These guys are all going
to raise their hands.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.640
They're all going to
want to share.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.010
But there's something that tells
us it's not OK to share.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.250
Now should you share your most
important, your most personal

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.933
intentions with everyone?

00:35:34.933 --> 00:35:35.820
AUDIENCE: No.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.000
ROBERT MACPHEE: No.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.100
Absolutely not.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.280
But aren't we all surrounded
by like-minded, supportive,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.160
encouraging people somewhere
in our life?

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.320
And if we're willing to share
our goals, our intentions, our

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.220
desires, our dreams,
we can get help.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.200
Did anyone find that the person
you shared with said,

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.405
ooh, I can help you with that?

00:35:53.405 --> 00:35:57.100
Did that show up anywhere?

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.140
Well, that just blasts my whole
theory about Google

00:35:59.140 --> 00:35:59.625
right there.

00:35:59.625 --> 00:35:59.890
Come on.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.930
AUDIENCE: We're good
listeners.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:03.610
ROBERT MACPHEE: But
that can help.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.850
Really good listeners, OK.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.680
You guys really follow
instructions well.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.500
That's great.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.260
But do you get a sense
of, its OK, right?

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.340
To stick your toe
in the water, to

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.640
share with one person.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.550
And granted, I asked you to do
something that was a much

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.910
bigger stretch, to stand
up in front of the

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.590
whole group and share.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.180
That's a different question
than just

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.810
sharing with one person.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.100
But you have the experience.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.620
Most people aren't willing to
share even with one person.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.330
So I want to give you the
experience of what it's like

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.070
to share that intention, to
anchor it in more deeply, to

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.360
get more clear about how
important it is to you.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.640
And hopefully get a
clearer vision.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.760
Get clarification and feedback
from someone, get support and

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.000
help, whatever it might be.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.880
So that's our intentions.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.300
The third question of the
approach that I teach, after

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.830
we look at setting our intention
and making sure that

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.270
intention is in alignment with
who we really are, is to ask

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.200
the question, how will I feel?

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.210
How will I feel?

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.220
And when we look at
manifestation, when we look at

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.360
creating new results in our
life, we look at things like

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.000
the law of attraction, I believe
this question about

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.600
feeling and emotion is really
the language of all this work.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.190
That when we connect deeply to
the feelings and emotions we

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:13.250
most want to experience, we
start attracting more of that

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.740
into our life.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.640
I work with people all the time,
and they've got, like, a

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.930
pocketful of 3x5 cards with
their visualizations, their

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:20.530
affirmations.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.440
They've got them all
written down.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.560
They'll come up to me and
they'll go, I heard this guy

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.830
Jack Canfield speak, or I read
your book, or whatever.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.980
And I know, I've been doing
my visualizations, my

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.510
affirmations, every
single day.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.470
And this stuff doesn't work.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.835
And I'm thinking to myself,
what's the feeling and emotion

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:36.840
that this person is
experiencing?

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.810
There's anger, there's
resentment, there's fear,

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.270
there's doubt, there's worry.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.190
And I believe that person is
sending a message to the

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.280
universe saying, please send me
more anxiety, fear, doubt,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.850
worry, pain, all of that.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.400
Because that's the feeling
and emotion that they're

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.900
experiencing.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.880
So of all these questions that
I teach as part of the

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.920
journal, "How will I feel?"
is the simplest one.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.120
But I believe it's the
most powerful one.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.760
When we really connect to the
feeling and emotion of what it

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.800
will be like to earn more money,
to be our ideal body

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.670
weight, to be in the perfect
relationship,

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.530
how will that feel?

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.224
To me, that's what really
gets the wheels moving.

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:15.800
I'd love to spend more
time on that, but.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.520
OK.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.630
The fourth question, the fourth
step that we look at,

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.990
is called letting go
of attachments.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.870
How many of you would agree
that we have a tendency to

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.080
make things more difficult
than they need to be?

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.340
Anyone else, or is
that just me?

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.270
OK.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.370
So attachments is
how we do that.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.960
Attachments, the way I define
it, is any way that we're

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.220
using our attention, our
thinking, our beliefs, in ways

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.560
that are not supporting us.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.570
This is things like needing
to figure out how to do it

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.210
ourselves, needing to figure
out all the steps before we

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.290
get started, needing it to
happen now, being worried

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.470
about what other people might
think, judgment of other

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.650
people or judgment
of ourselves.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.340
These are all ways that we
can use our attention

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.780
that don't serve us.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.030
That are slowing us down, rather
than speeding us up.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:03.100
So part of my work is about,
first of all, identifying what

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.490
those attachments are, and
second of all, looking at ways

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.800
that we can let go of
those attachments.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.170
There's some amazingly powerful
resources out there

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:15.000
to help us to recognize what the
attachments are that are

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.220
getting in our way, and
ways to let go.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.490
Again, in an hour today, we
don't have time to really go

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:21.800
into depth on that.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.260
But when you start recognizing
and being aware of what your

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.220
own attachments are, what are
the things that are getting in

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.880
your way, and get better at
letting go of those, it's

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.920
amazing how you can accelerate
your results.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.680
One thing that I do in my work
that's a little bit unique, in

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.230
terms of this area of letting go
of attachments, is this is

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:43.200
where we focus in on gratitude
and appreciation.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.990
I believe that gratitude
and appreciation--

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.330
first of all, it's kind of a
nice bridge from the feeling

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.240
step into this look
at attachments.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.290
But sometimes when people set
a goal and they realize that

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.080
it's really in alignment with
who they are, they connect to

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.820
the feeling and emotion of how
they really want to be

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.270
experiencing life, and they know
that this goal is perfect

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.280
for that, they can get to
the point where they,

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.380
like, really need it.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.450
Like, I need it to happen.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.410
Like, it's so important.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.390
My life won't be complete
unless I have it.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.420
And I believe gratitude and
appreciation is the way to

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.300
stay out of that trap.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.900
Because we really
don't need it.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.050
Our lives, everyone in this
room, our lives are

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.130
amazing right now.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:26.050
And if we pause and allow
ourselves just to be grateful

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.610
for the blessings that we have
now-- the friends, the family,

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:31.330
the opportunities, where we
live, this amazing company

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.665
that you're working for, this
environment here that's just

00:40:33.665 --> 00:40:34.680
so remarkable.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.470
When we pause and allow
ourselves to be grateful, we

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:42.340
can settle into a state that I
call high intention and low

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.830
attachment.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:45.900
High intention--

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.870
clarity, focus, certainty
about what

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.440
you're working on achieving.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.950
But low attachment.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.060
I don't need this.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.380
My life is amazing
just as it is.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.630
And when you really settle into
that state, it's amazing

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.290
how powerful we can be.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.330
How many of you have ever dealt
with a salesperson who

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.890
needed to make the sale?

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.160
Anyone?

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:03.920
OK.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.330
And how many of you have dealt
with a salesperson who was so

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.260
passionate about what they do,
so unattached, they were just

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.190
so passionate about what they
do, that you bought something

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.820
from them that you
didn't even need.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.740
Right?

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.400
That's the difference that
I'm talking about.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.260
High intention, clarity,
focus.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:22.010
On purpose, but non-attached.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.180
And then finally, the fifth step
that we teach is called

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.340
taking inspired action.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.760
Which brings us back to
that four-part model.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.530
No new result is going
to be showing up

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.610
without taking action.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.040
But the difference is with this
kind of approach, with

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.910
asking ourselves these kinds
of questions, we are taking

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.560
action from a different place.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.030
From a different
point of view.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.140
I tell people what most people
are doing out there, when they

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.200
get around this kind of
goal-setting, personal

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.700
development kind of work,
is they're looking

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.910
at step number two.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.070
They set a goal.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.400
And then they skip right
ahead to step

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.420
number five, take action.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.060
Right?

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.010
And these are the people that
are working hard, lots of

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.870
effort, will power.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.860
No matter what, I'm
going to do it.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.540
And they may be getting results,
but in terms of the

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.490
experience that I talked about,
they're rarely having

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.050
the experience that they
want to be having.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.160
And they're rarely getting
results that really last.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.490
So I encourage people to take
a look at the difference.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.370
Like what would the difference
be if I really was

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.970
clear about who I am?

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.630
If I was connected to the
feelings and emotions that I

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.330
most want to experience?

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.670
And if I had increased my
awareness of and inability to

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:30.330
let go of the attachments
before I take action?

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.590
And how different
would that be?

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:39.480
So I had one other piece.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.120
Oh, we have time.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:40.517
Cool.

00:42:40.517 --> 00:42:42.250
Thought we were out of time.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:42.570
All right.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:46.020
So when I get into inspired
action, I rarely have people

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.200
go, action, that's bogus.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.620
I just want to sit on the
couch and meditate.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.460
I don't want to take action.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.510
People know they need
to take action.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.730
So I want to share with
you something.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.000
Does everyone have something
to write on?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.010
So I'm going to ask you take a
piece of paper and a pen or

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.180
pencil, and be ready to write.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.990
Because I'm going to have you
do an exercise related to

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.440
multitasking.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.590
Now how many of you, personally
or professionally,

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.290
are put in a position where
you feel like you need to

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:08.570
periodically multitask?

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:09.660
Anyone?

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.560
OK.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.700
So how many of you consider
yourself to be really good

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.320
multitaskers?

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.230
Anyone in the room think
you're a really good

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.800
multitasker?

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.320
Couple of them.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.100
OK.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.660
So I'm going to give you
a point of view about

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.270
multitasking.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.470
I'm going to ask you to write
out a sentence in a minute.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.120
And this is the sentence.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.370
Now everyone always
wants to cheat.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:28.740
So I can't really see very well,
but you're going to have

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.270
to wait until I say go.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.210
OK?

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.280
I'm going to ask you, in a
minute, to write this sentence

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.630
out but to do it in
a very unique way.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.130
You're going to write it
one letter at a time.

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:40.070
And then after you write the
letter, you're going to write

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.080
a number below it.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.170
It's going to go
just like this.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.070
You're going to start with the
letter M. And then below it,

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.160
you're going to write
the number 1.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.900
Then you're going to go back up
to the letters and write U,

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.500
and go down and write 2.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:55.410
L, 3, T, 4.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.670
I hope that's as far as I went.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:57.610
Yes.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.010
So you see how that works?

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.760
Letter, number, letter,
number.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.210
And I'm going to time you.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.540
OK?

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.770
And when you're done, you're
going to-- don't start yet.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.860
There's always people
who want to cheat.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.570
When you're done, you're
going to stand up.

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.670
And I will tell you
how long it took.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.310
So keep track of how
long it took.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:19.110
So you all ready?

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:19.740
Don't start yet.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.620
Don't start till I say go.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.700
Oh, I saw that.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.780
All right.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.640
All right, so ready?

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.390
Go.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:28.960
31.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.420
35.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.630
Remember how long it took you.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:38.102
40.

00:44:38.102 --> 00:44:46.038
44.

00:44:46.038 --> 00:44:47.526
51.

00:44:47.526 --> 00:44:49.014
53.

00:44:49.014 --> 00:44:51.494
55.

00:44:51.494 --> 00:44:53.942
57.

00:44:53.942 --> 00:44:54.910
59.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:55.220
OK.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.640
So if you didn't finish, go
ahead and just notice how far

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.150
you got in one minute.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.600
So just make a note of
how far you got.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.850
And everyone else
can sit down.

00:45:04.272 --> 00:45:06.470
Now I'm just curious, how many
of you are doing this on a

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.940
phone or a computer?

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.600
That's so cool.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.430
All right.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:11.150
That's a first for me.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.420
I'll share that with all the
other groups I do this with.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.160
So now I'm going to ask
to do it differently.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.060
Same task, but you're going
to do it differently.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.470
And again, don't start
till I say go.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.830
I'm going to time you again.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.190
Anybody notice the level of
anxiety that started to show

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.560
up when other people finished
ahead of you?

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.270
Right back to second
grade, right?

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.610
OK.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.740
So this time, the same thing.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.680
You're going to write
all the letters and

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.970
then all the numbers.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:34.630
And this time, you're going to
write the letters first.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.760
Write the whole sentence
from start to finish.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.730
And then you're going to write--
there's actually 27

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:40.550
numbers, so you're going
to go from 1 to 27.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:41.500
Don't start yet.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.840
I see those pens come up.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.880
So when I say go, you're going
to write the whole sentence

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.560
and then the numbers 1 to 27.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.080
Same thing, stand up
when you're done.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.300
Ready, go.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.950
Stay standing.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:46:03.380
18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24,
25, 27, 28, 29, 30.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:03.640
OK.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.015
So again, if you didn't finish,
notice how far you got

00:46:06.015 --> 00:46:07.760
in 30 seconds.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.010
So have a seat.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.270
So what was the difference
between the two?

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:18.210
What's that?

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.410
By a show of hands, how
many of you got

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.660
further the second time?

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.200
And what was the experience
like the first time?

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.740
What was the experience like of
doing one, then the other,

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.656
then going back and forth?

00:46:31.656 --> 00:46:32.144
AUDIENCE: Frustrating.

00:46:32.144 --> 00:46:33.120
AUDIENCE: Very frustrating.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.720
ROBERT MACPHEE: Frustrating.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.270
Someone else up here
said frustrating.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.810
What other--?

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.054
AUDIENCE: I noticed there was a
mental jar, soon as I got to

00:46:38.054 --> 00:46:39.410
the two-digit numbers.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:40.400
ROBERT MACPHEE: A mental
jar when--

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.750
OK, so a little something
different.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.380
You got to two-digit numbers
and that threw you off a

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.160
little bit.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:45.690
All right.

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:49.520
So kind of like the corks--
this particular task won't

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.780
take you very far in life,
but the experience, the

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.570
physiological experience of
realizing what it's like to go

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.810
back and forth from one task to
the other, versus making a

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:01.190
commitment to start at the
beginning and finish a task

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.110
before you move on to the
other, is an amazing

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.370
productivity tool.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:07.850
An amazing way to get
more done in a

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.820
realistic amount of time.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.425
And for people-- and
I'm one of them.

00:47:11.425 --> 00:47:13.110
I still get pulled into
multitasking.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.160
I teach this stuff.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.600
But any time you're checking
your email while you're on a

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.590
phone call, this is exactly
what you're doing.

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.800
This exercise comes from someone
named Dave Crenshaw,

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.220
who wrote a book called "The
Myth of Multitasking." And he

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.370
says there's no such thing
as multitasking.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.420
There's only switch-tasking.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.980
Switching back and forth.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.870
And it wears you out.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:34.080
It exhausts you.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.980
I skipped over a step of this,
which is, if I had let you all

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.090
go to the end, and I took a
little poll about how many

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.560
numbers there actually were, I
probably would've gotten 25s,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.890
26s, 28s, 29s.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:47.760
Because when you're going fast
and trying to do it, it

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.440
affects your accuracy,
as well.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.600
So the degree to which you're
able to commit blocks of time,

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.030
finish something start to
finish, is the degree to which

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.850
your productivity will
really go up.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:03.850
It'll help you get more of the
inspired actions done.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:07.180
So we're pretty much where
we need to be.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.380
Were right at the
top of the hour.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.590
And I wish I could be here
all day, all afternoon.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:15.220
But I'm going to finish with
a couple questions for you.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.930
First of all, as we look at
the five steps, as the

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:18.820
questions, who am I?

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.940
What am I intending
to attract?

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.570
How will I feel?

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:26.230
Letting go of attachments
and inspired action.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:29.140
And as we look at those four
things I pointed out that we

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.670
need to be willing to do in
order to achieve mastery--

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.270
the four steps of trying
something new, asking for

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.580
help, being willing to be
uncomfortable, and being

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.360
willing to be persistent--

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.510
my question for you is what's
most important for

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.560
you to focus on?

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.290
That's nine different things.

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.360
Five steps and four things
that you need to do.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.290
For everyone in this room,
there's an area to zero in on.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.310
For some people, it might really
be getting clear about

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.230
your purpose.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.480
For other people,
it might just be

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.310
about taking more action.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:04.920
For someone else, it might be
that being willing to be

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.590
uncomfortable.

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:08.650
But again, I want everyone to
leave here with something

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.180
clear and concrete that you know
you can focus on, that

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:11.710
you can do.

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:14.000
That you can even work on and
focus on for the rest of your

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.020
day today, and say, I would
be willing to--

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.310
again, not multitask for
the rest of the day.

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:21.740
Or get clear.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.800
Take 10 minutes and really
get clear about that

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.710
question, who am I?

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.110
Whatever it is.

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:29.790
But for you, out of those nine
questions, what is most

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.620
important for you?

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.950
And the other question I would
leave you with is-- what if?

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.740
What if you led your life from
more of a place of clarity

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.900
about who you really are, what
your intentions are?

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.770
More of a connection to those
feelings and emotions you most

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.390
want to experience?

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:50.270
If you were more aware of the
attachments that get in your

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:52.560
way, and more able to let go of
those attachments, and if

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.300
you were taking more
inspired action,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.330
what would be different?

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.300
How would things be different?

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.326
And the same thing with those
mastery questions.

00:50:00.326 --> 00:50:05.170
I will support you, help
you, in any way I can.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.930
As you're looking at that one
thing, as you're considering

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.630
what that one thing is that
you'll focus on, Rachael and

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:15.800
her department actually very
graciously purchased 25 of my

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.070
books to share with those of you
who are here in the room.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.390
So if you're willing to come
up to Rachael and to share

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.610
with her what you're going to
focus on, what is that one

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.040
thing that you're going
to focus on?

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.460
What's one thing you took from
this conversation today that

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.970
you feel like you
can implement?

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.050
She's going to give you a
free copy of my book.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:32.970
Now don't climb all over each
other in order to get those,

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.200
but anyway.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.280
The other thing I have here is
I have copies of the journal.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.970
If you're interested in using
the journal and the book

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.760
together to implement this
approach, to try it out

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.490
yourself, the journals
are normally $19.95.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:47.000
You can get them for
$10 here today.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.990
For anyone who's watching online
who's not in the room,

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:53.270
there's a website called
manifestingbook.com.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:54.440
It's on the slide.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.960
And if you click on the image
of the book at that page,

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.190
manifestingbook.com, you'll get
an offer for a book and a

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.360
journal-- the books are
normally $15, the

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.510
journals are $20.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:08.320
You'll get the book and the
journal together, signed from

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.600
my office, for $20 if you
click on that link.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.280
So I'm available to help
in any way I can.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.350
Would love to stay connected and
support you in any way I

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.320
can, and that's one way.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.590
I wish I had time to tell
that story, but I don't.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.360
I'm going to finish on time.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:22.675
I don't know.

00:51:22.675 --> 00:51:24.610
Do we have time to take
a couple questions

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:26.690
if people have them?

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.300
AUDIENCE: So one thing I've
noticed when trying to

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:33.260
multitask is that it's a lot
harder to do two verbal tasks,

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.120
like talking with someone and
reading, versus talking with

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.750
someone and driving or
playing a video game.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.870
I was wondering if there's any
scientific basis for that, if

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:44.930
there's sort of like a language
part of the brain?

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.880
ROBERT MACPHEE: I don't know the
science behind it, but I

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.500
would totally agree with you.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.020
And I think it kind of depends
on how you define

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.020
multitasking.

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.150
I'm definitely that guy who's
going to put a load of laundry

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.410
in and have that laundry washing
itself while I'm

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:57.530
working on something.

00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:59.850
I'm definitely that guy who's
listening to something on tape

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.740
while I'm driving, because I
don't want to just be wasting

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.630
my time listening to sports
talk radio or

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:04.660
whatever it might be.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.650
So there's elements of kind of
complementary activities.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:10.160
And I think you bring up
a really good point.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.510
If we're using the same area of
our brain, if we're using

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:14.630
the same kind of communication
skills, if we're trying to

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:16.560
carry on one conversation at the
same time we're carrying

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.100
on another conversation, that's
the stuff that's really

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.360
going to drive us crazy.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.120
And not being a smart aleck,
but if I was speaking

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.350
somewhere else and someone asked
that question, and they

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:28.260
were really interested in the
research, where do you think

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:28.940
I'd tell them to go?

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.460
ROBERT MACPHEE: I mean,
it's all accessible.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.620
I think one of the most amazing
things about the world

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.150
we live in right now--

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.820
and this is part of the reason
I titled my book "Manifesting

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.910
for Non-Gurus"--

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:42.830
is we don't need
gurus anymore.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.570
We all have access to all the
information we could possibly

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:46.950
need, and then some.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:49.410
And we can indeed create
the lives that we

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:50.990
really want to live.

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:55.360
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a formula for

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.460
multitasking better?

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.840
I've heard--

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.390
I've heard something
like 60/40/20.

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.320
Like doing something for 60
minutes, then another priority

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.660
for 40 minutes, and taking
a break for 20.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.290
Is there something that
you've found is

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:09.480
maybe better than that?

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.100
ROBERT MACPHEE: So I'm glad you
clarified the question.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.790
Because the answer to "Is
there a way to multitask

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:16.030
better?" That's an easy
question, called no.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:18.280
Because again, there's no such
thing as multitasking.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.230
But you bring up a good point.

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:22.830
The research that I've seen
says no more than 50--

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:26.670
5-0-- minutes to really expect
yourself to be focused on any

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.380
given task.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.390
And then we need to get up.

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:29.550
We need to walk around.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.800
We need to take a breath.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.610
We need 10 minutes of a little
bit of a break before we come

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:35.540
back to whatever it is
we're working on.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.570
But most people don't even give
themselves that kind of

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:39.290
block of time.

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.680
I'm talking about, you know, the
phone is off, the door is

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.460
closed, everything is shut
down, so you're totally

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.930
focused on something
for 50 minutes.

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:49.660
It's amazing how much you can
get done if you do that.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.260
If you try to do that for two
hours, the mind can't keep up.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.330
You can't do that.

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:57.450
So 50 minutes, and then take a
break, and then come back, is

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.370
the number that I've seen.

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.730
So thank you all very much.

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:05.615
[APPLAUSE]
