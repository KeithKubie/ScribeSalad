00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:12.691
In 1815, the eruption of Mount Tambora
plunged parts of the world into darkness

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:18.260
and marked a gloomy period that came 
to be known as The Year Without a Summer.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.931
So when Mary and Percy Shelley arrived
at the House of Lord Byron on Lake Geneva,

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:26.192
their vacation was mostly spent indoors.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:30.621
For amusement, Byron proposed a challenge
to his literary companions:

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:34.331
Who could write the most chilling
ghost story?

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:37.730
This sparked an idea in 18-year-old Mary.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.603
Over the next few months, she would craft
the story of Frankenstein.

00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:46.172
Popular depictions may evoke a green
and groaning figure,

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:48.902
but that's not Mary Shelley's monster.

00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:53.562
In fact, in the book, Frankenstein
refers to the nameless monster's maker,

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:56.182
Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:59.572
So tense is the struggle between
creator and creature

00:00:59.572 --> 00:01:03.345
that the two have merged 
in our collective imagination.

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:06.024
Before you read 
or reread the original text,

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.959
there are several other things that 
are helpful to know about Frankenstein

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:13.283
and how it came to assume 
its multiple meanings.

00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:18.686
The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's
futile quest to impart and sustain life.

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:22.173
He constructs his monster
part by part from dead matter

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:25.254
and electrifies it into conscious being.

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:30.683
Upon completing the experiment, however,
he's horrified at the result and flees.

00:01:30.683 --> 00:01:34.293
But time and space aren't enough
to banish the abandoned monster,

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:38.578
and the plot turns on a chilling chase
between the two.

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:41.214
Shelley subtitled her 
fireside ghost story,

00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:43.153
"The Modern Prometheus."

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:46.285
That's in reference to the Greek myth
of the Titan Prometheus

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:50.073
who stole fire from the gods
and gave it to humanity.

00:01:50.073 --> 00:01:52.314
This gave humanity knowledge and power,

00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:54.534
but for tampering with the status quo,

00:01:54.534 --> 00:02:00.074
Prometheus was chained to a rock
and eaten by vultures for eternity.

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:03.754
Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence
in the literature of the Romantic Period

00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:05.674
during the 18th century.

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.554
Mary was a prominent Romantic,

00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:13.166
and shared the movement's appreciation for
nature, emotion, and the purity of art.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.744
Two years after 
Mary released "Frankenstein",

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:19.815
Percy reimagined the plight
of Prometheus in his lyrical drama,

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:21.905
"Prometheus Unbound."

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:24.395
The Romantics used 
these mythical references

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:28.816
to signal the purity of the Ancient World
in contrast to modernity.

00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:31.405
They typically regarded science
with suspicion,

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:34.525
and "Frankenstein" is one of the first
cautionary tales

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.485
about artificial intelligence.

00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.666
For Shelley, the terror
was not supernatural,

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:41.873
but born in a lab.

00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:45.265
In addition, gothic devices 
infuse the text.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.155
The gothic genre is characterized
by unease,

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:49.375
eerie settings,

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:50.566
the grotesque,

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:52.646
and the fear of oblivion -

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:55.976
all elements that can 
be seen in "Frankenstein."

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:59.175
But this horror had roots 
in personal trauma, as well.

00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:03.484
The text is filled with references
to Shelley's own circumstances.

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:10.186
Born in 1797, Mary was the child
of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:03:10.186 --> 00:03:12.415
Both were radical intellectual figures,

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:16.097
and her mother's book,
"A Vindication of the Rights of Women,"

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:18.367
is a key feminist text.

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:22.506
Tragically, she died as a result of
complications from Mary's birth.

00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.967
Mary was haunted by her mother's death,

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:28.695
and later experienced her own
problems with childbirth.

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:32.687
She became pregnant following
her elopement with Percy at 16,

00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:35.958
but that baby died shortly after birth.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.426
Out of four more pregnancies,
only one of their children survived.

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:44.598
Some critics have linked this tragedy
to the themes explored in "Frankenstein."

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:48.417
Shelley depicts birth as both creative
and destructive,

00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:53.786
and the monster becomes a disfigured
mirror of the natural cycle of life.

00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:58.407
The monster, therefore, embodies
Dr. Frankenstein's corruption of nature

00:03:58.407 --> 00:04:00.446
in the quest for glory.

00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:03.967
This constitutes his fatal flaw, 
or hamartia.

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:06.347
His god complex is most clear in the line,

00:04:06.347 --> 00:04:11.546
"Life and death appear to me ideal bounds
which I should first break through

00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:15.898
and pour a torrent of light
onto our dark world."

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:18.228
Although he accomplishes
something awe-inspiring,

00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:22.048
he has played with fire at his own
ethical expense.

00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:24.496
And that decision echoes 
throughout the novel,

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:30.177
which is full of references to fire
and imagery that contrasts light and dark.

00:04:30.177 --> 00:04:34.398
These moments suggest not only the spark
of Prometheus's fire,

00:04:34.398 --> 00:04:39.198
but the power of radical ideas to expose
darker areas of life.
