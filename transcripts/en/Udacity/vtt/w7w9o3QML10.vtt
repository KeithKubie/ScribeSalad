Matt I'm really sorry I tried to mutate your genome.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.290
&gt;&gt; It's okay. I understand but now you know

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.450
the power mutation has to shape traits and drive evolution.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.380
&gt;&gt; I do. But you know what, to be honest I'm kind

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.270
of jealous. You have your own genome book when do I get mine?

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.210
&gt;&gt; Well how about we do that now.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.790
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.650
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson we're going to

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.640
learn how you can obtain your own personal

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.420
genetic information and interpret it. Okay, and I

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.300
promise not to bring any more radiative ooze.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.040
&gt;&gt; Well, at least there wasn't any damage done.
