00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:10.817
Fu Manchu was one of the most
notorious escape artists

00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:13.777
at the Omaha Zoo in the 1960s.

00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:15.498
But he wasn't a performer,

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:17.220
he was an orangutan.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.527
The keepers who locked 
his enclosure every night

00:00:19.527 --> 00:00:21.628
were baffled to find him outside
the next day

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:23.317
hanging out with friends in a tree,

00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:25.047
or sunning on the roof.

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:27.288
Only after installing cameras 
did they realize

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:29.668
Fu Manchu had been picking the lock

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:33.797
with a metal wire that he kept hidden
under his cheek pouch.

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:37.409
The keepers shouldn't have been
surprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.798
Along with our other great ape cousins,

00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:40.529
the gorillas,

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:41.250
chimps,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.299
and bonobos,

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.928
they belong to our Hominidae
family tree,

00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:48.529
which stretches back 14 million years.

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:50.658
But it's not just their striking red hair

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:53.699
that makes orangutans unique 
among our cousins.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.850
As the only great apes from Asia,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.508
orangutans have adapted to a life
high in the rain forest canopies.

00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:03.820
Many of the skills they learn
are transmitted through the special bond

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.418
they have with their mothers,

00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:08.968
the most extended in the animal kingdom
next to humans.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.008
Orangutan mothers usually give birth
to one baby at a time,

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:15.071
waiting up to eight years before
having another.

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:16.349
This gives the young,

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:18.809
who begin as fully dependent infants,

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:20.999
plenty of time to learn how to climb

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:25.110
and distinguish the hundreds of plants
and fruits that make up their diet.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.830
Female orangutans even stay with
their mothers into their teen years

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.960
to learn child-rearing.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.899
As they grow up, orangutans also develop
a complex set of cooperative social skills

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.709
by interacting with their peers
and siblings.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:39.940
Much like ourselves,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.372
young orangutans involuntarily mimic
the facial expressions

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:45.539
and emotions of their playmates,

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.669
with behaviors that closely parallel
human smiling and laughter.

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:51.760
Once they finally venture out 
on their own,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.900
orangutans continue to develop
their resourcefulness,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.586
putting the skills they've learned 
into practice.

00:01:57.586 --> 00:02:01.513
Adults build a new nest each night
by carefully weaving twigs together,

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:05.350
topping them with soft leaves,
pillows, and blankets.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.621
This process requires dexterity,
coordination, and an eye for design.

00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:16.149
Orangutans also use a variety of tools
to make their lives in the jungle easier.

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.470
They turn branches into fly swatters
and back scratchers,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.860
construct umbrellas when it rains,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.933
make gloves from leafy pads,

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:27.721
and even use leaves as bandages
to dress their wounds.

00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:31.410
But orangutan intelligence goes far
beyond jungle survival.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.911
Research in controlled environments
has shown that orangutans are self-aware,

00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.736
being one of the few species to recognize
their own reflections.

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:43.720
They also display remarkable foresight,
planning, and cognition.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.872
In one experiment, researchers taught
an orangutan to use a straw

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:51.186
to extract his favorite fruit soup
from a box.

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:54.606
That orangutan was later given the choice
between the straw

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:57.442
or a grape that could be 
eaten right away,

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:02.163
and he chose the straw just in case
he was given another box of soup.

00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:05.713
In another experiment, orangutans figured
out how to reach peanuts

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:09.282
at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them.

00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:13.855
While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors,

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:16.993
there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve.

00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:20.062
Indonesia has the world's highest rate
of deforestation,

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:23.152
and millions of acres of rain forest 
are burned annually

00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:26.193
to support the logging 
and palm oil industries.

00:03:26.193 --> 00:03:30.193
Deforestation exposes the 30,000
orangutans remaining in the wild

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:31.520
to poachers.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.542
They kill mothers so that baby orangutans
can be sold as exotic pets.

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:40.063
But fortunately, the story often
doesn't end here.

00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:43.193
Orphans can be confiscated
and given a second chance.

00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:47.012
At special forest schools, they recover
from emotional trauma

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:50.262
and continue to develop 
essential life skills.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:54.054
Against all odds, these orphans 
demonstrate incredible resilience

00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:56.243
and readiness to learn.

00:03:56.243 --> 00:04:02.064
In Malay, the word orangutan translates
literally to "the person of the forest,"

00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:05.025
a reminder of our common lineage.

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:08.184
And despite orangutans being some
of the smartest animals on Earth,

00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:14.414
outsmarting their extinction requires
the creativity, empathy, and foresight

00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:16.664
that our species share.
