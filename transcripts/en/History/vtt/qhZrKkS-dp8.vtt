00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:02.752
- All right, gentlemen.

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:03.962
Each of your weapons
will now be tested.

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.130
And up first, the kill test.
Doug.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.095
The Spanish navaja, an iconic
folding weapon from history.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.931
It's even said to influence
the American Bowie knife.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.434
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.769
we'll take your Spanish
navaja then deal killing

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.147
blows on this deer carcass.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.648
Matthew, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:24.357
Oh, yeah.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.489
OK, Matthew.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.742
Nice and solid work right here.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.702
But I'm still recovering
from an injury.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.996
So please welcome
Anthony Palmer.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.915
Anthony is one of the chief
instructors of Marcaida Kali.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.585
Today he will have the
pleasure of wielding

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.170
your Spanish navaja.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.963
My biggest concern
going into testing

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.048
is the sharpness of my blade.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.385
[music playing]

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.106
Your blade is beautiful.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.025
And it's also solid in its feel.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.443
It lacerates easily.

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.404
You can see it chopped
right through the spine.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:15.784
Now, one of the pieces here
came flying out during the test.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.828
But in terms of the sharpness
and the wieldability

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:22.415
of your blade, it will kill.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.792
- Oh, yeah.
- OK, Wade.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:24.709
It's your turn.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:25.877
You ready?
- You bet.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.138
Wade, I can hear the
mechanism working in there.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:44.479
[music playing]

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:57.325
The thud of that deer
carcass hitting the floor

00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:00.620
is absolutely the
sound of $10,000.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.121
I feel like I'm ahead.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.331
That's where I want to be.

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.040
I want to win it.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.963
All right, Wade,
your blade is sharp.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.256
Thank you.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.507
The one issue is
it's kind of rickety

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.009
here, even while it
was being wielded.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.889
But despite being rickety,
it's deadly and it will kill.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.057
Thank you.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.392
DOUG: Next up is
the strength test.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.893
Ben.

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.436
To test the strength and
durability of your edge

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.146
as well as the
overall construction,

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.065
I'm going to smash
into this bamboo

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.441
with your Spanish navajas.

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:31.985
Matthew, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.361
Oh, yeah.

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.905
I'm looking at Wade
like he is one up on me.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.782
I have to outperform
him on the strength test

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.200
if I'm going to win
this competition.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.495
[music playing]

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:54.090
Well, Matthew, this thing's
one hell of a chopper.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.842
It held together beautifully.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.344
There was slight glinting that
happened up here near the tip,

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.680
but it's pretty darn sharp.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.848
Very well done.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.266
Thank you.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.183
Wade, you're up next.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.102
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.520
[laughing]

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.981
I'm ahead, he's ahead,
I'm ahead, he's ahead.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.774
We've been this
way the whole time.

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:12.692
It's a battle.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.152
I want to win it.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.488
[music playing]

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.335
[bleep]

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.216
(WHISPERING) No, it's broken.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:43.640
[bleep]

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.102
Wade, we have a problem.

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:49.771
On about the third
strike, things started

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.190
to get kind of loose
and that torquing

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.401
and the stress made
your scales pop off.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:58.196
The only thing holding the
cutting end to the handle end

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.073
are these thin brass sheets.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.867
And I don't have confidence
in their strength.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.078
This blade has lost its
structural integrity.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.496
It's no longer safe to test.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:12.752
Wade, due to the catastrophic
failure of the structural

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.837
integrity of your
weapon, we cannot

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:16.631
continue testing that blade.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:21.344
So I have to ask you to
please leave the forge.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.138
I thought I could beat down a
door with that thing, but, you

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:25.723
know, apparently you can't.

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:28.226
I should have put more
weight in the liner just

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:31.771
to make the whole handle
section much more strong.
