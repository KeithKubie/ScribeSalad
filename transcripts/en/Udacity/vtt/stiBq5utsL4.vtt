00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is when you're planning an initial product, the most important is finding

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
sufficient features to solve the problem for a known group of customers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Matching competitive features is what we used to do and actually is a going out of business strategy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And unless you're in an existing market and you happen to know

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which features the customers have told you are more important.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Having sufficient features to meet all of customer needs, startups just don't have the resources to do

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
every possible wish that a customer has at least on day 1, and so really what you want to do

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is focus on enough features to solve a problem important enough for a known group of customers.
