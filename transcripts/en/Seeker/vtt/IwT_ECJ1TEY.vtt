00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.860
You’ve probably heard of ferromagnetism,
materials that become magnetic in a magnetic

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.130
field, but have you heard of ferroelectricity?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.950
And what do hysterons have to do with it?

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.140
Wait what are hysterons anyway?

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.300
Ok I’m getting ahead of myself, let’s
go back to ferroelectricity.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.349
Ferroelectricity isn’t related to iron like
you might think, but it gets its name because

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.939
it’s analogous to ferromagnetism.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.349
Ferromagnetic materials like iron are made
up of magnetic domains that have north and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.579
south poles.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.260
If these domains line up, the material itself
becomes magnetic.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.850
Likewise ferroelectric materials are made
of crystals that are electric dipoles, meaning

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.030
they have a separated positive and negative
charge.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.140
If these dipoles line up, the material itself
will have a positive and negative pole.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.180
Usually the dipoles are pointing in random
directions, but they can be coerced into uniformity.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.230
The same way iron’s domains can line up
when exposed to a strong enough external magnetic

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.530
field, a ferroelectric’s dipoles will line
up when exposed to a strong enough electric

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.530
field.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.970
They’ll stay that way when the field is
removed, as though they have a memory, and

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.440
because of that memory when another electric
field is applied that can change the dipole’s

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.780
directions they’ll lag behind orienting
to the new field, a phenomenon called hysteresis.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.750
In a ferroelectric material the switch doesn’t
happen all together like it ideally should,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.220
different parts of it change direction at
different times.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.880
Figuring out exactly why took more than 80
years of searching.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.140
In 1935 a german researcher mathematically
described ferroic materials as small independent

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.060
parts called hysterons.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.420
Each hysteron would change it’s polarization
at a well defined speed when exposed to a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.700
strong enough field, but each hysteron could
also have a different critical field than

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.920
its neighbors.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.590
Meaning a magnetic or electric field that
was strong enough to change one hysteron would

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.090
have no effect on the hysteron next to it.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.740
The model works and accurately describes the
behavior of ferroelectrics, but nobody was

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.310
sure what hysterons actually were and the
physics of why they behaved that way.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.910
That was until 2018, when researchers studied
two organic ferroelectric materials and observed

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.280
stacks of disc-shaped molecules a few nanometers
high.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.060
The stacks’ different sizes and tight packing
meant they all strongly interacted with each

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.750
other, causing them to react differently to
the different field strengths.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.590
Finally, we witnessed hysterons and confirmed
why ferroelectrics line up their dipoles at

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.870
the speed they do.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.690
That wasn’t the only breakthrough in our
understanding of ferroelectrics in 2018.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.960
I know, you just learned about them and they’re
already advancing at a breakneck pace.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.710
See, ferroelectrics can be permanently polarized,
meaning their dipoles stay aligned even after

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.190
the field is removed, until another critical
field aligns them in another direction.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.690
That property means they have a potential
use in computer storage.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.020
Many computers today still use a magnetic
hard drive to store data, but creating a magnetic

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.680
field requires a large current.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.880
Ferroelectrics could use less power to store
data, but until recently they had a scaling

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880
problem.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.170
The crystals could only get so small until
the aligned dipoles became unstable.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.320
Roughly eight years ago though, researchers
in germany claimed they made a ferroelectric

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.720
material that did the opposite: it kept it’s
dipoles aligned when thinner than 10 nanometers,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.430
but when it got thicker it lost its ferroelectric
properties.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.220
A group of skeptical scientists tried to simplify
the material and recreate the results, and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.430
much to their surprise they did.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.160
In fact their results were even better than
before.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.740
It turns out at that small scale, the crystals
were under immense pressure that caused a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.069
different arrangement of their structures
and a polar phase.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.500
As an added bonus the substrate used to grow
the crystals was also magnetic, opening up

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.690
the possibility of magnetic and ferroelectric
storage on the same drive, allowing for more

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.910
data can be stored in the same space.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.010
Don’t expect ferroelectric computer storage
to hit shelves tomorrow, there’s a lot more

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.970
hurdles the technology would have to clear.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.959
But If one day in the future, you’re shopping
for a new computer and you start seeing the

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.390
flashy marketing term “Ferroelectric hard
drive,” just remember you heard it here

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.390
first.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.739
Computer storage is one area where a lot of
different fields of study have a lot of promise,

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.319
like the potential to store data on a single
atom.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.520
Check out my video on that here.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.011
Those tiny lab grown crystals had pressures
up to 5 gigapascals inside the crystal, or

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.520
over 49,000 times the atmospheric pressure
at sea level.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.340

no pressure, and I’ll see you for more Seeker.
