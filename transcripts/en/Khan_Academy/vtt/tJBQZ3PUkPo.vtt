00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.361
The function f is defined as follows:

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:08.718
f of t is equal to negative
two t plus five.

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:11.507
So whatever we input into this function,

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:16.558
we multiply it times negative two,
and then we add five.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:21.453
So what is the input value
for which f of t is equal to 13?

00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:25.550
So if f of t is equal to 13, that
means that this thing over here

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.258
is equal to 13 for some t, for some input.

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:34.860
So we can just solve the equation,
negative two t plus five is equal to 13.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.181
So let's do that.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:41.100
Negative two t plus five is equal to 13.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.312
Well, we can subtract
five from both sides.

00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:46.741
I'm just trying to isolate the t
on the left hand-side.

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.186
So, subtract negative five from the left,

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:51.881
that's the whole reason why we
did that, so those disappear.

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:53.759
But we have to do it 
from the right as well.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.237
So you have 13 minus five is eight.

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:59.210
And on the left hand-side
you still have your negative two t.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.232
So you have negative two t
is equal to eight.

00:01:02.232 --> 00:01:03.990
Now to just have a t on 
the left hand-side,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.480
I want to divide both sides
by negative two.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.317
And I'm left with, t is equal to 
eight divided by negative two,

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:13.200
is equal to negative four.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.263
So you input negative four
into this function

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:23.034
and it will output 13.

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:28.377
Or we could write that f of 
negative four is equal to 13.

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:30.293
But this, is what they are looking for.

00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:31.373
This is the input value.

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:34.850
Negative four is the input value
for which f of t is equal to 13.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.354
f of negative four is equal to 13.
