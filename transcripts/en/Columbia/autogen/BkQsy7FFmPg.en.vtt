00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520
that the campaign is a testament to the
 

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.740
that the campaign is a testament to the
difference the global health community

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:43.750
difference the global health community
 

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.680
difference the global health community
can make when it truly comes together

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:46.690
can make when it truly comes together
 

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.579
can make when it truly comes together
for a common purpose and it truly did

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:50.589
for a common purpose and it truly did
 

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:53.519
for a common purpose and it truly did
and in fact through some of the darkest

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:53.529
and in fact through some of the darkest
 

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:55.439
and in fact through some of the darkest
days of the Cold War we were working

00:08:55.439 --> 00:08:55.449
days of the Cold War we were working
 

00:08:55.449 --> 00:08:57.830
days of the Cold War we were working
very closely with the Russians

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:57.840
very closely with the Russians
 

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.280
very closely with the Russians
were very helpful in many many ways but

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:04.290
were very helpful in many many ways but
 

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.090
were very helpful in many many ways but
to put this into context of history this

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100
to put this into context of history this
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.040
to put this into context of history this
is a disease which we know goes back as

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.050
is a disease which we know goes back as
 

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.670
is a disease which we know goes back as
far as the Pharaohs 3,500 years ago

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680
far as the Pharaohs 3,500 years ago
 

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.770
far as the Pharaohs 3,500 years ago
because there are mummies for to be

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:15.780
because there are mummies for to be
 

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.740
because there are mummies for to be
exact which have lesions you can see

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:18.750
exact which have lesions you can see
 

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.820
exact which have lesions you can see
them pretty evident on the on the under

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:22.830
them pretty evident on the on the under
 

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.830
them pretty evident on the on the under
the neck and they clearly died of

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:27.840
the neck and they clearly died of
 

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.360
the neck and they clearly died of
smallpox and so we have indication if

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.370
smallpox and so we have indication if
 

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.830
smallpox and so we have indication if
they go back at least 3,500 years and

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:35.840
they go back at least 3,500 years and
 

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.420
they go back at least 3,500 years and
throughout history it has been a

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:38.430
throughout history it has been a
 

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.030
throughout history it has been a
pestilence well beyond anything that you

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040
pestilence well beyond anything that you
 

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.890
pestilence well beyond anything that you
can imagine it's certainly far worse

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:42.900
can imagine it's certainly far worse
 

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.420
can imagine it's certainly far worse
than plague or any of the other diseases

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.430
than plague or any of the other diseases
 

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.700
than plague or any of the other diseases
that you could mention it has been a

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:49.710
that you could mention it has been a
 

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.890
that you could mention it has been a
killer it is the only disease which is

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:54.900
killer it is the only disease which is
 

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.610
killer it is the only disease which is
represented by specific deities and this

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620
represented by specific deities and this
 

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.470
represented by specific deities and this
is true and there are deities in Japan

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480
is true and there are deities in Japan
 

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.700
is true and there are deities in Japan
from China literature and Japan in China

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:04.710
from China literature and Japan in China
 

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.020
from China literature and Japan in China
in India in West Africa it's the only

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.030
in India in West Africa it's the only
 

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.840
in India in West Africa it's the only
disease for which there are specific

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:11.850
disease for which there are specific
 

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.420
disease for which there are specific
deities and in India extensive numbers

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.430
deities and in India extensive numbers
 

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.680
deities and in India extensive numbers
of Sita Mata temples and I think this is

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:18.690
of Sita Mata temples and I think this is
 

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.900
of Sita Mata temples and I think this is
an indication that the peoples

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:20.910
an indication that the peoples
 

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.820
an indication that the peoples
throughout the ages have regarded this

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:22.830
throughout the ages have regarded this
 

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.790
throughout the ages have regarded this
as one of the great problems as no other

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800
as one of the great problems as no other
 

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.080
as one of the great problems as no other
disease but even until unfairly recently

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.090
disease but even until unfairly recently
 

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.990
disease but even until unfairly recently
it was more of a problem and we might

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000
it was more of a problem and we might
 

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.450
it was more of a problem and we might
imagine

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:34.460
imagine
 

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.070
imagine
first of all we'll go back and in the

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080
first of all we'll go back and in the
 

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.550
first of all we'll go back and in the
20th century we a conservatively

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560
20th century we a conservatively
 

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.710
20th century we a conservatively
estimate there were 300 million deaths

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720
estimate there were 300 million deaths
 

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.490
estimate there were 300 million deaths
due to smallpox and the New York Times

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.500
due to smallpox and the New York Times
 

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.370
due to smallpox and the New York Times
came up with a metric in comparison

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380
came up with a metric in comparison
 

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.540
came up with a metric in comparison
saying do you know that there were 120

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:53.550
saying do you know that there were 120
 

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.510
saying do you know that there were 120
million people died either directly or

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:56.520
million people died either directly or
 

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.510
million people died either directly or
indirectly as the k-t cause of armed

words 120 million due to armed conflict
 

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.500
words 120 million due to armed conflict
300 million to smallpox so this is a

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:09.510
300 million to smallpox so this is a
 

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.030
300 million to smallpox so this is a
disease of great mad

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040
disease of great mad
 

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.569
disease of great mad
- when we began in 1967 with the global

00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579
- when we began in 1967 with the global
 

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:21.470
- when we began in 1967 with the global
eradication program the closest we can

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480
eradication program the closest we can
 

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.749
eradication program the closest we can
come is that of about ten million cases

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:23.759
come is that of about ten million cases
 

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:27.710
come is that of about ten million cases
and two million deaths that year that

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720
and two million deaths that year that
 

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.420
and two million deaths that year that
year was reported from 43 countries and

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:31.430
year was reported from 43 countries and
 

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.189
year was reported from 43 countries and
many people don't realize that we

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:34.199
many people don't realize that we
 

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:36.980
many people don't realize that we
required vaccination in this country of

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:36.990
required vaccination in this country of
 

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.090
required vaccination in this country of
all school children up until 1972 and

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100
all school children up until 1972 and
 

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.050
all school children up until 1972 and
that was 23 years after the last case in

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060
that was 23 years after the last case in
 

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.720
that was 23 years after the last case in
this country so great was the fear of

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:47.730
this country so great was the fear of
 

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.030
this country so great was the fear of
smallpox coming in being introduced and

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040
smallpox coming in being introduced and
 

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.100
smallpox coming in being introduced and
spread that we were continuing

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.110
spread that we were continuing
 

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.400
spread that we were continuing
vaccination as were other countries

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:54.410
vaccination as were other countries
 

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.139
vaccination as were other countries
continuing vaccination for a disease

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:57.149
continuing vaccination for a disease
 

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:59.540
continuing vaccination for a disease
they did not have simply because of the

00:11:59.540 --> 00:11:59.550
they did not have simply because of the
 

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.199
they did not have simply because of the
fear of smallpox so let me say a word

00:12:03.199 --> 00:12:03.209
fear of smallpox so let me say a word
 

00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:06.559
fear of smallpox so let me say a word
about the disease itself it's a virus it

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:06.569
about the disease itself it's a virus it
 

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:11.150
about the disease itself it's a virus it
spreads from only during the rash man is

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160
spreads from only during the rash man is
 

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.490
spreads from only during the rash man is
the only host so there are no animal

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500
the only host so there are no animal
 

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.069
the only host so there are no animal
vectors on this no animal infections in

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079
vectors on this no animal infections in
 

00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:18.490
vectors on this no animal infections in
fact this has been a problem in research

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:18.500
fact this has been a problem in research
 

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.139
fact this has been a problem in research
because we have no experimental animal

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:21.149
because we have no experimental animal
 

00:12:21.149 --> 00:12:26.420
because we have no experimental animal
that we can infect with smallpox and as

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:26.430
that we can infect with smallpox and as
 

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.970
that we can infect with smallpox and as
you think about it this means that one

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980
you think about it this means that one
 

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.860
you think about it this means that one
individual has to infect another

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:30.870
individual has to infect another
 

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.900
individual has to infect another
individual has to keep another

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:32.910
individual has to keep another
 

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.389
individual has to keep another
individual what's going to keep going so

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399
individual what's going to keep going so
 

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:38.360
individual what's going to keep going so
we we we pictured and talked about it as

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.370
we we we pictured and talked about it as
 

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.509
we we we pictured and talked about it as
a chain of infection that had to keep

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519
a chain of infection that had to keep
 

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:43.340
a chain of infection that had to keep
going constantly and if you could break

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:43.350
going constantly and if you could break
 

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.210
going constantly and if you could break
the chain

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220
the chain
 

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:49.160
the chain
you obviously prevented many cases so

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.170
you obviously prevented many cases so
 

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.030
you obviously prevented many cases so
the death rate for smallpox runs about

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040
the death rate for smallpox runs about
 

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:59.509
the death rate for smallpox runs about
30% the cases there are no sub clinical

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519
30% the cases there are no sub clinical
 

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.730
30% the cases there are no sub clinical
cases that is to say if somebody

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740
cases that is to say if somebody
 

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.850
cases that is to say if somebody
infected with a virus we have a rash and

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860
infected with a virus we have a rash and
 

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.829
infected with a virus we have a rash and
so it's very different from many other

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839
so it's very different from many other
 

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:09.110
so it's very different from many other
diseases where there are some clinical

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120
diseases where there are some clinical
 

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.079
diseases where there are some clinical
cases but for those who survive there

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:12.089
cases but for those who survive there
 

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:15.309
cases but for those who survive there
permanently immune for life so that one

00:13:15.309 --> 00:13:15.319
permanently immune for life so that one
 

00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:18.980
permanently immune for life so that one
attack is all that anybody

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:18.990
attack is all that anybody
 

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.370
attack is all that anybody
so with this disease we had something

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:23.380
so with this disease we had something
 

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.040
so with this disease we had something
which was really quite unique and very

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.050
which was really quite unique and very
 

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.509
which was really quite unique and very
essential and that is we had a vaccine

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519

convulsions with this and then this

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680
convulsions with this and then this
 

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.800
convulsions with this and then this
would be the third day of this rash

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:13.810
would be the third day of this rash
 

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.690
would be the third day of this rash
which is now developing we'll go on and

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:18.700
which is now developing we'll go on and
 

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.540
which is now developing we'll go on and
we'll see the rash the vesicles are

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:21.550
we'll see the rash the vesicles are
 

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:26.250
we'll see the rash the vesicles are
becoming pustular pustular a rash and we

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:26.260
becoming pustular pustular a rash and we
 

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.290
becoming pustular pustular a rash and we
feel at this time it would take an

feel at this time it would take an
 

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.990
feel at this time it would take an
individual about the fifth day that if

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000

you saw it in the emergency room you
wouldn't see you saw this child you

wouldn't see you saw this child you
 

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.550
wouldn't see you saw this child you
would say it could be any of a number of

different diseases but if you saw this

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:41.410
different diseases but if you saw this
 

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.010

began that and again it was Rockefeller

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:30.810
began that and again it was Rockefeller

began that and again it was Rockefeller
sponsoring this and they did quite well

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.290
sponsoring this and they did quite well
 

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.530
sponsoring this and they did quite well
and up until 1932 and then they

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:37.540
and up until 1932 and then they
 

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.090
and up until 1932 and then they
discovered and with the most of Latin

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.100
discovered and with the most of Latin
 

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.670
discovered and with the most of Latin
America Latin America was free of yellow

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:41.680
America Latin America was free of yellow
 

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.370
America Latin America was free of yellow
fever then they discovered that there

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:44.380
fever then they discovered that there
 

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.410
fever then they discovered that there
were cases occurring and that there was

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:46.420
were cases occurring and that there was
 

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.910
were cases occurring and that there was
a jungle yellow fever

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:47.920
a jungle yellow fever
 

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.850
a jungle yellow fever
carried by monkeys and that it could

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:50.860
carried by monkeys and that it could
 

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.120
carried by monkeys and that it could
come back to man and so that was the end

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.130
come back to man and so that was the end
 

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.890
come back to man and so that was the end
of that one malaria followed in 1955 DDT

00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:58.900
of that one malaria followed in 1955 DDT
 

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.510
of that one malaria followed in 1955 DDT
had been discovered during the War of

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520
had been discovered during the War of
 

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.880
had been discovered during the War of
the tremendously effective insecticide

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:02.890
the tremendously effective insecticide
 

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.030
the tremendously effective insecticide
and the idea was to spray the walls of a

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.040
and the idea was to spray the walls of a
 

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.700
and the idea was to spray the walls of a
house mosquito bites the individual

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:08.710
house mosquito bites the individual
 

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.980
house mosquito bites the individual
becomes infected flies to the wall to

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:10.990
becomes infected flies to the wall to
 

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:16.170
becomes infected flies to the wall to
rest and is killed by the DDT so he the

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.180
rest and is killed by the DDT so he the
 

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.990
rest and is killed by the DDT so he the
mosquito does not spread it and this was

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000
mosquito does not spread it and this was
 

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.650
mosquito does not spread it and this was
very

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:19.660
very
 

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.080
very
in a number of areas but it soon became

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.090
in a number of areas but it soon became
 

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.380
in a number of areas but it soon became
apparent one that the the insecticide

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:25.390
apparent one that the the insecticide
 

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.970
apparent one that the the insecticide
where they're becoming resistant and

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:26.980
where they're becoming resistant and
 

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.520
where they're becoming resistant and
mosquitoes becoming resistant and the

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:29.530
mosquitoes becoming resistant and the
 

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.529
mosquitoes becoming resistant and the
parasite was becoming resistant to some

00:19:31.529 --> 00:19:31.539
parasite was becoming resistant to some
 

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:33.779
parasite was becoming resistant to some
of the drugs and it was a lot more

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:33.789
of the drugs and it was a lot more
 

00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:35.940
of the drugs and it was a lot more
expensive than they'd ever imagined and

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:35.950
expensive than they'd ever imagined and
 

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.330
expensive than they'd ever imagined and
so after two billion dollars was

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:39.340
so after two billion dollars was
 

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.880
so after two billion dollars was
expended and when you say 2 billion

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:41.890
expended and when you say 2 billion
 

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.310
expended and when you say 2 billion
that's when 2 billion dollars was really

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320
that's when 2 billion dollars was really
 

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.360
that's when 2 billion dollars was really
serious money and at that point it began

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:48.370
serious money and at that point it began
 

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.940
serious money and at that point it began
to fade and 1973 it finally came to a

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:52.950
to fade and 1973 it finally came to a
 

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.350
to fade and 1973 it finally came to a
halt

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360
halt
 

00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.140
halt
well 1967 the smallpox got got under way

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.150
well 1967 the smallpox got got under way
 

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.090
well 1967 the smallpox got got under way
and that was a decision of the World

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.100
and that was a decision of the World
 

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.210
and that was a decision of the World
Health Assembly to begin this program

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:06.220
Health Assembly to begin this program
 

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.000
Health Assembly to begin this program
and you can see it it was at the time

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.010
and you can see it it was at the time
 

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.419
and you can see it it was at the time
malaria eradication was failing and so

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:12.429
malaria eradication was failing and so
 

00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:15.210
malaria eradication was failing and so
there was not there's a lot of concern

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:15.220
there was not there's a lot of concern
 

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.370
there was not there's a lot of concern
about going ahead with smallpox

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:17.380
about going ahead with smallpox
 

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.649
about going ahead with smallpox
eradication now sake and say a little

00:20:19.649 --> 00:20:19.659
eradication now sake and say a little
 

00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:22.950
eradication now sake and say a little
more about it more than later guinea

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960
more about it more than later guinea
 

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.549
more about it more than later guinea

worm and it's tropical Africa now only
but they began an eradication program in

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.500
but they began an eradication program in
 

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.020
but they began an eradication program in
66 or 86 and it's now 24 years it was

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:46.030
66 or 86 and it's now 24 years it was
 

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.270
66 or 86 and it's now 24 years it was
supposed to be over hopefully in 14

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280
supposed to be over hopefully in 14
 

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.020
supposed to be over hopefully in 14
years and it's still going and

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:51.030
years and it's still going and
 

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.190
years and it's still going and
unfortunately most of this is in

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200
unfortunately most of this is in
 

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.710
unfortunately most of this is in
southern Sudan where all the fighting is

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720
southern Sudan where all the fighting is
 

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.770
southern Sudan where all the fighting is
now beginning and breaking out and it's

00:20:58.770 --> 00:20:58.780
now beginning and breaking out and it's
 

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.980
now beginning and breaking out and it's
been a real problem and then polio which

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:01.990
been a real problem and then polio which
 

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.970
been a real problem and then polio which
now is in its 23rd year and where

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:05.980
now is in its 23rd year and where
 

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.700
now is in its 23rd year and where
there's still polio in for endemic

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:08.710
there's still polio in for endemic
 

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.000
there's still polio in for endemic
countries and about three others are

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.010
countries and about three others are
 

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.560
countries and about three others are
seriously reinfected about 1 billion

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:16.570
seriously reinfected about 1 billion
 

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.230
seriously reinfected about 1 billion
dollars per year is now being expended

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240
dollars per year is now being expended
 

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.370
dollars per year is now being expended
just on polio eradication and there is

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:23.380
just on polio eradication and there is
 

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.370
just on polio eradication and there is
hope now that Gates Foundation's got

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:26.380
hope now that Gates Foundation's got
 

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.460
hope now that Gates Foundation's got
very much involved and hoped that the

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:29.470
very much involved and hoped that the
 

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.030
very much involved and hoped that the
end of 2012 that the last case is

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:33.040
end of 2012 that the last case is
 

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.400
end of 2012 that the last case is
will occur but there have been

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.410
will occur but there have been
 

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.530
will occur but there have been
disappointments again and again and

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:37.540
disappointments again and again and
 

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.300
disappointments again and again and
again so I won't go into that but it's

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:41.310
again so I won't go into that but it's
 

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.060
again so I won't go into that but it's
polio is still with us so those are the

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.070
polio is still with us so those are the
 

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:50.580
polio is still with us so those are the
seven eradication programs the way

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:50.590
seven eradication programs the way
 

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.480
seven eradication programs the way
smallpox came about was in 1959 the

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:54.490
smallpox came about was in 1959 the
 

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.600
smallpox came about was in 1959 the
Soviet Union had come back to the United

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:57.610
Soviet Union had come back to the United
 

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.400
Soviet Union had come back to the United
Nations they'd withdrawn all

00:21:59.400 --> 00:21:59.410
Nations they'd withdrawn all
 

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.740
Nations they'd withdrawn all
representation in the UN because of the

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:01.750
representation in the UN because of the
 

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.710
representation in the UN because of the
Korean War that was going on over with

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720
Korean War that was going on over with
 

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.810
Korean War that was going on over with
are we right in the Korean War yes and

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820
are we right in the Korean War yes and
 

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.000
are we right in the Korean War yes and
so they'd withdrawn and for nearly a

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.010
so they'd withdrawn and for nearly a
 

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.770
so they'd withdrawn and for nearly a
decade they were out thank you this as

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:13.780
decade they were out thank you this as
 

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.820
decade they were out thank you this as
they just came back and the delegates

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:17.830
they just came back and the delegates
 

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.340
they just came back and the delegates
wanted to be supportive and say fine

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:20.350
wanted to be supportive and say fine
 

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.700
wanted to be supportive and say fine
let's all get together and we agree and

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:23.710
let's all get together and we agree and
 

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.330
let's all get together and we agree and
so began a program in 1959 which was not

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:27.340
so began a program in 1959 which was not
 

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.880
so began a program in 1959 which was not
done very seriously and there was a

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:29.890
done very seriously and there was a
 

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.510
done very seriously and there was a
budget of $100,000 per year and they had

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520
budget of $100,000 per year and they had
 

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.430
budget of $100,000 per year and they had
a staff of five people and you can

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440
a staff of five people and you can
 

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.980
a staff of five people and you can
imagine not a lot was getting

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:37.990
imagine not a lot was getting
 

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.700
imagine not a lot was getting
accomplished and there were only five

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:41.710
accomplished and there were only five
 

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:47.100
accomplished and there were only five
staff members at that time so the Soviet

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:47.110
staff members at that time so the Soviet
 

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.000
staff members at that time so the Soviet
Union was really very unhappy about this

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.010
Union was really very unhappy about this
 

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.530
Union was really very unhappy about this
the US was supporting malaria

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:52.540
the US was supporting malaria
 

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.540
the US was supporting malaria
eradication putting a lot of money into

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:54.550
eradication putting a lot of money into
 

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.600
eradication putting a lot of money into

at this point the Director General was

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:34.900
at this point the Director General was
 

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.740
at this point the Director General was
very frustrated w-h-o did not have a lot

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:37.750
very frustrated w-h-o did not have a lot
 

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.800
very frustrated w-h-o did not have a lot
of money and he decided that they would

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:40.810
of money and he decided that they would
 

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.470
of money and he decided that they would
put together he a program a plan

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480
put together he a program a plan
 

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.400

10 year plan and this director general

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:49.410
10 year plan and this director general
 

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.600
10 year plan and this director general
plan to support a to introduce it to the

plan to support a to introduce it to the
 

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.170
plan to support a to introduce it to the
assembly and then see what they would do

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:57.180
assembly and then see what they would do
 

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.690
assembly and then see what they would do
and he was confident that they would

00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700
and he was confident that they would
 

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.540
and he was confident that they would
vote it down because it cost a lot more

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:02.550
vote it down because it cost a lot more
 

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:07.960
vote it down because it cost a lot more
money and a plan the strategy was unique

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:07.970
money and a plan the strategy was unique
 

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.160
money and a plan the strategy was unique
at that time there were a number of

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.170
at that time there were a number of
 

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.820
at that time there were a number of
small pox programs going on were people

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:13.830
small pox programs going on were people
 

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.240
small pox programs going on were people
trying to vaccinate quite a few because

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:17.250
trying to vaccinate quite a few because
 

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.150
trying to vaccinate quite a few because
it was such a problem disease that most

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:20.160
it was such a problem disease that most
 

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.950
it was such a problem disease that most
countries had to have some sort of a

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960
countries had to have some sort of a
 

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.470
countries had to have some sort of a
program and the goals that were set was

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480
program and the goals that were set was
 

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.800
program and the goals that were set was
to vaccinate 80% of the population and

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:30.810
to vaccinate 80% of the population and
 

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.650
to vaccinate 80% of the population and
the key thing that was unique was the

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:33.660
the key thing that was unique was the
 

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.290
the key thing that was unique was the
second component of it was to say we

of the program we want to report from

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460
of the program we want to report from
 

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.030
of the program we want to report from
every health center as whether they got

every health center as whether they got
 

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.700
every health center as whether they got
smallpox or they don't and made

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:46.710
smallpox or they don't and made
 

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.750
smallpox or they don't and made
provision and for teams to go out and

provision and for teams to go out and
 

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.600
provision and for teams to go out and
try to stop the outbreaks while they

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:53.610
try to stop the outbreaks while they
 

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.550
try to stop the outbreaks while they
went ahead with a routine vaccination

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:55.560
went ahead with a routine vaccination
 

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.520

and this was important because the
 

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.330
and this was important because the
question was where is smallpox where are

of 2.4 million dollars a year well that
 

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.379

sounds like not very much and in fact it

sounds like not very much and in fact it

really wasn't all that very much I tell

you the truth but their whole budget was

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:21.260
you the truth but their whole budget was
 

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.590
you the truth but their whole budget was
only about 55 million dollars at that

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600
only about 55 million dollars at that
 

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.310
only about 55 million dollars at that
time so 2.4 million on top of us was

time so 2.4 million on top of us was
 

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.789
time so 2.4 million on top of us was
going to be quite an expenditure the

going to be quite an expenditure the
 

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:32.440
going to be quite an expenditure the

fortunately the problems appeared and

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:06.630
fortunately the problems appeared and
 

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.840
fortunately the problems appeared and
kind of one by one and we'd solve a

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:08.850
kind of one by one and we'd solve a
 

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.580
kind of one by one and we'd solve a
problem and then another big one who

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:10.590
problem and then another big one who

and we're having smallpox introduced now

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460
and we're having smallpox introduced now
 

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.300
and we're having smallpox introduced now
in Latin American you see that's Brazil

importation now what had happened was
 

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.970
importation now what had happened was
that there was a vaccine a method to

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980
that there was a vaccine a method to
 

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.250
that there was a vaccine a method to
produce the smallpox vaccine called

which had been developed in the UK in

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140
which had been developed in the UK in
 

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:08.870
which had been developed in the UK in
the late 1950s and they introduced it

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:08.880
the late 1950s and they introduced it
 

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.250
the late 1950s and they introduced it
for a couple of countries and the in the

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260
for a couple of countries and the in the
 

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.270
for a couple of countries and the in the
Americas they had several laboratories

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280
Americas they had several laboratories
 

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.390
Americas they had several laboratories
using this freeze-dried vaccine well it

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:20.400
using this freeze-dried vaccine well it
 

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.350
using this freeze-dried vaccine well it
made a difference because this vaccine

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:23.360
made a difference because this vaccine
 

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.690
made a difference because this vaccine
could be kept at 98 degrees Fahrenheit

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700
could be kept at 98 degrees Fahrenheit
 

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.590
could be kept at 98 degrees Fahrenheit
37 degrees centigrade for a month and it

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:30.600
37 degrees centigrade for a month and it
 

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.659
37 degrees centigrade for a month and it
was potent at the end of that time so

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:32.669
was potent at the end of that time so
 

00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:36.050
was potent at the end of that time so
little problems that vaccinators going

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.060
little problems that vaccinators going
 

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.530
little problems that vaccinators going
into the field whereas the old vaccine a

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540
into the field whereas the old vaccine a
 

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.240
into the field whereas the old vaccine a
lick

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:40.250
lick
 

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.639
lick
preparation it was 2 to 3 days is all

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:42.649
preparation it was 2 to 3 days is all
 

00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:45.149
preparation it was 2 to 3 days is all
you had and then the vaccine was no good

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:45.159
you had and then the vaccine was no good
 

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.470
you had and then the vaccine was no good
well that had been introduced to bid

00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480
well that had been introduced to bid
 

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.619
well that had been introduced to bid
into Latin America and that was being

00:34:50.619 --> 00:34:50.629
into Latin America and that was being
 

00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:52.750
into Latin America and that was being
more effective than anybody believed or

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760
more effective than anybody believed or
 

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.190
more effective than anybody believed or
realized at the time because the

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200
realized at the time because the
 

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.930
realized at the time because the
reporting was so bad we really didn't

00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:55.940
reporting was so bad we really didn't
 

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.150
reporting was so bad we really didn't
have a very good idea till the second or

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160
have a very good idea till the second or
 

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.910
have a very good idea till the second or
third year really what was going on

00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920
third year really what was going on
 

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.860
third year really what was going on
Africa south of this era actually all of

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:02.870
Africa south of this era actually all of
 

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.990
Africa south of this era actually all of
those countries were really infected we

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000
those countries were really infected we
 

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.360
those countries were really infected we
just didn't know it at the time and then

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:07.370
just didn't know it at the time and then
 

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.980
just didn't know it at the time and then
you have the India Pakistan Bangladesh

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:08.990
you have the India Pakistan Bangladesh
 

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.650
you have the India Pakistan Bangladesh
group and then the islands off to the

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:11.660
group and then the islands off to the
 

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.780
group and then the islands off to the
right which are Indonesia the real

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:16.790
right which are Indonesia the real
 

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.850
right which are Indonesia the real
problem was how do we get enough of this

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:18.860
problem was how do we get enough of this
 

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.810
problem was how do we get enough of this
vaccine and so we decided to do

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:22.820
vaccine and so we decided to do
 

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.540
vaccine and so we decided to do
something which we were told we couldn't

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:25.550
something which we were told we couldn't
 

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.410
something which we were told we couldn't
do we had to have some quality control

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:28.420
do we had to have some quality control
 

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.910
do we had to have some quality control
now each of these countries making their

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920
now each of these countries making their
 

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.380
now each of these countries making their
own vaccine I think we had something

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:32.390
own vaccine I think we had something
 

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.990
own vaccine I think we had something
like 74 different laboratories making

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000
like 74 different laboratories making
 

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.510
like 74 different laboratories making
vaccine you can imagine what some of

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520
vaccine you can imagine what some of
 

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.880
vaccine you can imagine what some of
this was so we decided our own that we

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:42.890
this was so we decided our own that we
 

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.790
this was so we decided our own that we
would just not offer w-h-o assistance to

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800
would just not offer w-h-o assistance to
 

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.910
would just not offer w-h-o assistance to
any Leopard in any country that was not

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920
any Leopard in any country that was not
 

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.320
any Leopard in any country that was not
had a vaccine that would not meet

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:50.330
had a vaccine that would not meet
 

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:54.160
had a vaccine that would not meet
international standards so we we weren't

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:54.170
international standards so we we weren't
 

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.680
international standards so we we weren't
saying what your standards what your

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:56.690
saying what your standards what your
 

00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:00.220
saying what your standards what your
vaccine should be or had to be but we

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:00.230
vaccine should be or had to be but we
 

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.430
vaccine should be or had to be but we
weren't going to get provides support if

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440
weren't going to get provides support if
 

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.500
weren't going to get provides support if
you didn't have good vaccine and it was

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:05.510
you didn't have good vaccine and it was
 

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.260
you didn't have good vaccine and it was
amazingly effective even though this was

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:08.270
amazingly effective even though this was
 

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.320
amazingly effective even though this was
something that we were told we whu-oh

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:11.330
something that we were told we whu-oh
 

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.680

that was for sure well we weren't but we

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:18.140
that was for sure well we weren't but we
 

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.990
that was for sure well we weren't but we
were just making sure we had good

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000
were just making sure we had good
 

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.960
were just making sure we had good
vaccine in the field so we managed to

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.970
vaccine in the field so we managed to
 

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.900
vaccine in the field so we managed to
two countries Canada and Netherlands

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:28.910
two countries Canada and Netherlands
 

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.020
two countries Canada and Netherlands
offered to test the vaccines that were

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:32.030
offered to test the vaccines that were
 

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.760
offered to test the vaccines that were
there and so we got the vaccines were

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:33.770
there and so we got the vaccines were
 

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.240
there and so we got the vaccines were
being set in and we found that less than

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:37.250
being set in and we found that less than
 

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.400
being set in and we found that less than
10 percent of the vaccines met any

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:39.410
10 percent of the vaccines met any
 

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:42.070
10 percent of the vaccines met any
international standards so most of these

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.080
international standards so most of these
 

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.690
international standards so most of these
people were vaccinating some of them

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:43.700
people were vaccinating some of them
 

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.310
people were vaccinating some of them
weren't vaccinating with no more than

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:45.320
weren't vaccinating with no more than
 

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.100
weren't vaccinating with no more than
water but they were still putting it

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.110
water but they were still putting it
 

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.370
water but they were still putting it
into vials and sending it around so we

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:51.380
into vials and sending it around so we
 

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.720
into vials and sending it around so we
had to develop an ash

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:52.730
had to develop an ash
 

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.270
had to develop an ash
capacity and what we did was bring

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280
capacity and what we did was bring
 

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.340
capacity and what we did was bring
together the heads of laboratories from

five different countries sat them down
for two weeks and worked out a manual

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:02.360
for two weeks and worked out a manual
 

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.470
for two weeks and worked out a manual
which was simple enough we said so I

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480
which was simple enough we said so I
 

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.690

could understand it she could make
vaccine and they did this a very good

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:11.300
vaccine and they did this a very good
 

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.420
vaccine and they did this a very good
manual and then they went out from the

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:13.430
manual and then they went out from the
 

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.400
manual and then they went out from the
different laboratories in one Soviet

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:15.410

we had more than 80% of the vaccine was

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:35.600
we had more than 80% of the vaccine was
 

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.370
we had more than 80% of the vaccine was
produced in the developing countries so

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:39.380
produced in the developing countries so
 

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.920
produced in the developing countries so
our target for coverage was 80% and here

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:44.930
our target for coverage was 80% and here
 

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.770
our target for coverage was 80% and here
again we had what we felt was important

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:47.780
again we had what we felt was important
 

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.030
again we had what we felt was important
was to get quality control and this was

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040
was to get quality control and this was
 

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.770
was to get quality control and this was
something we had a very difficult time

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:53.780
something we had a very difficult time
 

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.960
something we had a very difficult time
persuading ministers of health that this

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:55.970
persuading ministers of health that this
 

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.020
persuading ministers of health that this
was a good idea and the idea we had was

00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.030
was a good idea and the idea we had was
 

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.320
was a good idea and the idea we had was
simply to have a team or teams that

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:02.330
simply to have a team or teams that
 

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.750
simply to have a team or teams that
would go after the vaccinators had gone

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760
would go after the vaccinators had gone
 

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.110
would go after the vaccinators had gone
through and when you vaccinate you're

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:08.120
through and when you vaccinate you're
 

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.060
through and when you vaccinate you're
putting a little drop of vaccine here

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:10.070
putting a little drop of vaccine here
 

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.710

you're scratching through it or putting

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720
you're scratching through it or putting
 

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.900
you're scratching through it or putting
it in on talked about that then you get

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:13.910
it in on talked about that then you get
 

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:17.170
it in on talked about that then you get
a pustule it comes up and a scab and

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:17.180
a pustule it comes up and a scab and
 

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.210
a pustule it comes up and a scab and
then it falls off so you've got evidence

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:19.220
then it falls off so you've got evidence
 

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.420
then it falls off so you've got evidence
of vaccination so weak team coming

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:22.430
of vaccination so weak team coming

through a week two weeks later could see
 

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:30.370
through a week two weeks later could see
who really got vaccinated and so the

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:30.380
who really got vaccinated and so the
 

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.620
who really got vaccinated and so the
idea of having a team that did nothing

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:32.630

we encountered why aren't these people

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:42.370
we encountered why aren't these people

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.980
the virus out so people were being very
careful and not getting it implanted in

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:29.990
careful and not getting it implanted in
 

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.890

the skin so we had many failures but we

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:32.900
the skin so we had many failures but we
 

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.510
the skin so we had many failures but we
decided well let's take the needle and

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520
decided well let's take the needle and
 

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.609
decided well let's take the needle and
suppose we do this and just have them do

00:40:36.609 --> 00:40:36.619
suppose we do this and just have them do
 

00:40:36.619 --> 00:40:38.980
suppose we do this and just have them do
a number what we call multiple punctures

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:38.990
a number what we call multiple punctures
 

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:43.120
a number what we call multiple punctures
and it's very sharp and very very

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.130
and it's very sharp and very very
 

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.280

three to five years and we soon found

three to five years and we soon found
 

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.260
three to five years and we soon found
that vaccination was probably good for

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:39.270
that vaccination was probably good for
 

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:42.140
that vaccination was probably good for
at least 10 years and probably longer so

important and I think they were
 

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.550

kind of the beginning and basically I'd
 

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.160

had to do it once to get that but that's
 

00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:09.620
had to do it once to get that but that's
alright so that there's a hints for the

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:09.630
alright so that there's a hints for the
 

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.140
alright so that there's a hints for the
field that as people learned was very

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.150
field that as people learned was very
 

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:17.140

and this was a program that we set up at

00:44:32.059 --> 00:44:32.069
and this was a program that we set up at
 

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:37.309
and this was a program that we set up at
CDC just before I left AI D decided to

CDC just before I left AI D decided to
 

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:39.740
CDC just before I left AI D decided to
come forward to support a program in

come forward to support a program in
 

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.069
come forward to support a program in
West Africa 20 countries and so we'd set

00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079
West Africa 20 countries and so we'd set
 

00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:45.319
West Africa 20 countries and so we'd set
it up and we were we were just

poorest in the world said smallpox rates
 

00:44:53.339 --> 00:44:55.490
poorest in the world said smallpox rates
were among the highest and here we were

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500
were among the highest and here we were
 

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.490

three years later we're virtually free
 

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.130
three years later we're virtually free
well you can imagine we were elated it

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140
well you can imagine we were elated it
 

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.220
well you can imagine we were elated it

just India Pakistan Bangladesh so it
 

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.520
just India Pakistan Bangladesh so it
looked like you know you're really

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:28.530
looked like you know you're really
 

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.620

moving along and we're only six years

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:30.630
moving along and we're only six years
 

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.099
moving along and we're only six years
into the program at this point but that

00:45:34.099 --> 00:45:34.109
into the program at this point but that
 

00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:35.150
into the program at this point but that
area

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160
area
 

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.070
area
in India Pakistan Bangladesh you're

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:37.080
in India Pakistan Bangladesh you're
 

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.750
in India Pakistan Bangladesh you're
really dealing with a population at that

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760
really dealing with a population at that
 

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.180
really dealing with a population at that
time of something around 700 million

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:41.190
time of something around 700 million
 

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.530
time of something around 700 million
people and that was the program was not

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540
people and that was the program was not
 

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.500
people and that was the program was not
working we really were not making

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:48.510
working we really were not making
 

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.570
working we really were not making
progress and we didn't really know what

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:50.580
progress and we didn't really know what
 

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.550
progress and we didn't really know what
to do

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:51.560
to do
 

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.480
to do
and we found that people in India and

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:55.490
and we found that people in India and
 

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.700
and we found that people in India and
the subcontinent really move around a

00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:58.710
the subcontinent really move around a
 

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:00.800
the subcontinent really move around a
lot more than we'd ever imagined or we'd

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:00.810
lot more than we'd ever imagined or we'd
 

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.260
lot more than we'd ever imagined or we'd
encountered in Africa there are roads

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:03.270
encountered in Africa there are roads
 

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.360
encountered in Africa there are roads
there are the jitney buses which you can

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.370
there are the jitney buses which you can
 

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.240
there are the jitney buses which you can
see here with a plenty quite a capacity

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:08.250
see here with a plenty quite a capacity
 

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.940

to move people around the whole families

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:10.950
to move people around the whole families
 

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:14.540
to move people around the whole families
would move from place to place so it was

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:14.550
would move from place to place so it was
 

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:17.000
would move from place to place so it was
much more population movement and we

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:17.010
much more population movement and we
 

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.560
much more population movement and we
were running behind we weren't getting

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:18.570
were running behind we weren't getting
 

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:21.020
were running behind we weren't getting
the outbreaks fast enough before it was

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:21.030
the outbreaks fast enough before it was
 

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.650
the outbreaks fast enough before it was
moving on this is a train going north

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660
moving on this is a train going north
 

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.670
moving on this is a train going north
out of Calcutta

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680
out of Calcutta
 

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.380
out of Calcutta
you can see the air-conditioned

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:27.390
you can see the air-conditioned
 

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:32.780
you can see the air-conditioned
compartment on the top and we as we

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:32.790
compartment on the top and we as we
 

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.400
compartment on the top and we as we
discovered very few tickets were

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:34.410
discovered very few tickets were
 

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.310
discovered very few tickets were
collected and in fact one that we did

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:37.320
collected and in fact one that we did
 

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.260
collected and in fact one that we did
check on there was just one ticket sold

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:39.270
check on there was just one ticket sold
 

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.750
check on there was just one ticket sold
and that was our whi adviser who bought

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760
and that was our whi adviser who bought
 

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.680
and that was our whi adviser who bought
the ticket so it was it was really a lot

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:45.690
the ticket so it was it was really a lot
 

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:50.870
the ticket so it was it was really a lot
of movement so what did we do with the

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880
of movement so what did we do with the
 

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.520
of movement so what did we do with the
population in India of 550 million we

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:55.530
population in India of 550 million we
 

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.550
population in India of 550 million we
decided in the spring of that year and

00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560
decided in the spring of that year and
 

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.300
decided in the spring of that year and
in fact June of 73 that what we needed

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:02.310
in fact June of 73 that what we needed
 

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.640
in fact June of 73 that what we needed
to do is try to search every village in

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:04.650
to do is try to search every village in
 

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:09.470
to do is try to search every village in
India in ten days time and we worked

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480
India in ten days time and we worked
 

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.180
India in ten days time and we worked
with the Indian government Health

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:11.190
with the Indian government Health
 

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.000
with the Indian government Health
Department planning this so the idea was

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.010
Department planning this so the idea was
 

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.500
Department planning this so the idea was
to go to four different parts in the

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:15.510
to go to four different parts in the
 

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.780
to go to four different parts in the
village and so many tea shops and to ask

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:17.790
village and so many tea shops and to ask
 

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:21.380
village and so many tea shops and to ask
about cases and try to reach every

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.390
about cases and try to reach every
 

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.590
about cases and try to reach every
village in ten days the first results

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:24.600
village in ten days the first results
 

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:29.920
village in ten days the first results
came back and won one state of India

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:29.930
came back and won one state of India
 

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:33.650
came back and won one state of India
which was at that time I think they were

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660
which was at that time I think they were
 

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.100
which was at that time I think they were
reporting 500 cases a week team found

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:37.110
reporting 500 cases a week team found
 

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:40.850
reporting 500 cases a week team found
10,000 cases and I must say the reports

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:40.860
10,000 cases and I must say the reports
 

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.060
10,000 cases and I must say the reports
came in to us and in Geneva I hold my

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:44.070
came in to us and in Geneva I hold my
 

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:48.330
came in to us and in Geneva I hold my
god 10,000 cases this was October

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:48.340
god 10,000 cases this was October
 

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.300
god 10,000 cases this was October
and the city smallpox season doesn't

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:51.310
and the city smallpox season doesn't
 

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:53.160
and the city smallpox season doesn't
really get started until late October

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.170
really get started until late October
 

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.950
really get started until late October
November when you really begin to get it

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960
November when you really begin to get it
 

00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.960
November when you really begin to get it
spread and things look pretty grim but

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:00.970
spread and things look pretty grim but
 

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:05.220
spread and things look pretty grim but
then that the the staff got organized in

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:05.230
then that the the staff got organized in
 

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.810
then that the the staff got organized in
this and said let's go to every house

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:06.820
this and said let's go to every house
 

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.530
this and said let's go to every house
not every village and so they set up a

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:10.540
not every village and so they set up a
 

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.500
not every village and so they set up a
program to visit every house in India in

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:13.510
program to visit every house in India in
 

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:16.260
program to visit every house in India in
ten days time and you say yeah I know

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:16.270
ten days time and you say yeah I know
 

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.720
ten days time and you say yeah I know
you know they went to all the houses but

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:18.730
you know they went to all the houses but
 

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:22.110
you know they went to all the houses but
we had quality control and the quality

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:22.120
we had quality control and the quality
 

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.180
we had quality control and the quality
control team went afterwards and if they

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:24.190
control team went afterwards and if they
 

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:28.260
control team went afterwards and if they
didn't get 90% of the houses they had to

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:28.270
didn't get 90% of the houses they had to
 

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.390
didn't get 90% of the houses they had to
send go back and redo the whole search

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400
send go back and redo the whole search
 

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.900
send go back and redo the whole search
again and so we had a pretty good idea

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:33.910
again and so we had a pretty good idea
 

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.080
again and so we had a pretty good idea
that we were really getting cases and

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.090
that we were really getting cases and
 

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.900
that we were really getting cases and
they were beginning to get contained

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:38.910
they were beginning to get contained
 

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:42.720
they were beginning to get contained
spring of 74 we thought of the

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:42.730
spring of 74 we thought of the
 

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:45.690
spring of 74 we thought of the
january/february I remember discussing

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:45.700
january/february I remember discussing
 

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.030
january/february I remember discussing
it at the time we felt this is the worst

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040
it at the time we felt this is the worst
 

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.730
it at the time we felt this is the worst
this is India if we can defeat smallpox

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:50.740
this is India if we can defeat smallpox
 

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.250
this is India if we can defeat smallpox
in India we're gonna be able to do it

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:53.260
in India we're gonna be able to do it
 

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.360
in India we're gonna be able to do it
the rest of the world and we were really

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:57.370
the rest of the world and we were really
 

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.850
the rest of the world and we were really
elated at that point and then the roof

00:48:59.850 --> 00:48:59.860
elated at that point and then the roof
 

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.660
elated at that point and then the roof
fell in

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:00.670
fell in
 

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.460
fell in
there was remember there were they've

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:02.470
there was remember there were they've
 

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:04.650

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:42.849
professionals we're not constrained by
knowing what can't be done and that's

01:03:42.849 --> 01:03:42.859
knowing what can't be done and that's
 

01:03:42.859 --> 01:03:44.980
knowing what can't be done and that's
the way so many of our people working in

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:44.990
the way so many of our people working in
 

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:47.620
the way so many of our people working in
the field knew and they were told that

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:47.630
the field knew and they were told that
 

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:50.770
the field knew and they were told that
it couldn't be done and so they didn't

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:50.780
it couldn't be done and so they didn't
 

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.500
it couldn't be done and so they didn't
know they couldn't do it and so it was

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:53.510
know they couldn't do it and so it was
 

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:55.690
know they couldn't do it and so it was
with many who contributed so much to

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:55.700
with many who contributed so much to
 

01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:12.540
with many who contributed so much to
making eradication a possibility

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:12.550
 
 

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:18.760

so dr. Anderson is yes is willing to to
 

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.340
so dr. Anderson is yes is willing to to
answer some questions and what we would

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:21.350
answer some questions and what we would
 

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:24.640
answer some questions and what we would
ask is that is there a microphone for no

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:24.650
ask is that is there a microphone for no
 

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:25.270
ask is that is there a microphone for no
okay

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280

around five to ten percent of the people
would begin bleeding during the first

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:15.590
would begin bleeding during the first
 

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:21.880
would begin bleeding during the first
week and there are no survivors and then

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:21.890
week and there are no survivors and then
 

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:25.030
week and there are no survivors and then
there was a flat smallpox in which they

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:25.040
there was a flat smallpox in which they
 

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.800
there was a flat smallpox in which they
don't didn't have those little lesions

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:26.810
don't didn't have those little lesions
 

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.800
don't didn't have those little lesions
they were just like a like a skin over

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:29.810
they were just like a like a skin over
 

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:31.630
they were just like a like a skin over
it and then if you touch the skin

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640
it and then if you touch the skin
 

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.540
it and then if you touch the skin
actually it's separated from and it was

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:34.550
actually it's separated from and it was
 

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:36.370
actually it's separated from and it was
just a horrible thing and so these

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:36.380
just a horrible thing and so these
 

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.170
just a horrible thing and so these
people died there was absolutely nothing

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:38.180
people died there was absolutely nothing
 

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:43.240
people died there was absolutely nothing
you could do for them no no no so no

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:43.250
you could do for them no no no so no
 

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:47.290
you could do for them no no no so no
survivors of the flat smallpox either it

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:47.300
survivors of the flat smallpox either it
 

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.390
survivors of the flat smallpox either it
was a hideous disease I could tell you

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400
was a hideous disease I could tell you
 

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.660
was a hideous disease I could tell you
from going through a ward with smallpox

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:52.670
from going through a ward with smallpox
 

01:05:52.670 --> 01:06:05.330
from going through a ward with smallpox
well that's something

01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:05.340
 
 

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:19.650
 
just speak up if you could

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:25.110
 
well there's a Pharisee giving and

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:25.120
well there's a Pharisee giving and
 

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.680
well there's a Pharisee giving and
controversy it's been going on and that

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:28.690
controversy it's been going on and that
 

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:31.020
controversy it's been going on and that
is at the end of the smoke during the

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.030
is at the end of the smoke during the
 

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:34.820
is at the end of the smoke during the
smallpox program for the end we asked

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:34.830
smallpox program for the end we asked
 

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:38.370
smallpox program for the end we asked
countries that had smallpox specimens in

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:38.380
countries that had smallpox specimens in
 

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.650
countries that had smallpox specimens in
their labs to put them send them to one

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:40.660
their labs to put them send them to one
 

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.340
their labs to put them send them to one
of two collaborating laboratories Moscow

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:44.350
of two collaborating laboratories Moscow
 

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:48.810
of two collaborating laboratories Moscow
and Atlanta and by 1980 they were pretty

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:48.820
and Atlanta and by 1980 they were pretty
 

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.690
and Atlanta and by 1980 they were pretty
well we were down to two laboratories

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.700
well we were down to two laboratories
 

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.300
well we were down to two laboratories
and those are the only two other

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:54.310
and those are the only two other
 

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.400
and those are the only two other
countries designed a piece of paper that

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:56.410
countries designed a piece of paper that
 

01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:59.520
countries designed a piece of paper that
in 1980 that they had checked and they

01:06:59.520 --> 01:06:59.530
in 1980 that they had checked and they
 

01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:02.040
in 1980 that they had checked and they
had no less of specimens in their

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:02.050
had no less of specimens in their
 

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:06.900
had no less of specimens in their
laboratories 1985 there was a an expert

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:06.910
laboratories 1985 there was a an expert
 

01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:10.170
laboratories 1985 there was a an expert
committee on smallpox for w-h-o and

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:10.180
committee on smallpox for w-h-o and
 

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.970
committee on smallpox for w-h-o and
looking at a number of things one of

01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:11.980
looking at a number of things one of
 

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.540
looking at a number of things one of
them was what should we destroy the

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:15.550
them was what should we destroy the
 

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:18.450
them was what should we destroy the
remaining smallpox virus is there a

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:18.460
remaining smallpox virus is there a
 

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.640
remaining smallpox virus is there a
chance that it could escape why not just

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:20.650
chance that it could escape why not just
 

01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.240
chance that it could escape why not just
destroy it so over the next 10 years

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:24.250
destroy it so over the next 10 years
 

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:28.110
destroy it so over the next 10 years
actually the committee met on a year a

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:28.120
actually the committee met on a year a
 

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.260
actually the committee met on a year a
year to year basis one of the things we

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:31.270
year to year basis one of the things we
 

01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:32.760
year to year basis one of the things we
were concerned about was to preserve

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:32.770
were concerned about was to preserve
 

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:36.540
were concerned about was to preserve
genetic information and so a library of

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:36.550
genetic information and so a library of
 

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:40.500
genetic information and so a library of
fragments of smallpox were created sub

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:40.510
fragments of smallpox were created sub
 

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:43.140
fragments of smallpox were created sub
different strains then the virus was

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:43.150
different strains then the virus was
 

01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:45.810
different strains then the virus was
sequenced so you had a real definitive

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:45.820
sequenced so you had a real definitive
 

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.860
sequenced so you had a real definitive
map of not one but several strains then

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:49.870
map of not one but several strains then
 

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:54.900
map of not one but several strains then
the committee then wrote to mint

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:54.910
the committee then wrote to mint
 

01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:57.720

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:28.240
that they wanted to do more research so
I said all right take three more years

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:28.250
I said all right take three more years
 

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.709
I said all right take three more years
than three more years and then three

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719
than three more years and then three
 

01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:34.160
than three more years and then three
more years there's a lot of anger in a

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:34.170
more years there's a lot of anger in a
 

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.680
more years there's a lot of anger in a
lot of developing countries about why

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:36.690
lot of developing countries about why
 

01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:39.320
lot of developing countries about why
are we not destroying it what is the US

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:39.330
are we not destroying it what is the US
 

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:41.660
are we not destroying it what is the US
and Russia up to anyway why do you want

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:41.670
and Russia up to anyway why do you want
 

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:44.390
and Russia up to anyway why do you want
to keep it so this has been argued very

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400
to keep it so this has been argued very
 

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.510
to keep it so this has been argued very
heatedly it was a major discussion at

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520
heatedly it was a major discussion at
 

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.399
heatedly it was a major discussion at
the World Health Assembly this year and

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:49.409
the World Health Assembly this year and
 

01:09:49.409 --> 01:09:54.079
the World Health Assembly this year and
went on for several days and they

01:09:54.079 --> 01:09:54.089
went on for several days and they
 

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:57.530
went on for several days and they
finally decided that they would defer

01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540
finally decided that they would defer
 

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.330
finally decided that they would defer
further discussion for another three

01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.340
further discussion for another three
 

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:04.879
further discussion for another three
years so this is where we are and I

01:10:04.879 --> 01:10:04.889
years so this is where we are and I
 

01:10:04.889 --> 01:10:07.550
years so this is where we are and I
think my own feeling is we ought to

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560
think my own feeling is we ought to
 

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.830
think my own feeling is we ought to
destroy the virus there's no question we

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840
destroy the virus there's no question we
 

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.840
destroy the virus there's no question we
should destroy it and there are all

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:11.850
should destroy it and there are all
 

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:14.320
should destroy it and there are all
sorts of objections being raised but

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:14.330
sorts of objections being raised but
 

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:20.200
sorts of objections being raised but
then let me just leave it there as

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:20.210
then let me just leave it there as
 

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:22.669
then let me just leave it there as
somebody said it's not scientific it's

01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679
somebody said it's not scientific it's
 

01:10:22.679 --> 01:10:38.620
somebody said it's not scientific it's
political now

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:38.630
 
 

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:42.820
 
in this state in this day and age of the

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:42.830
in this state in this day and age of the
 

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:45.770
in this state in this day and age of the
AIDS with the bifurcated needle

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780
AIDS with the bifurcated needle
 

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:49.160
AIDS with the bifurcated needle
technique still be used if smallpox is

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:49.170
technique still be used if smallpox is
 

01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:50.990
technique still be used if smallpox is
still around even though you can

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000
still around even though you can
 

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.090
still around even though you can
sterilize it there could be cases where

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:53.100
sterilize it there could be cases where
 

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.800
sterilize it there could be cases where
it wouldn't be properly sterilized so

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:54.810
it wouldn't be properly sterilized so
 

01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:56.870
it wouldn't be properly sterilized so
then we this be no longer a valid

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880
then we this be no longer a valid
 

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.860
then we this be no longer a valid
technique for smallpox treatment well I

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:00.870
technique for smallpox treatment well I
 

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:02.360
technique for smallpox treatment well I
think at this point there's a feeling

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:02.370
think at this point there's a feeling
 

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:05.570
think at this point there's a feeling
that one should never have an instrument

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580
that one should never have an instrument
 

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.700
that one should never have an instrument
the needle of to be reused at all no

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:07.710
the needle of to be reused at all no
 

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:09.650
the needle of to be reused at all no
matter how you sterilize it so that this

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:09.660
matter how you sterilize it so that this
 

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:14.900
matter how you sterilize it so that this
has been the what has been the the tenor

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:14.910
has been the what has been the the tenor
 

01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.300
has been the what has been the the tenor
of what what we should be doing if we're

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:17.310
of what what we should be doing if we're
 

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:19.970
of what what we should be doing if we're
putting up a stockpile we should have a

01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980
putting up a stockpile we should have a
 

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:21.980
putting up a stockpile we should have a
needle for every vaccinations going to

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:21.990
needle for every vaccinations going to
 

01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:24.830
needle for every vaccinations going to
be done but the difference between this

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840
be done but the difference between this
 

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.140
be done but the difference between this
and an ordinary needle an ordinary

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:27.150
and an ordinary needle an ordinary
 

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.850
and an ordinary needle an ordinary
needle you have a hollow bore and trying

01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860
needle you have a hollow bore and trying
 

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.640
needle you have a hollow bore and trying
to sterilize the needle thoroughly and

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:34.650
to sterilize the needle thoroughly and
 

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:36.380
to sterilize the needle thoroughly and
make sure nothing is there is more

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:36.390
make sure nothing is there is more
 

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:38.810
make sure nothing is there is more
difficult here you don't have the hollow

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:38.820
difficult here you don't have the hollow
 

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.780
difficult here you don't have the hollow
bore and the likelihood of transferring

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:41.790
bore and the likelihood of transferring
 

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:45.230
bore and the likelihood of transferring
something is pretty minimal so that I

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:45.240
something is pretty minimal so that I
 

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.870
something is pretty minimal so that I
think from all the lab study studies

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880
think from all the lab study studies
 

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.270
think from all the lab study studies
there's really one would not need to do

01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280
there's really one would not need to do
 

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.930
there's really one would not need to do
it but I think as a principal the

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:52.940
it but I think as a principal the
 

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.280
it but I think as a principal the
decision has been made that if we do

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:55.290
decision has been made that if we do
 

01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.320
decision has been made that if we do
vaccination we'll do it each one with a

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:57.330
vaccination we'll do it each one with a
 

01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:03.020
vaccination we'll do it each one with a
separate needle so however if we're back

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:03.030
separate needle so however if we're back
 

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:05.780
separate needle so however if we're back
against the wall and we've got vaccine

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:05.790
against the wall and we've got vaccine
 

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:08.060
against the wall and we've got vaccine
if we don't have enough needles I'm

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:08.070
if we don't have enough needles I'm
 

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:09.620
if we don't have enough needles I'm
going to be out there boiling needles

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:09.630
going to be out there boiling needles
 

01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:20.500
going to be out there boiling needles
I'll tell you that

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:20.510
 
 

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:23.660
 
on a sort of related note do you think

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:23.670
on a sort of related note do you think
 

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:26.870
on a sort of related note do you think
that in today's political current and

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880
that in today's political current and
 

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.030
that in today's political current and
views about public health do you think

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040
views about public health do you think
 

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.650
views about public health do you think
that this same campaign could have been

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:30.660
that this same campaign could have been
 

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:37.610
that this same campaign could have been
done again in 2010 2011 you're basically

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620
done again in 2010 2011 you're basically
 

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.150
done again in 2010 2011 you're basically
saying suppose we started with smallpox

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:40.160
saying suppose we started with smallpox
 

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.490
saying suppose we started with smallpox
eradication today could we do it yeah

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500
eradication today could we do it yeah
 

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.060
eradication today could we do it yeah
you know I've thought a lot about it I'm

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:47.070
you know I've thought a lot about it I'm
 

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:50.750
you know I've thought a lot about it I'm
not sure I know to tell you the truth I

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760
not sure I know to tell you the truth I
 

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.770
not sure I know to tell you the truth I
think it would be vastly easier because

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780
think it would be vastly easier because
 

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.140
think it would be vastly easier because
of communication and you got cell phones

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:57.150
of communication and you got cell phones
 

01:12:57.150 --> 01:13:00.110
of communication and you got cell phones
and you've got internet my goodness that

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120
and you've got internet my goodness that
 

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.880
and you've got internet my goodness that
what you could do in the communication

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:01.890
what you could do in the communication
 

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:06.290
what you could do in the communication
is marvelous on the other hand I think

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300
is marvelous on the other hand I think
 

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.620
is marvelous on the other hand I think
there are there's certainly more in the

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:09.630
there are there's certainly more in the
 

01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:14.990
there are there's certainly more in the
way of large-scale civil disorder then I

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000
way of large-scale civil disorder then I
 

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.700
way of large-scale civil disorder then I
think we were seeing although we did see

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:16.710
think we were seeing although we did see
 

01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:20.620
think we were seeing although we did see
quite a bit during a smallpox program

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:20.630
quite a bit during a smallpox program
 

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:25.480
quite a bit during a smallpox program
there's it's a bit different and I

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:25.490
there's it's a bit different and I
 

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:29.390
there's it's a bit different and I
really just don't know it's right now

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400
really just don't know it's right now
 

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.820
really just don't know it's right now
there's the bureaucracy is much more

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:31.830
there's the bureaucracy is much more
 

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:36.920
there's the bureaucracy is much more
elaborate than it used to be and it's

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:36.930
elaborate than it used to be and it's
 

01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:40.970
elaborate than it used to be and it's
very hard to cut through red tape much

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980
very hard to cut through red tape much
 

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.660
very hard to cut through red tape much
harder than it was when we were out

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:44.670
harder than it was when we were out
 

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:49.160
harder than it was when we were out
there and working on it so it gets more

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:49.170
there and working on it so it gets more
 

01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:51.550
there and working on it so it gets more
complicated getting from here to there

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560
complicated getting from here to there
 

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.100
complicated getting from here to there
which makes a lot of decisions more

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:55.110
which makes a lot of decisions more
 

01:13:55.110 --> 01:14:00.170
which makes a lot of decisions more
difficult than we had so I just I really

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:00.180
difficult than we had so I just I really
 

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.740
difficult than we had so I just I really
don't know I would only say this that

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:05.750
don't know I would only say this that
 

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:11.990
don't know I would only say this that
2001 came and I was brought back into

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000
2001 came and I was brought back into
 

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.980
2001 came and I was brought back into
working in Washington and we had at the

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:15.990
working in Washington and we had at the
 

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:19.510
working in Washington and we had at the
time we looked at it where there was

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520
time we looked at it where there was
 

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.580
time we looked at it where there was
intelligence which suggested that there

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:22.590
intelligence which suggested that there
 

01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:24.530
intelligence which suggested that there
could be a second event and it would be

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540
could be a second event and it would be
 

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:28.070
could be a second event and it would be
biological and we assumed for other

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080
biological and we assumed for other
 

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.250
biological and we assumed for other
reasons it would be smallpox or and

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260
reasons it would be smallpox or and
 

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:35.280
reasons it would be smallpox or and
and we checked with CDC to say okay

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:35.290
and we checked with CDC to say okay
 

01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:37.560
and we checked with CDC to say okay
tomorrow we discover we got a smallpox

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:37.570
tomorrow we discover we got a smallpox
 

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:41.550
tomorrow we discover we got a smallpox
outbreak how much vaccine have we got at

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560
outbreak how much vaccine have we got at
 

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.850
outbreak how much vaccine have we got at
that time they could put 90,000 doses in

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:44.860
that time they could put 90,000 doses in
 

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:48.840
that time they could put 90,000 doses in
the field not enough really to do much

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:48.850
the field not enough really to do much
 

01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:53.790
the field not enough really to do much
of anything in our sole supply then as

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800
of anything in our sole supply then as
 

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.150
of anything in our sole supply then as
the vaccine some of this material had

01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:57.160
the vaccine some of this material had
 

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.750
the vaccine some of this material had
been stored since 1978 came around and

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760
been stored since 1978 came around and
 

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.050
been stored since 1978 came around and
then we came up to 15 million doses but

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:04.060
then we came up to 15 million doses but
 

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:06.510
then we came up to 15 million doses but
my goodness if you had a smallpox

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:06.520
my goodness if you had a smallpox
 

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.670
my goodness if you had a smallpox
outbreak and you want a lot of people

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:08.680
outbreak and you want a lot of people
 

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.620
outbreak and you want a lot of people
vaccinated a lot of people demanding

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:10.630
vaccinated a lot of people demanding
 

01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:13.230
vaccinated a lot of people demanding
vaccinations 15 million isn't going very

01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:13.240
vaccinations 15 million isn't going very
 

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.400
vaccinations 15 million isn't going very
far we talked with people before 9/11

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:17.410
far we talked with people before 9/11
 

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:19.770
far we talked with people before 9/11
for other reasons to say how long would

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:19.780
for other reasons to say how long would
 

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.920
for other reasons to say how long would
it take to produce more vaccine because

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:22.930
it take to produce more vaccine because
 

01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:26.100
it take to produce more vaccine because
by the time vaccine vaccination stopped

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:26.110
by the time vaccine vaccination stopped
 

01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:28.980
by the time vaccine vaccination stopped
everywhere and there is no smallpox

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:28.990
everywhere and there is no smallpox
 

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.590
everywhere and there is no smallpox
vaccine producer and we thought were

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600
vaccine producer and we thought were
 

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.650
vaccine producer and we thought were
confronted with that and what to do

01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:33.660
confronted with that and what to do
 

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.170
confronted with that and what to do
so we talked with some of the very key

01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:37.180
so we talked with some of the very key
 

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.930
so we talked with some of the very key
people and said look if we need that

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:39.940
people and said look if we need that
 

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:45.120
people and said look if we need that
vaccine and we cut every corner how long

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:45.130
vaccine and we cut every corner how long
 

01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:48.300
vaccine and we cut every corner how long
would it take to get us its a vaccine

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:48.310
would it take to get us its a vaccine
 

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:52.500
would it take to get us its a vaccine
and after much discussion we finally

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:52.510
and after much discussion we finally
 

01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:56.940
and after much discussion we finally
came up with a figure five years so I

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:56.950
came up with a figure five years so I
 

01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:00.180
came up with a figure five years so I
can say there were some very hairy

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:00.190
can say there were some very hairy
 

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:03.780
can say there were some very hairy
moments back in 2001 which are not

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:03.790
moments back in 2001 which are not
 

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:07.950
moments back in 2001 which are not
really described however we got an

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:07.960
really described however we got an
 

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.200
really described however we got an
extraordinary person who former Major

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:10.210
extraordinary person who former Major
 

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:14.010

General from the military who joined us

01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:14.020
General from the military who joined us
 

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:19.800
General from the military who joined us
and we were all pretty dumbfounded

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:19.810
and we were all pretty dumbfounded
 

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:24.570
and we were all pretty dumbfounded
because within we cut red tape like it

01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:24.580
because within we cut red tape like it
 

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.950
because within we cut red tape like it
has never been cut before and we had and

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960
has never been cut before and we had and
 

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.680
has never been cut before and we had and
we were instead of finishing one study

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:31.690
we were instead of finishing one study
 

01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:33.510
we were instead of finishing one study
to know what to do in the next wound we

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520
to know what to do in the next wound we
 

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.120
to know what to do in the next wound we
were anticipating what would be starting

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:36.130
were anticipating what would be starting
 

01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:41.750
were anticipating what would be starting
the next study so overlapping and we had

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760
the next study so overlapping and we had
 

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.590
the next study so overlapping and we had
we had

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600
we had
 

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.220
we had
and 24 months with 200 million doses and

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:49.230
and 24 months with 200 million doses and
 

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:52.140
and 24 months with 200 million doses and
could we have done it because at that

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:52.150
could we have done it because at that
 

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:56.490
could we have done it because at that
time it was urgent and we could move

01:16:56.490 --> 01:16:56.500
time it was urgent and we could move
 

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.740
time it was urgent and we could move
very quickly and a lot of people were

01:16:58.740 --> 01:16:58.750
very quickly and a lot of people were
 

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:04.020
very quickly and a lot of people were
working very closely together and we had

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:04.030
working very closely together and we had
 

01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:05.850

it was being produced in Austria for

01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:05.860
it was being produced in Austria for
 

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.650
it was being produced in Austria for
example there were problems of the

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:07.660
example there were problems of the
 

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.410
example there were problems of the
Department of Commerce about bringing it

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:10.420
Department of Commerce about bringing it
 

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.660
Department of Commerce about bringing it
in without special licensing and a whole

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:12.670
in without special licensing and a whole
 

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.420
in without special licensing and a whole
lot of things that went with it

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:14.430
lot of things that went with it
 

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:17.850
lot of things that went with it
so I remember the meeting very well and

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:17.860
so I remember the meeting very well and
 

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.100
so I remember the meeting very well and
I said to the man from commerce I said

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:20.110
I said to the man from commerce I said
 

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:22.650
I said to the man from commerce I said
would it help if my secretary called

01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:22.660
would it help if my secretary called
 

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:26.310
would it help if my secretary called
your secretary he said that will not be

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320
your secretary he said that will not be
 

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.380
your secretary he said that will not be
necessary it will be done but that that

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:31.390
necessary it will be done but that that
 

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:36.810
necessary it will be done but that that
was a sort of lever you had which I I

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:36.820
was a sort of lever you had which I I
 

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.700
was a sort of lever you had which I I
don't know whether you would have that

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:38.710
don't know whether you would have that
 

01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:41.880
don't know whether you would have that
same sort of feeling if we were real and

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:41.890
same sort of feeling if we were real and
 

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:44.480
same sort of feeling if we were real and
a real emergency now what could we do in

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:44.490
a real emergency now what could we do in
 

01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:48.180
a real emergency now what could we do in
stopping smallpox I almost feel like we

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:48.190
stopping smallpox I almost feel like we
 

01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:50.400
stopping smallpox I almost feel like we
probably could stop it but it would take

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:50.410
probably could stop it but it would take
 

01:17:50.410 --> 01:18:04.700
probably could stop it but it would take
special measures

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:04.710
 
 

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:07.040
 
so over the course of you of your talk

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:07.050
so over the course of you of your talk
 

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:09.110
so over the course of you of your talk
you mentioned a couple of properties

01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120
you mentioned a couple of properties
 

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.600
you mentioned a couple of properties
that are specific to the smallpox virus

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:11.610
that are specific to the smallpox virus
 

01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:14.180
that are specific to the smallpox virus
and to infection like there's the

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:14.190
and to infection like there's the
 

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.010
and to infection like there's the
evidence of the vaccine also obviously

01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020
evidence of the vaccine also obviously
 

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.410
evidence of the vaccine also obviously
evidence of the infection there's like

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420
evidence of the infection there's like
 

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.990
evidence of the infection there's like
slower spread than you had expected and

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000
slower spread than you had expected and
 

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.600
slower spread than you had expected and
with other infectious diseases there was

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:23.610
with other infectious diseases there was
 

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:25.730
with other infectious diseases there was
a cheap vaccine and vaccination

01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:25.740
a cheap vaccine and vaccination
 

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:28.180
a cheap vaccine and vaccination
techniques so given all of these things

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:28.190
techniques so given all of these things
 

01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:30.830
techniques so given all of these things
would you say that the tactics that you

01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840
would you say that the tactics that you
 

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.680
would you say that the tactics that you
used to stop the spread of smallpox then

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:33.690
used to stop the spread of smallpox then
 

01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:35.000
used to stop the spread of smallpox then
would work

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:35.010
would work
 

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.010
would work
combating certain evil pathogens that

01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020
combating certain evil pathogens that
 

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.480
combating certain evil pathogens that
around today and if so why are there a

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:41.490
around today and if so why are there a
 

01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:44.000
around today and if so why are there a
very good question and I think the fact

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:44.010
very good question and I think the fact
 

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:46.040
very good question and I think the fact
is that we could tell where every case

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:46.050
is that we could tell where every case
 

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:49.810
is that we could tell where every case
was and could draw build a ring of

01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:49.820
was and could draw build a ring of
 

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:53.060
was and could draw build a ring of
vaccination around an immune immunity so

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:53.070
vaccination around an immune immunity so
 

01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:55.490
vaccination around an immune immunity so
it wouldn't spread with a real advantage

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500
it wouldn't spread with a real advantage
 

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:59.960
it wouldn't spread with a real advantage
but I think at this time you can look to

01:18:59.960 --> 01:18:59.970
but I think at this time you can look to
 

01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:03.290
but I think at this time you can look to
polio and for every paralytic case you

01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300
polio and for every paralytic case you
 

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.720
polio and for every paralytic case you
probably get 200 infections without

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:05.730
probably get 200 infections without
 

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:09.380
probably get 200 infections without
symptoms or very minor symptoms so that

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:09.390
symptoms or very minor symptoms so that
 

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:11.300
symptoms or very minor symptoms so that
it's very hard to know where the polio

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:11.310
it's very hard to know where the polio
 

01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:14.260
it's very hard to know where the polio
is so you have to use some different

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:14.270
is so you have to use some different
 

01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:16.850
is so you have to use some different
strategy and that that sort of strategy

01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860
strategy and that that sort of strategy
 

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:20.540
strategy and that that sort of strategy
we have the smallpox really it worked to

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:20.550
we have the smallpox really it worked to
 

01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:23.930
we have the smallpox really it worked to
a degree with measles in Latin America

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:23.940
a degree with measles in Latin America
 

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:26.870
a degree with measles in Latin America
but only to a degree it spread so

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880
but only to a degree it spread so
 

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.200
but only to a degree it spread so
rapidly that the small pocket was

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:30.210
rapidly that the small pocket was
 

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:32.090
rapidly that the small pocket was
spreading slowly measles spreads very

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100
spreading slowly measles spreads very
 

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.360
spreading slowly measles spreads very
rapidly much more than smallpox does but

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:35.370
rapidly much more than smallpox does but
 

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:36.700
rapidly much more than smallpox does but
it still was very helpful

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:36.710
it still was very helpful
 

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:41.090
it still was very helpful
so in polio it's not been it's not would

01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100
so in polio it's not been it's not would
 

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.330
so in polio it's not been it's not would
not work very well but I think the big

01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340
not work very well but I think the big
 

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.150
not work very well but I think the big
problem we have with polio and I felt at

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:47.160
problem we have with polio and I felt at
 

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.450
problem we have with polio and I felt at
the beginning we needed a much more

01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:50.460
the beginning we needed a much more
 

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.330
the beginning we needed a much more
potent vaccine polio you really in the

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.340
potent vaccine polio you really in the
 

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.460
potent vaccine polio you really in the
developing countries you got any of six

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:55.470
developing countries you got any of six
 

01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:58.130
developing countries you got any of six
eight doses of oral polio vaccine to get

01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.140
eight doses of oral polio vaccine to get
 

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:02.090
eight doses of oral polio vaccine to get
a coverage or get a take and it is not

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100
a coverage or get a take and it is not
 

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.800
a coverage or get a take and it is not
heat stable so you've got to keep it

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:03.810
heat stable so you've got to keep it
 

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:07.540
heat stable so you've got to keep it
cold right out to the periphery and I

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:07.550
cold right out to the periphery and I
 

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:11.600
cold right out to the periphery and I
think I at the time 1988 when we first

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:11.610
think I at the time 1988 when we first
 

01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:13.640
think I at the time 1988 when we first
got into this I felt we would not

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:13.650
got into this I felt we would not
 

01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:14.840
got into this I felt we would not
succeed

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:14.850
succeed
 

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:18.050
succeed
without a better vaccine and that I was

01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:18.060
without a better vaccine and that I was
 

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.970
without a better vaccine and that I was
I was all in favor of pushing very hard

01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980
I was all in favor of pushing very hard
 

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.930
I was all in favor of pushing very hard
to get the vaccine first and then begin

01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940
to get the vaccine first and then begin
 

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:26.000
to get the vaccine first and then begin
the eradication but it's not what

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:26.010
the eradication but it's not what
 

01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:30.380
the eradication but it's not what
happened

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:30.390
 
 

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.240
 
what extent do you think that the

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.250
what extent do you think that the
 

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.780
what extent do you think that the
eradication of smallpox has led to the

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:34.790
eradication of smallpox has led to the
 

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.280
eradication of smallpox has led to the
has led to some organizations today or

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:37.290
has led to some organizations today or
 

01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:38.510
has led to some organizations today or
foundations sitting the goal of

01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520
foundations sitting the goal of
 

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.470
foundations sitting the goal of
eradicating malaria

01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480
eradicating malaria
 

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.520
eradicating malaria
even though the diseases are very

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:40.530
even though the diseases are very
 

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:42.590
even though the diseases are very
different do you think that those

01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600
different do you think that those
 

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.450
different do you think that those
foundations really believe that because

01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460
foundations really believe that because
 

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.340
foundations really believe that because
we're a decay to smallpox that that's

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:46.350
we're a decay to smallpox that that's
 

01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:48.410
we're a decay to smallpox that that's
realistic goal for malaria if we had a

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420
realistic goal for malaria if we had a
 

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:54.350
realistic goal for malaria if we had a
vaccine is a really difficult question

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360
vaccine is a really difficult question
 

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.050
vaccine is a really difficult question
because indeed malaria has been

01:20:59.050 --> 01:20:59.060
because indeed malaria has been
 

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:01.760
because indeed malaria has been
pronounced the objective I think of the

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:01.770
pronounced the objective I think of the
 

01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:05.090
pronounced the objective I think of the
Gates Foundation and they feel that it

01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100
Gates Foundation and they feel that it
 

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:08.630
Gates Foundation and they feel that it
can be done and I think then others I

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640
can be done and I think then others I
 

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:08.950
can be done and I think then others I
think

01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960
think
 

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.510
think
w-h-o has endorsed this the question

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520
w-h-o has endorsed this the question
 

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.290
w-h-o has endorsed this the question
when and the problem is that there is

01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300
when and the problem is that there is
 

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.400
when and the problem is that there is
not at this time a malaria vaccine which

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:19.410
not at this time a malaria vaccine which
 

01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:21.920
not at this time a malaria vaccine which
could be used there is a malaria vaccine

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:21.930
could be used there is a malaria vaccine
 

01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:25.810
could be used there is a malaria vaccine
very reported just within the last year

01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:25.820
very reported just within the last year
 

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:29.240
very reported just within the last year
that does protect but it's very

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:29.250
that does protect but it's very
 

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:32.390
that does protect but it's very
difficult to produce it so there's a lot

01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400
difficult to produce it so there's a lot
 

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.730
difficult to produce it so there's a lot
of money going into producing a vaccine

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:34.740
of money going into producing a vaccine
 

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.990
of money going into producing a vaccine
but there are some other things that

01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000
but there are some other things that
 

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.900
but there are some other things that
have happened the use of bed nets of

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:38.910
have happened the use of bed nets of
 

01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:41.540
have happened the use of bed nets of
putting distributing bed nets have been

01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:41.550
putting distributing bed nets have been
 

01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:43.370
putting distributing bed nets have been
dramatically effective in a number of

01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380
dramatically effective in a number of
 

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:46.630
dramatically effective in a number of
countries is dropped death rates by 50%

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:46.640
countries is dropped death rates by 50%
 

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.880
countries is dropped death rates by 50%
and people maybe are sleeping into the

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:49.890
and people maybe are sleeping into the
 

01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:51.140
and people maybe are sleeping into the
bed nets if you don't want to be bitten

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:51.150
bed nets if you don't want to be bitten
 

01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:54.470
bed nets if you don't want to be bitten
by bugs but it's also preventing spread

01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480
by bugs but it's also preventing spread
 

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.100
by bugs but it's also preventing spread
of malaria so that that makes a big

01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:58.110
of malaria so that that makes a big
 

01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.610
of malaria so that that makes a big
difference

01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:58.620
difference
 

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:02.030
difference
you've got the drugs that you could use

01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040
you've got the drugs that you could use
 

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.130
you've got the drugs that you could use
to treat malaria and there are

01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140
to treat malaria and there are
 

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.290
to treat malaria and there are
diagnostic methods that are developing

01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300
diagnostic methods that are developing
 

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.760
diagnostic methods that are developing
so that you could do them much more

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:07.770
so that you could do them much more
 

01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:11.480
so that you could do them much more
rapidly quickly and give drugs I think

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:11.490
rapidly quickly and give drugs I think
 

01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:12.770
rapidly quickly and give drugs I think
that will help

01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:12.780
that will help
 

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.260
that will help
I think the bed nets are helped and I

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:15.270
I think the bed nets are helped and I
 

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:19.160
I think the bed nets are helped and I
think insecticide will also help but

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:19.170
think insecticide will also help but
 

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:20.900
think insecticide will also help but
when push comes to shove I think the

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:20.910
when push comes to shove I think the
 

01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:23.810
when push comes to shove I think the
ultimate test is going to be do we have

01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820
ultimate test is going to be do we have
 

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:27.320
ultimate test is going to be do we have
a vaccine and the reason is if you've

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:27.330
a vaccine and the reason is if you've
 

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:28.200
a vaccine and the reason is if you've
got back

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:28.210
got back
 

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:30.840
got back
Sene then the immune the you've got the

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:30.850
Sene then the immune the you've got the
 

01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:33.810
Sene then the immune the you've got the
antibodies in the individual and you can

01:22:33.810 --> 01:22:33.820
antibodies in the individual and you can
 

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.030
antibodies in the individual and you can
go through a whole area and can make

01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040
go through a whole area and can make
 

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.340
go through a whole area and can make
them immune if you're gonna treat all

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:38.350
them immune if you're gonna treat all
 

01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:40.620
them immune if you're gonna treat all
smaller malaria cases you've got to have

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:40.630
smaller malaria cases you've got to have
 

01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:42.330
smaller malaria cases you've got to have
a lot of people out there detecting

01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:42.340
a lot of people out there detecting
 

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.520
a lot of people out there detecting
cases getting them reported and so forth

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:44.530
cases getting them reported and so forth
 

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:46.650
cases getting them reported and so forth
and so the bed nets

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:46.660
and so the bed nets
 

01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:49.770
and so the bed nets
it's a compliance issue and that could

01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:49.780
it's a compliance issue and that could
 

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.840
it's a compliance issue and that could
be better but isn't it gonna really do

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:51.850
be better but isn't it gonna really do
 

01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:55.050
be better but isn't it gonna really do
it well mosquitoes are biting outside of

01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:55.060
it well mosquitoes are biting outside of
 

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.030
it well mosquitoes are biting outside of
the time that you're under the down to

01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040
the time that you're under the down to
 

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.670
the time that you're under the down to
the bed net so I think there are several

01:22:59.670 --> 01:22:59.680
the bed net so I think there are several
 

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.620
the bed net so I think there are several
ways I think there's a multi-pronged

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:01.630
ways I think there's a multi-pronged
 

01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:05.520
ways I think there's a multi-pronged
attack and I I think we get a malaria

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:05.530
attack and I I think we get a malaria
 

01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:09.120
attack and I I think we get a malaria
vaccine which I hope we can then I think

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:09.130
vaccine which I hope we can then I think
 

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:10.950
vaccine which I hope we can then I think
the malaria eradication we were is

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960
the malaria eradication we were is
 

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.850
the malaria eradication we were is
realistic

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:11.860
realistic
 

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.700
realistic
I think they now talking I think that

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:14.710
I think they now talking I think that
 

01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:17.340
I think they now talking I think that
many that people talk about 30-40 years

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:17.350
many that people talk about 30-40 years
 

01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:20.400
many that people talk about 30-40 years
maybe necessary before we get there but

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:20.410
maybe necessary before we get there but
 

01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:22.470
maybe necessary before we get there but
that's not bad to have the goal out here

01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480
that's not bad to have the goal out here
 

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.000
that's not bad to have the goal out here
because I think what it's saying is

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:24.010
because I think what it's saying is
 

01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:26.700
because I think what it's saying is
let's look at the strategy of how best

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:26.710
let's look at the strategy of how best
 

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:30.180
let's look at the strategy of how best
to address the disease and but let's

of the vector borne diseases is trying
 

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:21.420
of the vector borne diseases is trying
to do away with a vector which is very

to do away with a vector which is very
 

01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:24.780
to do away with a vector which is very
difficult and vectors seem to have a

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:24.790
difficult and vectors seem to have a
 

01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:30.120

capacity to mutate and change and become
 

01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:34.440

escape whatever you're trying to apply
 

01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:40.260
escape whatever you're trying to apply
it's also difficult because you've

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:40.270
it's also difficult because you've
 

01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:42.990
it's also difficult because you've
really got vectors multiplying in all

something about vectors very widely it
 

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.660
something about vectors very widely it
is really very difficult very expensive

it's really one of the problems so that

it's really one of the problems so that

you get with it and at what cost and so

01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:14.140
you get with it and at what cost and so
 

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.580
you get with it and at what cost and so
much of what we're driven by is cost for

much of what we're driven by is cost for
developing countries is this is at the

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:21.010
developing countries is this is at the
 

01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.400
developing countries is this is at the
moment we're looking at the question of

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:23.410
moment we're looking at the question of
 

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:27.390
moment we're looking at the question of
a vaccine which cost 50 cents a person

01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400
a vaccine which cost 50 cents a person
 

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.600
a vaccine which cost 50 cents a person
and this is really felt to be breakpoint

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:30.610
and this is really felt to be breakpoint
 

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:32.850
and this is really felt to be breakpoint
but if it's any more than 50 cents per

could you produce some rapidly at a
 

01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:15.570
could you produce some rapidly at a
large scale and and I think there's a

01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:15.580
large scale and and I think there's a
 

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.930

couple of laboratories have some ideas
on this they actually are producing

something that look like a very heat
stable and this would make a big

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:24.730
stable and this would make a big
 

01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:27.660

difference if you just put on a patch a
 

01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:31.440

doing things by mouth of course this
 

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:45.750
doing things by mouth of course this
would be a big advantage but that's also

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760
would be a big advantage but that's also
 

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.060
would be a big advantage but that's also
been difficult but at least people are

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:48.070
been difficult but at least people are
