00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.060
The bacteria that live inside you shape who
you are on a pretty fundamental level--from

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.279
your psychology to your body type.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.660
But new research also indicates that the billions
and even trillions of tiny creatures in your

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.760
body play a major role in the way you react
to medical treatments...making your microbial

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.780
ecosystem a literal matter of life and death.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.730
Yeah, hi, it’s me, your favorite microbe
geek here.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.750
As we discover more and more about how the
bacteria inside us influence our lives and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.420
our health, we also discover more places where
this relationship is really important--and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.510
one of these areas is cancer.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.410
Yup, it turns out that your body’s bacteria
play a HUGE role in how you respond to cancer

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.310
and its treatment...and they could hold the
key to the future of how we treat this disease.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.100
In the last few decades, one promising way
we’ve started treating cancer is called

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.100
immunotherapy.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.600
It activates the body’s own immune system
to identify and attack cancerous cells.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.630
Scientists have been puzzled about why immunotherapy
works so well in some patients, while in others

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.329
it has little effect.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.460
And three recent studies indicate that it’s
likely the patient’s bacterial populations

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.710
that are the game-changer.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.079
Researchers divided patient gut bacteria into
the categories ‘good’ and ‘bad’, and

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.850
patients with more good bacteria were the
ones who responded well to treatment with

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.170
immunotherapy--their tumors stopped growing
or even shrank.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.600
Researchers then went on to demonstrate in
mouse models that treating cancer patients

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.630
with a cocktail of the ‘good’ bacteria
improved their response to the immunotherapy.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.289
The theory goes that our microbiome is intricately
linked to our immune system.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.850
Bad bacteria seem to inhibit our immune system’s
proper functioning, while good bacteria help

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.090
prep immune cells to be on the lookout for
foreign bodies, like tumors.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.869
And we’re still unraveling how all these
relationships work.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.340
Immunotherapy is just the beginning.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.229
It’s been demonstrated that bacteria can
also be used directly to kill tumors.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.990
As in, you can inject bacteria into a tumor
area and watch as they grow to literally suffocate

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.909
and starve the tumor, because they’re eating
everything the tumor needs to grow.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.859
It’s called bacteria mediated tumor therapy,
and it’s surprisingly effective...but perhaps

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.459
not-so surprisingly, you do then have the
problem of a potentially dangerous bacterial

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.129
infection that you now need to treat.

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.510
Balancing that is tricky and has hindered
the progress--and popularity-- of this treatment

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.510
method.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.510
7.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.650
Bacteria also tend to produce something called
a biofilm, which is one of my favorite bacterial

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.650
behaviors.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.930
When there’s a certain number of bacteria,
called a quorum, they start to bind together,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.219
forming a mass of cells that behaves more
like a single unit than like individual bacteria.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.790
Some research shows that biofilm formation
actively disrupts and blocks tumor metastasis,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.720
suggesting it could be useful in stopping
the spread of cancer while the patient goes

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.010
through treatment.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.189
And it doesn’t stop there.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.620
Bacteria can also be genetically engineered
to detect cancer’s movements--a probiotic

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.800
form of E. coli, for example, can be taken
by a patient whose subsequent urine output

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.630
will indicate whether their cancer has metastasized
to their liver--because of the way their body

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.209
processed that bacteria.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.230
As living breathing organisms themselves,
bacteria are constantly producing lots of

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.909
enzymes and proteins and hormone-like chemicals,
to communicate with each other, to help them

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.010
eat stuff, to generally just help them live
their little lives.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.370
Some bacteria produce toxins that help them
kill whatever wants to eat them, and in some

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.299
cases, this protein--called a bacteriocin--can
also be toxic to cancer cells.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.760
It can be used to aid the effect of certain
cancer drugs, or on its own to tackle tumors

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.269
in a huge variety of cancers.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.950
And even aside from being used directly, bacteria
can be modified to carry targeted cancer treatment

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.939
to the necessary tissues.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.879
But while our invisible, microscopic friends
can help us in the face of this disease, they

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.670
can actively hinder us, too.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.260
A seminal study revealed that in some patients
who didn’t respond well to chemotherapy,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.000
bacteria inside their tumors disable those
drugs to protect themselves, meaning the drugs

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.510
can’t do any damage against the tumor either.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.499
This discovery was actually a pretty huge
revelation in our understanding of why some

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:03.099
peoples’ systems react to cancer treatment
so differently.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.920
And it brings up the question: antibiotics?

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.260
Or no?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.530
Obviously we don’t want bacteria that neutralize
our cancer drugs, but can we get rid of them

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.250
while also keeping the ‘good’ bacteria
that help our immune system?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.200
Not to mention the potential risk of accidentally
creating cancer-drug-killing bacteria that

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.820
then become antibiotic resistant, which would
be no bueno for anybody.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.230
This field is so.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.230
exciting.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.030
And we’re only just beginning to understand
and take advantage of it.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.310
This basically opens up a whole new dimension
in personalized medicine and could give us

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.530
a much more detailed understanding of the
diseases that plague us, and how to treat

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.530
them.

If you think bacteria are as cool as I do
then check out my other video on how your

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.660
gut microbes are controlling your mind.

And fun fact?

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.480
One of the most prevalent ‘good’ bacteria
that doctors found in patients who responded

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.040
well to treatment is called Bifidobacterium
longum.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.910
