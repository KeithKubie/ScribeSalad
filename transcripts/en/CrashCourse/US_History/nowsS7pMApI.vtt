Episode 21: Reconstruction

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.270
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. History and huzzah!

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.100
The Civil War is over!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.700
The slaves are free!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.700
Huzzah!

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.700
That one hit me in the head?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.260
It’s very dangerous, Crash Course.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.710
So when you say, “Don’t aim at a person,”
that includes myself?

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.579
The roller coaster only goes up from here,
my friends.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.579
Huzzah!

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.420
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what about the epic
failure of Reconstruction?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.650
Oh, right.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:34.739
Stupid Reconstruction always ruining everything
intro

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.550
So after the Civil War ended, the United States
had to reintegrate both a formerly slave population

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.109
and a formerly rebellious population back
into the country, which is a challenge that

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.290
we might’ve met, except Abraham Lincoln
was assassinated and we were left with Andrew

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.140
“I am the Third Worst President Ever”
Johnson.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.589
I’m sorry, Abe, but you don’t get to be
in the show anymore.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.179
So, Lincoln’s whole post-war idea was to
facilitate reunion and reconciliation, and

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.019
Andrew Johnson’s guiding Reconstruction
principle was that the South never had a right

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.640
to secede in the first place.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.659
Also, because he was himself a Southerner,
he resented all the elites in the South who

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.490
had snubbed him, AND he was also a racist
who didn’t think that blacks should have

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.140
any role in Reconstruction.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.140
TRIFECTA!

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.920
So between 1865 and 1867, the so-called period
of Presidential Reconstruction, Johnson appointed

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.840
provisional governors and ordered them to
call state conventions to establish new all-white

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.860
governments.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.040
And in their 100% whiteness and oppression
of former slaves, those new governments looked

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.390
suspiciously like the old confederate governments
they had replaced.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.850
And what was changing for the former slaves?

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.399
Well, in some ways, a lot.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.420
Like, Fiske and Howard universities were established,
as well as many primary and secondary schools,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.530
thanks in part to The Freedman’s Bureau,
which only lasted until 1870, but had the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.090
power to divide up confiscated and abandoned
confederate land for former slaves.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.079
And this was very important because to most
slaves, land ownership was the key to freedom,

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.990
and many felt like they’d been promised
land by the Union Army.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.460
Like, General Sherman’s Field Order 15,
promised to distribute land in 40 acre plots

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.460
to former slaves.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.810
But that didn’t happen, either through the
Freedman’s Bureau or anywhere else.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.149
Instead, President Johnson ordered all land
returned to its former owners.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.990
So the South remained largely agricultural
with the same people owning the same land,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.350
and in the end, we ended up with sharecropping.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.350
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.170
The system of sharecropping replaced slavery
in many places throughout the South.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.860
Landowners would provide housing to the sharecroppers--no,
Thought Bubble, not quite that nice.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.490
There ya go--also tools and seed, and then
the sharecroppers received, get this, a share

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.310
of their crop--usually between a third and
a half, with the price for that harvest often

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.740
set by the landowner.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.610
Freed blacks got to control their work, and
plantation owners got a steady workforce that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.500
couldn’t easily leave, because they had
little opportunity to save money and make

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.630
the big capital investments in, like, land
or tools.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.020
By the late 1860s, poor white farmers were
sharecropping as well--in fact, by the Great

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.540
Depression, most sharecroppers were white.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.890
And while sharecropping certainly wasn’t
slavery, it did result in a quasi-serfdom

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.760
that tied workers to land they didn’t own--more
or less the opposite of Jefferson’s ideal

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.450
of the small, independent farmer.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.400
So, the Republicans in Congress weren’t
happy that this reconstructed south looked

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.730
so much like the pre-Civil War south, so they
took the lead in reconstruction after 1867.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.870
Radical Republicans felt the war had been
fought for equal rights and wanted to see

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.290
the powers of the national government expanded.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.090
Few were as radical as Thaddeus “Tommy Lee
Jones” Stephens who wanted to take away

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.290
land from the Southern planters and give it
to the former slaves, but rank-and-file Republicans

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.650
were radical enough to pass the Civil Rights
Bill, which defined persons born in the United

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.790
States as citizens and established nationwide
equality before the law regardless of race.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.840
Andrew Johnson immediately vetoed the law,
claiming that trying to protect the rights

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.100
of African Americans amounted to discrimination
against white people, which so infuriated

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.140
Republicans that Congress did something it
had never done before in all of American history.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.660
They overrode the Presidential veto with a
2/3rds majority and the Civil Rights Act became

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.660
law.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.550
So then Congress really had its dander up
and decided to amend the Constitution with

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.260
the 14th amendment, which defines citizenship,
guarantees equal protection, and extends the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.720
rights in the Bill of Rights to all the states
(sort of).

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.510
The amendment had almost no Democratic support,
but it also didn’t need any, because there

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.910
were almost no Democrats in Congress on account
of how Congress had refused to seat the representatives

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.990
from the “new” all-white governments that
Johnson supported.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.569
And that’s how we got the 14th amendment,
arguably the most important in the whole Constitution.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.569
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.500
Oh, straight to the mystery document today?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500
Alright.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.250
The rules here are simple.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.849
I guess the author of the Mystery Document
and try not to get shocked.

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.979
Alright let’s see what we’ve got today.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.979
Sec. 1.

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.310
Be it ordained by the police jury of the parish
of St. Landry, That no negro shall be allowed

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.500
to pass within the limits of said parish without
special permit in writing from his employer.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.000
Sec. 4.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.389
. . . Every negro is required to be in the
regular service of some white person, or former

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.830
owner, who shall be held responsible for the
conduct of said negro..

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.030
Sec. 6.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.509
. . . No negro shall be permitted to preach,
exhort, or otherwise declaim to congregations

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.581
of colored people, without a special permission
in writing from the president of the police

00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:01.581
jury.

00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:03.080
. . .
Gee, Stan, I wonder if the President of the

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.080
Police Jury was white.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.259
I actually know this one.

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.800
It is a Black Code, which was basically legal
codes where they just replaced the word “slave”

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800
with the word “negro.”

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.020
And this code shows just how unwilling white
governments were to ensure the rights of new,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.020
free citizens.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.350
I would celebrate not getting shocked, but
now I am depressed.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.419
So, okay, in 1867, again over Johnson’s
veto, Congress passed the Reconstruction Act,

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.639
which divided the south into 5 military districts
and required each state to create a new government,

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.090
one that included participation of black men.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.870
Those new governments had to ratify the 14th
amendment if they wanted to get back into

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.069
the union.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.499
Radical Reconstruction had begun.

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:42.729
So, in 1868, Andrew Johnson was about as electable
in the U.S. as Jefferson Davis, and sure enough

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.160
he didn’t win.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.990
Instead, the 1868 election was won by Republican
and former Union general Ulysses S. Grant.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.249
But Grant’s margin of victory was small
enough that Republicans were like, “Man,

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.870
we would sure win more elections if black
people could vote.”

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.130
Which is something you hear Republicans say
all the time these days.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.129
So Congressional Republicans pushed the 15th
Amendment, which prohibited states from denying

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.389
men the right to vote based on race, but not
based on gender or literacy or whether your

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:07.620
grandfather could vote.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.629
So states ended up with a lot of leeway when
it came to denying the franchise to African

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:12.919
Americans, which of course they did.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.230
So here we have the federal government dictating
who can vote, and who is and isn’t a citizen

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.840
of a state, and establishing equality under
the law--even local laws.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.979
And this is a really big deal in American
history, because the national government became,

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.080
rather than a threat to individual liberty,
“the custodian of freedom,” as Radical

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.310
Republican Charles Sumner put it.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.939
So but with this legal protection, former
slaves began to exercise their rights.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:39.770
They participated in the political process
by direct action, such as staging sit-ins

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.740
to integrate street-cars, by voting in elections,
and by holding office.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.990
Most African Americans were Republicans at
the time, and because they could vote and

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.349
were a large part of the population, the Republican
party came to dominate politics in the South,

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.530
just like today, except totally different.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.330
Now, Southern mythology about the age of radical
Reconstruction is exemplified by Gone with

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.810
the Wind, which of course tells the story
of northern Republican dominance and corruption

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.060
by southern Republicans.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.340
Fortune seeking northern carpetbaggers, seen
here, as well as southern turncoat scalawags

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.680
dominated politics and all of the African
American elected leaders were either corrupt

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.059
or puppets or both.

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:15.849
Yeah, well, like the rest of Gone with the
Wind, that’s a bit of an oversimplification.

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.710
There were about 2,000 African Americans who
held office during Reconstruction, and the

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.070
vast majority of them were not corrupt.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:28.620
Consider for example the not-corrupt and amazingly-named
Pinckney B.S. Pinchback, who from 1872 to

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.719
1873 served very briefly in Louisiana as America’s
first black governor.

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:35.749
And went on to be a senator and a member of
the House of Representatives.

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:40.439
By the way, America’s second African American
governor, Douglas Wilder of Virginia was elected

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.689
in 1989.

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:45.699
Having African American officeholders was
a huge step forward in term of ensuring the

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.900
rights of African Americans because it meant
that there would be black juries and less

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.910
discrimination in state and local governments
when it came to providing basic services.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.639
But in the end, Republican governments failed
in the South.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.789
There were important achievements, especially
a school system that, while segregated, did

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:01.969
attempt to educate both black and white children.

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:05.600
And even more importantly, they created a
functioning government where both white and

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.849
African American citizens could participate.

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:11.729
According to one white South Carolina lawyer,
“We have gone through one of the most remarkable

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.779
changes in our relations to each other that
has been known, perhaps, in the history of

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:16.779
the world.”

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.940
That’s a little hyperbolic, but we are America
after all.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.129
(libertage)
It’s true that corruption was widespread,

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:26.129
but it was in the North, too.

00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:27.900
I mean, we’re talking about governments.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.110
And that’s not why Reconstruction really
ended: It ended because 1.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.810
things like schools and road repair cost money,
which meant taxes, which made Republican governments

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:40.080
very unpopular because Americans hate taxes,
and 2.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.700
White southerners could not accept African
Americans exercising basic civil rights, holding

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.020
office or voting.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.040
And for many, the best way to return things
to the way they were before reconstruction

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.400
was through violence.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.760
Especially after 1867, much of the violence
directed toward African Americans in the South

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.100
was politically motivated.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.430
The Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1866 and it
quickly became a terrorist organization, targeting

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.160
Republicans, both black and white, beating
and murdering men and women in order to intimidate

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.620
them and keep them from voting.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.960
The worst act of violence was probably the
massacre at Colfax, Louisiana where hundreds

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.590
of former slaves were murdered.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.210
And between intimidation and emerging discriminatory
voting laws, fewer black men voted, which

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.240
allowed white Democrats to take control of
state governments in the south, and returned

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.930
white Democratic congressional delegations
to Washington.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.870
These white southern politicians called themselves
“Redeemers” because they claimed to have

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.650
redeemed the south from northern republican
corruption and black rule.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.100
Now, it’s likely that the South would have
fallen back into Democratic hands eventually,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.260
but the process was aided by Northern Republicans
losing interest in Reconstruction.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.750
In 1873, the U.S. fell into yet another not-quite-Great
economic depression and northerners lost the

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.840
stomach to fight for the rights of black people
in the south, which in addition to being hard

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.930
was expensive.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:57.100
So by 1876 the supporters of reconstruction
were in full retreat and the Democrats were

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.040
resurgent, especially in the south.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.650
And this set up one of the most contentious
elections in American history.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.140
The Democrats nominated New York Governor
(and NYU Law School graduate) Samuel Tilden.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.210
The Republicans chose Ohio governor (and Kenyon
College alumnus) Rutherford B. Hayes.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.330
One man who’d gone to Crash Course writer
Raoul Meyer’s law school.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.790
And another who’d gone to my college, Kenyon.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.370
Now, if the election had been based on facial
hair, as elections should be, there would’ve

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.370
been no controversy, but sadly we have an
electoral college here in the United States,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:30.380
and in 1876 there were disputed electoral
votes in South Carolina, Louisiana, and, of

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.380
course, Florida.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.870
Now you might remember that in these situations,
there is a constitutional provision that says

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:40.030
Congress should decide the winner, but Congress,
shockingly, proved unable to accomplish something.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.840
So they appointed a 15 man Electoral Commission--a
Super-Committee, if you will.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.350
And there were 8 Republicans on that committee
and 7 Democrats, so you will never guess who

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.350
won.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.470
Kenyon College’s own Rutherford B. Hayes.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.600
Go Lords and Ladies!

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.690
And yes, that is our mascot.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.690
Shut up.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.060
Anyway in order to get the Presidency and
win the support of the supercommittee, Hayes’

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.870
people agreed to cede control of the South
to the Democrats and to stop meddling in Southern

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.570
affairs and also to build a transcontinental
railroad through Texas.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.260
This is called the Bargain of 1877 because
historians are so good at naming things and

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.380
it basically killed Reconstruction.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.930
Without any more federal troops in Southern
states and with control of Southern legislatures

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.700
firmly in the hands of white democrats the
states were free to go back to restricting

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.360
the freedom of black people, which they did.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.320
Legislatures passed Jim Crow laws that limited
African American’s access to public accommodations

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.620
and legal protections.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.520
States passed laws that took away black people’s
right to vote and social and economic mobility

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.660
among African Americans in the south declined
precipitously.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.680
However, for a brief moment, the United States
was more democratic than it had ever been

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
before.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.660
And an entire segment of the population that
had no impact on politics before was now allowed

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.680
to participate.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.270
And for the freedmen who lived through it,
that was a monumental change, and it would

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.860
echo down to the Civil Rights movement in
the 1950s and 1960s, sometimes called the

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.860
second reconstruction.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.320
But we’re gonna end this episode on a downer,
as we are wont to do here at Crash Course

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.750
US History because I want to point out a lesser-known
legacy of Reconstruction.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.540
The Reconstruction amendments and laws that
were passed granted former slaves political

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.570
freedom and rights, especially the vote, and
that was critical.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.320
But to give them what they really wanted and
needed, plots of land that would make them

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.090
economically independent, would have required
confiscation, and that violation of property

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.400
rights was too much for all but the most radical
Republicans.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.100
And that question of what it really means
to be “free” in a system of free market

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.010
capitalism has proven very complicated indeed.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.130
I’ll see you next week.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.021
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:33.900
Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.330
The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.440
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.090
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.080
Every week there’s a new caption for the
libertage.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.250
You can suggest those in comments where you
can also ask questions about today’s video

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.100
that will be answered by our team of historians.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.310
