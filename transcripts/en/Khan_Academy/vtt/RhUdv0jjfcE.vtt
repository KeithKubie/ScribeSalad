00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's say we're going to
shoot some object into

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.220
the air at an angle.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.075
Let's say its speed is s and
the angle at which we shoot

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:14.090
it, the angle above the
horizontal is theta.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.780
What I want to do in this video
is figure out how far

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.990
this object is going to travel
as a function of the angle and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.770
as a function of the speed, but
we're going to assume that

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.590
we're given the speed.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.250
That that's a bit
of a constant.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.120
So if this is the ground right
here, we want to figure out

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.920
how far this thing is
going to travel.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.800
So you can imagine, it's going
to travel in this parabolic

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.050
path and land at some
point out there.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.000
And so if this is at distance 0,
we could call this distance

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.950
out here distance d.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.090
Now whenever you do any problem
like this where you're

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.750
shooting something off at an
angle, the best first step is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.640
to break down that vector.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.235
Remember, a vector is something
that has magnitude

00:00:57.235 --> 00:00:58.210
and direction.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.240
The magnitude is s.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.960
Maybe feet per second
or miles per hour.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.459
And the direction is theta.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.820
So if you have s and theta,
you're giving me a vector.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.900
And so what you want to do is
you want to break this vector

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.370
down into its vertical and
horizontal components first

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.700
and then deal with
them separately.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.560
One, to help you figure out how
long you're in the air.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.420
And then, the other to
figure out how far

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.040
you actually travel.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.050
So let me make a big version
of the vector right there.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.590
Once again, the magnitude
of the vector is s.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.970
So you could imagine that the
length of this arrow is s.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.800
And this angle right
here is theta.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.550
And to break it down into its
horizontal and vertical

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.360
components, we just set up a
right triangle and just use

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.770
our basic trig ratios.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.030
So let me do that.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.490
So this is the ground
right there.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.850
I can drop a vertical from the
tip of that arrow to set up a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.100
right triangle.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.560
And the length of the-- or the
magnitude of the vertical

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.910
component of our velocity
is going to be this

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.160
length right here.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930
That is going to be-- you could
imagine, the length of

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.790
that is going to be our
vertical speed.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.590
So this is our vertical speed.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.880
Maybe I'll just call that
the speed sub vertical.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.860
And then, this right here, the
length of this part of the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.160
triangle-- let me do that
in a different color.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.880
The length of this part of the
triangle is going to be our

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.890
horizontal speed, or the
component of this velocity in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.770
the horizontal direction.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.750
And I use this word velocity
when I specify

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.940
a speed and a direction.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.310
Speed is just the magnitude
of the velocity.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.380
So the magnitude of this side
is going to be speed

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.470
horizontal.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.370
And to figure it out,
you literally use

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.280
our basic trig ratios.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.490
So we have a right triangle.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.800
This is the hypotenuse.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.210
And we could write down
soh cah toa up here.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.000
Let me write it down
in yellow.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.880
soh cah toa.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.960
And this tells us that sine is
opposite over hypotenuse,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.680
cosine is adjacent over
hypotenuse and tangent is

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.690
opposite over adjacent.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.690
So let's see what we can do.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.020
We're assuming we know
theta, we know s.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.480
We want to figure out what the
vertical and the horizontal

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.690
components are.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.110
So what's the vertical component
going to be?

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.150
Well the vertical component
is opposite this theta.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.320
But we know the hypotenuse is
s, so we could use sine

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.790
because that deals with the
opposite and the hypotenuse.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.610
And the sine function tells us
that sine of theta-- actually,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.710
let me do this in green since
we're doing all the vertical

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.060
stuff in green.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.560
Sine of theta is going to be
equal to opposite, which is

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.620
the magnitude of our
vertical velocity.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.520
So the opposite side is this
side right here, over our

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.270
hypotenuse.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.430
And our hypotenuse
is the speed s.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.150
And so if we want to solve for
our vertical velocity or the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.310
vertical component of our
velocity, we multiply both

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.250
sides of this equation by s.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.990
So you get s sine of theta
is equal to the vertical

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:27.010
component of our velocity,
s sine of theta.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.450
And now for the horizontal
component we do the same

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.830
thing, but we don't
use sine anymore.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.430
This is now adjacent
to the angle.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.290
So cosine deals with the
adjacent side and the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.140
hypotenuse.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.580
So we could say that the cosine
of theta is equal to

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.790
the adjacent side to the angle,
that is the horizontal

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.560
speed, over the hypotenuse.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.520
The hypotenuse is this length
right here, over s.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.440
So if we want to solve for the
horizontal speed or the

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.550
horizontal component or the
magnitude of the horizontal

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.720
component, we'd just multiply
both sides times s.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.980
And you get s cosine of
theta is equal to

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.970
the horizontal component.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.860
So we now know how fast we are
travelling in this direction,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.860
in the horizontal component.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.140
We know that that is going
to be s cosine of theta.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.200
And we know in the vertical
direction-- let me do that in

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.470
the vertical direction, the
magnitude is s sine of theta.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.560
It is s sine of theta.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.120
So now that we've broken up into
the two components, we're

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.880
ready to figure out how long
we're going to be in the air.
