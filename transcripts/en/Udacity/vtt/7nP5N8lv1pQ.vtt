00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
I'd like to take a slight tangent here, very slight and very brief, and look at

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.748
a number like this, 6 over the quantity 1 minus the root of 2. Now, at first

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:11.726
sight, this may seem completely unrelated to what we were just talking about.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:15.677
But I'd like you to focus on the denominator for a second. The problem that I

00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:20.024
see with this quantity, and the reason that we can't really do anything with

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.578
this fraction right now, is that there's a rational part and an irrational part

00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:28.715
in our denominator. I think in general, numbers are easier to work with the

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:32.759
closer they get toward the center of that world of numbers diagram. So, let's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.480
see if we can make our denominator have only one component, probably just a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.869
rational component instead of an irrational one. So, what number would you need

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:45.419
to multiply the numerator and denominator of this fraction by in order to come

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:50.109
up with an equivalent fraction, where the denominator is a rational number and,

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.877
of course, it's not equal to 0?
