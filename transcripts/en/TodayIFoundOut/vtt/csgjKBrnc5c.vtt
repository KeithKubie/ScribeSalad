00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.359
Few items of fictional clothing are more iconic
and easily recognisable as the ruby slippers

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.789
worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic,
The Wizard of Oz.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.300
Thanks to a combination of human error, poor
record keeping and a sticky fingered ne’er-do-well,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.980
these simple pieces of footwear are now considered
one of the most valuable film props in history.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.510
Figuring out exactly how much the slippers
are worth is no small feat because there are

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.000
currently only four pairs known to exist and
they very rarely appear at auctions.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.660
To make things even more difficult, one of
the pairs was stolen from the Judy Garland

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.880
Museum in Minnesota in 2005, meaning there
are only three pairs currently in existence

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.220
that we know the whereabouts of.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.740
One of these pairs currently resides at a
permanent exhibit in the Smithsonian where

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.170
they’re displayed amongst other treasures
from pop-culture history like one of Mr Rogers’

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.829
sweaters (made by his mother), one of Michael
Jackson’s hats, and one of Tony Hawks’

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:13.829
skateboards.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.369
This particular pair were given to the museum
by an anonymous donor who is believed to have

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.860
bought them in an MGM auction in 1970 for
$15,000 (about $88,000 today).

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.420
A second pair is currently in the possession
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.759
Sciences who acquired them in 2012 when a
collection of Hollywood bigwigs including

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.889
Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Spielberg pooled
their pocket change together to buy them at

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:44.889
auction.

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.799
The price they paid has never been revealed,
but it’s rumored to be around the $3 million

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.950
mark.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.229
The third known pair were purchased by a private
collector called David Elkouby in 2000 from

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.599
an auction at Christie’s for $666,000 (Almost
$1,000,000 today).

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.350
Elkouby has yet to display the slippers and
seemingly has no desire or need to sell them.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.050
The final, stolen pair has been missing since
2005.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.780
However, in the years since, an anonymous
and apparently very wealthy fan of the movie

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.060
has put up a million dollar reward for information
leading to their return.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.970
As for how many pairs of the slippers existed
in the first place, according to the film’s

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.410
producer, Mervyn LeRoy, between 5 and 10 pairs
were made, each sporting slight variations

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.620
to better accommodate the lighting and look
of different sets.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.340
For example, several pairs had a thin layer
of orange felt along the sole to muffle the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.530
sound of steps and dancing.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.320
The pair reserved for close-ups didn’t need
this felt and due to their minimal use, are

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.790
in amazing condition, sporting only slight
scuffs from Garland clicking her heels.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.510
All of the shoes were created by legendary
costume designer Adrian Adolph Greenberg who

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.130
crafted them from plain white pumps that were
dyed a deep shade of red before being coated

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.150
in dark “reddish-orange” fabric, onto
which thousands of sequins and eventually

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.400
a large bow were attached.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.890
Adrian coated the pumps in dark red sequins
instead of bright red ones because the Technicolor

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.080
process would have made bright red shoes look
orange on screen.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.990
Likewise, the sparkling effect seen throughout
the movie was added in post-production using

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.360
optical effects.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.550
For this reason, surviving examples of the
shoes are kind of underwhelming compared to

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.300
how they look on screen.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.530
Speaking of Technicolor, in the original Wizard
of Oz novel, the shoes Dorothy wears are silver.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.140
However, the film’s screenwriter, Noel Langley,
decided to make them bright red to better

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.700
take advantage of Technicolor; he felt that
silver shoes wouldn’t stand out against

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.860
the bright yellow road Dorothy would be standing
on for nearly half of the movie.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.430
Although a great deal of care was put into
making the shoes, after filming wrapped, the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.630
known surviving pairs were shoved into a wardrobe
somewhere deep in MGM’s expansive costume

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.850
department where they remained until the aforementioned
1970s bulk auction.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.870
Seemingly the only person aware of the value
of the shoes was a man called Kent Warner,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.250
an MGM costumer designer who quietly pilfered
hundreds of items from MGM over the years,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.919
including a pair of the ruby slippers which
he took while helping catalogue items for

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.860
the 1970 auction.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.270
Warner kept the best pair of the ruby slippers
for himself, never displaying or sharing them

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.479
with the public until he sold them in 1981
(this is the pair currently believed to be

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.810
in the hands of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences).

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.789
Interestingly, until the 1970 MGM auction,
it was believed that only one copy of the

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.080
shoes existed and they belonged to a woman
called Roberta Bauman who won them by placing

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.919
second in a movie trivia contest in 1949.

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.460
Bauman’s pair is considered to be the least
valuable since they are believed to have belonged

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.499
to Judy Garland’s stunt double, Bobbie Koshay,
who had slightly larger feet.

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:17.949
This is the pair purchased by Mr. Elkouby
in 2000 for $666,000.
