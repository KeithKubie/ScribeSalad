00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.616
So, I want to indicate what the overall purpose of the program was. So, right

00:00:03.616 --> 00:00:06.840
at the top, I'm going ti add a comment that says calculate the number of days

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.283
that Sally Ride lived. Now, I'm going to look at my variables. Seems like in

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:14.847
the context of Sally Ride having lived, the birthday is pretty obviously Sally

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:26.469
Ride's birthday. And the last day is probably Sally Ride's last day. Days alive

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:30.588
would be Sally rides days alive. Seems like that explains most of the lines of

00:00:30.588 --> 00:00:32.029
this program.
