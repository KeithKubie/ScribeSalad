00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.010
HAL BAILEY: Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.100
Thanks for coming to
see Kevin today.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.550
My name's Hal Bailey.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.670
And I met Kevin through
a friend of mine--

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.410
lifelong friend--

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.150
Andrew McDermott, so we should
thank him just as much.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.980
Kevin's here to talk
about climbing and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.930
why it's fun to him--

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.100
essentially the fun scale.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.660
A little background on Kevin--

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.970
he's been climbing for
about 15 years.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.580
He is local to the area.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.930
He's from Santa Rosa.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.150
He started out in a gym and
has sort of made his way

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.220
outside since then, since
he was younger.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.910
And he now climbs all
over the world.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.800
But there's one project
he's been

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.420
working on for four years.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.610
It's in Yosemite called
the Dawn Wall.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.060
It's a sustained 515, it's
about 3,000 feet.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.610
And it's a pretty
intense climb.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.330
The other thing, other than just
being a great climber,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.660
Kevin is also one of
the best climbing

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.200
instructors I've ever met.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.740
He set up some programs.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.010
He set up frameworks and
structure around

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.480
learning how to climb.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.780
And he started a group
called PCI--

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.820
the Pro Climbers Institute?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.430
KEVIN JORGESON: International.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.920
HAL BAILEY: International.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.640
Pro Climbers International,
where he's taken the best

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.200
climbers in the world, who have
the ability and interest

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.680
in teaching, and he's bringing
that to mortals

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.180
like you and me.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.860
Or at least I think most
of you all are mortals.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.410
So anyway, I'll let Kevin
take it from here.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.466
But let's give him
a warm welcome.

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.716
Thanks, Kevin.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.980
KEVIN JORGESON: Thank you.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.770
I'm definitely stoked
to be here.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.770
I've heard a lot about Google.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.470
I visited one time before.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.480
And I think the thing that stood
out to me the most when

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.390
I think about Google is the
culture of this organization

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.790
and this company.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.150
And I love how vital that
culture is when I came to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.680
visit with Hal, and I felt it.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.210
And that's what really led me to
want to share this culture

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.410
of climbing as well, because I
have a feeling they're really

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.040
going to match quite
well together.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.220
So today I have three different
things I want to do.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.840
I want to introduce you guys
both to myself, my sport, if

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.150
you haven't tried climbing
before, and my organization,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.120
Professional Climbers
International.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.580
I want to hopefully inspire
you guys to try climbing

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.650
through some of the adventures
I've been on.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.180
And then the last, I want to
invite you to join me both

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.170
today at 2 o'clock on the Google
Wall for a free clinic.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.020
But then we're also to be doing
some ongoing climbing

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.280
classes on the Google Wall
twice a month January,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.480
February, March.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.100
And we're bringing in some of
the world's best special for

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.800
that clinic series.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.223
So at the end of the talk, we
can take names that are

00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:51.810
interested for that.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.485
You can come climb.

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:54.820
And we can make sure
that everyone wants

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.470
to participate can.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.070
So let's go ahead
and kick off.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.900
My name's Kevin Jorgeson,
again.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.620
And like Hal said, I've been
climbing for 15 years.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.890
And I was born to climb,
I feel like.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.610
I always was climbing
cupboards.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.860
And whenever I would get lost,
my parents would look up

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.760
instead of down or under
things to find me.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.410
So I think it was just
a matter of time

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.390
before I found climbing.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.130
And I found climbing, so to
speak, when I went to an

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.520
outdoor retail shop for the
first time and they had a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.120
climbing wall.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.720
But they wouldn't let me climb
it because I wasn't 16.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.790
Luckily, Vertex Climbing Center
up in Santa Rosa was

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.420
opening shortly thereafter.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.850
And it was all over once
I had been to Vertex.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.700
So this photo is actually from
probably my first ever

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.310
experience with a climbing wall,
aside from that outdoor

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.390
retail shop.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.280
Do you remember [? Morine ?]

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.730
Outfitters up in Santa Rosa?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.520
They were in business before
REI moved next door.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.440
And this was right in
their parking lot.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.120
Definitely stoked.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.440
So over the past 15 years, I've
gone from climbing and

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.650
competing indoors, winning
national championships and

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.550
competing internationally, to
just moving exclusively to

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.640
climbing outside.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.710
And to me, there's nothing
more inspiring than a

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.940
beautiful line.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.110
And when it comes to beautiful
lines, it's really hard to

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.140
compete with El Cap.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.540
Has anyone even been
to Yosemite?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.940
Tell me most of you have been
since we're so close.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.400
If you haven't been, go.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.200
It's less than four hours
from here if you speed.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.450
And it's worth it.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.280
We'll get into what
this project is.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.160
But let's just say that climbing
has taken me many

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.930
amazing places.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.110
And I'm going to share their
journey with you guys.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.130
So a little bit about climbing,
if you haven't

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.930
climbed before.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.840
Can I see who's definitely
climbed--

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.480
rock climbed--

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.780
indoors or outdoors before?

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.660
Oh, then you know.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.080
OK.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.080
So there's a couple different
disciplines, as you're aware.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.970
You can freeze and be at the
danger of avalanches all the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.380
time through mountaineering.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.260
And how, that's your thing,
but not for me, sorry.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.660
You can go sport climbing,
which is fun.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.630
Single or multi-pitch
bolted climbs.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.170
That's the photo in the middle
from Smith Rocks.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.180
Or you can go bouldering, which
is just fun, ropeless,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.890
accessible.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.740
You can do it indoors, you
can do it outdoors.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.170
All you need are shoes, chalk,
and a crash pad.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.180
It's great.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.780
And I think that's one of the
things that draws to me

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.930
climbing so much is that
it is so versatile.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.320
With a slight change in angle
or location, you can find

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.550
yourself still participating
in climbing, but maybe be

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.370
soloing over the ocean in
Majorca, or up on a peak in

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.140
Alaska, or on a boulder
field in Bishop.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.210
It's really versatile to meet
anyone's version of climbing.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.440
So really, it's open to all
participants, which I

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.160
absolutely love.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.670
So three years ago, we started
an organization called

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.370
Professional Climbers
International.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.320
And our goal is to develop and
inspire the next generation.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.030
And we do that through a number
of different programs

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.480
and events.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.570
But one is through large stage
competitions, like the photo

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.070
on the left, but also through
instructional programs like we

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.660
do in schools, here at Google,
and all over the place.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.610
And this happens to be
the same climber.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.970
He's winning the competition
on the left and teaching a

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.750
clinic to adults and kids
in New York last year.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.150
Daniel was here too the day
before yesterday in Sunnyvale

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.140
at Planet Granite, if you
guys have been there.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.730
Myself, Alex Johnson, a two-time
World Cup champion US

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.480
female climber was there,
and so was Daniel.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.990
So that's enough for the
introduction of myself, of

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.710
climbing, of PCI.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.410
I want to dig into the
fun and, to me,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.090
more inspiring part.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.970
So in September 2009,
it was kind of an

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.120
interesting period for me.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.840
In January I'd finished a
lifelong goal-- well, maybe

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.530
not lifelong.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.550
But it was a particular
climb called Ambrosia.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.130
It was this really dangerous,
really tall boulder

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.440
[? prop. ?]

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.420
And I was kind of lost.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.630
If you've ever climbed, do you
ever go through post-send

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.530
depression?

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.670
Or maybe you finish a project
of some kind.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.980
Whatever, it doesn't even
have to be climbing.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.690
You finish it and you're
like, now what do I do?

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.650
And I was having a serious case
of post-send depression

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.575
in September 2009.

00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:34.250
And I didn't know what I
was going to do next.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.940
And as a professional climber,
it's all about pushing

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.230
yourself and having an inspiring
project to look

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.980
forward to and to work on
and progress toward.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.890
And I didn't know where I was
going, which really is not a

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.290
nice place to be.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.500
So in September, I saw the
Reel Rock Film Tour.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.990
And it featured Tommy Caldwell
on the Dawn Wall project.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.310
And it sure looked like
he needed a partner.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.960
So I called him up and I
was like, I'm nothing

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.220
but a pebble wrestler.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.910
You're a big wall climber.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.460
But hey, I would love to help
you out if you would have it.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.450
And he wrote a funny article
recently where he said, what's

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.780
the worst I would get
out of having

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.480
Kevin come for a season?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.000
I get a belay partner, I burn
through him, and then I'll get

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.440
another one.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.030
But on our first day, it was
really clear we climbed really

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.690
well together.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.980
We were having fun.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.070
And that we had forged both a
friendship and a partnership

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:31.390
that was going to last the
duration of this project.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.590
So this is the line that
the Dawn Wall takes.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.970
And every other free climb on
El Cap follows a very clear

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.919
system of cracks.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.059
The majority of the climbs
all across the wall

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.130
are called aid climbs.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.710
And that means you're standing
on and pulling

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.280
on gear as you go.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.750
When you think of climbing,
you're probably picturing free

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.780
climbing-- hands and
feet, you're

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.470
doing the moves yourself.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.530
Free climbing on El
Cap, same thing.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.420
You have the ropes there.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.430
You're not going to
die if you fall.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.330
The Dawn Wall takes the blankest
feature of El Cap and

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.210
tries to climb it.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.440
It's quite the audacious
objective.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.940
And Tommy deserves all the
credit in the world for

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.040
looking at that wall and even

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.790
believing that it was possible.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.180
So without that, there's no way
I would be working on this

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.240
project right now.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.230
So I remember standing in
the meadow on day one

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.610
looking at the wall--

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.730
met him in the meadow
for the first time.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.110
I mean is a childhood
hero of mine.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.170
I have watched him--
he's 33, I'm 28.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.130
So I was literally watching him
in the magazines and the

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.040
videos when I started.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.180
I was like, hey Tommy
how's it going?

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.730
Where does this thing go?

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.270
I mean, the wall is so blank.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.970
There was no obvious place to
go, like with the Nose, or the

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.380
Salathe, or the Zodiac.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.750
All these other climbs have
very clear places to go.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.210
So began the Dawn
Wall Project.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.920
And the thing about climbing--

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.470
oh wait.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.350
TOMMY CALDWELL: Probably
one of the craziest

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.400
dyno I've ever tried.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.360
And it's right in the
middle of El Cap.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.140
So it's sick.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.430
I'm just not the best
dynoer in the world.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.300
But I think somebody
could do it.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.560
When I look at this next
generation of climbers that

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.930
are doing things on the boulders
and the sport climbs

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.570
that I really couldn't conceive
of, if they could

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.630
apply that kind of talent
to the big walls.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.360
And that's what it would take
to free climb this project.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.770
Even if I can't climb this, I
wanted to plant the seed for

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.540
somebody in the future to
come and inspire us all.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.800
KEVIN JORGESON: Now that's a
classic Tommy line, being

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.180
super humble.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.710
Oh, I'm just planting
the seed for someone

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.880
else to come do this.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.140
Tommy's going to climb
this thing.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.500
And I hope to be on that
team with him.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.760
There's nothing that's going
to stop us from seeing it

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.660
through to the end.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.380
But that was the call to action
that I saw in that film

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.620
in September that was like,
well, he's really putting it

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.010
out there to every discipline
within climbing to step up and

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.830
help make this project happen.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.700
Now the thing but a project like
the Dawn Wall is you will

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.620
never, ever do it in a season.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.140
Even if you're Adam Ondra,
who's arguably the best

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.020
climber in the world right
now, you couldn't come to

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.210
Yosemite and do this
thing in a season.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.210
There's a lot that goes into
climbing at a big wall of this

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.270
size and this difficulty.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.830
And inevitably, it's not
all fun as we may

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.310
normally think about it.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.730
So in alpinism, and in climbing,
and I'm sure in

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.580
other industries or sports,
there's this

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.390
idea of the fun scale.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.150
And that definitely applies to
climbing, and the Dawn Wall

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.840
project in particular.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:36.800
And even if it's not as fun as
jumping in a foam pit, you can

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.280
still have actually view
it as a kind of fun.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.420
So I just want to go through
the types of fun.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.710
So type one a simple.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.830
It's what we think of fun.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.630
It's the pure, unqualified,
silly fun--

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.855
foam pits, climbing walls
for the first time.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.040
And in the case of the Dawn
Wall, taking a magic carpet

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.170
ride in 60 mile an hour
updraft winds

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.420
is pretty darn fun.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.830
Tommy didn't want to break down
the portal ledge and then

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.560
reset it up in the wind.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.180
So he just sat on it
and levitated his

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.430
way down the wall.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.020
Or fun is forgetting your can
opener every night, and

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.620
having to use a--

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.720
they call it a pecker, in order
to open your dinner.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.466
No I'm serious, I don't think
we've ever opened a can with a

00:12:43.466 --> 00:12:44.340
can opener on El Cap.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.490
For some reason, we either
forget it or leave it in the

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.140
hall bag at pitch down
or something.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.990
So we're always hoping that we
have our beaks nearby so we

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.240
can eat dinner.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.100
Or you can have type one
in the form of a

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.880
100-foot rope swing.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:58.897
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:58.897 --> 00:13:00.900
KEVIN JORGESON: We'll, last
time I did this is--

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.516
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are you
all clipped in OK?

00:13:02.516 --> 00:13:03.012
KEVIN JORGESON: I think so.

00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:04.262
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.270
This is like a baby
porch swing.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:26.840
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.210
KEVIN JORGESON: Now I don't
know if that's everyone's

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.140
definition of fun.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.400
But to me, that's like
complete type one.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.150
That's just pure bliss.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.910
So you can see there's a lot of
time on the wall that's not

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.530
just spent climbing.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.640
And you kind of have to see the
fun in the entire process

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.800
in order to engage in a project
that's going to last

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.210
three, four, five, six years.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.460
Who knows how long it's
going to take?

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.710
It's been four already.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.720
Can you guys see
our camp here?

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.060
That's our camp that we
were based out of.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.240
That photo was taken less
than a month ago.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.320
We spent October
and November--

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.620
that's kind of the best season
for working on this project.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.240
And that's about maybe
1,000 feet up.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.950
If you know the Nose route,
this is El Cap Tower.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.110
This is Texas Flake.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.020
And then there's the Boot
Flake up higher.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.180
And you can just see how really
blank that section is.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.590
But again, for me, to be in that
kind of position, just

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.740
pasted to the side of the wall,
to be able to wake up

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.430
and make your French press
coffee in the morning is just

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.210
complete type one fun.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.280
Unfortunately--

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.590
well, I don't know, somewhat
fortunately--

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.060
it's not all type one fun.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.630
Either with a project like this,
of that difficulty, or

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.380
for that long.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.880
You kind of have to endure
the whole scale.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.930
So type two is kind
of interesting.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.610
It's not that fun when you're
actually going through it.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:15:00.610
But when you look back on
it, it's pretty fun.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.460
You're in it, you're doing it,
and you're like, this sucks.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.290
And then you look back, it's
kind of like the things that

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.830
make really good story.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.570
You're like, oh, this
is so terrible.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.350
And by 5 o'clock, you're
like, that was so cool.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.830
I did that.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.850
Yeah, no big deal.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.170
Yeah, I was having fun
the whole time.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.700
So terrible in the moment,
taking the tape off of a

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.080
bloody flapper wound after
a day of bouldering.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.800
But fun in retrospect is
realizing that you have a

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.490
heart shaped flapper under that
piece of tape that you'll

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.220
never ever see ever again.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.440
So let's see, what else do
we have for type two fun?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.300
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:41.930
KEVIN JORGESON: It's
10 o'clock.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.522
We just did pitch seven
a couple hours ago.

00:15:45.522 --> 00:15:47.910
And now we're going
to do pitch eight.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.030
But we need a little
pick-me-up.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.560
We just ate dinner.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.810
Kind of ready for a nap.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: So what are
you doing for a little

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:58.890
pick-me-up?

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.250
KEVIN JORGESON: I think I'm
going to take this instant

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:07.515
coffee powder, pour it into my
mouth, swig some water, and

00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:12.400
swallow it instead
of brewing it.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.080
But when I describe it, it
seems like a bad idea.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.920
MALE SPEAKER: You're a
model of laziness.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.190
You even have a stove
right next to you.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.870
KEVIN JORGESON: I'm really
afraid of how much I'm going

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.334
to put in my mouth.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.310
This is the type two
moment right here.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
does it taste?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.630
Is it dissolving?

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.140
Is it warming up?

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.740
Let's see your smile.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.900
Not bad.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.220
KEVIN JORGESON: It's a little
brutal when it firsts hits

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.432
your tongue.

00:16:59.432 --> 00:17:01.360
But when you mix it
up, it kind of

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.040
tastes like cold coffee.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.767
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe you should
stick that packet up to your

00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:09.433
left nostril and just snort
the rest of it.

00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:20.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wait, did you
just do that for real?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.655
KEVIN JORGESON: I'm not going
to snort the instant coffee.

00:17:22.655 --> 00:17:25.619
I'm not that tired.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.399
MALE SPEAKER: It'll hit your
bloodstream faster.

00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:33.310
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.580
KEVIN JORGESON: So that was in
the middle of a week long

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.220
ground up effort in 2010, where
we would start climbing

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.800
around 4 o'clock each day when
the wall went into the shade

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.030
and then climb until
we were too tired.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.860
Because when the wall is in the
sun, it's just simply too

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.630
hot to hang on to the holds,
because they're so small.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.540
A lot of you have climbed.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.780
So you know how important
conditions can be.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.480
And that's one of the biggest
battles on this wall is with

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.190
the conditions.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.990
And some of the best conditions
happen to be in the

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.110
middle the night.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.640
But when you get tired, you've
got to do what you got to do.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.470
And it worked out well.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.726
We did the next pitch that
night and took a rest

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:10.430
day the next day.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.570
All right.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.060
There's a lot of elements
of this

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.670
project that aren't ideal--

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.070
the conditions that I talked
about with the sun.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.620
Another is that there are
certain sections of the route

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.490
that are just always wet, no
matter what, always wet.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.940
Pitch 10 is one of those.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.980
This wet streak is so big you
can see it from the ground.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.550
It's 100 feet long.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.590
And it happens to be in the
middle of a 5.14 pitch.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.470
So you do a bunch
of lie-backing.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.460
And then the holds don't
get any better.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.770
And the feet don't
get any better.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.170
Everything just turns
to slime.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.590
And there's nothing you can do
except grit your teeth and get

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.950
through it.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.140
And half the time you just
slide right out.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.600
But it's kind of one of those
moments as well, where you're

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.830
getting through it and you're
like, oh this is awful.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.000
But then you zoom out
and you realize, I'm

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.860
climbing a 5.14 wet pitch.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.790
This is so cool.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.570
And then you're like, oh this
is really slippery.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.115
I'm going to fall.

00:19:00.115 --> 00:19:02.125
And you're all gripped, because
the gear's bad.

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:03.700
And if you fall, you're
going to zipper it all

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.980
the way to the belay.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.860
But when you finish the pitch,
that's kind of back to that

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.990
type one feeling.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.660
But you have to get to
the wet stuff in

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.710
order to get the elation.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.860
And to me, type two
is one of the most

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.590
rewarding types of fun.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.190
I really enjoy type two.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.440
And then there's type three.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.750
It's just never fun.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.280
The cool thing about type
three is it makes

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.680
for the best story.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.810
But when you look back on it,
whether it be an injury, or a

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.590
close brush with death, or
something, type three is just

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.810
something that you look back on,
and you just don't want to

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.400
repeat any part of
it whatsoever.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.210
So let's see what we have
for type three.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.880
We talked about conditions.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.580
Sometimes to get the good
conditions you have to wake up

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.710
in terrible hours
of the morning.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.500
And pardon my French for
naming my alarms.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.020
But that's pretty much what it
feels like to wake up at 2:00

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.270
in the morning to go
rock climbing.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:16.290
There's nothing that fun about
lugging an 80 pound load of

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.320
gear to the top of El Cap--

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.940
just going to throw
that out there.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.860
I've done it a lot
of times by now.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.100
I thought, oh maybe it'll
just turn into type two.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.630
Like the runners endorphin,
you get to the

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.870
top, it feels great.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.340
That was the first time
it was type two.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.324
Every time after that,
type three, over it.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.700
That was about one second
of type two.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.570
I don't think I would've reacted
like that if Matt

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.880
didn't start yelling.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.280
I think he just stoked that
I didn't break my legs.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.710
But this was in England
in 2008.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.680
I went on this trip as a
training trip for that

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.430
Ambrosia objective, which
I did that January.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.000
And all of the routes in England
are really sketchy.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.110
Nothing is bolted anywhere
on the gritstone.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.600
It's all trad.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.460
So if there's no cracks,
there's no gear.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.560
And obviously, the gear is
super low on this one.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.670
And this is already kind
of an infamous route.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.730
It's called Gaia.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.600
And if you've seen these
underground climbing movies--

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.500
"Hard Grit"--

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.980
you get to watch someone take
that exact same fall

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.600
but break his leg.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.730
I was like, I really want to
climb Gaia, but I really don't

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:41.570
want to break my leg.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.940
And then sure enough, trying
to onside it, my left foot

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.590
blows, and I nearly
break my legs.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.820
So the good thing
was that, A--

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.610
that's Alex Honnold.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.870
He ran backwards and kept me
from breaking my legs, because

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.890
he pulled in the slack
as I was falling.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.110
And the second thing is, he
moved this crash pad up

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.310
against the arete.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.480
But my heels still struck.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.950
So for the next week I
was walking around--

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.230
I don't know, does an ostrich
walk right on their toes?

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:10.720
But I couldn't step on
my heels for a week.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.620
So then, it was definitely a
moment of type three for me.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.260
Looking back, I have no desire
to do that whatsoever.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.440
But it's good footage,
type three.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.650
That's the nature
of type three.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:28.550
And luckily, I think it's
really special that this

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.510
project has taken so long.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.520
You get to experience all parts
of the success and the

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.440
failure that goes along
the way with working

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.120
something so hard.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.680
The partnership that Tommy and
I have forged over the last

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.280
four years is awesome.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.610
I mean, we balance each
other out really well.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.710
When you're going through
so much challenge, and

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.090
difficulty, and a lot of
physical pain at times, you've

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.920
got to have someone there that
has your back, that can

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.770
complement your weaknesses
and your strengths.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.780
Luckily, Tommy and I balanced
each other out really well.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.930
We may appear a little bored at
times when belaying since

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.050
up at 2:00 in the morning.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.870
But that's all just
part of the game.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.090
And it takes you
amazing places.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.370
You don't get to climb a pitch
like that without going

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.430
through a little type two
fun, and sometimes

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.920
some type three fun.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.160
But in this particular
moment, pure bliss.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.900
And thanks to Jimmy
Chin for capturing

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.290
such an amazing shot.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.070
So everyone always asks, if
you haven't climbed a big

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.950
wall, how do you go to the
bathroom up all a big wall?

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.640
I mean, if I don't tell you now,
you're going to ask me

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:41.970
afterwards.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.110
So I figure I'm just going to
let a video take care it.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.450
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.464
MALE SPEAKER: I love
portaledges.

00:23:47.464 --> 00:23:51.020
I can't tell you how much
I love portaledges.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.540
You just live in them up here.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.040
FEMALE SPEAKER: Why
do you love them?

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.020
MALE SPEAKER: No exposure.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.890
We can hang out in
the middle of the

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.063
blankest wall in the world.

00:24:01.063 --> 00:24:02.880
We're kind of cozy right now.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.700
We could just take a nap.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: What's Kevin
doing over there?

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.610
MALE SPEAKER: Kevin
is urinating in a

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.965
wind-storm right now.

00:24:10.965 --> 00:24:11.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
does that mean?

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.900
MALE SPEAKER: It means he's
probably going to get piss all

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.752
over himself, and us, and the
walls, and anybody within a

00:24:18.752 --> 00:24:20.002
quarter mile radius of us.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: Kevin,
how's it going?

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.950
KEVIN JORGESON: I'll tell
you in a second.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.080
MALE SPEAKER: Love
his technique--

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.330
legs slightly spread.

00:24:31.005 --> 00:24:32.466
Right now he's trying
to dig it out

00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:34.292
from through his harness.

00:24:38.797 --> 00:24:42.230
The wind is blowing him
around a little bit.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.896
FEMALE SPEAKER: You have
cold feet, Kevin?

00:24:44.896 --> 00:24:46.848
Oh, there it goes.

00:24:46.848 --> 00:24:52.540
The little raindrops flying
upwards, like dancing.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.535
MALE SPEAKER: He is somewhat
experienced in that he's going

00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:56.300
with the wind.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.090
Because if he was going against
the wind right now, he

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.102
would be getting so wet.

00:25:00.102 --> 00:25:01.352
KEVIN JORGESON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.863
This isn't embarrassing
at all.

00:25:07.863 --> 00:25:09.342
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
leg and your foot?

00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:12.300
Looks like you're peeing right
on your leg right now.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.550
KEVIN JORGESON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:16.737 --> 00:25:18.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
did he just say?

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.058
MALE SPEAKER: He said that was
the cleanest wind pee ever.

00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:22.370
That's what he said.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.570
The only certain [? people ?]

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.910
[? on the nose. ?]

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: Kevin got
[INAUDIBLE] by a lot.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.940
That whole ledge, I bet,
just got hammered.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:33.900
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.150
KEVIN JORGESON: Well,
there you go.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.990
That adage is true through.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.510
If at first you don't succeed,
you definitely

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.700
have to try, try again.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.780
And it's interesting to
experience the evolution of

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.280
this project over the
last four years.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.370
Year one, my eyes were just
completely opened to how

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.180
challenging this
objective was.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.590
We didn't even know where
the route was going

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.200
to go at that stage.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.710
Year two, we knew where
everything went.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.990
Where we had to add bolts,
we added bolts.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.900
We knew what gear we needed.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.860
And we also knew it was just
way over our heads.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.240
Year three, we gave it a
good ground up effort.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.460
I got an injury that set back.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.340
And then this year, we focused
all of our effort two months

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.200
on two pitches, on the crux
pitches, the crux 400 feet.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.420
And we made a lot of little
micro beta breakthroughs, like

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.990
little sequence changes
here and there

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.170
to help us get through.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:37.920
And it's funny, the littlest
change in your sequence can

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.990
open up all kinds
of confidence to

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.750
your chances of success.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.720
But if we had only tried it
for two years or for three

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.160
years, it would still feel
completely impossible.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.800
So I'll be the first to admit
that there are times in this

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.050
project where it just feels like
I'm trying for no reason,

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.590
that this thing is so hard, and
there's no way that it's

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.080
ever going to happen.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.350
By still just trusting that by
chipping away, it's going to

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.790
become more feasible.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.420
You are getting stronger, you
are getting more tuned in to

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.450
the root, that it will happen.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:18.370
And now for the first time,
I feel confidence in our

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.730
chances, to be honest.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:26.140
I mean, we wouldn't be trying
this route for this long if we

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.790
didn't enjoy type one through
three that goes along with

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.550
this route.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.260
And that was enough.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.990
But now it almost feels
like, wow, we can

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.440
actually do this thing.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.880
So that's been a
really exciting

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.260
process to go through.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.660
And if you're in the middle of
anything like that yourself,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.410
some multi-year epic project,
I encourage you to just keep

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.760
going, because there's light
at the end of the

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.660
tunnel, if you will.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.560
And your skills hone in.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.730
I'm sure you've all been through
it, no matter what, as

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.140
far as taking on something
that you have no business

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.460
doing, but then doing
it one day.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.240
And we haven't even done
this thing yet.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.350
And we'll be back next year.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.432
I'm going to go in the
spring, and I'm going

00:28:09.432 --> 00:28:10.120
to go in the fall.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.780
And we're going to keep doing
that until we send.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:18.640
But without that process, and
without accepting that fun

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.300
isn't always type one fun, it's
not always type two fun,

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.457
you kind of have to accept some
days it's just going to

00:28:23.457 --> 00:28:24.810
suck, and it's not going
to be fun at all.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.470
But really, it's worth it.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.470
It makes for good stories that
I can share with you guys and

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:33.650
hopefully talk you into coming
climbing with me, and yeah.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:38.060
So what I would definitely like
to do is introduce all of

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.500
you and anyone you know within
Google to come climbing with

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.540
us in January, February,
and March.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.080
Twice a month for those three
months, we're going to have

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.320
some of the world's top climbers
on your climbing

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.550
wall, introducing you guys to
climbing, if you haven't done

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.290
it before, and helping hone
your mental strength, your

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:02.140
technical abilities, and your
physical training on the

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:02.770
Google Wall.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:06.660
And then my goal from there is
to have gathered up all those

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.650
interested in climbing and who
already climb that work at

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.040
Google and do even more cool
stuff, whether that's outdoor

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.850
trips or doing meet-ups at the
local climbing gyms, of which

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.150
there are a ton here
in the Bay Area.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.520
And all of this starts
today at 2 o'clock on

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.520
the climbing wall.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.460
So we brought harnesses
and shoes.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.950
No experience, no equipment
necessary.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.060
Just come hang out for an hour
and a half and try it.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.900
I encourage you just
to come try.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.100
And if nothing else, you'll
have some type two fun at

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.010
worst, which will make for
a good story, which isn't

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.700
a bad way to go.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.780
So it's win-win,
no matter what.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:50.050
So I have a couple of fliers,
if anyone wants to take a

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.970
little reminder for the clinic
series that's going to start

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.260
in January.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.830
Otherwise, come find me after
the talk or at the wall.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.710
And we can make sure that we
stay in touch so that we get

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.075
to climb together from
here on out.

00:30:03.075 --> 00:30:04.450
And at this point,
if you have any

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.630
questions, please fire away.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.040
AUDIENCE: So you're working
on this project.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.210
And I'm not quite sure
how it goes.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.870
But you accumulate a lot of
knowledge over four years.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.810
What happens if your partner
decides he wants to go and do

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.470
something else?

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.270
KEVIN JORGESON: I was talking
earlier about the strengths

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.780
and weaknesses of
our partnership.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.730
And for me, I bring a lock tight
memory when it comes to

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.100
sequences and gear
and all the rest.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.770
But I also back that up with
meticulous lists of actual

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:49.070
sequences, the list of gear that
we need, start to finish

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.540
on every single pitch.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.490
That and this thing has been
documented by really talented

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.830
videographers from Big UP
Productions and Sender Films

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:58.990
for that Reel Rock film tour.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.620
So it's great.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.970
We actually have a video
catalog, if you will, of some

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.590
of the pitches.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.690
So if it really came to it, we
could go back to those and

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.640
look at it.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.640
But the nature of climbing--

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.800
Tommy's been climbing since he
was five, I've been climbing

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.170
since I was 12--

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:18.050
your body really remembers the
movement in and of itself at

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:18.890
this stage.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:23.020
So after climbing on the pitches
for that long, it

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.520
really takes no time to get
up and running again.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.570
Yeah.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.280
Of course.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.930
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like
you've made a number of

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.630
attempts in this wall.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.185
What happens in the moment when
you decide that one of

00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:40.680
your attempts is over and
you're headed back down?

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.320
KEVIN JORGESON: We're
pretty stubborn.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.520
Again, coming back to
that balance thing.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.690
Tommy's the utter optimist.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.210
He looks at the Weather
Channel forecast.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.960
I'm not a pessimist,
but I'm a realist.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.810
I look at the Noah forecast.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:32:00.980
And we kind of balanced each
other out a little bit.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.950
Looking at a Doppler radar, like
in 2010, we're watching

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:04.700
this huge storm.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.470
Do you guys remember the amount
of snow and rain we got

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:08.440
a couple years ago?

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.600
It was absolutely insane.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.700
The snow pack was like
250% in Tahoe.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.310
We were on the wall right as
that storm was hitting.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.730
And Tommy's like, I think it's
going to go around us.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.630
I think we should just
stick it out.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.010
We're at the crux pitches.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.720
It's not like we had sent
the crux pitches.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.140
He's just in total denial.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.840
And I'm like, dude, it's
calling for 6 feet

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.300
of snow in 12 hours.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.660
What are you talking about?

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.650
But to answer your question,
we go until the weather

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.450
typically forces us off.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:40.920
So we let some external factor
come decide for us.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.530
Because otherwise we're
just up there.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.290
But I was injured last
year, for example.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.080
And Tommy was up there and
had great weather.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.570
Our winter last year, remember,
was bone dry all the

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.170
way through February.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:58.190
He spent 16 days on the wall
going ground up, and finally

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.790
decided to come down because
he had holes virtually in

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.060
every single one of
his fingertips.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.030
And he'd have to sit up there,
just sit there on the

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.870
portaledge for a week for his
skin to heal to be able to

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.390
grab the holds again.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.670
So for him it was like, all
right, I've been up here for

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:16.160
16 days, just the time
required to heal.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.970
And the chances of doing the
pitch, and the progress he

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.550
wasn't experiencing.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:24.030
He decided that he was going
to wait until next year.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.880
Typically, it's weather.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.520
AUDIENCE: Quick question,
you mentioned injuries.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:29.870
KEVIN JORGESON: Yes.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.450
AUDIENCE: So just curious, when
you were injured, and if

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.270
you are having to sit out for
awhile, how did you stay

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.650
motivated while you
couldn't climb?

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.360
And what did you learn on the
way back when you were trying

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.880
to recover?

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.990
KEVIN JORGESON: After climbing
for 15 years, you have a lot

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.180
of natural ebbs and
flows of your

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.830
motivation, I've realized.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.340
And I've realized really
not to fight those.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:56.530
And when I hurt my ankle on the
wall last year, that was

00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:00.780
kind of the start of just a
natural kind of low period in

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.800
my climbing, I felt like.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.480
And so I focused a lot on PCI.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.390
I focused a lot on teaching
and getting

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.520
more athletes involved.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.580
And just kind of balancing out
the other aspects of what I

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.989
love about climbing.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:17.190
Sharing it with others, creating
really good programs

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.100
to get other people into it.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.199
And really not to force it,
because that's when it's no

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.120
longer part of your passion and
you've turned your passion

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.340
into a job.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.730
And I really am conscious
about that balance.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.540
I feel like the most fortunate
guy ever to be able to make a

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.550
living doing what I
absolutely love.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.330
I don't want to be doing
anything else.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:42.580
But as soon as I start forcing,
I feel like, climbing

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.969
when I'm not motivated or
working when I'm not

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:47.989
motivated, then it
kind of ruins it.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:49.239
Yeah.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.940
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering,
how much time you spend in the

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.620
gym doing cardio or
weight training?

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.440
Or are you always on
the wall climbing?

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.810
KEVIN JORGESON: You know, the
adage goes that the best

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.960
training for climbing
is climbing.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.280
But with a project like this,
I've reluctantly had to accept

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.610
that I need to do more
than just climb.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.880
And getting off the
wall this year--

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.710
I hate stretching.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.552
I can't even touch--

00:35:12.552 --> 00:35:14.300
[STRAINING]

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.600
KEVIN JORGESON: I can't do it.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.370
It's embarrassing.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.340
I need to be able to touch my
toes if I stand any chance of

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.160
climbing pitch 12 of the
Dawn Wall-- period.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.410
And I've known that
from day one.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:29.770
But only after this season,
coming off of that little bit

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.620
of progress and that kind of
glimmer that we can do this,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.300
I've started a daily
foam rolling

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.550
and stretching regiment.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.060
Not because I feel
like I have to.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.560
But all of a sudden I want to.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.060
And we do do cardio days.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.640
And I don't do a lot of weight
opposition training.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.820
But I do do antagonistic
muscle training

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.410
to keep things balanced.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:56.990
Because with this project, you
have to be more than just

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.900
climbing fit.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.860
It kind of breaks you down over
the two to three month

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.360
season that you're
in the valley.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.110
So you can't show up
peaked on day one.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.000
You're actually training still,
if you will, in that

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.760
first month that you're there.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.010
So that by the fourth or fifth
week, you're actually peaking.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.940
AUDIENCE: Great talk.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.370
KEVIN JORGESON: Thanks.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.000
AUDIENCE: You said that your
partner spent 16 days on the

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.880
wall ground up.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.910
Is there another way to spend
16 days on the wall, like

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.210
starting somewhere other
than the ground?

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.470
KEVIN JORGESON: Yeah, you can
drop in from the top as well.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.720
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.760
KEVIN JORGESON: Yeah, from
the top of the wall.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.530
So this thing is so difficult.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.790
And looking from the ground,
like I said early on, you

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.440
can't tell where it goes.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.770
This route was discovered
from the top down.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:41.820
The first thing Tommy did was
hike a bunch of rope to the

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.360
top of El Cap, throw it off the
top, and start swinging

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.610
around, literally trying
to connect the

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.440
dots from top to bottom.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.140
Because if we started at the
bottom and just tried to push

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.290
one rope length higher and
higher, not knowing if it's

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.980
free climbable, or this crack
connects to the next crack, we

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.860
would be nowhere near
where we are now.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.850
And we're already
four years in.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:06.310
So the strategy, a lot of times,
is to come in from the

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.070
top to see where things are.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.030
But I would say, no.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.220
No one's going to spend 16 days
on the wall consecutively

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.860
without a purpose.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.000
And if you're just coming
in from the

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.770
top, you're not sending.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:21.800
You're doing a recon trip.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.030
You're working a crux pitch.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:26.220
You're stashing water for
the next attempt.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.870
You're doing logistics
and training.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:32.720
So the pushes that have taken
a really long time, some of

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.250
the historic ones like Warren
Harding on the wall in early

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:35.940
morning light.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.290
He was up there for a month.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.430
He's going up from the ground.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.160
He wants to send.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.500
He doesn't want to bail.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.820
When those kinds of things are
at stake, the realization of

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.850
your project, that's when people
stay for that long.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.010
AUDIENCE: And then you
just mentioned

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:51.280
leaving water behind.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.530
From one season to the next,
what do you guys leave?

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.130
Do you leave anything?

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.300
KEVIN JORGESON: Nothing.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.920
AUDIENCE: Nothing gets left.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.360
So as you're going up the same
pitches over and over again,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.700
you're getting really good at
the lower levels of the game.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.220
And then you try to get to
the advanced level next?

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.350
KEVIN JORGESON: So what we do,
is so now I can tell you every

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:11.550
single move of pitch
one through 18.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:17.670
The crux is in 12, 13,
14, and 15, and 16.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.500
They're all 5.14.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.670
So we feel really confident
about those bottom pitches.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:25.360
And now, a lot of times, what
we do in October is drop in

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.350
from the top and focus our
efforts right on those crux

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:31.850
pitches, because we're confident
about what's below.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.170
And we're confident about
what's above.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:38.140
But if we don't have a clear
game plan for how we're going

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.580
to do those crux pitches, or
have the confidence to be able

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.030
to do it, then you're really
just climbing up from the

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.360
ground into a brick wall.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.880
So it's really important to know
what's coming up and to

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.760
be confident and have the
knowledge necessary to do it.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.690
So that requires some top
down tactics as well.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.160
But we don't leave
anything behind.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.380
When we're working on the route,
we actually have a rope

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.720
fixed top to bottom so
that we can literally

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.250
commute across the wall.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:06.340
In any one day, we may ascend up
the fixed ropes halfway up

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.610
the entire wall, and the next
day climb for 12 hours, then

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:11.980
go back down and have
some pizza.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.820
Or come in from the top and
resupply a camp, because we're

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.950
staying up there two, three
days at a time.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.870
But then when the season's over,
everything comes down.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:27.380
And you have a burly type three
fun set up and take down

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.520
mission at the start and
end of every season.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.840
Yeah, that's where those
80 pound loads come in.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.070
Cool.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.730
Well, if you guys don't have any
other questions, I hope to

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.870
see each and every one of you
at 2 o'clock on the wall.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.400
We'll cycle you all
up it, no problem.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.680
And then we'll add a bunch
more dates to the clinic

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.030
series if you guys
all show up.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.830
But thank you, seriously.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:56.627
[APPLAUSE]
