&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Bam.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.320
Welcome to The Friday Games Review.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, yeah.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.599
Rolling in again.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.599
All right.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.599
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Bam.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.229
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Welcome again, to The Friday Games
Review.

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS All right.

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.660
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm Dan Galpin and with me is Ian
Ni-Lewis.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we're kicking it old school
today.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.120
We decided, we've been doing a lot to bring
the quality of the show up and you know lots

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.140
of new shots...

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.140
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...lots of new effect, lots of
new...

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Low quality today, that's we were
at, man.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.230
Today, we just dragged out the bar table,
we got the beers and honestly, we're just

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.230
going to talk games.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.230
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yup.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And if you guys want to stick
around, that's cool.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.180
I'm not going stop you.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.180
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.380
And we want--we actually have looked at the
moderator page and guys, stop nominating stuff

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.980
we've already looked at man, come on.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm also like stop this garbage.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, yeah.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I was kind of bummed about that.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.059
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But now you know, there's some
good stuff here.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.059
But you know really, man.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.310
We like--we've already reviewed it.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.330
We're not going to review again unless...

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.330
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.969
&gt;&gt; GALPIN...unless you've done like something
just totally kick ass awesome with it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.969
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.859
But seriously you know, hey, we're tired.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.370
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's been a while...

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.399
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We had some week, yeah.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.750
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, it's been [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, lots of--lots of stuff

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.330
going down here at work but...

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.330
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All good.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.330
Good stuff.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Good stuff for you, I guess.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.390
Anyway, point B...

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.680
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Dude, we're going to get promoted,
man.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, there you go.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.530
All right.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.229
So, anyway, we've got a lot of stuff to talk
about but I think we're going to--we're going

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.520
to do a little bit of game review or think--we're
just going to talk a little bit about games.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.760
We've actually been doing--we--every now then,
we kind of do a sweep of a bunch of games

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.760
that are popular.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: To see you know, how well they're
working on different devices and if there's

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.130
any issues with them...

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.680
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Developers do very...

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...performances like.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.140
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...interesting things.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.630
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's what we learn.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, yeah.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.189
We've learn some really interesting things
that I think it would be fun to talk about

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.409
them and at the same time we'd like to you
know, look at a few games.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.409
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And maybe mock some, maybe not.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.920
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's possible, yeah.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.580
Well, you know, we have--we have--we have
our good friends from Com2uS nominated a game

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.580
and their games are always fun because they
don't--they aren't intended to appeal to my

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.580
cultural norm.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.420
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Do you remember when we had to
send that one game back?

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.650
And say we're not going to feature it unless
you take out the giant red...

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.960
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: The falace.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I guess it was supposed to
be a rocket.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It was, it was, but it--the problem
is when you make a rocket with two giant round

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.420
orbs on the side of it.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.709
It really does have the wrong impression.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Especially when the nose is kind
of purple.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes, yeah, absolutely.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.510
It was...

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Anyway, today, we're drinking
Lagunitas IPA.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.580
Cheers.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.580
We need this today.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.819
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a gift from our friend the
Famster because I've totally run through my

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.170
beer budget and I'm not going to start spending
on something else like wine.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.550
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Beer.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.550
No.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.520
You're not--come on, it's the beer budget.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's true, that's true.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520
Yeah.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, actually you know, what I'm
spending it on now is audio stuff and lights.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.519
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And lights?

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.519
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup, because we need key lights.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.519
We need key lights...

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.519
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...coming right back here shining
down on your shoulders...

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.590
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's going to make your hair
look luxurious.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.672
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, I'm wearing a hat again because
there was some public outcry about the fact

00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:19.730
that I had no hat last week, so once again.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.870
But what is--what is fun is I'm actually performing
in an opera right now in my spare time.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I thought you said they're going
to make you cut your hair for that.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, they were going to.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.150
But...

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And you rebelled?

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, no.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.150
I didn't actually...

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Your cast members rebelled.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.530
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Actually, they first tried to put
me in a wig.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.150
And they put me in a wig that was--honestly
like the $20 wig special.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.040
And I looked I was a game show host.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.121
And you know, when you're in an opera where
you're suppose to be in like 1890 or something

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:48.250
like that and you look like you know, Wink
Martindale.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.499
It just--it just doesn't work.

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.499
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, Wink Martindale.

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:51.499
I miss that guy.

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:52.680
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I do, too.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: [INDISTINCT] of him, anyway.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.160
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But they did make me actually dye
my beard.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.220
This is--this is not the normal color.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.220
So, it shows...

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I noticed them.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...a lot better on video.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.220
I think I'm going to go...

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.790
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...go Zorro for Halloween this
year because I--do you think I'm rocking the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.790
Zorro look?

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.790
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Probably.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.260
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Like fat Zorro is where going forward.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And juts because we're probably
going to die half-way through when the YouTube

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.590
stream cuts out.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.379
Might as well say right now that next week,
it will be a perfect time to talk about Halloween

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.379
apps.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.379
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:22.379
And Halloween games.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.069
So, you know, we're--we're going to actually
have a two weeks of Halloween games so you

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.919
know, it doesn't actually say so the moderate
pages yet, but please nominate some Halloween

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.159
games otherwise, I'm going to nominate them
so yeah.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I don't think it's really a risk.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.870
I think that there is...

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.982
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS:...plenty of--in fact, most games
have come out.

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:39.982
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There's so many zombie games out
there.

00:04:39.982 --> 00:04:40.982
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:40.982 --> 00:04:41.982
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I mean, seriously.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:42.982
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:43.982
Right.

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:44.982
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Now, here we are.

00:04:44.982 --> 00:04:45.982
It's Farmville with zombies.

00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:46.982
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:04:46.982 --> 00:04:47.982
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Zombieville.

00:04:47.982 --> 00:04:48.982
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:49.982
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There actually is a game.

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:51.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Actually, so I'm really excited
to see if there's going to be an Android version.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.919
My--one of my old co-workers from Project
Offset did a mobile game called brains.

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.629
It's a zombie real time strategy game.

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.159
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's right up your alley.

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.129
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You play--you play the zombie
horde.

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.349
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's awesome.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.349
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.819
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's very--to me, it's interesting.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:10.819
Okay.

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.020
So, it's--I'm looking forward to that.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.020
That sounds cool.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.520
And--so right now, we'll say the closest we
have to Halloween, is we do--we do have witch

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.089
wars on tap for today.

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:21.949
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it's not really a Halloween
witch.

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:22.949
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: NO, no.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.330
There sort of your sexy anime witch.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.330
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.810
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's the way we describe it.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.509
So--and it's weird because you pointed out,
they do have handcuffs.

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.509
It's one of the things...

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, let's...

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:33.509
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...do is judge for themselves.

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.509
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So just take a look at.

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.209
Now, you'll notice that we've completely [INDISTINCT]
today, we don't have any titles or anything.

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:41.949
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Nope, you'll have out figure out
what we're...

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:42.949
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:43.949
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...looking at on time.

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:44.949
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a mystery.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:45.949
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Disconnected to the server.

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.229
Ops, ops, wait hold on.

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Basically what we did...

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.229
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: The game is back.

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.219
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...is, if there's like a lot
of hating in the YouTube comments.

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:52.219
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-huh.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.289
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, first, we'll discount 90%
of it because that's what you do with YouTube

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.679
comments if you want to remain sane.

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:58.679
No offense.

00:05:58.679 --> 00:05:59.679
But...

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:01.579
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Wait--did we start out saying,
that's the real question.

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:02.579
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:03.579
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, that's what I was going to
say.

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:05.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And of course I'm not talking
about any of our live viewers because they

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.740
all rock.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.990
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Point being.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.699
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That I--we are kind of like just
winging this show today...

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:13.699
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ... but we'd love to hear--yeah,
a sort of you know, counter point what we've

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.030
been doing before which is kind of like slick
and over produced I guess.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.620
You know, what do you think?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, let us--let us know if you
want us to continue over producing, we can

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.389
do that.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:27.389
We can make more three titles.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We...

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.689
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: We can use more effects.

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.849
We can use more green screen, we can--we can...

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:32.849
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right, baby.

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:33.879
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...we can--we can have us on freaking
Mars man.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:34.879
Now for the next--to the next show...

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:35.879
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.879
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...it's up to you.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I've got a green screen, a bonus
burning, a whole in my pocket and a year's

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.429
subscription to Adobe CS6.

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:45.189
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, better watch out.

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:46.189
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.189
Exactly man.

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.729
After--we're going to use After Effects on
your but so let's just...

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.069
&gt;&gt; Uh-oh, guys, I'll just put a lower thirds
for you guys.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, no.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.169
You didn't [INDISTINCT] rock on.

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:02.559
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: He just do that, you know, he does
that to spike us.

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:03.669
That's awesome.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.620
Thank you.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.180
We have lower thirds now, so yes, the title
is Witch wars and let me tap restart.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, wait a second, Dan.

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.629
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Because you'll see the witch is
exempted at the beginning.

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:14.629
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right, there's a witches, okay.

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And [MAKES SOUND]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So excellent.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.499
And Dan, this game play it's really interesting
to me.

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:20.499
It seems like...

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:21.499
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:22.500
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...there's a bunch of things
here.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.939
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: They're talking.

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:24.939
Yeah.

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:25.939
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That you need to match.

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:26.939
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: How many do you need to match?

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:29.509
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Three.

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:30.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Three, really?

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:31.509
Okay.

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:32.509
&gt;&gt;GALPIN: Yeah.

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:33.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's interesting.

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:34.509
And there's like a grid of them and they're
all different sorts of objects.

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:35.509
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes, but I'm playing against another
witch.

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:36.509
You see?

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:37.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:38.509
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, she's like--she's like kicking
my butt now because you're talking.

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:39.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well...

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:40.520
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Wait, you're ruining my game.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So what you're saying is, I'm
talking so you're not getting any work done?

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:47.189
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.800
Hey, wait.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.139
I'm sending--I'm sending a message here.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:52.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm just saying.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:53.139
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No, no.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm just saying.

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.139
So anyway, yeah.

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:56.139
So, play it man.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:57.139
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm restarting, okay.

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:58.139
Oh, witches.

00:07:58.139 --> 00:07:59.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Is it always the same witches?

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:00.139
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I don't know.

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:01.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:02.889
And then the question is, yeah, why do did
they have handcuffs?

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:05.539
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well yeah, that I didn't understand
the handcuffs part.

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:08.440
Is there--is there--so let us know in the
live stream, is there a some sort of witch

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.070
thing of handcuffs that we should be aware
of that you know, that we--I understand like

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.639
you know, that--the star pentagram and stuff
like that you know, that's--that kind of stuff

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:21.819
like that, the Star of David is kind of sort
of witchy thing to some people.

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:24.509
But yeah, come on, tell me what this is what
this is?

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.110
I don't get the symbolism here.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.710
Maybe I'm trying to read too much in this
game.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that is weird.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.710
There's a Star of David.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.710
Shouldn't it be like a pentagram?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.710
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It should be a pentagram, yeah.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Is this like just all completely
messed up?

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.329
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's possible.

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:37.949
I just don't know.

00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:41.099
I honestly, I haven't had enough to drink
yet to get this game.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:42.099
So...

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you are a little--do you
want to just take a break?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.970
&gt;&gt; Guys, I'm just going to jump in and read
you guys in one of the comments?

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.540
&gt;&gt; So this is from one of our long time viewers...

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.540
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.290
&gt;&gt; ...FunnerGo he says, the last minute title
card actually looks better and then the formerly

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.070
over produced title card.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.339
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's like--that's awesome.

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:02.509
That is not--we are--we are so, okay.

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:03.509
Okay.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.509
Good to know.

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:05.509
Good to know.

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:06.509
I blame...

00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:07.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, he's got--he's a good point.

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:08.509
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I blame Keno for that actually.

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:13.500
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I'll tell you what happen
is we--yeah, we threw together that--that

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.819
thing in Keno and it looked good at the time
and then, one of the reasons we don't have

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:23.100
it now, is because we got really sick of it
and didn't like it at all.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.100
So...

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You're with us actually.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.550
We're totally with you.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.570
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: We're--when we actually have time
next week, maybe we'll do another one that's

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.570
cooler.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But you know, just so you know
that's not a thrown together title card.

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:40.770
That is in original Roman of New York title
card.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.029
For which, we paid vast sums.

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:47.880
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, his salary.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Vast sums.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.430
All right.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.750
So, what is this have that other match free
games don't have?

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.770
I think it's a question you will always got
to ask.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It is--it is a battle element--oh,
she's crying.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.300
She lost, I totally won.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.520
Hey, new witch.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:08.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, it's got witches and a handcuffs
and battles and spells.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.470
And it's actually pretty cool like, honestly
it's fun.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.470
Where there spells?

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.470
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.490
We get spells by matching up certain skills
you see and then you can cast spells.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.060
Dude, level one explosion.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, nice.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.060
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, yeah.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.060
So, it is--I mean, honestly, it's fun.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.209
You know, if you like these kind of games,
there's ones that really have a lot more depth

00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:27.939
in terms of, like, progression, like, you
know, one of my favorite ones is called Atlantis

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:29.399
that I actually played all the way through.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.460
From players, they talked about it a few times
on here.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.060
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Because I like the fact that you
actually got to different cities and got to

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.060
different challenges.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.220
And--but, this is fun for what it is.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:44.890
It's sort of--it's sort of reminds me actually
of the classic puzzle fighter in the sense

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.389
that you're sort of, you know, you're--you
know, you're kind of battling against someone

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:48.389
else.

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:49.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:50.389
That's what I was thinking, you know...

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:51.589
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You know, but taking it to match
3 instead of--instead of to, you know...

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:52.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-huh.

00:10:52.589 --> 00:10:53.589
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Puzzle Bobble kind of thing.

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:54.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:55.589
Yeah.

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:56.589
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, you know, I'd say cool.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.589
Nice Match up with game donors.

00:10:57.589 --> 00:10:58.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That is cool.

00:10:58.589 --> 00:10:59.589
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I always appreciate match ups.

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:01.529
As far as the graphics, we have really kind
of low res backgrounds with high res icons.

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:04.500
If you actually look, you will get--I don't
know if you can see this in live stream, but

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.269
if you actually can see, like, the versus,
it's really kind of blurry and the backgrounds

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:09.269
are really blurry.

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:10.269
But then the icons are beautiful, like...

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:11.869
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You got to ask yourself if...

00:11:11.869 --> 00:11:12.869
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's...

00:11:12.869 --> 00:11:14.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they did that and the--and
the [INDISTINCT] just decided, "Okay, this

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.940
background is too big, probably you'll notice
if we just blur it out a little bit and make

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.940
it smaller.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.070
You know, I--they--and I'm sure they are trying
to make the APK size small which I appreciated.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.720
I would say one thing that was great about
today, all these games installed in, like,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720
four minutes.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.720
Like, honestly, they were...

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Wow.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720
&gt;&gt;GALPIN: ...they were all tiny games.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Unlike Bard's Tale.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Unlike Bard's Tale.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720
Yeah.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720
Last week and I was, like, installing Bard's
tale...

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...which by the way is awesome.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720
Thank you inXile for doing that.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.079
That's like--it made my whole week the fact
that we had Bard's Tale on Android finally.

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:48.790
But, yeah, it's freaking enormous and mostly
because of the song about beer, beer, beer,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.810
tiddly beer, beer.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.899
Oh, I got stunned.

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:53.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It is Tommy Tallarico, you don't
cut out his songs.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.290
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No, you don't.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.290
You absolutely don't.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.160
And it's Kerry Ellis as the--as the narrator--not
as the narrator, as the--as the Bard.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.130
So, you know, you got to appreciate that.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.579
You know, the funny thing is I think the last
time I played Bard's Tale...

00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:05.579
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-huh.

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:06.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...was actual Bard's Tale, like...

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.600
They--same here.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...when they came out...

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.649
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I miss the PS2 version...

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:13.009
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And what was the [INDISTINCT]
it actually comes with that.

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:14.009
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:15.009
Yeah.

00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:17.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it's not nearly as good as
I remembered.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.920
All right.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.920
Yeah.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: When you're...

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Back then a 240x240 graphic in...

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.920
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...like 16 colors, it really
blew me away.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.920
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It was Awesome.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920
Yeah.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.450
It's, like, how did they get so many colors
on the screen, man?

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.709
Well, because I had a VGA monitor which...

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:31.709
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, yeah.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:36.079
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you could put in the 256 color
mode as long as you're willing to go down

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:37.470
to QVGA.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, one thing that's interesting
about this game is this game actually uses

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.490
Com2uS's...

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...network back in the game.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Dude, you've totally stepped
on my reminiscing.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I know.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.490
I know.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.490
I know.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.490
But you didn't even say anything.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.490
You didn't say--you didn't say, like, "Oh,
shut up, Ian.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.490
Let's talk about this."

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.490
You just like acted, like, I wasn't even talking.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, no.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.490
I mean, I totally--I totally miss that.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:00.420
Actually, you know, one of my favorite thing
was I had an original, like, you know, CGA

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:05.040
adaptor for my PC and most people didn't realize
that if you actually hooked it up to a composite

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.709
monitor and you had the right games that could
actually display 16 colors at once.

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:09.709
So, that's how the original...

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:10.709
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What?

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:11.709
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...King's Quest worked.

00:13:11.709 --> 00:13:14.060
And it used the same methods in the Apple
II.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, oh, right, right, right.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.360
Because it--yeah, it does--it was like a--was
it scam line or was it block?

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.449
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It was block.

00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:20.449
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:21.449
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:22.449
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, the block pellet, right?

00:13:22.449 --> 00:13:23.449
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:25.199
So, and basically you would--you would--you
have two lines, you put them right next to

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:28.190
each other horizontally and then you end up
getting the color on...

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...composite because of the, you
know, kind of affect--raster effect you got

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.490
from that.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Similar to what you got on apple
II.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.490
So...

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Do you remember the Commodore
64 did that, but they didn't actually have

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.110
enough memory, so every pixel on it being
twice as wide?

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.110
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.110
Back to Witch Wars.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.110
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Good days.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Witch Wars.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.110
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, yeah, and so overall, you know,
pretty good.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.620
I mean, my main--my main thing is it like
it pushes the Com2uS social network into,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.730
like, new levels of annoyance if you don't
want to actually use it.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.189
But the game--the game plays...

00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:55.189
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, come one.

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:56.189
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No.

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:57.189
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's not--I mean, what is it
doing?

00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:58.189
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well--okay.

00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:00.620
So, the first--let's see if I can actually
replicate it.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.620
I might have to clear the...

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean--well, I just didn't--I
didn't see it come up or anything.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.820
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.839
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They all take a really long time
to load.

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:06.839
I don't know why.

00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:11.080
It's like refining swords and, like, "Dude,
what--are you copying something to the--from

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.199
the EPK file?"

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:13.620
I mean, this game is tiny.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.790
Like, I'm not sure what it's doing, delivering
skill books...

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.889
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That is what it is.

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.350
&gt;&gt;GALPIN: ...like is it caught in the network.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.350
I just want to play.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.690
I want to get my witch action on and...

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Delivering handcuffs ordered
from the shopping mall.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.370
I mean, seriously there is...

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.471
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There is something...

00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:26.471
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There is something up with [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:27.471
I know.

00:14:27.471 --> 00:14:28.471
This game, I know.

00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:29.471
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I don't--yeah.

00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:31.740
I don't know how to interpret this, but I
don't think I want to.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.860
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, then when it comes up actually,
I ended up getting--you end up getting the,

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.930
you know, some sort of news.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.120
It looks like it's actually being nice to
me the second time.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.350
It's not actually forcing me into lots and
lots of stuff.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.410
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Which is cool.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.549
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, it gave you some ads up front.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:47.390
&gt;&gt; GALPLIN: It get--well, not add--not just
ads, like, kind of a general--okay, maybe

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.529
I signed--I don't know.

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:51.699
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm sure these guys know what
they're doing.

00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:55.769
They make, you know, oodles and oodles of
sales in--especially in Korea.

00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:59.549
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: [INDISTINCT] I didn't--I like O-ker
and--instructions.

00:14:59.549 --> 00:15:03.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, yeah, they...

00:15:03.929 --> 00:15:07.069
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I would--I would say they don't
quite know what they're doing.

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:08.069
They're close.

00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:09.069
They're close.

00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:11.249
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, it's just they don't--all
right.

00:15:11.249 --> 00:15:16.170
But my personal theory is that they're--most
of their translation department is, like,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.170
nephews and...

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.480
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, I'm just saying that, like,
this is a--the word wrapping thing though

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480
here.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, actually let me explain
it to you.

00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:25.439
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:15:25.439 --> 00:15:26.439
Okay.

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:27.439
All right.

00:15:27.439 --> 00:15:28.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:29.439
You and I...

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:30.439
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:31.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...wrap words on...

00:15:31.439 --> 00:15:32.439
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:33.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...syllables...

00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:34.439
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's because we wrap.

00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:35.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:36.439
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:15:36.439 --> 00:15:37.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know what this is?

00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:38.439
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:39.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This is how you do word wrapping
Gangnam Style.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:40.439
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.439
Gangnam Style.

00:15:41.439 --> 00:15:42.820
All right.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.940
So, anyways, we'll quit.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.310
Let's go--let's go to our next game.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.529
I figured that I have to look--we have to
look at Happy Sheep.

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:53.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We have to look at Happy Sheep,
but only because we want to know if anyone

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.579
on the live stream can explain this game to
us.

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:57.839
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: The sheep are happy...

00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:02.499
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, they're very happy and
it's like--I mean, I think--I definitely got

00:16:02.499 --> 00:16:06.730
past the first level and I'm pretty sure I
knew how I got past the first level.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.850
I just...

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.529
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:12.110
Play button really close to advertisement,
clever.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.230
All right.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:18.320
So, your goal is to get the sheep into the
barn, I think, and you do that partially by

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.559
flicking them, I think, but mostly by using
the [INDISTINCT]

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:23.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know what, flicking is not
actually a part of it.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, it is.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It is not a mechanic.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.649
It's--because if you try to--wow.

00:16:27.649 --> 00:16:32.289
Because if you--if you really pay attention
and just tapping them.

00:16:32.289 --> 00:16:33.289
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh.

00:16:33.289 --> 00:16:38.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I don't think it's actually requiring--well,
so basically you put the barn at the bottom

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.529
of the screen and just let everything fall.

00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:42.899
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, I guess so.

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:44.649
So, the sheep are happy.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:45.949
Mostly--you know, and that's good.

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:49.850
They have--they have one frame of animation
on them which is, you know--which makes them

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.850
look happier.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.709
There's a dog.

00:16:52.709 --> 00:16:56.220
I'm not sure what the dog does except that--I
guess it blocks you from getting sheep in

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.779
if it happens to be in the right place.

00:16:57.779 --> 00:16:59.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That doesn't make sense.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.599
It seems like the dog should be helping you
get the sheep in.

00:17:02.599 --> 00:17:03.599
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Totally.

00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:04.599
Totally.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.170
But, you know, dogs don't--you know, you do--you
do have sheep dogs that are, you know, that

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.170
go with sheep.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.780
Oh, we just lost HDMI because, you know, microHD
my socks.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.780
It flickering.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.910
I don't [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There we are.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.910
All right.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.209
But anyway, so that's the game.

00:17:21.209 --> 00:17:26.069
You could see on the tablet, we're seeing
some minor sprite alignment errors.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.050
You can see the classic around the chickens.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.200
You can see there are little lines around
the chickens and a little line around the

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.510
dog and this is pretty common if you're using
a sprite sheet and you're trying to break

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.200
things up and run on the...

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Carefully, something...

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.330
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...of higher resolution.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.330
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.330
All right.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.330
Stop playing that game, seriously.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.330
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.330
What?

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.330
Why?

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because you keep tilting it around
and it keeps popping out the connector.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.249
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, but I'm holding the connector
in now.

00:17:49.249 --> 00:17:50.779
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, you're not holding it right.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.690
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm not holding it right?

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Put it on the table.

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:54.919
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Damn it.

00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:55.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Just put it on--you know what,
you're cut off.

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:56.919
Come one.

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:57.919
Come on.

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:58.919
Come on.

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:00.919
&gt;&gt; I have a couple of great comments from
our viewers.

00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:01.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, please.

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:02.919
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, yeah, go for it.

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:03.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Let's hear some viewer comments.

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:07.731
&gt;&gt; So, the first comment is that flicking
your sheep causes blindness, I'm just saying.

00:18:07.731 --> 00:18:09.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I have no idea...

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.850
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Good point--good point...

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...what you're talking about.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.360
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.740
&gt;&gt; And the second comment is that someone
wants to see us abuse the green screen in

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.740
horrible ways.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.740
All right.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, believe me, we have.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: We already have, yeah.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We're already saving it for the
outtakes video.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.740
But...

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Dude.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I will say this about [INDISTINCT]
the sprite outlines that you saw...

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...did not occur without the
HDMI connector plugged in.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:41.000
So, this is something that we're actually
starting to learn is it's really, really important

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.499
to go in and test your game at really bizarre
resolutions.

00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:44.499
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:48.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because sooner or later, no matter
what resolution you think is never going to

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.309
in the real world...

00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:51.309
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:53.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's going to hit the streets
of Shenzhen at half the price of everything

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.610
else.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.610
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.469
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And Samsung is going to snap
up a bullet load of them.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.469
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:18:58.469 --> 00:19:03.409
You know, it's--I mean, people are--I'm always
amazed on what we're getting in terms of screens.

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:06.610
I mean, even in terms of last year when, you
know, I was kind of amazed that we actually

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.610
had a device which--we're shipping out on
a phone form factor with 720p, that was last

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.610
year.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.610
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Who knows...

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And God only knows what's going
to happen...

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.029
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly, what's going to
happen this year, so...

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:17.290
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But, it's not just that.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.290
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's that you think--you think,
"Oh, 720p, that's pretty crazy."

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But what's really crazy is 735p...

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.440
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, yeah.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...or...

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.780
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Which is actually that we were
because...

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.190
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...when you--when you--we're actually--we're
actually at--on this device, we're actually

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.240
running at true 720p when you're in HDMI.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.499
But you're not on HDMI, we're in this kind
of weird funky thing where we're actually...

00:19:40.499 --> 00:19:41.499
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:19:41.499 --> 00:19:43.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...you know, 35 or 40 pixels short
of that I think.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.940
So...

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.049
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:47.049
And so--yeah.

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:48.049
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Or longer than that.

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:50.941
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That can--that can mess up some
sprite sheet calculations, I think.

00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:51.941
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:52.941
Absolutely.

00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:53.941
So, anyway, it was interesting.

00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:55.010
Also, the thing that it's interesting when
you plug the HDMI and you actually--you actually

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.590
get one of those rare things where it actually
gets your--tells your app to change the size.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.450
And so your app needs not to respond to that.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.900
We actually had one app earlier that had a
giant purple or green fringe on it and that

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.270
actually was because, oh, we just never realize
that the size change could come in as late

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.270
as it did.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.270
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, you do have--you do have to
watch out for that.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, you change--you can come
in any time.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.809
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You're going to come in any time,
you got to be ready for it.

00:20:16.809 --> 00:20:17.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:20:17.809 --> 00:20:18.809
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So...

00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:19.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:19.809 --> 00:20:21.000
I mean, we've said it before and we'll say
it again.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.740
Programming Android is not like programming
a game console.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.000
It's like programming a desktop or a web browser.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.549
You have to be ready for hardware to be different.

00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:32.820
&lt;&lt; GALPIN: Oh, so when you select hard difficulty,
you have chickens who are blocking your way

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.960
now too.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.229
I hadn't noticed that.

00:20:36.229 --> 00:20:37.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.039
So, that was fun, but tell us what you have
been doing this week, Dan.

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:44.720
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Other than flicking my sheep?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.000
So, what other games we have going on?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.010
We actually have Words Workout which is fun.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:57.000
It's yet another in a long line of words games,
but it's done very, very well.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.070
I would say that the excessive use of rounded
rectangles is a little unnecessary in Android.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.850
But there's some good words here like pleat.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.520
Ouch.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:17.169
And you are, you know, it's a time game so,
uh, oh, well.

00:21:17.169 --> 00:21:25.299
So, yeah, we now--we get to learn how good
I am with these games.

00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:26.539
Anyways, so it's a fun game.

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:29.130
We were trying to draw things in a sort of
a boggle-esque fashion.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.920
There's a lot of power ups, a lot of really
well-thought out stuff.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.330
I thought it was a really fun game.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.100
On a tablet, it works great, you know, because
it just scales to fill the screen.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.990
The only thing on the tablet is the--obviously
you can see the area with the ad is kind of

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.240
awkward looking and takes a very small portion
of that top there so...

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...probably could just adjust for
that.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Especially games like this.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.179
There's really not much of an excuse for not
trying it on the emulator.

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:55.179
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:21:55.179 --> 00:21:56.179
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And just try some different sizes.

00:21:56.179 --> 00:22:01.400
It's a little bit of a pain because honestly,
it--we don't switch as fast as we could...

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.330
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...between different sizes and
different lay-outs...

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.330
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:13.029
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS...on the emulator, on the dev
tools, but it's well worth it.

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:18.120
And it turns out that for games nowadays--I
mean, I think we used to see some really bizarre

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120
things.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we still do on some devices.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.500
But as we're, you know, for instances, as
we're looking at devices that haven't shipped

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.960
yet which we sometimes do, there can be some
crazy stuff.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960
But...

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.960
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.960
Well, you know, it's interesting.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.700
We, you know, we sometimes do it to ourselves.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:39.340
And, you know, I think one of the things we're
going to cover in future sessions are--is

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.610
ways in which we--you have to be careful,
you know.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:42.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:48.169
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And so, sometimes people make assumptions
about the way the memory in devices are laid

00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:49.169
out.

00:22:49.169 --> 00:22:51.760
Sometimes there are actually some bugs in
[INDISTINCT] it turns out that were affecting

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.250
the way that one could subclass various classes
that people we're accidentally taking advantage

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.250
of.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:03.200
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that's actually one thing
you'll notice is that the original Android

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.179
source base, you know, was obviously not a
hundred percent perfect and there were a few

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:13.120
things that either were underspecified or
were just done wrong that tend to get cleaned

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.880
up over time by AOSP contributors.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, for instance...

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.130
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And by us, and by us, yeah.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And by us.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:25.669
So, for instance we made--for Jelly Bean we
made pthread POSIX compliant.

00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:27.020
It was supposed to return an error...

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...if it couldn't give you the
thread you wanted, you know, with the scheduling...

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...that you wanted.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.170
And it used to just fall back and, you know,
still create a thread, but it wasn't what

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.170
you asked for.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.170
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we made it do the right thing,
which was to return an error and that broke

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:41.570
everybody.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.570
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Everything.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:46.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because it turns out nobody was--why
would you check for errors on pthread because

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.690
it never [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, we had ton of games and other
apps that would spin up threads and then sit

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.960
there waiting like, "Hey, all right, just
waiting for that thread to spin up."

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.830
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Waiting for the thread to spin
up.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.830
&gt;&gt; Ni-LEWIS: And--exactly.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.830
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And, yeah.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.230
And nothing would happen.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.230
So--yeah.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.909
So, you have to be--you should be a little
bit cautious.

00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:05.909
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:08.330
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Sometimes reading our docs actually
is a good thing.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And also just, you know, adhering
to standards even when it doesn't break you.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.979
You know, the other thing that happened I
believe is the Ice Cream Sandwich timeframe...

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:17.979
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:24:17.979 --> 00:24:21.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...was we tightened up the JNI
referencing restrictions.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.919
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, we've done that several times.

00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:28.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because we, you know, and this
is usually to make things faster.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.470
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, some of the things that happened,
you know, when we add a single threaded, you

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.470
know, everywhere.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.300
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There are kind of two things we
did at once.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.570
We went multi CPU.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:45.409
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And at the same time we also tightened
up JNI and I think they sort of went hand

00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:46.409
in hand.

00:24:46.409 --> 00:24:50.330
But for a long time, we weren't cleaning up
JNI very effectively.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:55.000
So, you could pretty much guarantee that if
you reference something from the JVM, that

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.271
reference would always exist in JNI as long
as it existed in the JVM.

00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:00.279
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, basically what we were
doing is...

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:02.440
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Or [INDISTINCT] let's be clear.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...the "opaque candles" that
were getting passed back were just references

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.590
to memory...

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.590
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: To chunks of memory and then...

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and then the address is the
one changing.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...and now--and then we switch
to actually passing opaque candles [INDISTINCT]

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.020
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That were actually candles.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, because at some point we
realize we, you know, we're not going to make

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.700
this GC any faster...

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.700
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.020
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...unless we start rearranging
memory, so.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.740
So, one of the--of the things everyone should
do in addition to using CheckJNIs is to also

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:31.029
build against the latest versions of the NDK
and build against the latest versions of the

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.029
SDK.

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:34.570
Be very, very careful especially with native
tools especially if you're using any pre-built

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.570
libraries because that...

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.021
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...you know, you don't know how
those pre-built libraries were compiled.

00:25:38.021 --> 00:25:42.280
Maybe they were compiled with an older version
of the NDK, maybe they're complied with the

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280
[INDISTINCT] flag.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.429
So, in general, I, you know, especially with
binary libraries, be very, very cautious.

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:52.029
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, this is--the reason we're
talking about this is because recently it's

00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:58.059
become very obvious to us that as we do more
address layouts--address space layouts randomization

00:25:58.059 --> 00:26:01.359
and just screw with the address space in different
ways...

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.559
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:08.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...old code that was compiled
with very old NDK is not re-locatable in the

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:15.669
same way that the newer code is and this also
goes for code that may have been compiled

00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:16.669
with a different toolchain.

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:17.669
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:20.159
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, if you're using some other
random toolchain to generate Android code,

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:24.570
be aware that we only test against the NDK.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.650
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, so, definitely, you know,
all you guys out there I know there's a bunch

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.799
of other, you know, a lot--a lot--for a long
time Chris Axe was like doing sorts of cool

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:32.530
stuff that we, you know, later introduced
into the NDK.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.230
So, you can definitely run into problems there.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.710
So, just be very, very cautious that you're
always using the latest version of our tools

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.360
because that's going to guarantee the longest
forward compatibility that we can.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360
All right.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.360
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
So, anyways it's a cool game.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.070
I--you know, I really don't have much to say
about it other than they really need to make

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.200
this dialogue dismissible with the back key
as a general rule.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There's not [INDISTINCT] all
right.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Zombie.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That bad.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:55.950
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Back key must work.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's an x for us, dude.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.750
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, sorry.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, dude, you should be Frankenstein.

00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:01.749
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh.

00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:03.909
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You should be hipster Frankenstein.

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:05.419
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Hipster Frank--with the beard?

00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:06.419
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:07.419
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:07.419 --> 00:27:13.279
I should keep the beard just so I can be--I
can have--I can have--I have sunglasses [INDISTINCT]

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:19.789
your tablet is not cool as mine because yours
is shiny and silver and mine is blackish colored.

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:21.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This is--that's--it's purple.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.309
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Purple, yeah.

00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:23.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or actually that's--it's amethyst.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It is amethyst.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.620
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And this one isn't silver.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.220
Don't fool yourself.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.220
It's champagne.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It is actually.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.380
That is the color they call it.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know why?

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because we're the Sex and the
City girls basically.

00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:36.299
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:37.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:38.299
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's why we got this hat.

00:27:38.299 --> 00:27:39.850
It's all about accessorizing.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:40.850
All right.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:46.139
So, let's look--let's look at a game that
actually--unlike Words Workout, it's somewhat

00:27:46.139 --> 00:27:48.230
actually--oh, my god that's small.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.630
You can bring up the tablet now, Mr. Fanster.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.580
And, yeah, there we are.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.770
This is actually a portrait.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:54.770
Yeah, I know.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:55.770
Look at that.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.799
That is high production values right there.

00:27:57.799 --> 00:28:02.830
Now, you'll notice--this is one of those times
in which actually looking at screen size is

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:08.950
useful because by default this is of course
an nDPI device, so you're getting very small

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.240
text and very small icons.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Which game is this, guys?

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.320
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: This is Math Twister.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Math Twister.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: M-A--now, you can tell it's not
from the US because it's got math in it and

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.490
no one in the US would actually call it Math.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.019
It would definitely be a--something coming
from somewhere else, you know, usually with

00:28:26.019 --> 00:28:27.139
some k in it or something like that, maybe
Australia.

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:28.139
I'm not sure.

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:32.390
I didn't look for this [INDISTINCT] but clearly
not from here.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.940
&gt;&gt; Ni-LEWIS: Did you know in Australia...

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:35.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they call soccer, soccer?

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: What?

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.090
As you know, originally the term soccer came
from the UK.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.620
And we are not that--and we--and we just kept
using it and they said, Stop, we're calling

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.620
it football."

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love this because...

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.010
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:55.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's like we can make a 600
mile journey across England in just a few

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:56.830
sentences.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.830
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:02.009
It all depends on what app are we talking
of the--wait, hold on, hold on, wait.

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:04.940
I got one more--no, I've got--no, sorry.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.940
I can't...

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Come on.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:12.259
Give me a [INDISTINCT] and [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No, no, don't say that at all.

00:29:12.259 --> 00:29:14.299
It's nothing like it.

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:16.179
That sounds bad as the...

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:19.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's the dude that tried to
sound like Ringo in the Old Submarine.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That is so absolutely true.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.169
Well, you know, the funny thing about The
Beatles too is that they actually were coached

00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:27.399
to sound like that because they came on--I
don't want to talk like this.

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:28.460
What are you talking about?"

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.790
Like no Americans could understand you.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:30.790
You need to slow the way down.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, really?

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.490
Like what's his name in that one movie?

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes, exactly.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.490
So, they said no.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.490
They were--they taught them.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.340
They actually said, "You've got to slow down
the way you speak."

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.340
Like, "All right.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.440
Well, we'll speak like this then.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.769
And then yeah, we'll sound like we're always
on something."

00:29:43.769 --> 00:29:45.710
&gt;&gt; I think you mean Brad Pitt from Snatch.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.710
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:49.710
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What?

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:51.710
You didn't know that?

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.710
Because that's what I was talking about.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:53.710
Dan got it.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.800
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800
That's enough about us.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.460
Let's get on to Math Twister.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.700
So, you know, I'll go with a bit more of a
refined accent for this.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.150
Math Twister is a highly educational game.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.340
We can choose untimed and different levels
of difficulty which will throw math problems

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.340
at us.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.630
You know what is 10% of 80?

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.519
Or two times seven?

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:18.040
Or six times nine?

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.419
Or 10% of 70?

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.419
And they get kind of fun.

00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:23.419
I have no...

00:30:23.419 --> 00:30:24.419
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And you're now George Harrison's
butler.

00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:26.100
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right, something like that.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.100
Yeah.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: By the way, I just want to--I
just want to pause for a second to recognize

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.250
our new producer, Producer Louis who...

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Louis.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...is not might.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.269
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No, he's not.

00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:36.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:37.269
Sorry.

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:38.269
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, he's...

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:39.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Louis, I'm sorry.

00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:40.269
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...he's the silent producer.

00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:42.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, Producer Louis named as Louis
but he spells it Louis which really bugs me

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.460
because my last name is Lewis and I spell
it Lewis.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.179
He's not on camera today because he's phenomenal
handsomeness...

00:30:50.179 --> 00:30:51.740
&gt;&gt; But he could be.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...would...

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.740
&gt;&gt; NO, no, no.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...would cause all of us to look
hideous in comparison.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.149
&gt;&gt; Now, Lewis, the way you spell it...

00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:59.620
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; ...is the American fashion.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.620
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's true.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.230
&gt;&gt; The Louis I spell it is the French way
and the original.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.230
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I see.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:07.230
That's true.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, like King Louis?

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.230
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.710
All 15, 16 or 20 of them.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:11.710
Yes.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:12.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.710
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That is [INDISTINCT] something
like that.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:14.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And did they ask...

00:31:14.929 --> 00:31:15.929
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So are...

00:31:15.929 --> 00:31:16.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you to pronounce it Louis...

00:31:16.929 --> 00:31:17.929
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Are you saying...

00:31:17.929 --> 00:31:18.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...like some American dude?

00:31:18.929 --> 00:31:19.929
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...you're French Loyalty then?

00:31:19.929 --> 00:31:20.929
&gt;&gt; Not anymore than you are Scottish.

00:31:20.929 --> 00:31:21.929
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:31:21.929 --> 00:31:22.929
I'm not Scottish.

00:31:22.929 --> 00:31:23.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You're crap.

00:31:23.929 --> 00:31:24.929
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:31:24.929 --> 00:31:25.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:31:25.929 --> 00:31:26.929
Let's go.

00:31:26.929 --> 00:31:27.929
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:31:27.929 --> 00:31:28.929
This is--anyway, it's kind of cool.

00:31:28.929 --> 00:31:31.350
It sort of combines falling tower action with
math.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:35.620
You know, definitely in terms of tablet, there's
a little bit of work to be done, you know,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.490
it's--and I was actually a little surprised
to see this game was a landscape game.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:43.059
It actually starts off in portrait and it
goes to landscape.

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:47.340
In general, if you're going to lock to one
dimension, you should kind of lock to one

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.940
dimension, you know, whether--if you're going
to have a tile screen that's in landscape,

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.630
then your game should be in landscape [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.959
You never want to make the user actually...

00:31:53.959 --> 00:31:56.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You have to rotate the device.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...rotate the tablet.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.070
So...

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Unless--well, unless you're just
trying to get obese children to exercise or

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.070
try to stand.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.379
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, I wish somebody had
done that for me when I was young.

00:32:04.379 --> 00:32:07.259
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, maybe that's why they called
it Maths Twister and it occurred because you

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:08.259
have twist the tablet.

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.259
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, that's a good point.

00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:10.259
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:13.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I had just assumed that it was,
you know, what Mormons do for flirting.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.890
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You have to...

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, it's funny because...

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:18.890
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...explain that offline.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's funny because I actually--I
was visiting some friends, some, you know,

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.220
they went to school in Brigham Young University.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-huh.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:30.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, they brought out this video
and [INDISTINCT] wasn't the sexiest game of

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.970
twister you've ever seen with...

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, yeah, so that...

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.910
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, that being twisters--I would
say it's beyond flirting there.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.759
That's--twister is sort of in the heavy, heavy,
heavy, petting already when you get to like

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:42.759
that.

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:43.759
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly, right?

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:44.759
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, totally.

00:32:44.759 --> 00:32:45.759
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, totally.

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:46.759
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's crazy.

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:47.759
Yes, drunken, not drunken.

00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:49.279
Completely sober, party twister at BYU.

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:50.279
All right.

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.279
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.279
Let's do it.

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:53.350
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You know, all these things I never
knew about.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:54.480
All right.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.760
So that's Maths Twister.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.940
You would definitely--I think the biggest
issues that I have are tablet optimization

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.940
in terms of that.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.429
I think, true, the game is fine on the phone.

00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:03.990
We play it all on a tablet.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.990
Why?

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.630
Because this has cool HDMI and it's running
Jelly Bean.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.899
Thank you.

00:33:09.899 --> 00:33:11.159
All right.

00:33:11.159 --> 00:33:14.110
So, one more game which is also portrait.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:18.940
It is Jungle Jumper and no, there's nothing
sexual about this game, just in case you're

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.940
curious.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.940
There's no theme here.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.940
So...

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We weren't initially thinking
about that.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.210
But now, I can't unhear it.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:27.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm sorry.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.210
I'm sorry.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.210
To all our viewers out there, forget about...

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:34.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, the thing I love about Jungle
Jumper is this like Stuart Little title screen

00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:35.269
they've got.

00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:36.269
It's like--it's seriously...

00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:37.269
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You're a rat.

00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:38.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But you know what, it's not Stuart
Little.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.789
I don't--it's just this--I don't know if you've
ever heard of this, but Abel's Island.

00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:43.919
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, okay.

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:45.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Do you know what I'm talking
about?

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.999
It was like a Newbery Award Winner.

00:33:46.999 --> 00:33:48.419
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You can actually jump off the side.

00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:49.669
I've never done that before.

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:51.640
I didn't realize you could die jumping off--yeah.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.999
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean, seriously, did you read
Abel's Island?

00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:55.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No, I didn't actually.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.070
I didn't.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.070
All right.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.070
Well, in that case, we can't share a moment.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I like the fact of the...

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Just believe me, the Abel's Island
guy looked exactly like the Jungle Jumper

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:03.850
guy.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:04.850
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:10.090
But I do like the fact that you actually get
nicely and soundly eaten by these guys when

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.090
you jump on them.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.090
They got some good animations.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.010
I mean, obviously, it wasn't made for a tablet
in the sense that the background graphics

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.650
are a little fuzzy at this resolution.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.180
That's always a little bit disappointing especially
when you can see that, you know, they're pretty

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.580
much Vector graphics, so they probably could
have been...

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...rescaled and not too much
expense, but....

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.580
I mean, this game is designed to be small.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.580
&gt;&gt; NI_LEWIS: You can do this thing.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I would love to see it have a little
more animation than it does, you know.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's like...

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, and to tell the truth,
I mean, this is sort of like [INDISTINCT]

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.820
where it's...

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.820
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...actually not as fun on a tablet
because it's meant to have a smaller place.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I--honestly, I do love [INDISTINCT]
on a tablet though.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I like--well, on a phone though,
it's so much easier.

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:48.200
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It is easy.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.160
I ran into his butt.

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160
There we are.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Really?

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.160
He ate you?

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.160
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I was--I was--no, I didn't eat--he
didn't eat me.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.740
I was just butt killed.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.740
So...

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's disturbing.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.900
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I know.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.250
So, let's see.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.250
What else coming up?

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:08.320
Well, next week, I think, either next week
or the week after you should see the ceremonial

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.930
unkegging of our Android fifth anniversary
ale.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Very exciting.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:13.930
I was...

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:14.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: The whole team has been looking
forward to this.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:16.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a--what is it?

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, he hasn't eaten you at all.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.240
Yeah, sorry, go on.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They've blended two malts and
three hops.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.870
I can't remember off the top of my head, but
they are--but I hear it was the inaugural

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:33.250
outing of our new brewery and I understand
it ended up a little hoppier than we wanted

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.250
to.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.250
Yeah.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Interesting.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.250
All right.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Just a little accident with the
hops, but that's all right...

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, we made--we made more of an
IPA?

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...because we like the hops.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.250
&gt;&gt; That is the California thing guys.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.250
That's very fitting.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, hops.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It is.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Hops, yeah, pretty much.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.040
It's because probably it make you fat.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.400
&gt;&gt; You know, that wasn't an accident.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.790
I actually did that by design behind the scenes.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.040
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I see.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.460
Spiked it with extra hop.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, Daniel Feemster.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.099
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:03.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Ruined the fifth anniversary
ale.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.490
&gt;&gt; In your words ruined.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.490
&gt;&gt; Not my words.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.860
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: He made our fifth anniversary into
a bitter drink to swallow.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Did you do that with our--with
our code too?

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.220
Just like sneak in at night and...

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...do some ninja chickens?

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.550
&gt;&gt; I can't neither confirm nor deny that.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Got you.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Here we have Daniel Fem ninja chicken
master.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I totally believe that.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I do, absolutely.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Every now and then you just find
a rogue feature and then...

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:28.730
It's like how did that get that ninjas?

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:29.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:30.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's what happens, yeah.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's totally ninjas.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:33.730
Wi-fi direct, that was a total ninja feature.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:35.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It really was.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:37.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:38.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.730
Media code [INDISTINCT] code.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:41.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: The total ninja feature.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:43.730
All right.

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:44.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:45.820
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, yes, continue to get on the
moderator.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.000
We actually do look at your suggestions and
the best of these games we do present over

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.090
to our buddies over at the Google Play team
and say, "Please, take a look at them."

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.210
They may or may not feature them.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:56.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Like...

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:59.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And not only that, but we actually--we
are working on some collections of our very

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:00.870
own.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:01.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:02.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We're...

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:03.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, we're very excited about
that.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.110
We've seen that collections actually are fun
people who like them.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.341
I was really excited to see the retro gaming
collection which--you know, we talk a lot

00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:13.320
about retro game tiles here and we--said,
"We really wanted to see some really cool..."

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, really want to do a collection
because we're like, "Well, you can't put a

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.630
retro game on the front page of Google Play."

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.630
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because a lot of people aren't
going to understand.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: What the heck is this, man?

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.020
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.400
It's going to blow their mind, you know.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We're not part of their system.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly, you know, like 8-bit
audio and low res graphic.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.120
But...

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But for people who want it...

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Great.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...it's awesome.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I collect it up, yeah, absolutely.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm like, "Oh, yes, I'm saving
my childhood right here."

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm totally--yeah.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.640
Back when I didn't read Abel's Odyssey.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's okay because you had a
childhood with 8-bit graphics.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.770
I used to dream of 8-bit graphics.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:48.770
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:53.680
I remember when I was a child, I used live
in a shoebox.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: With a lid?

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.630
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.780
You're inside a lid, lucky man.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:37:59.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.780
We're punchy.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.780
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, indeed.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We talk about our games, talked
about some game development.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.500
We are going to be shifting this.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.320
The show, right, time wise?

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.440
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Maybe.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.140
I don't know.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.180
We might be.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.180
Watch.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Big change is coming up.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.180
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Big chage.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We will announce it on Google
Plus.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.180
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.040
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But basically, we just have to
get through this month and then we have not--well,

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.040
you know.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.160
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, drink some more.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.160
Drink some more.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.460
We get through this month and we are going
to change things up.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.460
So, keep an eye on us and keep the comments
coming.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.120
Now, let's see what people are saying on the
comment stream.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.030
God, you guys suck so bad.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.530
&gt;&gt; We actually--we actually had typical....

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: [INDISTINCT] that needs more specifics.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.220
&gt;&gt; ...Youtube comments.

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Really?

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.100
Are there people being like...

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.100
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.550
So, here is a question about the Transformer
Prime.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:56.560
Is the Transformer the best Android tablet
or do you guys just use it because [INDISTINCT]

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, the Transformer has some
advantages.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.200
It is not--definitely not a bad Android tablet.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.950
I don't know I'd go so far to say it's the
best.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.900
For--as far as things that are shipping now
that we can get our hands on and reliably

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:19.490
get several backup units, it is the very best
at providing HDMI out.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.280
It's got really good HDMI out options.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.280
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.921
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Asus added some things to the
base Android system that allow it to do things

00:39:25.921 --> 00:39:27.810
like rotate in a portrait mode.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.960
So, that makes our show a lot easier.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.730
That's--I mean, that's the primary reason
we're using it on the show.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.460
We have them and they have this really cool
feature.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:41.691
You know, we don't have HDMI on our tablet
sad to say, you know, on the Nexus 7.

00:39:41.691 --> 00:39:42.691
So, if we had an Nexus 7.

00:39:42.691 --> 00:39:43.691
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:44.691
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I mean, a Nexus tablet HDMI, we
might use it.

00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:46.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean, if you think about it,
the Nexus 7 in a lot of ways is a stripped

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.140
down Transformer Prime.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.720
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: In a lot of ways.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.720
Yeah.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's, you know, it's got the--essentially,
the same processing power, but a smaller screen,

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.480
no rear camera, you know...

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.480
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...all the options are taken
off.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.080
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So fortunately we have a lot
of experience with that chipset and that piece

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640
of hardware, so...

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's a lot easier to show.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.160
Now, there are some disadvantages to the Transformer
Prime.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.000
It's--out of all of the--it's sort of the
odd man out on rendering.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.869
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:18.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Unlike almost all mobile chips,
it's not a tile renderer; it's forward renderer.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:19.350
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:24.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And that means that it's very,
very sensitive to performance characteristics

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.140
that the tiler can handle very easily and
vice versa.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.100
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, so, like, you know, for example,
you know, there's just three different renderers

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.550
essentially on Android.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:39.420
We have tile-based, deferred tile-based and
we have immediate mode or direct rendering

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.440
[INDISTINCT] on this.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.250
And this tablet is--this chipset is really
cool if you need to do some really clever

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:49.940
effects that involve reading stuff back out
of the buffer, because the buffer is updated

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.120
in the, you know, in these thing.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.030
The screen is updated in real time.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.700
It was actually really fast to go and read
stuff out.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.520
With the tile-based renderer or deferred renderer,
it means that it has to reconstruct that piece

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.070
of the buffer when you want in the middle
of rendering and that can slow you down in

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.070
immense amount.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.710
So there are certain kinds of full screen
effects that this kind of chipset can do that

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:11.090
are very difficult to do on a tile-based renderer.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:14.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it's--you know, when you
think about the way the hardware is put together,

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:17.520
it's not so much as tile-based renderer is
bad at it...

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's that--it's significantly
better at not doing that and it...

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, that...

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, so...

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There we go.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...so in other words, you're
not--you're not actually doing something that...

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS:...that the hardware is bad at,
it's just that it has to...

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...forgo a whole set of optimizations
[INDISTINCT]

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:32.110
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Right.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.760
And it promise this, you know, this hardware
is designed to do work the other way and so,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.410
what this--so the tile-based renderers tend
to actually have performance problems when

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.240
you start having to force them in the sort
of direct mode rendering because they just...

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...weren't designed to work that
way.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:49.000
On the other hand, tile-based renderers excel
at some things, you know, for instance if

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.190
you're doing rebacks from a frame for blending,
they're--they can be very, very fast.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.650
&gt;&gt;GALPIN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Many tile-based renderers, especially
the ones that are fully deferred and have

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:03.950
geometry sorting, are incredible at dealing
with completely unsorted geometry...

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:04.950
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:05.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...which is a real benefit because...

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:06.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:10.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...sorting geometry is, A, not
actually a tractable problem.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.780
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You can--you can get close, but
it's sort of a traveling salesman thing and

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:14.970
so...

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:15.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But also, it takes up a lot of
CPU resources, so...

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.960
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:25.720
Now, that being said, a lot of other drivers
for tile-based renderers also do some of that

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720
sorting...

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...inventing on the CPU drivers.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720
So there is--there is additional CPU load
already in a tile-based renderer just kind

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.140
of to begin with and it...

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I mean, it's always a...

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.140
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And it...

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...cooperation between the CPU
and the...

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.140
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...and then--yeah...

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...GPU, yeah.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.140
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And then the magic sauce really
isn't, you know, the big the trace how much

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.140
is done where?

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.140
It's, you know, it's kind of...
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.140
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...and exactly, you know, how...

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's very true.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.230
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's like that, you know, but basically--but,
yeah, so in theory also--in theory is that

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.350
and this isn't really proven, but that the
immediate mode guys would say when you get

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:59.340
into a really, really huge amount of geometry
when you start doing things like having procedural

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.340
geometry basically.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.900
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That you start running into things
that immediate mode renderers do better than

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.900
tile-based renderers.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.900
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And I think the jury is still out.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.170
We'll have to wait to see what happens with
the--with...

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, nobody's going to do that,
right?

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.460
Not more effective...

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, okay, okay.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I'd be really surprised.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.200
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: OpenGeo is starting to add this
kinds of features in, so I think--you know,

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.030
I think we'll have to look, you know, five
years down the line, we're going to definitely

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:24.491
have APIs and chips that'll support, you know,
doing that kind of geometry.

00:43:24.491 --> 00:43:26.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, but the thing is it's not--it's
not so much that...

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...the sheer amount of geometry.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.250
It's--the same reason that sorting is a different
problem.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:34.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, you know, you're right.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:38.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But, you know, on a tiler, you're
really dealing with just a very large number

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:39.970
of frustra basically.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:40.980
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:46.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, you've already pre-clipped
a lot of your trial, so the chances of getting

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.440
interpenetration...

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...is very low.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.040
Now, at the point where we are sitting...

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.040
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...as application developers...

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:55.690
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...when we say sort your geometry,
we're not actually thinking about sorting

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680
your trials.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.520
We're usually thinking about sorting it on
the object level, right?

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.520
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because we'll draw entire BBOs
at a time.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.650
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly, and that's...

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:06.650
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, that's actually...

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.650
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...and that's...

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's a difficult problem because
you get these interpenetrating things.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.980
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.980
And that's actually a big challenge.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.760
It's a challenge anyways, because you also
have certain geometry that is translucent.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:22.810
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And so you actually have to maintain
that in proper, you know, front to back order...

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:23.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.880
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...while you actually want to maintain
all of your geometry that isn't translucent

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880
in back to front order and so...

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I...

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...you have to--you have to watch
out for all those interdependencies as well.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.210
So this is...

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it's not like it's, you know,
I mean, this isn't a secret to anybody because...

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:33.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...desktop cards have been doing
this for a long, long time.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.120
It's really...

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...only on the mobile space that
tilers are super popular.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But a lot of it is because--as
you're saying, you know, with deferred renderers--I'm

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.250
sorry, with medium renderers, you get more
predictable performance...

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's easier to reason about
what the GPU is doing.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:53.910
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:59.870
&gt;&gt;.NI-LEWIS: It's easier to do multi-pass
effect, but--and it's easier to take advantage

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:04.170
of these, you know, super long shaders that
you got too.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.760
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it doesn't mean that when
you're in much more resource constrained environment...

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:11.170
&gt;&gt;GALPIN: Yeah, it's...

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:12.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they don't shine.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:13.430
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: They don't shine, exactly.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.740
And so--and I think that--so it is interesting.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.802
So one of the thing--one of the thing that's
nice about this is, one, you see that most

00:45:17.802 --> 00:45:19.110
of the games are really well on it.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.110
I mean, honestly...

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:21.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.850
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...you know, the vast majority
of games on Android do great on the Transformer

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.700
Prime and it's really exciting also for us--the
other thing that's about Transformer Prime

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.070
is they did get Jelly Bean and it's really,
really nice.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:35.520
Like the difference in smoothness when this
guy went into Jelly Bean was huge, because

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.260
it felt fast to begin with.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.260
But as soon as we...

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I never had a real problem
with it.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.260
But--yeah, when...

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.260
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But when you see Jelly Bean on
this...

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's the same way...

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.260
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...it's like...

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...like my Galaxy Nexus when
I upgraded it to Jelly Bean, I'm like, wow.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.020
I feel like I just got a new phone.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it's because the--you know,
we did a lot of work which we're actually

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.310
really hoping to bring to you...

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:52.310
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...over the next few months.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:57.610
It just talks about how you can dejunk your
applications the same way we dejunk the operating

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:58.610
system.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.360
Mostly because all the guys did the dejunking...

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...sit, like, two cubes away
from us and...

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And then they're like, "When are
you going to do this online, dude?"

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.290
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They actually hate us and they
are like, "God, would you go away?"

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.290
But...

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, we bugged them all the time.

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:10.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...we have listening devices.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:12.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:13.940
And when we say, bugged them...

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...we mean actually microphones
in their office.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, we...

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We get all their secrets...

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: The important thing is we added
this too...

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...nothing is safe.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:20.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...called Systrays.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:22.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And Systrays is really, really
awesome.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.940
So, I'll show an example.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.750
So on one GPU, we could actually look at Systrays
since they are--the GPU is rendering here

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.930
and the thread went to sleep for this period
of time...

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:29.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:30.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...and then the GPU was rendering
here.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:31.930
Why did the thread go to sleep?

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.570
Well, the thread went to sleep because that
point we didn't read back from the GPU.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:35.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.590
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And we could say--and that was
that the entire chunk of time which we could

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:40.080
actually measure and you can see that in Systrays.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080
It was actually...

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm, exactly.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.600
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...the GPU going, "Hey, well, I'm
going to do a bunch of calculation now.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.600
This sucks."

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.600
So...

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, now, remember of course
that there's two components to any read back,

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:48.810
right?

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:53.460
There is the--there is the fact that you're,
you know, you have to stall out the GPU writing

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.460
side.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:01.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But you also have to make sure
that the resource isn't in use on either side.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.600
So it's...

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.600
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes, yeah.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, it's not just--sorry.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.840
So, you need to collect the tiles...

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.840
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and do all and, you know,
collapse your deferred renderer.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:10.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:14.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And you also need to do a synchronization
between the CPU and GPU and that's what really

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.630
kills you.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:22.580
And one thing that we've noticed with video
is that no matter how fast you are or how

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.580
good you...

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's why cache coherent CPUs
and GPUs are iconic kickass...

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, no...

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...because here's the problem...

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's not actually--it's not
actually a synchronization problem, it's more

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:36.970
a sequencing problem...

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:37.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I know.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:38.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:39.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I was just kidding.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That is--yeah, your point.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:44.800
But anyway, the problem is--or the solution
I should say...

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...is that you just never want
to have the GPU and CPU holding on to the

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.530
same resource at once.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.530
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.421
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And so--and, you know, if you're
working on a desktop part, you already know

00:47:54.421 --> 00:47:56.540
how this works because you have to deal with
PCI Synchronization...

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.540
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and the solution is staging
buffers.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:07.210
So, you don't do a read back into a texture
and then immediately use it.

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.130
You do a read back...

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:10.130
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...this frame while you're reading
the read back that you did three frames ago.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.609
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, it's actually point--one
of the things people do actually for reflection...

00:48:15.609 --> 00:48:16.609
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:18.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...is that you actually don't calculate
a reflection every frame...

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.960
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...but you use, you know, every
other frame, you know, maybe every two frames,

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.220
you know, depending on how much you're allowed.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.930
All right, well, now let's calculate reflection
and we'll apply that and that's from two frames

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:27.930
ago, but that's okay.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:28.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.110
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Because actually the user can't
really tell because on top of some other wavy

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:32.110
meshy thing and...

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right, right.

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.110
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And...

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, and a lot of it depends
of course on who is doing the read back.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean, because the problem is
that the GPU is considered to be a user of

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.430
that texture from the point that a draw call
involving it had submitted to the...

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.430
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: uh-hmm.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...point where it retires.

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.430
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:52.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, that's actually a huge length
of time that the GPU is not in fact using

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.460
the texture.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:49:01.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And in fact most of these GPUs
are executing completely serially.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.090
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:07.420
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, for instance it's no problem
for the GPU to read back a texture as long

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.590
as it's not actually writing to it right now.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:10.590
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:14.420
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But having the CPU read it back
or if you need to do any kind of processing

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.080
that involves the CPU which as you noted before...

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.080
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.713
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you don't really know because
a lot of this--the magic happens in the driver.

00:49:21.713 --> 00:49:22.713
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Inside the driver.

00:49:22.713 --> 00:49:23.713
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And each one of these...

00:49:23.713 --> 00:49:24.713
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:24.713 --> 00:49:27.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...chips is not just a self contained
magical graphics...

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:28.550
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Not at all, no.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...producing unit.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.000
It's part of an ecosystem of software that
lives in multiple places.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And--yeah.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
So, it's interesting.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
And then sometimes you actually--for some
of these effects, you actually can do them

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
entirely on the CPU, you know, like some of
the guys...

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...some of the guys, you just fake
it out.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.500
You're like, "All right, I know I've got a
problem with this geometry.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.710
Let's calculate it on the CPU.

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:45.520
Let's not even get the GPU involved and we'll..."

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, sometimes that's your best
choice, right?

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because--especially if you've
got things where you got a lot of recursion

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:52.490
and you...

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.550
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: [INDISTINCT] Oh, yeah, recursion,
yeah.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:56.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or...

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: What was that?

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, feedback, right?

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.820
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, feedback.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, so let's say you're doing
an IRR filter...

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:04.840
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:09.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...which depends on feeding back
the results of previous calculations.

00:50:09.619 --> 00:50:10.619
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:15.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, that's incredibly difficult
for a GPU to do well because...

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:16.810
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...unless you're doing entire
frame...

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.990
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...buffers at a time, right?

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.990
So, but the GPU is for like...

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.590
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, you know and that's why they
go great on these--on these newer devices.

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.900
We have some very, very powerful CPUs with,
you know, Vector processing...

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:31.900
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...built in to them, you know.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.900
Neons can do a lot of really cool stuff.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.340
So, it's--it definitely is an opportunity
to actually go and balance some of the load

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:40.512
between the CPU or GPU and especially when
you get into this tilers, you can really--you

00:50:40.512 --> 00:50:43.590
can start to guess at what they're going to
do badly and you'll usually be right.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:44.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:45.930
I think...

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:46.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:47.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And then that's it, the world's...

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:48.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Are there...

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...world record for the longest
answer to complete a long the question.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:50.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, I know.

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:51.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Next question.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:52.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:54.870
Is there anything else in the screen that's
interesting at all?

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.890
&gt;&gt; Yes, so a question from Bugsize.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:03.930
He's asking [INDISTINCT] keep pushing hardware
speed, won't programming become really easy?

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.950
No more optimizations needed?

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:10.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, it--I guess at some point,
way in the distant future.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.310
The thing is we keep pushing kind of two things.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.080
One is the expectation for quality.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.310
So, you know, while, you know, while we're
pushing more Geometer, we're pushing more

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:19.700
textures, we're pushing more layering.

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.420
And so we're keeping up the hardware.

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.420
The second thing is we're going high resolution,
you know.

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:26.461
I mean and as--and every time we go a higher
resolution, it's kind of funny we sort of

00:51:26.461 --> 00:51:28.661
take a step forward and a step back.

00:51:28.661 --> 00:51:29.661
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:30.661
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: A step forward and a step back.

00:51:30.661 --> 00:51:31.661
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:31.661 --> 00:51:33.780
Well, and so I have my own personal answer
for you.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.720
And of course the answer is yes, see JavaScript,
right?

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.260
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:45.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because--I mean, that's why we
have the web is because this incredibly inefficient

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:52.900
mode of programming that grew out of the mark
up language and an experiment in Computer

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:53.960
Science...

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.960
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...has now become capable of
running almost anything as long as you're

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:03.020
on a massively multi-core of computer with
gigabytes of RAM.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.280
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But on--and so I think that that
trend will probably continue...

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.280
&gt;&gt; GALPIN:: Yeah.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...especially now that we've
really gotten for multi-core into the desktop.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680
But here's the problem...

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: For certain class of games, I think--I
think we won't have to optimize.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:20.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, here's the problem for
mobile though, a little thing I like to call

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.410
the Laws of Physics.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.430
There is certain amount of weight you're willing
to carry in your pocket.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.620
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You cannot change the Laws of Physics.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:28.700
Thank you.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.230
I was waiting for that.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.030
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I know you were.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:33.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The--wait.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.030
That does make you evil, Scotty?

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.030
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Does, it does?

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.030
You're right.

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:37.030
All right.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:38.030
Never mind.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.030
I don't know what I...

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:40.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:41.030
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...thought I was doing there.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:42.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Anyway, the point is, so you
have a specific amount of battery.

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.030
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:46.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You have a specific size and
specific tolerant for heat.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:53.630
Now, if you've ever felt the back of let's
say a giant, you know, Mac Pro or a--one of

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:57.100
these big Windows workstations or anything
like that.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.320
You know that the type of computational power
that it takes to run let's say...

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.830
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It totally beats my house.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:03.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...[INDISTINCT] yeah.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.760
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's awesome like I don't even
need to turn on the heater at certain times.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.220
I just turn up that [MAKES NOISE]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, all I do is check my Gmail.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Boom.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.440
That's why I called it VA, right?

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:23.660
So, you know, none of that is going to take
away from the miracle that is modern computing.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.970
But to get that into the size--I mean it is
somewhat that you could...

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:29.750
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It somewhat less than [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well--right.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:36.340
And it's the same way that you can be like--well,
gee, you know, Transatlantic Ocean Liners

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:40.000
can produce huge amounts of horse powers.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.490
So, I guess we don't have to worry about designing
cars to be aerodynamic.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:48.410
Well, no, because you're never going to get
that, you know, that engine...

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:49.410
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:51.540
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...into that size and make it
work efficiently, right?

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I think on mobile it's always good
to--it's always good when you can design something

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.150
efficiently.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:57.770
You can always help the user's battery life.

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.470
You know, we--you know, sometimes the reason
why people stop playing mobile games is like,

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.740
"This game is sucking away all of my battery."

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.630
And, you know, so being more efficient is
always better.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:09.090
Now, that being said, you know, we are getting
to a point in which certain kinds of optimizations

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:10.090
aren't as important.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:11.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:12.090
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And for a lot of games.

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:13.090
I mean there's...

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Very sure.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:15.150
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There's a lot--there's a whole
series of games that just doesn't have to

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.040
care about certain things.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.350
But memory is always an important resource.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:23.580
We have a lot of devices that have, you know,
different sizes of VMs, different sizes of

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.070
actual physical memory in different amount
of stuff that's running on top of them.

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:28.550
So it's always good to be resource sensitive...

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:30.550
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...on this resource constraints...

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:31.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But there are tradeoffs, you
know.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:32.550
I mean...

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:33.550
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:34.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...sometimes you can--you can
trade memory for greater CPU.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:35.550
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's less the case than it--than
it used to be.

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:40.540
CPUs have really gotten faster, memory buses
have quite kept up...

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.790
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, I mean we can--we can--we
could make cars more sufficient today.

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:44.020
We could build them out of titanium.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.020
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But the problem is it would be
really, really, really, expensive and no one

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.220
would but them.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.220
So, you know, you...

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Except for you.

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.170
I think--don't you have titanium car now?

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:54.650
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No, I don't.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.540
But that sounds like a brilliant idea.

00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:57.540
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.540
I'm mixing you up with Sergey.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.540
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.540
Yeah, I know.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.540
People do that.

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.540
It's the beard.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.540
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, that same thing, yeah.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.540
He owns a titanium car.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.760
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, in any case, you know, so I
mean there's a point in which obviously you're--what

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.820
I'm saying is that in terms of efficiency,
there is a point in which you want to--you

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.560
have to stop and say, "Look, it's just not
worth it."

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.490
We've hit the 95 percentile of what, you know,
what we're going to get.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:20.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But I think that, you know, especially
in mobile it's a--forced us to relook at efficiency

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:22.580
and say, "You know, this is really important
stuff," which is fun because we love it to

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.580
work Computer Scientists.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.300
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And we love actually looking at
those kinds of problems.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Remember though that actually
speed is not as important as it once was.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.400
But smoothness is.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:40.510
So a lot of times, we're doing things that
don't actually increase the speed of the application.

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:45.410
What they do is they increase the responsiveness
and make certain that the animations can play

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:46.900
at 60 frames per second.

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.130
So making something twice as fast isn't hard.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:56.950
Making it consistently 60 FPS when you started
out at 15 FPS or 30 FPS is often extremely

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:57.950
difficult because...

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:58.950
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...especially if you're trying
to make it consistent, consistent.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.710
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.080
And again, if you're trying to, you know,
one of the real challenges on Android is you're

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:10.930
trying to use a very small amount of memory
targeting a very high resolution screen and

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:12.040
you are fighting the fact that you've also
have garbage collection going, that every

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.270
once in a while that's going to take 20-30
milliseconds.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:19.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love how a very small amount
of memory.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.670
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, I know.

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.670
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And is--yeah.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.990
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, like 64 megabytes of memory,
you know, is--which is...

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:30.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, right--or, you know, I
mean if we have a gig or two gigs in a device,

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.390
I mean that's like...

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I'd use to dream of that.

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, exactly.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.360
I mean I actually--I actually remember that
16 megabytes memory for a [INDISTINCT] or

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.410
for a computer was just something beyond like
that was what professional photo workstations

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:43.450
had and that was like $5,000...

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah, exactly.

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:45.450
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...worth of memory.

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:46.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: The fact that we have that for
a process--so, you know, it's always going

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.560
to take things into consideration.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.660
That's what I mean when I talk about quality,
you know, the quality keeps going up.

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.690
We keep finding ways of using those computing
resource.

00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:57.450
So I think that we're not going to be at a
time anytime soon.

00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:00.970
Maybe 20-30 years out, we're going to be able
to say, "Yeah, you know, we don't need to

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:02.450
worry about this."

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:06.670
But I think that for--we still have a pretty
long cycle before that stuff becomes unimportant.

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:07.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.400
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.910
I think--I think--is there anything else exciting?

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:14.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Anything else on the screen that's
just really knocking you out?

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.680
No?

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:16.680
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.680
All right.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, thank you for joining us.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.260
As always, vote stuff up in the moderator
page.

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.380
Let us know what you're playing.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.490
Let us know what you want us to talk about.

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:26.690
We're going to try mix up the format of the
show a little.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.260
We've got some exciting stuff coming on as
soon as we get some sleep.

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:34.311
So, thank you once again for joining us and
our friends over at [INDISTINCT].

00:57:34.311 --> 00:57:40.320
