00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.860
Would it be really bad if gravity just stopped?

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.880
I mean, what’s the worst that could happen
… C’mon.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:15.400
Hello Everyone, Crystal here for DNews asking
important questions like, do we really need

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.820
gravity? and what would happen if it just
stopped?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.830
Would we explode?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.830
Spin off into space?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.089
Or just float along looking graceful and fluid
like the astronauts on the international space

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.089
station?

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.109
Well to a certain extent, the answer is … yes.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.539
Gravity is just one of those things we all
take for granted.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.900
Breathing, death, taxes, and gravity all important,
all inevitable.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.450
I’m sure just the word gravity evokes some
distant memories of apple trees, guys in grey

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.200
wigs, and names of sciency people you remember
being important like Galileo, Newton, and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.360
Einstein, but Pop Quiz: What Is Gravity?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.840
If you ask a physicist (and I asked several)
they’ll tell you that gravity is a geometric

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.980
property of space time, as described by Einstein's
Field Equations … diffEqs anyone?, and that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.829
whole Newtonian F equals G times m one m two
over r squared thing, is a childish simplification.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.519
But what does that mean for us?

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.770
Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental
forces of nature but gravity and electromagnetism

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.810
are the big ones acting at scales relevant
to human experience.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.170
We experience Gravity as a force that keeps
us accelerating towards the most massive body

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.170
in our vicinity.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.399
In our case, that’s the earth.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.689
In the Earth’s case that’s the sun … So
scale is really important when we answer this

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:23.689
question.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.570
If gravity suddenly stopped, humans would
be fairly inconvenienced.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.069
Firstly, it would be hard for us to move around
given that we would have nothing to push against,

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.020
Newton’s laws of motion and action/reaction
would still totally be in control, so objects

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.340
in motion would stay that way and vice versa.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
I feel compelled to bring up the unrealistic
fate of George Clooney’s character in the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.259
movie Gravity so if you haven’t seen it
*spoiler alert*! … but honestly, where did

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.579
the filmmakers think the force that sent him
floating away from Sandra Bullock came from

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.579
anyway?

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:50.880
-- epic physics fail.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.569
We know humans can live through the absence
of gravity because astronauts experience something

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.850
similar all the time, so that’s not a problem.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.579
What we can’t live without is air., gravity
is the attractive force keeping our atmosphere

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.579
intact.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.570
Without gravity, our breathable air would
spring into the vacuum of space, and that

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.780
would be pretty uncomfortable for us.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.750
Honestly, we probably wouldn't really notice
because the tidal effects from our moon would

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.330
be changing so drastically that it would trigger
earthquakes, Earth would expand and become

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.850
less dense while pieces of it would be flung
off … things wouldn't be looking good.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.840
We’d be long dead, but an observer with
a galactic viewpoint would see the dissociation

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.450
of our planetary system, the death of stars,
and basically the ultimate death of the universe

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.450
as we know it.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.610
So, how important is Gravity?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.100
very, very important.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.580
Life as we know it wouldn’t exist without
it.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.250
I’d like to thank Casey Handmer in the Astrophysics
department at Caltech for input on this video.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.620
So are there any other crazy physics questions
you want us to answer?
