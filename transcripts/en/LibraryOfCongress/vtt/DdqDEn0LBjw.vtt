Congress in Washington DC.

[Music]

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.150
&gt;&gt; HIRAD DINAVARI: Hi,
I'm Hirad Dinavari,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.820
the Iranian World Reference
Specialist

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.440
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.510
I'm responsible for Persian
Language, other Iranic languages.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.260
I want to welcome you
to this amazing exhibit,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.750
1,000 Years of the Persian Book.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.830
We have a large Persian speaking
community in the Washington, DC,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.990
and California regions
which are Iranian, Afghan,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.900
and Tajik background,
and essentially live

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.110
in the United States and
this is their heritage.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.100
We are trying to show
you the background

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.850 position:56%
which is often lost in modern times.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.310
The lingua franca aspect of
Persian, a common language

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.270
of an entire region, and this
exhibit goes out of its way

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.480
to not just focus on Iran
but also show you works

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.930
and the Persian language
materials from all the areas

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.160
that use the language --
Afghanistan, Tajikistan,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.510
historically in Mughal India,
the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.260
[Music]

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.730
&gt;&gt; Persian is an Indo-European
language, actually closely related

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.300
to English, German,
French, Spanish, Hindi,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.940
and related to Sanskrit and Latin.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.320
And it is crucial to
understand that Persian is one

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.330
of the number of Iranic languages.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.290 position:56%
There are a number of languages from
the Indo-European Iranian family.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.770
Of course, Persian is
the west's best known.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.820
However Pashto, Kurdish,
Ossetic, Balochi,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.730 position:56%
these are other Iranic languages
that are related to Persian closely.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.110
And there are a number of
regional names for the language.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.440
Many Iranian Americans here have
started to use the term Farsi.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.890
In the native language
they call it Farsi as well.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.830
In Afghanistan, both
Farsi and Dari are used.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.180
So, many Afghans would refer
to the language as Dari.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.980
And under the Soviet influence
in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.580
the language is referred
to as Tajiki.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.310
In English we have a historic
name for the language and the name

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.690
in English has always been Persian.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.150
And this is why we are using
the term Persian and the Library

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.510
of Congress uses the term
Persian for the language.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.480
[Music]

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; We decided to explain the
history through the writing systems,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.710
the scripts of the language, and
we have selected three panels.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.300
First panel is an example
of the Cuneiform script.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.180
As you see, the writing
system is taken

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.890 position:56%
from ancient Mesopotamian Cuneiform.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.060 position:56%
This is the Persian that here you're
familiar with through the stories

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.440
of the Bible, Queen Esther,
King Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.510
I also want to bring to
your attention this replica

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.170
of the famous Cyrus cylinder.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.670
This was a very important
document in the ancient Near East.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.420
We are using this beautiful
replica as an example

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.270
of how cuneiform would have
been used in ancient Persian.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.060
Second panel is the Pahlavi
language, or Middle Persian.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.160
And even though it
is Middle Persian,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.330
the writing system is borrowed,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.350
or taken from the Aramaic
or Syriac language.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.220
Third panel, and the focus of
the exhibition is modern Persian,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.430
the last thousand years
plus and it written

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.900
in the modified Arabic script.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.010
But, Persian of course
has an additional number

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.720
of letters as well.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.970
And the last thousand
years, more or less,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.400
the language has been
written in this script.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.020
However, as we go through
the exhibit you will see

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.600
that modern Persian, which is
the period we are talking about.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.160
And yes, modern Persian does
go back a thousand years,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.930
which is quite an achievement --

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.580
modern Persian is also
written in additional scripts.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.970
And Jewish Persian communities did
write Persian in the Hebrew script

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.880
and the language is
known as Judeo-Persian.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.450 position:56%
So in medieval times we have a body
of literature that looks like Hebrew

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.980
but actually it's Persian
and Hebrew script.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.660
And areas that fell under czarist
Russian and then Soviet rule

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.530
in Central Asia - today's
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.650
where there are large
Persian speaking communities,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.960
experimented with writing Persian
first with the Latin script

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.010
and presently in the
Cyrillic script.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.510
Hence today, Tajik Persian
is written in Cyrillic.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.070
[Music]

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.700
&gt;&gt; I also want to showcase
this amazing map that you see.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.220
We decided not to go with the
modern map that is political

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.820
and based on nation states.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.670
We went with a thematic map
that is from the 1700's.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.140
It's a Dutch map in
the language of Latin.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.010
It's showing you the
cultural world of Persian.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.930
It shows you the areas to the
east from the Indus River,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.270
what is the border of present-day
India, all the way coming west

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.380
to the Tigris and Euphrates,
what is present-day Iraq.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.240
The areas you see in color,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.140
highlighted what is present-day
Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.350
coming up into the
Caucasus and Azerbaijan are

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.220 position:56%
where the language was spoken on a
day-to-day basis by native speakers.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.510
As we explain in the exhibition,
the Persian language was also used

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.170
as lingua franca, a language of
culture and elites extensively

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.910
for 600 years in India,
in Moghul India,

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.040
from the 1500's to the 1900's.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.920
For many centuries, it
was the official language

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.630 position:56%
of the Indian Court and the Ottoman
Empire in the west also used Persian

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.280
in addition to Ottoman
Turkish, and Arabic.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.310
Persian became a language of
literature, of historiography,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.900
and also some scientific works.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.820 position:56%
So it became an international lingua
franca to which many contributed

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.510
and it wasn't narrowly identified
with a specific ethnic group.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.090
[Music]

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.270
&gt;&gt; Every language in the world
has areas of strength and areas

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.310
in which it has excelled in.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.860
Persian is best known for
its literary tradition

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.910
and its contributions in the
fields of literature and poetry.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.140
The Shahnameh is the seminal
piece of Persian literature

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.940
that really set forth and formed
the modern Persian language

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.580
in a very substantial way.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.630
Around the 7th, 8th Century,
after Persia became part

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.540
of the Islamic world,
Persian was on the decline.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.640
The language was not being used.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.510
But by the 10th Century Eastern
parts of the Islamic Empire,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.660 position:56%
the Abbasids that ruled out of
Baghdad, became little too far flung

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.910
and Arabic was not as dominant.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.920 position:56%
Regional rulers and dynasties that
arose - the Samanids, the Saffarids,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.820
the Ghaznavids, started to
encourage the use of Persian.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.710
And this was a new modern
Persian, a Persian that was derived

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.120
from Middle Persian, from Pahlavi,
but used Arabic vocabulary,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.000
was written in Arabic script,
and the language was strengthened

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.870
by this amazing work produced
by the poet and the writer,

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.010
Firdawsi who started his
work under the Samanid court.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:49.510
And in 977, he started to
compile works and stories

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.060
from the ancient Persian,
Sasanian pre-Islamic Persia,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.020
works that were often in Middle
Persian, and he composed it

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.960 position:56%
and translated it into modern
Persian but into verse, into poetry.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.350
He created a work, the Shahnameh,

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.910
that essentially encompasses
62 stories, 990 chapters,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.190
and it is 50,000 rhyming couplets.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.620
A very important work
for modern Persian

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.790
because it set forth a
standard for modern Persian

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.950
that over the centuries
has become a blueprint

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.610
for Persian authors and writers.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.190
And this has allowed the language

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.790
to change very little
over the centuries.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.700
Today when you hand the Shahnameh
to a modern Iranian, an Afghan,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.760
a Tajik, they can easily
read it and understand it.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.080 position:56%
The Shahnameh also became a cultural
and civilizational masterpiece

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.280
that captures Persian and
a greater Iranian identity

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.340 position:56%
but is also multi-ethnic and diverse

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.930
with many different ethnic
groups represented in it,

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.410
many heroes and heroines.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.830
It is the Persian version
of the Iliad and Odyssey.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.940
It has heroes like Rustam,
the Persian Hercules.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.590
Many women heroines at a time
when women characters were scarce,

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.400
the Shahnameh is filled
with a number

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.720
of very powerful women characters.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.410
The language and the
stories became so popular

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.470
that it influenced the
neighboring languages as well

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.660
in neighboring cultures, the Turks
of Central Asia, of Azerbaijan,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.080
the Caucasus of the Ottoman
lands, the Kurds, the Pashtuns,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.610
and the Georgians, all have taken
the Shahnameh and have adapted it

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.270
to their own cultural and
linguistic traditions.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.480
We have selected from the
library's collection three

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.050
or four great examples
of Shahnamehs.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.370
The library's oldest Shahnameh is
this amazing manuscript on display.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.050
It is dated 1618 in the
back but it's believed

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.170
that the text is from 1618.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.300
The art historians who
looked at the miniatures feel

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.270
that the miniatures are older
and are in the Iranian style.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.580
The script is the Nastaliq script

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.800
which is the preferred
script for Persian writing.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.830
However, the binding, the
leather olive green binding

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.700
that the book is presently
bound in is believed to be

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.250
from the 18th Century, much
later, and from Central Asia,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.390
from the cities of
Samarkand and Bukhara.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.420
Next to it we have on the
wall an example of a page

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.350
from a Safavid Shahnameh
from 16th Century Iran,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.840
and on display we have a
regional Indian Shahnameh

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.740
from the 18th Century.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.800
The reason why we selected
these two is

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.480
because they are essentially
showing you that the content

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.290
of the Shahnameh hasn't changed

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.230
but different regions used
their own regional esthetic.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.530
On the wall you see a
classically Iranian Safavid style

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.260
from the 16th Century.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.410
In this amazing manuscript,
you see a regional Indian style

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.540
of Shahnameh book manuscript making

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.680
which uses the local
Indian esthetic.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.360
Both of them are telling
you the story of the hero,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.150
the Persian Hercules if you
like, Rustam and his battles

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.120
with the various demons, the Div.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.370
Here on the wall you see
Rustam battling Div-i Akavan

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.240
and Div-i Akavan has picked up
Rustam while he's sleeping and is

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.680
about to toss him into the sea.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.880
Below in the Indian manuscript,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.120
you're seeing Rustam slaying
the white demon or the white Div

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.720
as his mythic horse Rakhsh is
watching from beyond the mountain.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.490
Next we have a lithographic
Shahnameh, and lithography

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.640 position:56%
and Shahnamehs became very important
because many of the early works

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.030
of lithography in Persian
that were produced in India

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.070
and in Iran itself later,
were essentially Shahnamehs.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:45.220
Now the stones for this original
work were produced in 1906

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.410
and the book was published
in India in the city of Pune.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:53.620 position:56%
But this edition which was a gift to
the library by the Mehrizi family,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.470
is a reprint from 1913 but produced

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.570
by the Parsi Zoroastrian
community of India.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.930
The Parsi community of
India very much feels

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.270
that the Shahnameh is a book
that captures the ancient glory

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.080
of pre-Islamic Persia,
because the stories

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.000
and the tales are all based
in pre-Islamic Persia.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.390
Even though the Shahnameh isn't
technically an Islamic work,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.140
to the Zoroastrian community it
is revered and seen as a work

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.380
that captures their
heritage and history.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.980
And the book has in the
front a page with the image

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.840
of the Prophet Zoroaster, and an
additional chapter has been added

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.710 position:56%
to the end of all the great
notables and important personalities

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.740
of the Indian Parsi community.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.490
Similarly we have another
page from a Georgian Shahnameh

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.810
that has been enlarged and put on
display to show you how the region

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.460
and neighboring cultures
also took the Shahnameh

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.510
and adapted it to their
own traditions.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.090
[Music]

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.470
&gt;&gt; Classical Persian
literature has evolved over time.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.770
Of course the first style or genre

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.380
that is important is the panegyric
epic style of the Shahnameh,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.640
which started in the east
of what is now Persia -

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.190
areas that are today
essentially Afghanistan,

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.170
Tajikistan, and Central Asia.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.850
It's also referred to
as the Khurasani style.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.830
The Khurasan is the eastern
Persian lands and that's the style

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.080
in which both the Shahnameh
and the works

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.180
of the great poet,
Rudaki are produced in.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.770
Later, by the 13th Century, the
center of focus moves westward

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.410 position:56%
to the area presently known as
western Iran or at the time referred

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:49.980
to as 'Iraq-i 'Ajami if you like,
Western Persia or Persian Iraq.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.780
It is this region that you have
the lyrical Sufi mystical style

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.980
of Persian poetry that evolves.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.730 position:56%
By the 15th/16th Century, so much
Persian was being produced in India,

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.430
that a new genre of
Persian is developed

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.810
and it is essentially the
Persian that is developed

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:10.050
out of Indian Mughal Court
known as the Sabk-i Hindi

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.430
or the Indian style of Persian.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.150
If we had to roughly
divide our Persian

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.130
into three styles these
three would be it.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.570
But, this is an over-generalization
- there are many styles of Persian.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.580 position:56%
But, these three are the largest
subcategories that exist in Persian.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.330
The grandfather if you like, or the
founding father of Persian Poetry

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.100
in many ways is the poet, Rudaki.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.500
Rudaki predates the great poet
Ferdowsi who wrote the Shahnameh.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.090
But he does come from the same
period, the Samanid period

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.600
around the 7th/8th Century.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.030
To honor him, I have
selected a modern work

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.320
of his poetry from Tajikistan.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.210
Since he is today a hero and
an icon of Tajik society,

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.250
this Tajik book beautifully
captures his works both

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.690
in the Arabic Persian script used
in Iran and Afghanistan but also

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.980
in the Tajik Persian
script in Cyrillic.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.250
And it also has a Russian
translation next to it.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:17.160
The tradition of the lyrical
Sufi style of Persian poetry

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.560
or 'Iraq-i 'Ajami, is a style in
which a number of poets wrote in.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.130
Of course Omar Khayyam
was one of them.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.890
But, the great poet, Rumi who wrote

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.810
in this lyrical and
mystical Sufi style.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.130
In many ways he is the
maestro of this genre.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.090 position:56%
From the city of Shiraz, the city of
poets, we have the great poet S'adi

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.810
and the great poet Hafiz.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.060
Both of them wrote in
this lyrical style.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.490
Continuing with the regional
styles of Persian manuscripts,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.330
you have a Safavid Persian
manuscript from Iran

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.410
that captures beautifully the
esthetics of Safavid Persia

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.830
with very ornate illuminated
gold leaf.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.150
This book known as Licit Magic

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.450
by the famous Shirazi poet
Ahli-yi Shirazi, is the manuscript

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.880
that we have used for the banner

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.500
of the exhibition and
the brochure cover.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.930
And it shows you a uniquely
16th Century Iranian style.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.970
For the great poet Nizami, who
also wrote in this lyrical style,

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.860
we chose to go with a
Kashmiri Indian work

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.650
of his famous work, the Khamsah.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:31.090
The Khamsah or the Quinary is
a long series of five stories.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.750
And Nizami is a great poet
from the city of Ganjah

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.060
which today the Azerbaijanis
essentially have made

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.600
in their national icon and hero.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.570 position:56%
Another great Persian author that in
recent years has become very popular

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.160
with American audiences is
the great Persian poet, Rumi.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.250
Rumi is a poet that
essentially was born in an area

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.640
that is present-day Afghanistan
(near Tajikistan as well.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.220 position:56%
Over the years he lived in Nishapur,
Iran, what is present-day Iran,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.800
and Baghdad, and Damascus, what
are present-day Iraq and Syria,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.140 position:56%
and he settled in Konya, what is
today's Turkey, and is buried there.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.900 position:56%
Oldest manuscript here is from 1441.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.680
It is the Rumi manuscript that's
on display, it is believed

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.560
to have been produced in Shiraz.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.230
Although some have also said

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.590
that it could be a work
from the city of Herat.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.880
We have on display the great poet,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.690
Sanai from what is now
Ghazni in Afghanistan.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.300
The lithographic work
that you're seeing here

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.760
by Sanai is actually produced in
India but the reason why we have it

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.710
on display is because this use of
calligraphy in the shape of animals

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.590
and birds is something
that didn't start in India,

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.920
it started in Ottoman lands
in what is now Turkey.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.260
It became a style that became so
popular it traveled all the way

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.790
to India and even though the poet
comes from what is now Afghanistan

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.700
and the work is produced in India,

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.410
the esthetics did come
out of what is Turkey.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.780
It's showing you the
dialogue and conversation

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:13.180
of this vast region all being
conducted in the Persian language

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.940
and a common style and
esthetic that is developing.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:22.170 position:56%
From Central Asia, we have the great
love story of Yusuf and Zulaikha.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.190
In English, Joseph and Potiphar's
wife from the biblical tale.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:31.120
And this Central Asian manuscript
shows you the elaborate colorful

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.400
designs of Central Asia in which
they use borders and bright orange

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.340
and purple and green and colors
that are not so prevalent in Iran.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.840
All of them showing you
the diversity of manuscript

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.880
and Persian bookmaking from a
range of territories stretching

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.450
from Ottoman lands to
the Indian subcontinent.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.920
The interest in Persian
literature in Europe

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.950
and the United States really
began in the 18th/19th Century.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.030
By the early 20th Century
in the United States,

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.920
the famous Edward Fitzgerald
had created

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.380
and produced this amazing
translation of the Rubayat

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.650
of Omar Khayyam, which became a
bestseller in the United States

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.740
and really captivated American
audiences with Persian literature.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.220
On display from our rare books
collection, we have a translation

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.110
of the Rubayat by Edward Fitzgerald
with the beautiful paintings

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.810
of Arthur Szyk, the famous
Jewish American painter

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.830
of the Washington Haggadah.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.050
Despite maintaining a
uniquely Arthur Szyk style,

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.540
beautifully captures the
essence and touch and feel

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.510
of Persian miniature
painting as well.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.060
[Music]

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.690
&gt;&gt; When you speak of
classical Persian literature,

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.050
mainly the genre is poetry.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.790
Poetry became a very important
force not just for literature.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.610
It's crucial to understand works
that were based on philosophy,

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:02.790
religion, science even, history,
were often delivered in verse.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:07.150
For religion, it was crucial
that we showcase the diversity

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.800
of the religious and
philosophical traditions

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.330
of the larger Persian-speaking
world.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.490
We decided to showcase
the region in two sections

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.830 position:56%
in a timeline - eastern and western.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.430
For the western regions,

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.420
which essentially today would
be the Caucasus, western Iran,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.750
and parts of Mesopotamia,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:32.430
we are showcasing how the
ancient near eastern traditions,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.660
Mesopotamian traditions
mix in with the Iranian

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.760
and Indo-European traditions.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.020
In the eastern regions, what is
today eastern Iran, Khurasan,

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.990
Central Asia, and Afghanistan,

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.010
we are showing how the
Indian traditions mix

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.120
in with the local Indo-Iranian
or Iranic traditions.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.060
From there, the next major
faith traditions that come

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.550
into the area are the Jewish and
Christian traditions which come

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.960
in through Mesopotamia followed by
Islam which came in through Arabia

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.200
and equally influenced both the
western and eastern regions.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.360
However, in the eastern
regions, Buddhism

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.460 position:56%
and Hinduism also make an impact as
we have seen with the great Buddha's

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.710
of Bamiyan and Afghanistan and the
great Buddha's and Buddhist culture

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.650
of central Asia and
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:35.600
After the coming of
Islam in the 8th Century,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.680
within 200 years a
mystical form of Islam,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.670
Sufi Islam develops
in the entire region.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.200
And within another couple hundred
years we have the first form

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.910
of Shiite Islam or the
Ismaili path that develops.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:57.430
And then by the 1600's and what
is Safavid Iran, parts of Iraq,

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.810
and Azerbaijan, the western region
of the Persian speaking lands,

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.500
the Twelver form of Shiite
Islam becomes dominant.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.430 position:56%
And that's the Twelver form that is
now dominant in this region as well.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.410
However in the Eastern regions,
Afghanistan and Central Asia,

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.340
people predominantly remain Sunni.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.270
By the 19th Century in Iran
in the western regions,

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.700
we also have the Bahai'
faith that blossoms.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.120
All of these faith traditions

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.190 position:56%
that I mentioned are still presently
practiced there in the region.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.540
We have a selection of wonderful
manuscripts and lithographs,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.560
modern printed materials here to
showcase this rich, religious,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:42.030
and philosophical tradition in the
greater Persian speaking lands.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:46.790 position:56%
The dominant religion of this region
is Islam so we selected a number

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:52.090
of items that are on basic Islamic
tradition across all denominations.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.070
We have a book of morning prayers

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:00.120
that you see there ornately
illuminated in the Persian style.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.420
Next to it we have a Quran

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.950
from Iranian Azerbaijan
region in the Iranian style.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.120
Next to it we have a
lithographic book published

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.380
by the Royal Publishing House
of Kabul for all the judges

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:20.740
in Afghanistan for practicing Sunni
and Hanafi branch of Sunni Islam.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:26.680
We have a Sufi Treatise here that
you see from 1520, and this comes

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.600
from Afghanistan or Iran, and
essentially the Sufi material tends

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.550
to be predominantly
in Persian language.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.780 position:56%
The earlier works that we discussed,

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.650
because they are scriptural,
are in Arabic language.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.760
And according to Islamic law,
scripture cannot be translated

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.190
into other languages, it has to
remain in the original Arabic.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.690
But as soon as you enter the
realm of mystical Sufi works,

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.860
Persian becomes dominant and often
it's delivered through poetry.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.600
Lithography or essentially
in Persian, Chap-i Sangi,

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.360
which is prints made from stone,
stone prints, were introduced

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.870
to the region in the
mid 19th Century.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.430
Earlier on, printing press
modern prints did come to Iran.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.250
It was introduced by
the Armenian community.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.090
However, printing did not
become popular in the region

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.490
because calligraphy was a
high art that was very valued

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.690
and the printing press
didn't capture the beauty

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:29.160
of the calligraphy or allow
for the illustrations.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.560
But lithography, which are
prints that are done on stone,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.100
became very crucial because they
allowed the beautiful esthetics,

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.550
the beautiful calligraphy, and
the illustrations to be continued.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.720
And here you have showcased three
pieces that are clearly Iranian

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.470
and Shiite, and I would
like to bring your attention

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.360
to this beautiful lithography
from Iran.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.370
And as you see, this is discussing
metaphysical and mystical concepts

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:01.620
of awareness and consciousness.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.740
You see in this circular
form human depictions

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.590 position:56%
that are upside down and sitting up.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.890
The areas that are upside down

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.190
and that are dark represent the
subconscious mind and the areas

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.690
where people are sitting
up is the aware mind.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.880
Next to it you see in
a circular spiral form,

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.390
like a staircase going deep
down, down, and further down,

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.150
different layers of awareness.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.360
Each layer has been categorized,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.290
it has been given a name
and the use of gold ink.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.100
Now remember, these are lithographs

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.030
and lithographs are essentially
prints made from stone.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.470
The use of gold in
lithography is not easy

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.240
and as you see this is a beautiful
representation and you also see

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.530
in the Iranian tradition of
lithography, there is a number

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.640
of human figurines which is
quite unique in many ways

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.080
to the Iranian lithographic
tradition.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:57.890 position:56%
Next to it, we have two great Shiite
pieces, the words and the writings

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.840
of 'Ali, the son in law
of the prophet Muhammad.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.580
And for the Shiites,
he being the son in law

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.640
and the first Imam,
he's very revered.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.750
And these books would be items
that would be usually used

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.500
as prayer books on the gravesite
or the mausoleum of 'Ali

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.380
in various Shiite religious
sites of Iraq.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.820
The one item on top
is an interlinear.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.950
Starting in the 1500's
or a little earlier,

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.970
a tradition of writing Arabic
prayers with a Persian explanation,

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.840
became popularly known
as interlinears

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.260
in which the Arabic
original prayer was written

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.880
in the bold Naskh script.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.990
And underneath it in
the Nastaliq script,

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.260
the Persian explanation was
there for Persian speakers

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.740
to understand the Arabic content.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.230
Another tradition that
comes out of the Iranian

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.030
and other spiritual
practices is the Bahai' faith.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:27:00.820 position:56%
And at the very top you see a modern
publication from Germany in Persian

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.020
of heavenly verses by
Bahá'u'lláh, morning

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.840
and evening prayers
for the faithful.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.130
The most ancient religion of
the Persian-speaking world

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.490
that has survived of course
is the Zoroastrian faith.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:20.770
The Zoroastrian faith is native
to greater Persia and the Gathas,

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.910
the holy scriptures have survived.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.830
The Gathas are the oldest
examples of religious poetry

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.880
and were written in Old Persian.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.650
Here we have a book from the
Zoroastrian Parsi community

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.950
of India.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.950
This book has the Gathas in the
Middle Persian language of Pahlavi

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:42.450
and next to it you have a
modern Persian translation.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.350
Beside it, I have from the
ancient Christian community

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:51.390 position:56%
of northwest Iran, the Urmia region,
today referred to as the Assyrians,

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.720
the book of Ewangeliyon or
the four books of the gospels.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.960
The language used is Aramaic,
and present day Assyrians

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.190
in Iran still speak Aramaic.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.780
The Assyrians historically
were known as Church

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.990
of the East or Nestorians at times.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.010
And they have been in the
region since the biblical times.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.560
The language, Aramaic is
crucial to understand,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.460
it was a lingua franca
of pre-Islamic Persia.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.030
Pre-Islamic Persia, both under
the Parthians and Sassanians,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.850
encouraged the use of Aramaic
because it was a language

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.260
that was used in the
entire empire and beyond.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:33.310
Therefore, its writing system
influenced Persian itself.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.370
As you see, middle
Persian here, Pahlavi,

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.060
is written in a script
based on Aramaic

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.490
and similarly the large Jewish
community that lived in Mesopotamia

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.440
from the period in
which the Talmudic works

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.570
and writings were developed
onwards to the Jewish communities

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.560
who ended up living in Persia.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.180
Aramaic also became important
in the Jewish tradition.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.240
So right next to the Ewangeliyon,
from the Assyrian community,

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.740
I have a modern Psalms of
David in both modern Persian

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.720
and the original Hebrew produced by
Ayatollah Masumi Tehrani in Iran.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.360
All of these faiths were
interconnected in the ancient world

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:19.510
and Aramaic was an important
language of that time.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:25.040
[Music]

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.500
&gt;&gt; There are a number of important
works in the Persian language

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.970
that essentially are on subjects
such as science and historiography.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.910
I would like to give a little
background on the importance

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.990
of how language interplays here.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.380
From around the 7th
to the 10th Century,

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.140
modern Persian was still evolving

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.280
and Arabic had become
the lingua franca.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.690
Many Persian scholars,
historiographers,

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:57.580
and scientists wrote their
works in the Arabic language.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.400
These works later on were
translated into modern Persian.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.540
But, what's also crucial is Persia
itself was a center of science

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.550
and technology and historiography
prior to coming of Islam

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.090
in the middle Persian
language of Pahlavi.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.380
From the 7th to the 10th Century,
especially in the city of Baghdad

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:23.330
under the Abbasid rule for a number
of centuries, the great works

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:29.490
of Aramaic, ancient Sanskrit,
Greek, Middle Persian, Pahlavi,

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:35.080
and other ancient languages were
all translated into modern Arabic.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.210
Arabic plays an important
role here because it ended

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:43.150
up preserving middle Persian
works like the Kal lah wa Dimnah

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.410
that otherwise would have been
lost to modern Persian-speakers.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.950
Subsequently by the 10th/11th
Century many of these works

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.400
that were now in Arabic,
were translated

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.100
from Arabic into modern Persian.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.760
And it's crucial to understand the
interesting play of language here.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.760
In Iran and Central Asia, Arabic
remained an important language

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.340
for scientific and
religious writings.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.890 position:56%
So you would see science
manuscripts produced in Iran as late

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.670
as the 18th/19th Century in Arabic.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.650
However, as Persian
became the lingua franca

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.860
of the Indian Mughal court
and the language of culture

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.330
in the Mughal court, in India
from the 16th Century onwards,

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:28.130
you see a large number of
Persian language manuscripts

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.630
on science and history.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.300
Far more, you could argue,
science manuscripts in Persian came

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.830
out of India in some
ways that actually came

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.550
out of Iran or Persia itself.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:43.180
I have a number of
wonderfully illustrated

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.920
and beautiful manuscripts
and lithographs

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.640
that represent the
scientific tradition

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.420
in the Persian speaking lands.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.490
The first example over
there is from Afghanistan,

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:57.280
produced by two Pashtun commanders
from the Durrani ruling elite

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.950
of Afghanistan who have created
this amazing book on medicinal

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.330
and herbal plants known
as 'Amal-i Salihin.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.970
Now the book is a lithograph
and because it's fairly late

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:12.560
in the 19th Century, it has
an amazing index on the side

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.980
and the index lists all the
primary and secondary sources

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.300
that went into the creation of it.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.580
Next to it from Tabriz Iran, we
have a book on human anatomy.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.850
This amazing lithograph focuses
on different parts of the body

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:31.690
and it really is intended to be
used as a textbook or a manual

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.710
in the Dar al-Funun
University in Tehran

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.060
for educating young
doctors or physicians.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.100
The book is filled with these
amazing fairly modern illustrations

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.060 position:56%
and various parts of the human body.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.380
Here you see depicted is the
dissection of the lower half

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:53.380
of a woman's body and
next to it we have a work

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:57.350
that showcases the interplay of
language I was discussing earlier.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.970
The author Qazvini, who
is of Persian origin,

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:05.780
has created this amazing work
known as "The Marvels of Creation

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.640
and Oddities of Existence."

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.440
The work was originally
written in Arabic

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.420
which was the lingua
franca of the time.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.760
However, the library is proud
to have this in manuscript form

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.020
in the Arabic original,
in the Persian translation

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.370
which you see showcased here
and even in Ottoman Turkish.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.330
We have it in three languages.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:29.910
The Persian version is beautifully
illustrated and has an amazing map

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.980
and it shows you oceans
and continents

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.640
and wild beings, et cetera.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.470
We have an example of geographic
surveys which is a tradition

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.510
that started in Baghdad, actually
by the scholar Yaqut originally

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.410
in Arabic but became popular
through the Islamic lands.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.230
Here you see a Persian
lithographic version of it

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.770
from the Nasir al-din Shah period.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.490
And showcased on display I have
selected the city of Baghdad

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.150
because Baghdad is a great
place where both Persian

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.050
and Arabic culture came together.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:06.590
You see depicted the ancient
Sasanian Persian palace

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:10.500
of pre-Islamic times and you see
a map of the Tigris, Euphrates

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.300
and the city of Baghdad
during the Islamic period.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:19.640 position:56%
Next to it we have a manuscript from
India and this is a great example

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.690
of Persian manuscripts from
India not produced by an Indian,

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.520
a Persian, a Turk, or an Arab.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.980
The author, James Skinner
is actually British

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.460
and these were the British
dignitaries and personalities

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.800
in the Mughal court in India
who had learned the language

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.810
and were communicating
and writing in Persian

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.760
because that was the
language of the court,

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.730
and produced amazing manuscripts.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.810
This book discusses the
various castes and kinsfolk

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:48.970
of the Indian subcontinent
and the trades

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.000
and technologies they
were involved in.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.190
You are seeing a group
of papermakers

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.780
in the Indian style here,
and this book itself is

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.900
from our Rare Books collections
at the library and part

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.700
of the Rosenwald Collection.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:07.360
[Music]

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; On the subject of history, one of
the most famous works by the scholar

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:17.930
of Persian origin, Tabari, is his
famous history Tarikh-i Tabari.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:23.450 position:56%
Many historians in the period of the
9th/10th Century wrote in Arabic.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.900
However, Tabari's work
was of such importance

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.000
that it was translated a couple
of centuries later by Bal'ami

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.380
and the manuscript on display
is Bal'ami's translation

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.150
of Tabari's history.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:40.530
And many manuscripts were broken
up and various pages were sold

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.280
to different institutions.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.580
What we are trying to do

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.150
at the library is virtually
reconnect manuscripts

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.370
that have been broken up.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.290
Other works of history that are on
display are lithographic pieces.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.980
We have a book produced by the
Parsi Indian community known

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.870
as the "Monuments of Persia."

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:02.840
It showcases beautifully the
latest work of archeology

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.470
that was being done in
the 18th/19th Century

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.370
by western archeologists in Persia.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:13.270 position:56%
So many of these works were produced
in lithographic form in India,

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.620
in modern Persian, to essentially
educate and bring knowledge

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.920
to Persian speakers
around the world.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.350
Next to it, we have a lithographic
book known as Kuliyat-I Riyazi.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.940
The page on display is on
current events, current history.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.380
It showcases portraits from
recent Iranian kings ranging

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.540
from Nadir Shah to the last
Qajar king on the throne in Iran.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:43.270
But simultaneously underneath, you
have two rows of Afghan Barakzai

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.510
and Durrani kings showing you side
by side Persian-speaking kings

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.480
from Iran and Afghanistan
and the formation

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.670
of the modern nation states
of Iran and Afghanistan.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.960
Similarly we have a memoir
by the Amir of Bukhara,

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.260
from what is now Uzbekistan.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.400
At the time, Bukhara was being
fought over in Central Asia

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.860
by the czarist Russian forces.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:12.060
The memoir known as "The Anguish
of Nations", "Huzn-i Milal,"

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.400
is an account by the
Amir of the troubles

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.170
that the Central Asian
populations were having

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.870
with the czarist Russians.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.580
It is beautifully done
in lithographic form.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.010
The map and the photography
is modern French,

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.310
the binding is western.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.250
However, the lithography is in
the traditional classical form.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.870
A whole genre of travel
literature that had started

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:38.970 position:56%
with Europeans coming to the Islamic
world, set forth a whole tradition

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.970
of historiography known
as Safarnamehs

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.780
in the Persian-speaking world.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.190
Safarnameh are travel
letters or travel books.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.570
This time a number

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.850
of Persian-speaking elites
including this example

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:56.050
of Muzaffar al-Din Shah Qajar
or the Qajar King of Iran,

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:00.700
they traveled to Europe and they
wrote their memoirs and stories

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.360
about their visits to Europe.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.640 position:56%
The book however is a very good
example of early printing in Persian

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.720
and it is essentially known
as Chap-i Surbi in Persian,

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.720
or lead prints, produced
by single typeset.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.890
And here you have an interesting
example of early printing.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.170
The library's most exquisite
Persian language book

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:27.400
of historiography is this amazing
precious manuscript of the rule

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.500
of Shah Jahan, the famous
Mughal emperor of India

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.320
who produced the famous Taj Mahal.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.750
The book is compiled of two
parts, the Padishahnameh

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.200
which is the first 10
years of Shah Jahan's rule,

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.810
and the Shah-Jahan Nameh, which is
the remaining years of his rule.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:48.500
The book is an amalgam or a
mixture of Mughal Indian styles

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.460
with Safavid Persian styles with
Western European influence as far

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.690
as perspective and art design.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:58.620
It's beautifully illuminated
with gold, lapis, and turquoise.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.020
Almost every other page is jeweled

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.650
with precious metals
and precious stones.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:09.590
It is from 1825 and it
is a perfect example

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.280
of Persian from the Indian world.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:17.510
It is a part of the Rosenwald
Collection from Rare Books.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:22.070
[Music]

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:26.210
&gt;&gt; Persian in the Indian style
is another very important style

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.600
that develops in the
15th/16th Century.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.750
And of course the great poet,
Bidil is a great example of that.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.190
Here in the 18th/19th
Centuries we have a legacy

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:38.680
of Indian style Persian that
continues with a variety of poets

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.870
from the Indian subcontinent.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:45.770
We have on display the works of
the great poet Ghalib and Iqbal.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.300
Their Persian works are very
important for two reasons.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.970
In addition to being a
continuation of the Indian style,

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:57.610 position:56%
they also happen to be capturing
the modernity trend which was coming

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.980
in from the west and Europe.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:04.150
Similarly in Afghanistan, we
have on display a great book

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.690
by the founding father in
many ways of the Tarzi family.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.320
A great Pashtun family
that brought modernity

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.110
and advancement to Afghanistan.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.750
And the anthology is
in the Shahnameh style

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:23.230
and it is written beautifully in
the Khurasani style of Persian

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.960
and it's showing you the
use of Persian styles

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.360
across the different regions.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.630 position:56%
Moving onwards, the library's most
exquisite Iranian Persian manuscript

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:38.300
is the small pocket-sized
manuscript with a lacquer binding.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.190
All the paintings are done
with a single haired brush,

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.300
but it's a book selection of all
the choicest of Persian poems.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.150
It's the great poems
of S'adi, Hafiz, Jami,

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:53.000
and other great poets coming all
the way down to the 19th Century.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.050
The handwriting is in the
Shikastah script, which is a script

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.580
that develops later in the
Persian-speaking world,

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:03.030
and it is a perfect
example of the love affair

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.540
of Persian speakers with poetry.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:10.480
Last but not least is a tradition
of bookbinding making from Iran,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.480
this is from Qajar Iran and it
illustrates the use of leather

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.840
and gold but there's
also a tradition

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.110
of lacquer bookbinding making.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.910
But around the same time,
around the 19th Century,

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.210
new trends come into the region.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.960
You have the great author raj
M rz , who in Iran starts

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.700
to write Persian in
colloquial everyday language.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:35.020
Next to it in Central Asia, you
have Sadriddin A n who starts

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.900
to write novels and short
stories and is seen as the father

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.180
of Tajik Persian literature.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:44.580
In the Caspian region of Iran,
Nima Yushij starts to write poetry,

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.800
this time free verse,
influenced by his Tabari roots,

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.170
which is a regional dialect.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:54.000
He creates a genre of
Persian poetry, a new genre,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.640
which didn't use any of the old
rhyme schemes and structures.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.410
And similarly in Afghanistan,
Khalilullah Khal l the great poet

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.210
of Afghanistan, also starts

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.720
to produce Persian
language free verse poetry.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:12.030
Short story writer, Jam lz dah
who lived in Europe many years,

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.280
starts the genre of short
stories with famous works like

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.210
"Once Upon a Time" and
"Persian is Sugar."

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:23.040 position:56%
This is the time in which works have
been produced for mass audiences.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.410
Education of the masses
begin to become important,

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:31.840
and you see a number of regional
writers and authors come about.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.180
And what is interesting is there's
no central court necessarily

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.700 position:56%
for which the authors are producing,

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.750
but the main focus
becomes the public square.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.570
And regional styles and
modern styles influenced

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.630
by the west also come about.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:53.880
These styles begin to form in what
is now today, the Iranian form

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.510
of Persian, Afghan form of
Persian, and Tajik form of Persian.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:03.520
[Music]

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.220
&gt;&gt; Women writers and
authors have been present

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.840
in Persian speaking lands
for many, many centuries.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.620
There is this notion that somehow
women have not been active.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.920
It is true that oftentimes in
medieval times women writers were

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.150
of elite backgrounds
or were royalty.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.810
But, we have a number of
women authors showcased here

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:29.240
from the great poetess R bi'a
Balkhi from the city of Balkh

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.590
who wrote at the same time
as Firdawsi and Rudaki

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:36.760
when they wrote the Shahnameh
in the 9th/10th Centuries.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.070
And we have other great
poets displayed here.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.610
The famous Indian princess,
Zeb-un-Nissa who wrote

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:46.020
under the pen name, The Hidden
One, and whose works were banned.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.240
Her father had imprisoned her
for 20 years for her works.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.940
Today the Tajik nation has fallen
in love with her works and many

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.620
of her works have been
turned into pop songs.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:02.850 position:56%
So, on display we have Tajik edition
of her poems and it essentially says

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:08.030
in Tajiki "101 Odes"
by Zeb-un-Nissa.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.830
The library's oldest book

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.670
by a Persian-speaking woman
is this beautiful lithograph

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.130
from the Afghan Queen and Princess,

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.350
' yisha Durr n
and it's from 1881.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.660
And this important
woman was the first

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.060
to start a women's
school in Afghanistan.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:31.930
And she essentially represented
a new trend of modernity coming

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.810
to Afghanistan in the period.

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.110
Similarly in Iran, you
have the great poetess,

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:41.890
Táhirih Qurrat al-`Ayn who in
many ways wanted to reform society

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.180
and became very controversial.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:47.070
Many of her works have been
destroyed but we have here

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.870
on display the works
that have survived

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.920
and have been translated
into English.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.640
The great poet, Parv n Etesami
from Iran who wrote beautifully

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.190
in the classical style
and is often compared

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.180
to the classic poets
of the medieval era.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.610
The new trendsetters
and modernizers.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:07.790
From Iran we have the author Simin
Danishvar, the great novelist.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:13.370
From Tajikistan we have the
great author and poet, scholar,

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.860
Gulrukhsor Safi, a great
scholar of Persian literature.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.940
This is one of her latest
anthologies Shulah Dar Sang,

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.060
"The Flames from the
Stone," in Tajik Persian.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:27.470
The great poetess, Simin Behbahani
who you have first edition

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:30.120
of her first anthology, Ja-yi Pa,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.320
"Footprint" that the library
has in its collections.

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.580
The library also has a first
edition of "Another Birth"

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.900
by the great poetess
iconoclast Fur gh Farrukhz d,

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.620
probably the best-known woman
poet of the Persian language.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.240
And she is a very important author

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.750
that has been translated
into 16, 17 languages.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.550
Similarly we have the
author, Shahrnush Parsipur

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:57.630
who has written many novels
in the magical realist style.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.710
A number of her works
have been translated.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:04.280
One book, "Women without Men,"
has become a feature film here

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.350
and has been turned into a movie.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:09.960
And of course we have a book
from the Armenian Iranian author,

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.670
Zuya Pirzad, who has won
several awards in Iran

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.030
and often her stories deal
with stories about Christian

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:18.940
and Armenian traditions
and characters

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.540
that are of Armenian background.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.200
She's become very popular in Iran

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.260
and is outselling many
men in the marketplace.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.050
We have on display here a range
of authors including a page

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.750
from the Quran, the chapter
on women, S ratu an-Nis .

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.780
This 13th Century chapter
on women is quite important

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.870
because it shows you a very
archaic old form of Persian

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:44.360
in which the dots and diacritics
have not been set in place yet.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.730
I really recommend that you look
at the website and read in detail

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:49.420
about each one of these women.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.080
They're all very important starting
with the great poetess R bi'a

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.290
in the 10th Century,
all the way to the 21st.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:00.500
Mind you that this is just a
small selection of women authors.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.040
There were literally hundreds
from all three of these countries

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.510
and beyond and it was very hard
to reduce to such a small number.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:14.330
[Music]

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.930
&gt;&gt; Here we have showcased a
number of Iranian, Afghan,

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.050
and Tajik contemporary authors.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.220
I'm not going to get into
detail on each author

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.410
because they all have
lengthy biographies

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.350
and I really recommend
you read the descriptions

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:26.950
on each one of these titles.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:31.170 position:56%
I would just like to showcase the
great writers and poets of this era.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.740 position:56%
The great Sadiq Hidayat, who started
a whole new genre of prose writing

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.990
and really changed Persian prose.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:40.970
Similarly, the father of modern
Persian poetry, Ahmad Shamlu.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:45.360
The great novelist Sadiq Chubak,
who wrote beautiful novels

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.130
that were really focused on details

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.510
and were a new genre
of novel writing.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.480
Short story writer, Samad Bihrangi,

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.830
his "Little Black Fish" has
become essentially a sensation

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.670
and translated into English.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:02.000 position:56%
The great painter, Suhrab Sepehri
who took Buddhists and Sufi thoughts

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.090 position:56%
and delivered it in free verse
poetry but using nature as his theme

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.090
or muse for delivering the poems.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:15.340
Other great authors of the time
from Iran, have three critics

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.210
of society and social trends.

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:21.770
Jalal al Ahmad, who wrote about
the influence of western culture

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:25.870
in '60s Iran, with his famous
book "Westoxification."

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:30.720
Akhavan Salis who essentially
writes from a voice from the past,

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.760
a voice from the Shahnameh
or the Holy Book of Avista,

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.960
looking at modern times and
looking at society in the present

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.250
but from a view from the past.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:43.340
Or a great writer, Dawlat' b d
who would essentially be the voice

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.400
of a peasant or a villager in his
famous series of novels Kalidar,

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.190 position:56%
in which as a Kurdish peasant coming
to town, he is exploring modernity

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:56.520
and looking at things from the
prism of a small towns person.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.230
Then other genres that have
developed from Tajikistan,

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:04.930
the great poet Loiq Sheral , who
essentially writes Persian poetry

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.360
but with a uniquely Tajik
identity and nationalistic twist.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.980
From Iran, the humorist writer, "My
Uncle Napoleon" is his famous work,

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.730
Iraj Pezeshkzad who you
see on display here.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.250
This work has been translated and
also been turned into a TV series.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:22.110
From Afghanistan, the great writer,

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:26.150
Sultanzadeh who essentially
writes often about exile

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:32.510
and lamenting life not being
in his homeland of Afghanistan.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:36.940
[Music]

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:41.030
&gt;&gt; One of the oldest traditions
of literary works is of course,

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.710
the genre of storytelling.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:45.610
Going back to the stories
our grandmothers told us

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:50.170
in Persia growing up or the famous
tales that have now been passed

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:53.540
on century after century starting
from Gilgamesh all the way

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:57.210
down to the modern
stories of the Middle East.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:01.210
One of these rich traditions is of
course the stories of the Thousand

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.120
and One Nights, here also
known as the Arabian Nights.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:09.400
On display we have a lithographic
Persian version put to verse,

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.350
known as the Hizar Dastan,
"A Thousand Nights."

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:16.840
And we have an amazing example of
a 19th Century lithographic style

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.870
in this "Thousand and
One Nights" genre.

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:22.770
Of course the heroine of
it, Sheherazad was Persian

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.540
and the villain also
Shahriyar, was Persian.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.610
Another great storyteller

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:31.770
of the medieval times was Ubayd
Zakani from the 13th Century.

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:33.760 position:56%
Many of these great old stories have

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.860
in present times been
turned into children books.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.810
On display, we have the
work of Ubayd Zakani's,

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:44.230
"The Joyous Treatise" and adapted
to a Tajik children's book.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:49.940
Similarly we have from Iran and
Afghanistan works that are inspired

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.850
by the Shahnameh, the
stories of the Shahnameh

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.440
that have been today turned
into children's books.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.910
We have the great author,

00:50:56.910 --> 00:51:01.660
Parvin Pijvak who essentially
has written a series of books

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.170
on the character Arash
that is from the Shahnameh,

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:09.390
as well as Zarrin Kilk from Iran
who has done a series of books

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.580
on the various stories
from the Shahnameh.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.330
This one on display is the mythic
bird Simurgh saving the albino

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:18.110
prince Zal.

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.830
Also, the same character Simurgh,
or Phoenix if you like in English,

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.540
has been an inspiration
for other artists.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:29.470
We have on display here a
vinyl cover from the works

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:32.540
of the Armenian Iranian
composer Loris Tjeknavorian,

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.480
who has created a number
of operas and ballets

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.570 position:56%
and musicals based on the Shahnameh.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:42.760
We have the pop-up genre
of children's books.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.680
Inspired by Ken and Barbie here
in the west, we have "The Voyages

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.530
of Sara and Dara through Iran."

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.630
It's a beautiful pop-up
book from Iran.

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.750
Storytelling has come
into the modern age.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.100
Graphic novels have
become quite popular.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:01.470
On display we have the famous
work of French Iranian artist,

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:04.990
Marjane Satrapi who told the
story of the Iranian Revolution,

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:09.390
the Iran-Iraq war in the form of a
graphic novel published in Paris.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:13.830
We began with the Shahnamehs,
the old ones from middle ages,

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:17.920
and we are ending with the 2013
modern Shahnameh that you see

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.830
on display here translated into
English by Ahmad Sadri in New York

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:27.490
and all the graphics are produced
by Hamid Rahmanian by using images

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:31.090
from Indian, Persian, Central
Asian and Ottoman manuscripts

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:35.800
and lithographs all turned
into high-tech graphic images.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.550
The book is geared toward American
youth and the diaspora communities,

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.430
Iranian Americans, Afghan
Americans, and Tajik Americans.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:45.200
And it is essentially bringing
the stories of the Shahnameh

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.510
to the American and
English speaking audiences.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:52.040
[Music]

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.580
&gt;&gt; I would like to
finish with a number

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.910 position:56%
of sound recordings showcasing three
different styles of Persian starting

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:04.260 position:56%
with a few seconds of the Shahnameh,
a few seconds of the lyrical style

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.920
of Rumi, and of course, free verse
poetry of the Persian poetess,

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.690
Fur gh Farrukhz d
in her own voice.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.220
This recording is from
a collection of stories

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.440
from the Shahnameh by Firdowsi.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.790
Here is an excerpt from
"The Battle of Kumarth

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:25.510
with the Demon" narrated
by Parviz Ahur.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:03.420
&gt;&gt; This recording is from the
book, "Divan-i Shams" by Rumi.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.950
