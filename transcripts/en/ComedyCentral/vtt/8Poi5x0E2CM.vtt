00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.637
It is 11:59 and 59 seconds.
This happened in America today.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.206
For months, voters across
this great land of ours,

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.776
and also Michigan,
have been tasked with...

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.046
the incredible responsibility
of choosing our next president.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.148
And, boy,
have they been blowing it.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.416
-(laughter)
-But...

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.452
a field that started
with 21 presidential candidates

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:22.455
and one precocious schoolboy
who snuck in to the debates...

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.157
(laughter)

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.294
...wearing his big brother's
jacket-- adorable--

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:30.296
has been narrowed down to five.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.298
Tonight we welcome two of them
to our stage

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:35.234
for a very special extended
hour-long presidential debate

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.669
here on<i> @midnight.</i>

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.870

(whooping, shouting)

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.777
Now, we're hosting them
not only because...

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.846
they are polar
political opposites,

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.848
but they both seem to have

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.716
a ring of authenticity
to their supporters

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.852
that bucks the traditional
political system.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.021
They're both very active
on social media,

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:57.790
one as a socialist,
the other as a sociopath.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.592
-(laughter)
-And...

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.862

pander for your votes

don't shout anything out,

amongst some key demographics,

to keep in mind.

who shop at Whole Foods

And we're gonna start winning.
I'll tell you first,

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:02.595
I had the same policy
on women as I do the Chinese,

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:04.363
which is that 'Gina

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:07.833
And I'll tell you this, 'Gina is
our enemy, I'll tell you that.

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:10.269
We started out with 17 people
on the island,

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:13.139
and Scott Walker,
uncanny Valley android face,

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.440
got knocked up.

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:16.475

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:19.011
in every single ceremony
since then.

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:20.846

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.283

hydrogen bombs in Iowa,

-I can tell you that.

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:28.120

I dug a hole in Iowa...

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:30.556
I dug a hole in Iowa
on the way out,

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:33.359
and I sexually assaulted
the state, I can tell you that.

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:35.428
But here's the point,
very important...

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:37.430
I mean, Jeb Bush,
very low energy guy,

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.831
very low energy guy.

00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:41.567
He was the Terri Schiavo
of presidential candidates,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.735
I can tell you that.

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:44.437
Those eyes clicking
back and forth.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.071

in his neck.

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:47.339

-And... you know,

00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:49.108

I love Chris Christie.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:50.509
Great guy.
I love Chris Christie.

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:51.911
But he is a big guy.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.547
I threw a paper clip at him
during one of the debates,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.549
and it went into orbit,
and I promise you

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.951

we will name it a moon

-I think there is some contrast

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.470
between the candidates
you see on stage.

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.772

(cheering, applause)

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:54.874
We're gonna be talking about
a wide variety of issues today,

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:57.009
uh, gentlemen,
a lot of Internet issues--

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:58.544
you seem to be familiar
with that.

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:00.479
Let's begin.
Voters, you've heard...

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:02.515
SANDERS: I do have a modem,
yes, thank you...

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.283
Okay, good.

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:06.852
I have a Mexican guy
who reads the Internet to me.

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:08.821
-Wonderful guy.
-Thank you.

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:10.656
Wonderful guy.
Hello, Paco.

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:12.458
HARDWICK:
Voters...

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:15.694
Every crazy thing he says
just makes him more popular.

00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:17.696
-It's unbelievable.
-TRUMP: I'm a demon.

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:19.698
I'm a demon.
I'm a demon on earth.

00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:22.134
Uh, now, you've heard
these two comments

00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:24.670
on a wide variety of political
topics on other news programs

00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:26.972
and on debates, but we're
about to show you the Internet,

00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:28.574
and we want to discuss
these topics

00:08:28.607 --> 00:08:30.242
that affect Internet Americans.

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:32.378
Our first topic is:
Environmental Activism.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.580
Environmental Activism.
The state of the environment

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:36.582
is a very real concern
to everyday Americans,

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:38.651
which is why
millions of Web users

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.653
were glued to their laptops
this weeks

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.923
following the story
of a crazy dude in a tree.

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.791
Here we go.
This is a...

00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:47.693
bearded man who was in Seattle,

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:50.729
he climbed the majestic conifer
Tuesday, refused to come down,

00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.665
throwing apples and pine cones
at officials

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:57.202
and generally... generally being
the most Seattle person ever.

00:08:57.235 --> 00:09:00.539
-(laughter, whooping)
-Um...

00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:02.775
Perhaps, uh,
perhaps most disturbingly,

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.810
the tree never
actually gave consent.

00:09:04.843 --> 00:09:06.779
-Um... Senator Sanders,
-(laughter)

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.614
the tree man came down
earlier this afternoon.

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:10.683
But how do you respond
to this growing trend

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:14.653
-of tree dwellers? -Sure.
I thank you for that question.

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:16.255
Let me say this.

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:19.525
And when I say that, what I mean
is I'm gonna say something.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.327
(laughter)

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.330
As the only candidate
running for president

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:27.566
who has himself lived
in a tree...

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:31.036
-(laughter) -I believe I have
some clarity on this issue,

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:34.640
and I think what we see
is a vision of the future.

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:37.076
I support tree dwellers,

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:39.244
and I believe
it's a fantastic way

00:09:39.277 --> 00:09:43.349
to solve the housing crisis,
by having people climb up trees

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.084
rather than cut them down.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.152
-(cheering, applause)
-Thank you, Senator Sanders.

00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:49.154
Uh, Mr. Trump...

00:09:49.187 --> 00:09:51.023
Mr. Trump, I'll throw
the question to you.

00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:52.391
How do you respond?

00:09:52.424 --> 00:09:54.793
I will tell you, I've had
a number of my friends

00:09:54.826 --> 00:09:58.197
murdered by trees--
Sonny Bono, terrible.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.232
Edward Kennedy, okay?

00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:02.401
The guy from whatever
that<i> Taken</i> movie is,

00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:03.836
Liam Neeson, his wife.

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.471
-All murdered by trees.
-(jeering)

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:07.306
Terrible, terrible.
Trees are terrible.

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:09.308
And I promise you this,
if I become president,

00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.310
we will get rid of every tree.

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:14.947
We're gonna turn... we will
turn every forest into glass,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.682
-I guarantee you that.
-All right.

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:19.284
We got to use these nukes.
We haven't used them in years.

00:10:19.317 --> 00:10:22.087
All right, uh, points for...
points for Mr. Trump,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.922
also points to Senator Sanders.

00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:25.891
Next topic:
The Judicial Branch.

00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:27.493
With the debate raging
over filling

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:28.994
the upcoming
Supreme Court vacancy,

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:32.131
Sarah Palin is getting her own
Judge Judy style courtroom show.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.466
This is not a sketch.
This is a real thing

00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:36.235
happening in your real world.

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:38.370
Now, some critics have
pointed out that Sarah Palin

00:10:38.403 --> 00:10:40.673
doesn't even have a law degree,
but on the other hand,

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.241
not being qualified
to do something

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:44.309
has never stopped Sarah Palin
from doing<i> anything.</i>

00:10:44.342 --> 00:10:46.011
-So... some legal experts
-(laughter)

00:10:46.044 --> 00:10:48.147
are concerned about she's
gonna pass sentence on others

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.349
when she can't even get
past a sentence herself.

00:10:50.382 --> 00:10:51.984
Take a listen.

00:10:52.017 --> 00:10:53.519
We believe...

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.754
Wait, I thought
fast-food joints?

00:10:55.787 --> 00:10:57.990
Eh. Don't you guys think
that they're, like,

00:10:58.023 --> 00:11:00.125
of the Devil or something?
That's what...

00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:03.495
Liberals, you want to send
those evil employees

00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:05.631
who would dare work
at a fast-food joint

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:08.300
that you just don't believe in,
thought you wanted to...

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.870
I don't know, send them
to purgatory or something.

00:11:12.437 --> 00:11:14.406
And it just goes on and on.

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:16.375
Since the frighteningly
unqualified Sarah Palin

00:11:16.408 --> 00:11:18.210
will now be judging
in a court of law,

00:11:18.243 --> 00:11:20.946
please suggest a case
Judge Palin might preside over.

00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:22.981
Uh, Senator Sanders,
let's start with you.

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:25.417
Okay, fair. Look,
I have a class action lawsuit,

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.620
it is called 
<i> Sanders v. Vlasic Pickles.</i>

00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:31.523
I am suing them. I'm tired
of trying to take the lid off

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:33.959
and having to run it
under hot water.

00:11:33.992 --> 00:11:36.295
And I think that big pickles
should be broken up

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.363
into its constituent spears.

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:40.866
-(laughter)
-But I will add,

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:43.001
I did not vote
to confirm Judge Judy,

00:11:43.034 --> 00:11:45.471
and I will not vote
to confirm Judge Sarah Palin...

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.940
All right. Thank you.
Points. Points, Senator Sanders.

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:49.909
(cheering, applause)

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:54.480
Mr. Trump.

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.415
Sarah is a beautiful woman.

00:11:56.448 --> 00:11:58.117
Very, very beautiful woman.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.385
Wonderful female.
Great skin.

00:12:00.418 --> 00:12:01.820
Incredible skin.

00:12:01.853 --> 00:12:03.956
I'll tell you this right...
I wouldn't even be

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.691
paying attention to this, okay?

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:08.560
-I'm sorry, Kyle. I will
not pay attention to it. -Okay.

00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:10.696
I don't care.
I don't care what she says.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:12.264
I'm just looking at her
and thinking

00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:14.500
about me sliding somewhere,
I'll tell you that.

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.001
And here's the most...
I'll tell you,

00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:18.003
like a sloop,
it's like the Olympics.

00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:19.972
And I'll say this,
I put the mute on,

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.573
because she does,
she makes no sense.

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:23.308
It's gobbledygook.
I'd have her...

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:26.011
I will have her mouth sewn shut
if I become president.

00:12:26.044 --> 00:12:28.313
-All right. Thank you. I guess.
-(cheering, applause)

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:29.681
Audience seems to support that.

00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:31.884
I will give you points
on behalf of the audience.

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.719
Candidates,
throughout the debate,

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.087
we're gonna be asking you
questions

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.522
submitted from people online.

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:38.490
Our first one covers
the important topic of religion.

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:40.025
Top of religion--
always a topic

00:12:40.058 --> 00:12:42.928
people are comfortable
speaking reasonably about.

00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:44.329
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:46.732
Twitter user
@WayneASchneider asked:

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:51.236
Uh... Trump,
let's start with you.

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:53.372
I love the Bible.
I've read the whole book.

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.541
I love the Bible.
Great book. Incredible book.

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.176
I love Corinthians.
I love both of them.

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.911
I think they're incredible.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.312
-(laughter)
-I love their leather.

00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:01.980
I love their leather.
And I'll say this,

00:13:02.013 --> 00:13:03.615
I really do, I love it.
And I'll say,

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:05.284
the Book of Jahb,
incredible book.

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:06.952
-HARDWIDK: Oh, the Book of Job,
yeah. -Incredible book.

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:09.688
Jobs is in the Bible.
Jobs is in the Bible.

00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:12.457
If our president wasn't reading
the Quran, maybe he'd know that.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.326
-(laughter, gasps)
-But here's the point,

00:13:14.359 --> 00:13:16.328
very important, very important.

00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:18.730
Jesus, most boring part
of the book, are you kidding me?

00:13:18.763 --> 00:13:20.098
He's a very boring guy.

00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:22.067
They should've chopped him up
into pieces.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.469
They should've chopped him up.
Why did they crucify him?

00:13:24.502 --> 00:13:27.139
-He came back like Voltron.
Unbelievable. -(laughter)

00:13:27.172 --> 00:13:29.675
Unbelievable.
I would be a way better Jesus.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.677
Way better Jesus.
Way better Jesus.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.046
All right, uh, I will, based
on the audiences' reaction,

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:35.547
points to Mr. Trump on that.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.883
-Senator Sanders. -Look,
I'm not like Jesus at all.

00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:39.151
There's nothing in common.

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:42.321
Uh, I'm far older
than Jesus ever was.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.556
(laughter)

00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:46.825
I don't know, maybe
he would have run for, you know,

00:13:46.858 --> 00:13:49.394
emperor of Rome or something
if he'd lived as long as I did.

00:13:49.427 --> 00:13:50.996
But let me say this.

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:53.265
I am not particularly religious,

00:13:53.298 --> 00:13:56.735
however I do have
a holy spirit-like effect

00:13:56.768 --> 00:14:00.405
on Vermonters
and Vermont-like people.

00:14:00.438 --> 00:14:04.243
Wherever two or more
Birkenstocks are gathered,

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.144
I am in their midst!

00:14:06.177 --> 00:14:08.213
-(applause, whooping)
-All right, points.

00:14:08.246 --> 00:14:09.514
Points now to Senator Sanders.

00:14:09.547 --> 00:14:10.949
Sorry to interrupt.

00:14:10.982 --> 00:14:13.151
I hate to fudge the American
people in the buns like this,

00:14:13.184 --> 00:14:15.120
but we need to go
to a quick commercial break

00:14:15.153 --> 00:14:17.689
to pay off this flag that
we spent all of our budget on.

00:14:17.722 --> 00:14:18.991
We'll continue
our<i> @midnight</i> debate

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:31.470
between Donald Trump and
Bernie Sanders when we return.

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:33.472
Thank you for joining us.

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:35.040
Welcome back to the<i> @midnight</i>
 presidential debate.

00:14:35.073 --> 00:14:37.242
I'm Chris (bleep) Hardwick.

00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:38.377
Our next issue: agriculture.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.811
Very important
to the United States.

00:14:39.844 --> 00:14:41.546
Candidates, both of you
have very strong roots

00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:43.815
in the world of farming.
Senator Sanders, you've lived

00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:46.752
near farms both in Vermont
and before cities were invented.

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:50.188
Donald, uh, you've been
raising an animal

00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:53.425
on your scalp for several
decades, which I believe...

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:55.093
technically counts
as the livestock industry.

00:14:55.126 --> 00:14:56.929
Proving just how important
agriculture is

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:59.131
to the American people,
uh, this image

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.466
from ruthlessrellik
was at the top of reddit.

00:15:01.499 --> 00:15:05.304
It shows a chicken
crossing a road right there.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:08.440
Now, judging by the chicken's
blatant disregard for others,

00:15:08.473 --> 00:15:10.509
um, and also his coloring,

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.010
I'm guessing a Trump supporter.

00:15:12.043 --> 00:15:15.714
Candidates, why did
this chicken cross the road?

00:15:15.747 --> 00:15:18.450
Why did the chicken
cross the road?

00:15:18.483 --> 00:15:20.352
Uh, let's start
with you, Mr. Trump.

00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:23.088
Well, I want to say something
very important, okay, Chuck?

00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:25.257
And I want to tell you this,
it's very important.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.792
Very, very important.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:29.294
I've been to this intersection.
This is right on the border.

00:15:29.327 --> 00:15:32.364
Okay? And that's... I am telling
you that's an immigrant chicken.

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:33.799
I'm telling you right now.

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:37.202
And there are many
Mexican chickens.

00:15:37.235 --> 00:15:39.071
I've been to Mexico,
I've seen the chickens.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.340
We've got to find out
if this is a rapist chicken

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:44.242
or a murderer chicken.
And I promise you this...

00:15:44.275 --> 00:15:46.878
I promise you this:
we are going to build

00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:49.648
an incredible coop--
an incredible coop--

00:15:49.681 --> 00:15:52.217
along the southern border.
I guarantee you that.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.553
I guarantee you that.
I guarantee it.

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:56.989
All right, points, points.
Senator Sanders?

00:15:57.022 --> 00:16:00.392
Look, Chris, I think it's
important to understand

00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:02.294
that I was made aware
of this story

00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:05.530
and I immediately, uh, went down
to have a listening tour

00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:09.301
and I sat down
with the chickens.

00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:11.770
And I heard their concerns.

00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:14.806
And I talked to relatives,
family members

00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:17.843
of this particular chicken,
and it turns out

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:21.013
he crossed the road
to draw attention

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:23.181
to the crumbling infrastructure

00:16:23.214 --> 00:16:25.551
the chickens have to face
every day of their lives.

00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:31.390
A middle-class chicken

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:34.192
is not able to raise
the same number of eggs

00:16:34.225 --> 00:16:37.329
that they were 40 years ago.

00:16:37.362 --> 00:16:40.799
Their coops are in disrepair,
and if I am president,

00:16:40.832 --> 00:16:44.269
I promise that I will spend
billions of dollars

00:16:44.302 --> 00:16:46.938
on chicken wire.
They deserve better,

00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:48.440
just like human beings.

00:16:48.473 --> 00:16:50.142
All right, thank you,
Senator Sanders.

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.377
-Points for that.
-Unbelievable.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.380
Unbelievable.

00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:56.848
We have another...
Uh, Mr. Trump,

00:16:56.881 --> 00:16:58.717
-you're saying unbelievable?
Is there... -Unbelievable.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.952
Just unbelievable.
We should wipe 'em all out

00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:03.388
-and use their eggs
just like women. -Okay.

00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:06.491
All right. Uh...

00:17:06.524 --> 00:17:08.627
We have another question
from the Internet now.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.229
@Renie_Rivas asks
"What would your position be

00:17:11.262 --> 00:17:14.266
within a Human Centipede?"
Um...

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:16.301
Let's start with you this time,
Senator Sanders.

00:17:16.334 --> 00:17:20.205
That's a fair, question, Chris.
I believe that, for sure,

00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:22.507
I would not be in the top
one percent

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.709
of the Human Centipede,

00:17:24.742 --> 00:17:27.045
with the bankers and the people
who are up there

00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:30.549
in charge of everything.
I would be in the bottom 80%,

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:34.152
along with everybody else,
but I would fight to strengthen

00:17:34.185 --> 00:17:37.222
the middle class
within the Human Centipede.

00:17:37.255 --> 00:17:40.225
All right.
Thank you, Senator Sanders.

00:17:40.258 --> 00:17:42.928
I'm not, uh...
I'm not 100% sure

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:45.163
that a person at the front
of a Human Centipede

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:46.531
has any more power than anyone

00:17:46.564 --> 00:17:47.933
in the Human Centipede,
but, uh...

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:49.801
Well, look, I... No, I disagree
with those numbers.

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:52.471
Look, if you want to fact check
that, Chris, I can show you

00:17:52.504 --> 00:17:54.439
some numbers.
I've read the documents.

00:17:54.472 --> 00:17:57.976
I r... I read for two weeks
all the printouts and documents

00:17:58.009 --> 00:18:00.512
and reports I could find
on Human Centipede.

00:18:00.545 --> 00:18:03.515
It's tragic, what they
go through. But I think...

00:18:03.548 --> 00:18:07.285
the disappearing middle class,
the thorax of the centipede,

00:18:07.318 --> 00:18:09.988
needs to be enhanced
so that these creatures

00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:11.890
-are able to have a healthy
overall... -Excuse me.

00:18:11.923 --> 00:18:13.291
-All right, yes.
-Excuse me.

00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:14.626
-Mr. Trump,
your rebuttal. -Excuse me.

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:16.294
-Points, Senator Sanders.
-First off, I would do

00:18:16.327 --> 00:18:18.130
a Human Millipede,
'cause it's way bigger--

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:20.832
more legs,
far more luxurious.

00:18:20.865 --> 00:18:22.701
I'll tell you that.
Absolutely.

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.470
A Human Millipede would be
so much bigger, I'll say that.

00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:28.140
I... We... I only do millipedes,
I'll tell you.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.976
But my position in a Human
Centipede would be in the corner

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:32.978
jerking off watching those
people. I don't do that.

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:35.080
-All right.
-I don't do that.

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:37.649
Poi-Points for your honesty.

00:18:37.682 --> 00:18:39.518
I do not jerk off,

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.253
and I... This is a very
important distinction

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:45.123
between me and Mr. Trump.
I do not jerk off.

00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:47.626
I-I don't need to.
I do things...

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:49.227
You know, with no hands.
Hands-free,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.429
that's the way I handle it.

00:18:51.462 --> 00:18:55.000
I have ejaculated three times
during this debate.

00:18:57.902 --> 00:19:00.238
-And if I might...
-Yes, Senator Sanders.

00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:02.641
If I might--
I have not ejaculated

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.676
since Jesse Jackson won

00:19:04.709 --> 00:19:07.078
the 1988 Georgia primary,

00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:10.148
and I saved
that ejaculate in jars

00:19:10.181 --> 00:19:13.051
for future use.

00:19:13.084 --> 00:19:14.386
Thank you, Senator Sanders.

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:15.820
Mr. Trump.

00:19:15.853 --> 00:19:18.290
I'm... envisioning
all of that now.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.492
I'm envisioning,
uh, pumpkin spice latte

00:19:20.525 --> 00:19:22.827
-coming out of you, and...
-That's right.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.464
...and clouds of evaporated milk
shooting into the ether.

00:19:26.497 --> 00:19:29.734
And I'll tell you, that pumpkin
spice latte's a double shot.

00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:32.938
I can tell you that.
It's definitely a double shot.

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:35.140
Thank you very much, Mr. Trump

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.175
for activating my gag reflex.

00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:40.645
It's actually rice milk.

00:19:40.678 --> 00:19:42.781
Gentlemen, we have to pause
this illuminating discussion

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:45.350
to shove our (bleep) minds
back into our skulls.

00:19:45.383 --> 00:19:46.818
We'll continue our debate

00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:49.487

Donald Trump when we come back.

Next up, tech innovations.
Tech innovations.

00:20:18.683 --> 00:20:21.353
A very key part of our economy,
of course, is the tech sector.

There are some exciting
new innovations

00:20:23.054 --> 00:20:25.790
from one of the industry's
leaders, PornHub, of course.

00:20:25.823 --> 00:20:27.892
Um, Senator Sanders,
now, this is a Web site

00:20:27.925 --> 00:20:29.494
the young people visit to see...

00:20:29.527 --> 00:20:32.030
Oh, I understand, yeah, sure,
it's a www, what do you want?

your buddy brought back
from the war.

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:45.143
Yeah, sure, I understand it.
A nickelodeon picture.

-What do I need to know? -Yeah,
it's like a nickelodeon picture.

00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:50.081
Uh, Mr. Trump, uh,
you know PornHub as a place

00:20:50.114 --> 00:20:53.518
for many of your
future ex-wives. Uh, we...

00:20:53.551 --> 00:20:57.489
-Very low blow, low blow. Very
low blow. -No, I... I'm not...

-All right? I watch...
-Do you mean your category?

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.093
I watch home movies of my

-Keep it in the family.
-All right, they...

00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:09.401
they made waves this week, uh,

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.503
by announcing plans
to give away free VR goggles

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.872

featuring virtual reality films.

Uh, porn for the elderly--

00:21:36.861 --> 00:21:39.464
what does it look like?
Senator Sanders.

00:21:41.899 --> 00:21:45.236
What would you like to see in
a blue movie for the AARP set?

00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:47.806
First of all, I want to point
out that is exactly why

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:50.909
you wear boxers<i> and</i> briefs.

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:53.978
All right.

00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:57.349
Look, I think I would largely
leave pornographic policy

00:21:57.382 --> 00:22:00.285
to the states to decide.
I will say this, however:

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:02.854
I believe that special interests

00:22:02.887 --> 00:22:05.357
have no place
in our money shots.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.526
And I would move
to have corporations

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:11.796
have their influence taken
out of pornographic pictures.

00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:14.366
And also, Chris,
on a personal level,

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.634
I wouldn't mind seeing
some virtual reality porn

00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:19.237
where they are able
to recreate Betty Boop,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.407
so I can once again fantasize

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.542
about performing cunnilingus

00:22:24.575 --> 00:22:27.245
on my favorite pinup model,
Betty Boop.

00:22:27.278 --> 00:22:30.048
All right, thank you,
Senator Sanders.

00:22:30.081 --> 00:22:33.017
I just, um...

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.221
Just as a...
just as a quick, little point--

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:38.189
uh, you know, Betty Boop
is an animated character,

00:22:38.222 --> 00:22:39.824
-not a real human being.
-Oh, sure, no,

00:22:39.857 --> 00:22:41.693
I had a fun time
when I was young.

00:22:41.726 --> 00:22:43.461
All right. Good.

00:22:43.494 --> 00:22:46.531
Uh, Mr. Trump, to you.
What makes a good adult film?

00:22:46.564 --> 00:22:49.067
I personally enjoy
Japanese crying films.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.637
I like those girls crying...
I like 'em crying.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.672
And I'll tell you--
China is ahead of us

00:22:54.705 --> 00:22:57.142
on robot octopus tentacles.
They are.

00:22:57.175 --> 00:23:00.044
They're ahead of us and we ship
38% on robot tentacles

00:23:00.077 --> 00:23:03.681
going into women.
China does it all.

00:23:03.714 --> 00:23:06.584
America does not corner
the market, and I'll say this:

00:23:06.617 --> 00:23:09.354
if I become president, every
young woman in the United States

00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:11.890
will have a large octopus
tentacle inside them.

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:14.559
I'll guarantee it.
I promise you that.

00:23:14.592 --> 00:23:15.827
I love seeing them cry

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.396
because it reminds me
of how they lost the war.

00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:20.698
All right, uh...

00:23:20.731 --> 00:23:23.368
I feel very bad
about giving points for that,

00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:26.037
but the audience
seems to decree it.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.874
One more question. From American
Twitter use @hgreen568 asks

00:23:29.907 --> 00:23:33.011
"Why don't ghosts just fall
through the Earth?"

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.379

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:36.514
There was a time in this country

00:23:36.547 --> 00:23:40.485
where we took care
of our ghosts.

00:23:40.518 --> 00:23:44.322
And the reason that ghosts
did not fall through the earth

00:23:44.355 --> 00:23:46.958
was because there was
a social welfare wa...

00:23:46.991 --> 00:23:49.761
there was a social welfare
safety net

00:23:49.794 --> 00:23:51.496
to keep them from falling,

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:54.499
and that has eroded
since Reagan was president.

00:23:54.532 --> 00:23:56.968
And I promise, as president,

00:23:57.001 --> 00:23:59.437
I will give the ghosts
a fair shot,

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.272
just like I will human beings.

00:24:01.305 --> 00:24:04.509
Because ghosts are just
very elderly people.

00:24:04.542 --> 00:24:08.313
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:11.516
Excuse me,
I do want to say one thing.

00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:13.585
I want to say one thing.
I promise you this:

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:16.688
if I become president I am
gonna make a lot more ghosts.

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:18.490
-I guarantee you that.
-All right.

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:21.159
I will make a lot more ghosts.
I... We're gonna...

00:24:21.192 --> 00:24:23.728
-There's gonna be so many
ghosts. -Now, a lot of...

00:24:23.761 --> 00:24:26.264
a lot of people, uh, there
seems to be a growing trend--

00:24:26.297 --> 00:24:29.367
a lot of people very upset,
uh, most ghosts as depicted

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.636
in film and television
always tend to be white.

00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:35.240
Uh... Senator Sanders, would you
like to comment on that?

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:38.309
Sure. Look, I...
I understand that I am

00:24:38.342 --> 00:24:40.678
what is known as a white male.

00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:44.382
And I'm on Tumblr,
so I know that's wrong.

00:24:44.415 --> 00:24:46.985
I have educated myself

00:24:47.018 --> 00:24:49.387
through a number of,
uh, enlightening reblogs.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.422
And let me say this--

00:24:51.455 --> 00:24:54.759
in my administration,
I think the ghosts will be

00:24:54.792 --> 00:24:58.630
diverse, just like my cabinet,
like everybody around me.

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:01.733
And the ghosts
in a Sanders administration

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:05.637
will be multicolored like
the ghosts in a Pac-Man game.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.541
Ah, thank you very much.
Points to Senator Sanders.

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:11.142
-Mr. Trump.
-Unbelievable.

00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:13.211
We just have a little
bit of time left in,

00:25:13.244 --> 00:25:14.679
uh, in this part of the debate.

00:25:14.712 --> 00:25:16.748
Uh, any comment
on ghost diversity?

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:19.684
I... First off, I'll say
something very, very important

00:25:19.717 --> 00:25:22.086
about ghosts, okay?
They wear white sheets.

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:24.589
They wear white sheets, we don't
know what's underneath them.

00:25:24.622 --> 00:25:26.491
-All right. -We don't
know what is underneath them.

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:29.460
Much like a great company
that supports me.

00:25:29.493 --> 00:25:31.729
An incredible energy company
that supports me

00:25:31.762 --> 00:25:34.699
called Triple-K.
Incredible energy company.

00:25:34.732 --> 00:25:37.368
There's this British guy,
he's a duke.

00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:40.171
His name is David. And he
tells me about this new...

00:25:40.204 --> 00:25:42.874
this incredible,
new alternate energy

00:25:42.907 --> 00:25:45.443
called white power--
unbelievable.

00:25:45.476 --> 00:25:48.980
And apparently...
apparently white power

00:25:49.013 --> 00:25:52.850
has been running this country
for 350 years. I had no idea.

00:25:52.883 --> 00:25:55.219
All right. Um...

00:25:55.252 --> 00:25:57.188
I think I'm...

00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:01.026
I think I'm...

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:07.098
I'm not... I wasn't trying
to get your attention, Chris.

00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:08.533
I just always hear music

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:09.968
and sometimes
I like to play along.

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:11.502
All right, excellent.

00:26:11.535 --> 00:26:14.772
That brings us to the end
of Rapid Refresh.

00:26:14.805 --> 00:26:16.174
No points
for Mr. Trump's answer.

00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:17.542
That brings us to the end

00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:18.876
of Rapid Refresh:
Presidential Debate Edition.

00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:20.745
We are going to decide,
once and for all,

00:26:20.778 --> 00:26:22.380
who will end up
in the White House

00:26:22.413 --> 00:26:24.449
by the end of this show.
We're gonna be holding

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.384
a special Presidential
#HashtagWar later on.

00:26:26.417 --> 00:26:27.986
We're gonna continue
our<i> @midnight</i> debate

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:30.722
with Donald Trump and Senator
Bernie Sanders when we return.

00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:36.227
<i> Our tweet of the day
 from last night's #HashtagWar</i>

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.731
<i> was presented by Burger King
 and from @MyLittleGarrone.</i>

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:48.606
<i> Well done.</i>

00:26:48.639 --> 00:26:51.075
Welcome back to the<i> @midnight</i>
 presidential debate.

00:26:51.108 --> 00:26:52.777
The only presidential debate
that is relevant..

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.112
AUDIENCE (chanting):
Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:56.314
...to your interests
and will determine... Please.

00:26:56.347 --> 00:26:58.016
Uh, that will determine
once and for all

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.684
who will end up
in the White House.

00:26:59.717 --> 00:27:01.719
Let's jump right in with another
question from the Internet.

00:27:01.752 --> 00:27:05.490
@BlazeaceofAces8 asks
"Who is the better kisser?"

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:08.059
Who is the better
kisser?

00:27:08.092 --> 00:27:09.961
Senator Sanders,
let's start with you.

00:27:09.994 --> 00:27:12.030
Well, look, it's hard for me
to tell for sure,

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:15.933
'cause I can guarantee
I'm never kissing Donald Trump.

00:27:15.966 --> 00:27:17.702
But I do...

00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:20.571
Look, I make my wife very happy.

00:27:20.604 --> 00:27:23.775
We have nice romantic times up
in Lake Champlain

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:26.811
where we go out on a boat and
we read each other statistics

00:27:26.844 --> 00:27:29.781
from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:32.417
All right, thank you.
Uh, points to Senator Sanders.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.484
Mr. Trump.

00:27:33.517 --> 00:27:35.620
When I was 13 years old

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:38.256
I went in to have my first kiss

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:39.824
with a lovely, beautiful girl

00:27:39.857 --> 00:27:42.960
who I had purchased from Dubai.

00:27:42.993 --> 00:27:45.763
My father bought her for me.

00:27:45.796 --> 00:27:47.665
And she shamed me

00:27:47.698 --> 00:27:49.867
and my mouth has been
perpetually stuck

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.805
in a kiss since then.

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:56.474
I see. I see.

00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:05.550
Senator Sanders, uh...

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.752
-What do you need?
-Follow-up question, uh...

00:28:10.654 --> 00:28:14.092
how do you feel
about Muppet rights?

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.760
Look, Chris,
that's a fair question.

00:28:15.793 --> 00:28:17.428
I understand
that I look like I'm running

00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:20.598
for president
of<i> The Muppet Show.</i>

00:28:20.631 --> 00:28:24.035
But let me say this:
I believe that we owe it

00:28:24.068 --> 00:28:27.105
to young Muppets,
Fraggles, to make sure

00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:30.208
that they are able
to go to college for free.

00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:32.810
And I also believe
that older Muppets--

00:28:32.843 --> 00:28:36.781
Statler and Waldorf--
should be able to see a doctor

00:28:36.814 --> 00:28:38.549
to look at their Muppet holes
when they need it.

00:28:38.582 --> 00:28:39.851
HARDWICK:
All right, thank you.

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.452
-(cheers and applause)
-Points Senator Sanders.

00:28:41.485 --> 00:28:43.354
-Excuse me. -Mr. Trump,
you have a rebuttal?

00:28:43.387 --> 00:28:45.556
Excuse me. First off,
I have worked with Doozers

00:28:45.589 --> 00:28:47.792
my entire life.

00:28:47.825 --> 00:28:49.393
Doozers are incredible builders.

00:28:49.426 --> 00:28:50.728
They used to work on Fraggle,

00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:52.930
and they built incredible
buildings for me.

00:28:52.963 --> 00:28:54.866
And it's...
And the Fraggles eat them.

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:56.701
The Fraggles eat them,
let's not forget that.

00:28:56.734 --> 00:28:58.402
-That's true.
-And I'll say this,

00:28:58.435 --> 00:29:00.138
I mean, these Sesame Street,
unbelievable.

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:02.940
I mean, Cookie Monster, this guy
is so addicted to cookies,

00:29:02.973 --> 00:29:06.110
I heard he sucks felt in the
alley behind Sesame Street.

00:29:06.143 --> 00:29:08.246
I did. I heard it.

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:09.447
Interesting.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.615
I heard he sucks felt.

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:11.816
I mean, that's hearsay.

00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:13.518
You don't know that
for a fact. You're just...

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:14.952
I don't know what...
I don't know anything,

00:29:14.985 --> 00:29:17.255
but I say things
and then hope people...

00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:18.523
and then I hope...

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:20.925
I hope people commit acts
of violence as a result.

00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:22.794
-HARDWICK: Points.
-Donald,

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:26.497
I think that gay panic
and shaming of sex workers

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.668
has no place on Sesame Street
or on Main Street.

00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:32.303
-Let me tell you...
-(cheering)

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:34.272
Hold on, excuse me.

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:36.307
-Yes, yes, and another rebuttal.
-Excuse me.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.011
Okay, Kim, listen to me, I'm
going to tell you right now.

00:29:40.044 --> 00:29:41.746
-That's not even a man's name.
-Okay? I...

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:43.614
I'll tell you this.
I'll say this right now.

00:29:43.647 --> 00:29:44.481
I don't have a problem
with gay issues.

00:29:44.515 --> 00:29:46.083
Bernie and I line up on this,
okay?

00:29:46.116 --> 00:29:48.286
It doesn't mean we're gonna run
a train on each other,

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:50.822
but we do line up.
And I'll say this.

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:53.991
I support lesbians
picking up wood in Vermont.

00:29:54.024 --> 00:29:56.194
-I think it's fine. Whatever
you want to do is your... -Oh.

00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:59.197
My state was mentioned.
I believe I get a response.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.533
Mr. Trump, I will have you know

00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:05.403
that lesbians picking up wood
in Vermont

00:30:05.436 --> 00:30:07.939
-is our number two industry.
-Wonderful.

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:10.942
Wonderful. Hold on. Excuse me.

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:13.678
Excuse me.
I have no problem with that.

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.413
I love
the lesbian wood industry.

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:18.749
China is sending
Chinese lesbians to pick up wood

00:30:18.782 --> 00:30:20.618
for half the price.
And China's...

00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:22.687
How many Chinese lesbians are
we gonna have come over here and

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.556
pick up wood? I want American
lesbians to be picking up wood.

00:30:25.589 --> 00:30:28.292
-All right. -I want American
lesbians to pick up wood.

00:30:28.325 --> 00:30:29.827
I don't need
these Chinese lesbians.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.230
America, the choice is clear.
The choice is yours.

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:35.833
You can elect the<i> Monopoly</i> Man
with a bag of money for a head

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:39.103
or you can elect me,
the boot from<i> Monopoly,</i>

00:30:39.136 --> 00:30:40.838
and I will modify the game

00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:43.174
so that nobody goes to jail!

00:30:43.207 --> 00:30:46.110
You just keep passing Go
and collecting $200!

00:30:46.143 --> 00:30:49.113
-Get out of here. -Okay. Okay.
Thank you. -That is, uh...

00:30:49.146 --> 00:30:51.115
-I'm sorry.
-Forget about it. -Thank you.

00:30:51.148 --> 00:30:53.584
It's now time for our live
challenge, Attack of the Ad.

00:30:53.617 --> 00:30:55.553
Attack of the Ad.

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:01.759
Now, candidates, let's pivot
to an important part

00:31:01.792 --> 00:31:03.427
of the American political
tradition. I'm talking,

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.630
of course, attack ads.
Tearing your opponent down

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.899
from everything from hand size
to the way their hair looks

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:10.902
like the pubes of an elderly
yeti, it's a very effective tool

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:13.971
for swaying voters and-and
kind of takes everything away

00:31:14.004 --> 00:31:16.641
from the real issues so people
don't have to think too hard.

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:20.378
Take, for example, this classic
2010 ad by Carly Fiorina

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:22.380
on her opponent, Tom Campbell.

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:24.048
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Your current brilliant solution</i>

00:31:24.081 --> 00:31:25.516
<i> to California's budget mess?</i>

00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:28.185
<i> A wolf in sheep's clothing.</i>

00:31:28.218 --> 00:31:31.455
<i> A man who literally helped put
 the state of California</i>

00:31:31.488 --> 00:31:34.959
<i> on the path to bankruptcy
 and higher taxes.</i>

00:31:37.227 --> 00:31:41.032
Very salacious indeed.

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:43.167
It is craven, to be sure,
but I do think

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.436
that two vicious old grumps
could do even better.

00:31:45.469 --> 00:31:48.039
So, candidates,
your challenge is to create

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:50.708
an attack ad against
your opponent. All right?

00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:52.843
We'll get your answers after
the break. We'll be right back

00:31:52.876 --> 00:31:55.346
with more<i> @midnight </i>
Presidential Debate 2016.

00:31:55.379 --> 00:32:06.123
(cheering and applause)

00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:09.126
Welcome back to<i> @midnight's</i>
 Presidential Debate 2016.

00:32:09.159 --> 00:32:11.796
Before the break, I gave you
a no-holds-barred challenge

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:14.265
asking you to make political
attack ads against one another.

00:32:14.298 --> 00:32:17.268
Let's see what you came up with.
Mr. Trump, we'll start with you.

00:32:17.301 --> 00:32:19.870
I'm Donald Trump.

00:32:19.903 --> 00:32:24.008
Bernie Sanders, this guy is
only three years older than me,

00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:26.410
but he looks
absolutely terrible.

00:32:26.443 --> 00:32:29.814
He looks like the Templar
at the end of<i> Last Crusade,</i>

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:32.283
and America needs
to choose wisely.

00:32:32.316 --> 00:32:34.452
Bernie Sanders
shouldn't be president.

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:36.787
He's gonna be eating alone
in a Denny's

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.289
for the rest of his life.

00:32:38.322 --> 00:32:41.292
Do we really want a president
who seems like he always has

00:32:41.325 --> 00:32:43.027
old soup on his lip?

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.029
It's gonna be like watching
<i> Death of a Salesman</i>

00:32:45.062 --> 00:32:46.697
for the next four years.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.834
Kids, listen up.
He's not your grandpa.

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:52.436
He's gonna slip and die
in a bathtub,

00:32:52.469 --> 00:32:54.939
and then we'll be stuck with
Vice President Whoopi Goldberg.

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:56.140
And who wants that?

00:32:56.173 --> 00:32:59.276
I am the president
that America deserves.

00:32:59.309 --> 00:33:02.613
I can tell you that.

00:33:02.646 --> 00:33:05.149
-All right.
-There we go.

00:33:05.182 --> 00:33:08.619
Senator Sanders,
let's see your ad.

00:33:08.652 --> 00:33:11.956
Okay, look. Uh,
yeah, it's me, Bernie Sanders.

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:14.291
They want me to do an attack ad.
I don't want to do...

00:33:14.324 --> 00:33:15.960
I'm running a clean campaign.

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:17.628
I don't got time
for that bull(bleep).

00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:21.565
So in the interest
of radical transparency,

00:33:21.598 --> 00:33:24.568
I am going to run an attack ad
against myself.

00:33:24.601 --> 00:33:26.070
Bernie, you're a jerk.

00:33:26.103 --> 00:33:27.471
You're a real piece of doo.

00:33:27.504 --> 00:33:29.006
You stink. Literally.

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:32.009
You smell like old bananas, and
nobody knows better than you.

00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:33.878
You look like Ray Bradbury.

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:35.346
Where do you get off, you bum?

00:33:35.379 --> 00:33:37.882
Literally, where do you get off?

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.884
You're asleep on the subway.

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.420
I'm Bernie Sanders,
and I approve this message.

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:45.156
But I do not approve
of Bernie Sanders.

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.425
We're done.

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.260
Very interesting approach.

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:52.563
Very negative. Very negative.

00:33:55.332 --> 00:33:56.801
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give, uh,

00:33:56.834 --> 00:33:58.536
1,000 points to Mr. Trump
for not blinking

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.538
during his entire ad.
I'm gonna give 1,000 points

00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:03.607
to Senator Sanders
for ruthlessly attacking himself

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.610
for some reason. We now turn
to the subject of war,

00:34:06.643 --> 00:34:10.481
specifically the Hashtag War.
Now...

00:34:10.514 --> 00:34:13.818
tonight...

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:16.620
we're wondering what it would be
like if Senator Sanders' finger

00:34:16.653 --> 00:34:18.622
was on the button, especially
one that does something

00:34:18.655 --> 00:34:20.091
other than alert
his flight attendant.

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:22.760
Uh, what would Mr. Trump do
as head of state,

00:34:22.793 --> 00:34:24.695
besides negging Angela Merkel?

00:34:24.728 --> 00:34:27.364
Well, gentlemen, now is your
opportunity to go head-to-head,

00:34:27.397 --> 00:34:30.367
mano a mano. Tell the voters
what the world would look like--

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.870
this is your final chance
to get their approval--

00:34:32.903 --> 00:34:35.406
if you were sitting in the Oval
Office, with tonight's hashtag,

00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:38.142
#IfIWerePresident.
#IfIWerePresident.

00:34:38.175 --> 00:34:40.878
Uh, examples might be
"our national parks would become

00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:42.880
national golf courses" or, um,

00:34:42.913 --> 00:34:44.415
"the White House
would get a chairlift."

00:34:44.448 --> 00:34:46.150
Either one, either way.

00:34:46.183 --> 00:34:48.552
Um, we're gonna go back
and forth on this one.

00:34:48.585 --> 00:34:50.221
Let's start with you,
Senator Sanders.

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:53.023
Okay. If I were president,

00:34:53.056 --> 00:34:56.660
"Hail to the Chief" would be
played by the band Phish,

00:34:56.693 --> 00:35:00.064
and it would take 25 minutes
every time I walk into a room.

00:35:00.097 --> 00:35:01.565
All right, points.

00:35:01.598 --> 00:35:03.300
Mr. Trump.

00:35:03.333 --> 00:35:06.303
If I were president,
we would have

00:35:06.336 --> 00:35:09.240
the first lady-daughter
of the United States.

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:11.775
I'm disgusted. Points.
Senator Sanders.

00:35:11.808 --> 00:35:13.310
If I were president,

00:35:13.343 --> 00:35:16.180
I would put
the rich Wall Street bankers

00:35:16.213 --> 00:35:19.316
in the same prison
that Magneto goes in,

00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:21.485
but they would not be let out
for any sequels.

00:35:21.518 --> 00:35:23.687
All right.
Points to Senator Sanders.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.289
Mr. Trump.

00:35:25.322 --> 00:35:27.825
If I become president,

00:35:27.858 --> 00:35:32.496
I am gonna hunt down Rosie
O'Donnell like Osama bin Laden.

00:35:32.529 --> 00:35:34.098
Points.

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:36.167
Senator Sanders.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.035
If I were president,

00:35:38.068 --> 00:35:41.906
I would institute
a national Netflix account

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:43.707
with one password

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.178
so we are no longer burdening
our seniors

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:49.881
for their Netflix passwords.

00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:54.985
Points to Senator Sanders.

00:35:55.018 --> 00:35:57.388
You're applauding that,
but do you know what that...

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.390
you'd end up watching
if everyone were

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:01.525
-on the same account?
-They don't even understand.

00:36:01.558 --> 00:36:04.996
They don't even understand.
It would be<i> Bones</i> all day long.

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:08.966
That is the end
of the Hashtag Wars.

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:12.937
That means it's time for our
closing statements, For the Win.

00:36:22.112 --> 00:36:24.348
Very important part of the show.

00:36:24.381 --> 00:36:28.018
Uh, Definitely Trump,
Absolutely Sanders came here

00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:30.354
to determine who,
once and for all, would be

00:36:30.387 --> 00:36:32.022
the next president
of the United States.

00:36:32.055 --> 00:36:35.025
Uh, we have a-a lustrous history
on this show of people

00:36:35.058 --> 00:36:37.194
winning debates and then going
on to take the White House.

00:36:37.227 --> 00:36:39.129
You both came on
to this fake Internet game show

00:36:39.162 --> 00:36:41.732
to show the American people that
you do understand the Internet.

00:36:41.765 --> 00:36:43.867
Both of you are representative
of social media's ability

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.270
to give everyone a voice,

00:36:46.303 --> 00:36:49.540
regardless of how orange
or hunchbacked they might be.

00:36:49.573 --> 00:36:53.210
As such,
your final challenge tonight,

00:36:53.243 --> 00:36:55.479
it only makes sense for you
to show the Internet

00:36:55.512 --> 00:36:56.981
that you know how to speak
their language.

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:59.316
I'm talking, of course,
about emoji, uh,

00:36:59.349 --> 00:37:00.718
the primary means
of communication

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:03.587
for both teen girls and people
pretending to be teen girls

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.389
in order to catch predators.

00:37:05.422 --> 00:37:08.125
Candidates, I would like you
to deliver one last message

00:37:08.158 --> 00:37:09.793
to the American people tonight.

00:37:09.826 --> 00:37:11.662
We're gonna have our candidates'
answers and name the leader

00:37:11.695 --> 00:37:13.197
of the free world
when we come back

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.000
on<i> @midnight</i> Presidential Debate
2016.

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:26.110
(cheering and applause)

00:37:26.143 --> 00:37:28.279
Welcome back to<i> @midnight.</i>

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:30.447
It's now time for For the Win.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.316
I'm gonna wipe your scores
clean,

00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:34.652
rendering all the gameplay up to
this point entirely meaningless,

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:37.054
begging the question why did we
go through this entire exercise

00:37:37.087 --> 00:37:39.523
if it was all gonna come down
to one question.

00:37:39.556 --> 00:37:42.259
Gentlemen, at this time, we will
now accept your closing remarks.

00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:44.261
Senator Sanders,
we'll start with you.

00:37:44.294 --> 00:37:48.265
Look, I've got a message
for the mainstream media

00:37:48.298 --> 00:37:51.402
and that is
I'm running for president.

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:54.872
You should put me on TV
from time to time.

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:57.408
Look, we just did it.
It wasn't so bad.

00:37:57.441 --> 00:38:00.844
And when you...
when you do put me on TV,

00:38:00.877 --> 00:38:02.980
don't just have the audio
cut out,

00:38:03.013 --> 00:38:05.983
where you just see me
pantomiming

00:38:06.016 --> 00:38:09.253
and Chris Matthews
is blabbering over me,

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:11.255
telling you what I'm saying.

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:14.858
I'm a loud guy! Put it on TV!

00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:17.528
We don't need to hear
what Chris Matthews is saying.

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:20.097
We already know it. He's saying
something we've already heard

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.432
about Tip O'Neill.

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:24.902
I'm a loud (bleep) guy.
Put it on TV.

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.837
And I would also like to ask
for money,

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.640
if you got anything,
any small change.

00:38:29.673 --> 00:38:31.975
Anything under a dollar,
I'll take it.

00:38:32.008 --> 00:38:35.646
If you got a gift card that's
partially used, we can use it.

00:38:35.679 --> 00:38:41.151
If you have parts of a bitcoin,
we almost have one full bitcoin.

00:38:41.184 --> 00:38:42.753
I will take bus tokens

00:38:42.786 --> 00:38:44.755
if they are for currently
functioning bus systems.

00:38:44.788 --> 00:38:47.391
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, Senator Sanders.

00:38:51.695 --> 00:38:54.865
Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump,
your closing remarks.

00:38:54.898 --> 00:38:56.734
First up,
when I become president,

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:59.737
within the first 100 days,
I will be bored within ten.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.273
I can guarantee you that.
I am gonna get a cabinet

00:39:03.306 --> 00:39:05.342
that makes Dick Cheney
and Paul Wolfowitz

00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:07.811
look like Marlo Thomas
and friends in<i> Free to Be...</i>

00:39:07.844 --> 00:39:11.348
<i>You and Me.</i> We are going to get
a terrible group of people

00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:14.017
to run this country.
And I promise you this,

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.819
I'm the beast. I am the beast

00:39:15.852 --> 00:39:17.488
at the end of the Bible,

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.757
and I will destroy this planet.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.025
-And I'll tell you this,
we are gonna get... -MAN: Boo!

00:39:22.058 --> 00:39:24.228
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:27.231
-Get him out of here!
-I will make sure all hecklers

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.899
-are taken care of with health
care. -You had your time.

00:39:28.932 --> 00:39:30.367
You had your time, Bernie.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.536
-You had your time. Excuse me.
-Okay. Okay. Okay. (blubbering)

00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:36.473
My big promise though, Greg,
is, I'll tell you this,

00:39:36.506 --> 00:39:38.642
we're gonna get rid
of the kaiser,

00:39:38.675 --> 00:39:40.978
we're gonna burn down
the Reichstag,

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:43.514
and I promise you
we will unify Germany

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.182
and make it the diamond
of Europe

00:39:45.215 --> 00:39:47.918
for the next 1,000 years. And
I hope you'll pledge with me

00:39:47.951 --> 00:39:51.121
-as we do this. Make a pledge
with me now. -Oh, no. Uh...

00:39:51.154 --> 00:39:54.458
-Don't do that. -We're gonna
make America and the world

00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:56.460
-(booing) -great again.
Get 'em out of here!

00:39:56.493 --> 00:40:00.264
Get 'em out of here!
Get 'em out of here!

00:40:02.332 --> 00:40:04.168
Now I'll read your answers
aloud,

00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:06.170
and you, the audience,
will decide the winner.

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:09.339
Again, I'm gonna read these so
you have no idea who wrote what.

00:40:09.372 --> 00:40:11.275
Before the break,, I asked you
to deliver a message

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:13.944
to the American people
using emoji. Uh...

00:40:13.977 --> 00:40:16.346
-Emohis. I like them.
-No, I... It's "emoji."

00:40:16.379 --> 00:40:18.315
-It's Japanese in origin.
-Look, I've sat down

00:40:18.348 --> 00:40:20.717
-with the Emohi community. I
understand... -No, it's, uh...

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.320
-You haven't. They're not real.
They're... -Chinese. -I got

00:40:23.353 --> 00:40:25.589
-a great empathy for the Emohi
people. -They're essentially

00:40:25.622 --> 00:40:27.925
pictograms. No. Um,

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:30.727
each of you told me privately
what these emoji mean,

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.463
and I will interpret them
for the audience.

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:34.398
Let's see what you came up with.
First one.

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:36.634
First set of emoji.

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:48.712
Feel the Bern, live the Bern,
speak the Bern.

00:40:48.745 --> 00:40:50.681
Uh...

00:40:55.118 --> 00:40:57.621
-All right.
-(audience chanting "Bernie!")

00:40:57.654 --> 00:40:59.957
Could've been either one.
No, sir.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.226
Could've been either one.
Could've been either one.

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:04.828
-Unbelievable. -Next up--
completely anonymous,

00:41:04.861 --> 00:41:06.697
next up-- completely anonymous--

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.966
you better ship yourself
to Canada

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:13.971
because my tiny orange hands are
coming to the White House, baby.

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:17.241
There they are.

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:20.511
You're all gonna die.
You're all gonna die.

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:22.980
What if that was mine?
What if that was mine?

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.248
Number one was the winner!

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:27.251
Senator Bernie Sanders,
you have won the Internet,

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:31.255

in no way. Mr. Trump walking

00:41:38.161 --> 00:41:40.797
