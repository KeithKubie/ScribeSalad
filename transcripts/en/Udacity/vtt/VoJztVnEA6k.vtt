00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.510
So at this point, when p0 is declared the champion

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.590
of the tournament, what we know is that everybody has

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.357
arrived at the barrier. And this knowledge is available with

00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:13.530
p0 but not with anybody else. So everybody, everybody has arrived

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.930
at the barrier, but P0 is the only one who

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.450
knows because he's a champion, he knows that, that everybody has

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.280
arrived at the barrier. So clearly, the next thing that

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.530
has to happen is of course free up all the processors

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.050
to indicate to them that you know, its time to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.320
move on to the next phase of your computation. So let's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.070
talk about the wake up. So what p0 is going to do

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.970
is is going to tell p4 that it's time to wake up.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.920
And you know, if you want to use the tournament

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.290
analogy again, in any tournament the winner walks over to the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.780
loser and shakes hands, right? So, you can sort of think

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.750
of the same thing happening over here, P4 with the [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.870
face is waiting for P0 to come over, and let

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.040
him know that okay, its a good match and shake

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.418
hands with you. And so, P0 is going to come

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:04.980
over and let him know, shake hands. So that's the first

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.520
thing that happens. So in other words, at this point

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.960
P0 is awake of course, and he is also waking

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.440
up P4 saying that well barrier is done. And now

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.870
one of these guys can go to the next level and

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.630
do the honours at every level so, just as I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.070
said about P0 coming in and shaking hands with P4, what

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.740
P0 is going to do is, go to the next round

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.100
and shake hands with P2, P4 go to the next round

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.900
and shake hands with P6 and, and so on. And

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.600
of course, if you think about the analogy of a tournament,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.080
as soon as the match is over, the winner is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.930
going to shake hands with the loser. But in this case,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.820
the winner shakes hands with the loser after the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.086
tournament is all done. So at every level, we're going to

00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:48.520
have that. So, its essentially, P0 and P4 come down

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.620
to the next level and they shake hands with the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.050
respective losers of that level. And as I said, if

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.340
we have for some arbitrary N, where N is a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.310
binary power, you're going to have this kind of propagation

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.990
of wake-up signals going from the winner to the loser

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.270
at every round. And all of them wake-up and go

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.460
to the next level. Because all of these guys are winners

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.660
from the previous level. So, all of these winners will

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.420
go down to the next level and wake up the losers

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.280
at that level. So that's what is going to happen. Again, what that means from

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.030
the point of view of a shared memory multiprocessor is that the spin location

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.490
for P4, P2, and P6, it's all fixed, right? Statically determined. If P4 knows

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.780
that P0 is going to come over and shake hands, and so that he can spin on a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.130
local variable that is close to it's processor, and so again this is important

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.360
for NCC NUMA machines in which there is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.820
no cache coherence and therefore it is convenient

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.390
if P4 can be spinning on a memory

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.670
location that is close to the processor. Same thing

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.930
with P2 and P6 at the next level. So this process of waking up the losers at

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.810
every level goes on till we reach round 1. And when at round 1, all the winners

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.432
have congratulated. Well, not congratulated, [LAUGH] but shook

00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:15.940
hands with the respective losers at the first round.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.880
At that point, the wake up is complete. Everybody's

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.080
awake now. And, and, the, the barrier is done.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.900
So all are awake, and the barrier is done, and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.950
they can move on, the next phase of the computation.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.700
And once again, in order to make sure that there

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.155
is sense reversal, everybody knows that this barrier is done, and

00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:37.910
they're going to go to the next phase of the computation

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.925
where they will wait on the different [INAUDIBLE] of the barrier.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:44.620
. So, that's Tournament Barrier Algorithm. So the 2 things

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.220
that I want you to take away is, the arrival moves

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.440
up the tree like this, with match fixing. And all the respective winners at

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.202
every round, waiting on a statically determined

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:59.260
spin location. And similarly, when the wake up

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.072
happens, the losers are all waiting on

00:04:02.072 --> 00:04:05.940
statically determined spin location in their respective

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.320
processors and the winner comes over at

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.630
every level at every round of the tournament,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.380
the winner comes over and tells the loser that

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.510
it's time to wake up. So that's how this

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.980
whole thing works. So now that we understand this

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.320
tournament algorithm let's talk about the virtues of this algorithm.
