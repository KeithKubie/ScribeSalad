00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:11.637
If I say, "Venice," do you imagine 
yourself gliding down the Grand Canal,

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:13.869
serenaded by a gondolier?

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.633
There's no doubt that the gondola 
is a symbol of Venice, Italy,

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:23.297
but how did this curious banana-shaped
black boat get its distinctive look?

00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:26.850
The origins of the Venetian gondola 
are lost to history,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.446
but by the 1500s, some 10,000 gondolas
transported dignitaries, merchants and goods

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:35.439
through the city's canals.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:38.977
In fact, Venice teemed with many types
of handmade boats,

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:44.837
from utilitarian rafts to
the Doge's own ostentatious gilded barge.

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:48.858
Like a modern day taxi system,
gondolas were leased to boatmen

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:51.935
who made the rounds of the
city's ferry stations.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:56.314
Passengers paid a fare to be carried from
one side of the Grand Canal to the other,

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:58.734
as well as to other points around the city.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:01.598
But gondoliers soon developed a bad rap.

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:05.857
Historical documents describe numerous
infractions involving boatmen,

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:09.363
including cursing, gambling,
extorting passengers --

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:11.767
even occasional acts of violence.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:14.632
To minimize the unpredictability
of canal travel,

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:18.528
Venetian citizens who could afford it
purchased their own gondolas,

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:22.415
just as a celebirty might use
a private car and driver today.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:27.117
These wealthy Venetians hired two private
gondoliers to ferry them around the city

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:28.894
and maintain their boats.

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:32.638
The gondolas soon became a status symbol,
much like an expensive car,

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:36.212
with custom fittings, 
carved and gilded ornamentation,

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:39.339
and seasonal fabrics, like silk and velvet.

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:42.842
However, the majority of 
gondolas seen today are black

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:46.258
because in 1562, 
Venetian authorities decreed

00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:49.773
that all but ceremonial gondolas 
be painted black

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:53.725
in order to avoid 
sinfully extravagant displays.

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:57.711
Apparently, Venetian authorities did not 
believe in "pimping their rides."

00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:00.617
Still, some wealthy Venetians 
chose to pay the fines

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:03.368
in order to maintain their 
ornamental gondolas,

00:02:03.368 --> 00:02:05.643
a small price to keep up appearances.

00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:09.205
The distinctive look of the gondola 
developed over many centuries.

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:14.227
Each gondola was constructed
in a family boatyard called a squero.

00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:18.165
&gt;From their fathers and grandfathers,
sons learned how to select and season

00:02:18.165 --> 00:02:26.337
pieces of beech, cherry, elm, fir, larch,
lime, mahogany, oak and walnut.

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:29.209
The gondola makers began 
with a wooden template

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.700
that may have been hammered into
the workshop floor generations earlier.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.497
&gt;From this basic form,
they attached fore and aft sterns,

00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:41.157
then formed the longitudinal planks
and ribs that made up the frame

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:45.280
of a boat designed to glide through
shallow, narrow canals.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.948
A gondola has no straight lines or edges.

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:52.266
Its familiar profile was achieved through
an impressive fire and water process

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:57.995
that involved warping the boards with
torches made of marsh reeds set ablaze.

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:02.607
However, the majority of the 500 hours
that went into building a gondola

00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:04.611
involved the final stages:

00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:10.161
preparing surfaces and applying successive 
coats of waterproof varnish.

00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:14.521
The varnish was a family recipe,
as closely guarded as one for risotto

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:16.327
or a homemade sauce.

00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:20.568
Yet even with the woodwork finished,
the gondola was still not complete.

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:23.752
Specialized artisans supplied their
gondola-making colleagues

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:26.635
with elaborate covered 
passenger compartments,

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:29.883
upholstery and ornaments 
of steel and brass.

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:33.554
Oar makers became integral partners
to the gondola makers.

00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:38.534
The Venetian oarlock, or fÃ³rcola,
began as a simple wooden fork,

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:41.979
but evolved into a high-precision tool
that allowed a gondolier

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.411
to guide the oar into many positions.

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.070
By the late 1800s,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.406
gondola makers began to make the left side
of the gondola wider than the right

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:54.368
as a counter balance to 
the force created by a single gondolier.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:59.153
This modification allowed rowers to
steer from the right side only,

00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:01.638
and without lifting the oar from the water.

00:04:01.638 --> 00:04:04.659
While these modifications improved
gondola travel,

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.879
they were not enough to
keep pace with motorized boats.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.314
Today, only about 400 gondolas
glide through the waterways of Venice,

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:16.602
and each year, fewer authentic gondolas
are turned out by hand.

00:04:16.602 --> 00:04:20.834
But along the alleys, street signs 
contain words in Venetian dialect

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:25.512
for the locations of old boatyards,
oar makers and ferry stations,

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:28.203
imprinting the memory 
of the boat-building trades

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:33.751
that once kept life in the most serene 
republic gliding along at a steady clip.
