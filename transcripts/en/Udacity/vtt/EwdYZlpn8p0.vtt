00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.950
Today we will talk about diagnosis. Diagnosis is the identification of the fault

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.280
or faults responsible for a malfunctioning system. The system it could be a car,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.140
a computer program, an organism, or

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.990
the economy. Diagnosis builds on our discussion of classification and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.690
configuration. They start by defining diagnosis. They really setup two spaces.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.430
A data spaces and a hypothesis space. Data about the malfunctioning system.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.970
Hypothesis about the fault that can explain that malfunctioning system.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.190
Then, we'll constructing mappings through data space to hypothesis space

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.650
which amount to diagnosis. We'll discuss two views of diagnosis,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.990
diagnosis as classification and diagnosis as abduction. Abduction in

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.420
this context is a new term to you. We'll discuss it in more detail today.
