00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.229
[applause]

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.429
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Ok. Thank you.

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.170
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We're happy to be here.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.600
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It only takes like 15 minutes
to get here so we can do this all the time.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600
[laughter]

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
Yeah, I mean where do you wanna -

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.839
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We should start in 1998.
You need a fade wipe.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.009
[laughs]

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:31.689
So in 1998 we were living together in Spokane
and making really horrible comic books.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:32.689
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Hey.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.899
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: No, they were bad. And in
fact they were so bad that we would take them

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.960
and leave them places, like in stores, hoping
that people would just pick them up and take

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.960
them and read them.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.210
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: You know when you go to Costco,
and there's like you can get little bits of

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.210
an enchilada?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.210
[laughter]

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.310
Sort of like a sample. Like we had this idea
for comics but no one wanted them. So -

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.310
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.899
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: So if you retain the metaphor,
it means our comics were disgusting. Oh, hey

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:57.899
what's up.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.790
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And back then there was a
video game magazine called Next Generation.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.180
Most of you probably remember it if you've
been gaming for a while, and it was a pretty

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.590
big deal at the time. I remember they posted
a little blurb saying that they were looking

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.680
for a cartoonist to do a comic strip about
video games that they would then run in the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.680
magazine.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.820
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But here we have to emphasize
how things have changed. Because we all know

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.130
about the Internet. Right?

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.130
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik Yeah.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.550
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But this update he was talking
about, was on Next Generation online which

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.800
was, you know, the online component of that
magazine. But it, you know, it being 1998,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.420
this is a gaming news website that updated
once a day, only weekdays at 7 pm.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.900
[laughter]

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.520
And that was considered a lot of content.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.391
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It is not. It turns out.

00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:52.840
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: So it was weird, but it wasn't
until that point that we'd even really considered

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.840
the idea that maybe our love of games and
making comics, we could sort of combine those

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.210
two things. And so, I made, I think, three
or four comics just on my own about, you know,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.119
the popular topics at the time which would
have been George Broussard and Prey.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.119
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.000
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: I can't remember what the
hell the other one -

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.510
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Truly eternal topics.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.640
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. You know, Doom. And
then I showed 'em to Jerry and he, he liked

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.030
'em and he ended up writing a couple. And
so I think between the two of us we ended

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.040
up with maybe five comics that we mailed into
Next Generation. And we never heard back,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.739
you know, weeks went by and I think even maybe
a month or so before I actually mailed them

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.219
and said:"What happened with this, you know,
this comic contest." And they said: "Oh, you

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.790
know, we got your material but we went with
a different cartoonist. We picked another

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.790
winner."

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.180
Another comic never appeared in Next Generation
magazine. So I'm assuming that they just wanted

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.920
to get rid of us. But we had these comics
left over that we thought people should see.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.620
And that's when we decided to turn to the
Internet. At the time.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.069
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: That's true.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.760
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: That's your cue.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.930
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Oh. And so we essentially
offered them up. And again, and this is, is

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.370
you know, there was a 'zine at the time. I
mean this was before the blog nomenclature,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.180
right? And so we essentially started that
we offered our comics to a 'zine called Loony

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.590
Games, which was at that time an adjunct of
Blues News, which was a very, very big deal,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.069
you know, during that era.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.069
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Years ago.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.450
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah, yeah. During the, you
know, the Mesozoic area.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.299
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Well we actually offered
them to pretty much every 'zine at the time.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.870
Like I remember sending them to Telefrag ?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.870
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.079
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: and James Spy and all the
big gaming sites at the time.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.170
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right. And we, so we sort
of felt that, that because it was low to the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.749
ground that this, this 'zine would be a good
venue for our stuff 'cause he wouldn't get

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:58.120
in our way as much as a larger site might
have. In terms of the creative process. And

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.170
that turned out to be incorrect.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.489
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.489
[laughter]

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.579
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And, so is there a rating
for this discussion?

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.870
&gt;&gt;Voice off stage: A rating?

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.950
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yes, i.e., PG, R.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.739
&gt;&gt;Voice off stage: Well it'll be public -

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.000
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Well I don't care. People
know that I say bad words.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.230
[laughter]

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.790
I'm saying, I'm saying does that make, does
that make things complicated for you if I

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.840
say the word "fuck."

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840
[laughter]

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.130
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: No, see you messed that up.
Because ?

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.440
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Oh, I should have done it
the other way around.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440
[laughter]

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.750
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Anyway, here listen now that
you know what word I said, understand that

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.880
that's where all the problems came from. Because
we thought that that was a very funny word.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.180
And I can tell by your reaction that you too
were amused by it.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.180
[laughter]

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.070
But our quote unquote editor felt that profanity
was unnecessary in humor, which is a lie.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.221
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: He told us, he flat out -

00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:54.221
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: A black lie.

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.480
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: He told us that that word
was not funny and that we should not use it

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.500
anymore. And that's, I think, when we decided

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.500
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: That was ?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.630
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: to get our own effing website.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.630
[laughter]

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.630
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.790
&gt;&gt;Voice off stage: That's better.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.850
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. And I made some, you
know, I code it as classy.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.850
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: That's how I do it.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.640
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And I, you know, so we started
to host it elsewhere which was, you know,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.900
and at the time was a byzantine process. But
I wrote some -

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.910
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: The reality is that we gave
Loony Games those six comics under the assumption

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.880
that he would run those comics and then that
would be it. And then, you know, the next

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.390
Monday came, he'd been putting them up once
a week and said: "Need the comic for today.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.830
Where's it at?" We're like, "Well we didn't
sign any kind of agreement to make more of

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.830
these."

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.900
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It was never our intention.
We simply had made something - it would be

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.390
like if you made a delicious meal and then
it was just sitting there on the stove. Like

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.730
we wanted people to sample
our wares.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.410
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And it was really just us
not wanting to disappoint him that made us

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.410
keep doing it.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.410
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It was social anxiety.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.410
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.410
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Actually.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.600
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Um. Yeah. That was it.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.611
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Oh. Okay. And so we started
doing our own thing.

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:59.110
I was able to - I managed to write a set of
frames in HTML ?

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.110
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.850
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: which included some incredibly
large navigation buttons. And the navigation,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.520
the navigation buttons were so large that
the scaling kept creating this huge field

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.670
on the left where no content was. And it was
agitating to me from an aesthetics perspective.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:25.590
And so I started writing, you know, essentially
news posts to a company, the strip for that

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.260
day. Just the different topics that we were
discussing and now that's a core part of the

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.930
site.
Now the idea that the comic includes commentary

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.890
that may or may not be about gaming, or you
know, it might be about a sandwich that I

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.900
had, and thought was great. But all that stuff
the way that that works, is that I was just

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.180
trying to fill that - there was just a void
in the template. And we weren't even, we didn't

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.860
even archive them. Like for three years I
just, you know, select, delete, -

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.880
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.961
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: right out of the raw HTML
file. So -

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.730
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. Those were good days.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.610
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. But, I mean that just,
that just is an assertion that we did not,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.720
we had no idea what we had made. I think that
other people sensed that -

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.730
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Well, the other people did

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.750
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: we were on to something.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.440
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. In fact that the next
leg of our journey ?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.440
takes us -

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.740
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: - At the bar table. Buyers.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.940
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. So now we're on the
Internet and we have a website and people

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:31.400
are coming to it. And you might remember back
in these days the concept of content aggregators.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.960
The idea that a company like a UGO or something
might just buy up a couple thousand websites

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.840
and then run ads across their entire network.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.620
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But that suffix the gator
suffix and its implications of a reptilian

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.310
carnivore will come back.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.310
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughter]

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.310
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Later on. You'll see it.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:53.000
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: So we actually got approached
by a content aggregator named, I forget already.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.500
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Jackasses Incorporated.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.500
[laughter]

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.840
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Let's just, let's -

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: No. Let's use a euphemism.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.380
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Who was it? What was the
name of them?

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.460
&gt;&gt;Male voice off stage: Was it eFront?

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.930
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: eFront. Thank you, sir. I
try to block that out as much as I can. And

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.710
they wanted to, they wanted to add Penny Arcade
to their network and run ads and they promised

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.410
us all this money and said: "You quit your
jobs and you can do this full time and -

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.280
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Oh, and we got stock.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Oh yeah, we got eFront stock.
Hey.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.950
[laughter]

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:24.721
And so we ended up signing the agreement.
And, you know, we didn't realize that what

00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:30.760
we were signing was actually the rights to
Penny Arcade. So we actually literally sold

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:38.829
Penny Arcade to eFront, for some worthless
stock and the promise of advertising revenue.

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:39.830
Right? And basically, that's what we did.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.480
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. That's more or less.
But I mean the document - it's like we had

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.800
a different conception about what that document
represented. I mean, for us that document

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.360
represented the ability to create comics full
time which was an incredible concept. And

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.959
it's entirely possible we would have given
up almost anything do, you know, to do that.

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:58.569
And we did. But it was inadvertent.

00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:02.389
&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. [laughs] And you know,
and they actually made good on the promise.

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:06.730
For the first couple months they did send
us checks and, you know, I did quit Circuit

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:07.730
City.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.000
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: This is that period when
the Internet was just totally rad -

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.620
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. People were just throwing'
money at 'ya. And so I remember it was like,

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.850
you know, Christmas Eve and I think my manager
at Circuit City told me to go do wire maintenance

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.312
on the laptops and I just said: "F you." And
I walked out.

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:24.312
[laughter]

00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:26.320
And, you know, it was pretty much right after
that eFront stopped sending checks.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320
[laughter]

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.310
So that was poor timing on my part.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.310
[laughter]

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:36.920
But yeah, so they stopped sending the money
and then when we asked them where the money

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.279
was, they said that they needed to put more
ads on the site. And so eventually it got

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:44.999
to the point where it was just ads on the
site, and I think at one point if you go back

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:49.680
through the archive you'll see a comic very
early on that is just an ad. That was our

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.199
sort of, us fighting back like we thought
"Well you've taken over every other part of

00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:54.980
the frickin' site, you might as well -

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.889
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And we also introduced a
character named, Mr. Adbannerhead.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:58.949
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs] Yeah.

00:09:58.949 --> 00:10:02.279
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Which was just a subtle dig
at that policy.

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:08.779
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We were frustrated at the
time. And so we said: "Listen this isn't working.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:12.420
We'll just take our comic and go." And that's
when we realized that we couldn't just take

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.870
our comic and go, because it was their comic.
[laughs] It was bad. And they were actually

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.870
gonna fire us.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.459
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. Oh and see 'cause and
this is great. So you knew about eFront, but

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:25.480
I mean do you know that all the ICQ, remember
ICQ -

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.480
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.720
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: There were all the ICQ logs
that came out so they used a lot of ICQ in

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.089
upper echelons of eFront. And all their conversations
about us came to light after the company started

00:10:37.089 --> 00:10:42.449
to have trouble; and it's really strange reading
about yourself in the third person. Like,

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:46.089
you know, it's like opening a book and like
finding out that you're actually incorporated

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:47.420
into some grand drama.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.420
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs] Yeah.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.980
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Because they had every intention
of firing us from our own comic and then having

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.100
other people produce it.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.300
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah, in fact if you, if
you do a search for ICQ logs eFront, you can

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.339
still find the logs and they're incredible.
But the conversations about Penny Arcade,

00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:07.981
I mean, were very far along - they had a new
artist. They had comics done and they were

00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:14.600
ready to fire us. Had their president not
been under investigation for, like some kind

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600
of like racketeering -

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. He had to flee to country
 -

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Tax evasion.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And ended up leaving to Africa.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600
[laughter]

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.820
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We were, we were that close.
And, and so it was at that point that the

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.930
company sort of dissolved under all these
legal problems that we said: "Okay, listen

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.850
you guys owe us a ton of money. Instead of
giving us cash, which we know you don' have,

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:39.800
just give us our comic back." And that's the
only way we were able to get out of it.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.600
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.430
That's true. I'm sorry. I'm like sweating,
like my -

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.430
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.451
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: My heart rate has increased
as a result of that retelling.

00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:47.451
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: That was, that was a very
scary time.

00:11:47.451 --> 00:11:48.970
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: [sighs heavily]

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:54.610
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It was also the time that
we accidentally sold the book rights - for

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.120
five years to a man who took all our money
and moved to Alaska.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120
[laughter]

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.470
So, I mean, that's a different story though,
and we made, we made a lot of bad decisions.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.689
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right. Early on.

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:08.410
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We made bad decisions until
we found someone to make good decisions on

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.410
our behalf.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:14.809
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: On our behalf. Which is who,
who is now sort of, he sort of runs Penny

00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:19.410
Arcade. Like the business side of Penny Arcade.
We eventually realized, you know, due to the

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.649
stories that we have just told you, and other
stories which we have not yet related -

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:25.170
[laughter]

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.019
we decided that we were not business people.
That the best we could do, the best we could

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:35.930
do, in this life was to create three jpegs
a week. That was the extent of our capabilities.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:36.930
[laughter]

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.999
and we decided not to reach for the stars.

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:43.999
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: At this point, you know,
so eFront stopped paying us - we've both quit

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:46.860
our jobs - we're at the VA.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.860
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We're -

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.481
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And I remember having
a conversation with Jerry where I said: "Okay.

00:12:50.481 --> 00:12:56.389
Well, do we go back to our jobs and quit doing
Penny Arcade or do we, do we try to figure

00:12:56.389 --> 00:13:00.769
out some other way to make this work?" And
it just so happened that literally that day

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:05.319
I had gotten an email from a reader who was
telling me about the Amazon honor system.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:11.369
And it had just come out that week and it
was a system where readers could donate money

00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:12.939
to you for nothing.

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:14.990
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's just a transactional
system similar -

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.990
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It's a tip jar for your website.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.100
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah, sort of like PayPal,
the way PayPal works.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.879
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And we, you know, in
our heads running the numbers, which we can't

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:26.201
run. We thought "Okay, well if we have" -

00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:27.350
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: remember what the number
was?

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.819
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: If we have 50 thousand readers
and each one of them gives us one dollar everyday

00:13:31.819 --> 00:13:32.819
like ?

00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:33.819
[laughter]

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:35.930
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: we're like we're gonna be
bijillionaires!

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:36.930
[laughter]

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.860
And so, you know, we put the tip jar up, and
we weren't bijillionaires. You know,

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:46.329
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Listen we weren't bizillionaires,
but it is a fact that after a single day of,

00:13:46.329 --> 00:13:49.050
of requests for donations there was ten thousand
dollars in there.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:54.240
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And it ended up that
we said "Okay, how much money do you and I

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.970
need to live? Rent? Groceries? Video games?"
Take that number -

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.550
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's a part of a food pyramid.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.550
[laughter]

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.550
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.550
[laughter]

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.670
And we took that number and we put it on the
website and we said: "Dear reader: This is

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.509
how much we need to live."

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:09.509
[laughter]

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:10.610
"Please give us this."

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:16.040
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It was essentially like an
NPR type, you know, public media sort of thing.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040
I mean, that's -

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.370
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. We were very honest.
We constantly showed the graph of - here's

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.480
how much we need or we'll starve to death.
And here's where we are.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.029
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right. There's still gonna
be some kind of benefit.

00:14:26.029 --> 00:14:28.619
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. Wow. Is that the Internet
archive or -

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:29.619
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yes, exactly.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:30.619
&gt;&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: or way back machine?

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:31.619
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. See he has, he has
our thermometer.

00:14:31.619 --> 00:14:35.540
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And we gave away little
prizes when, you know, we reached our goal.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.300
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Sort of like the fair. Yeah.
You know -

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.639
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Sustaining our lives apparently
we thought wasn't enough. They're gonna need

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:41.139
a jpeg too.

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:42.139
[laughter]

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:43.139
Not enough that we fed ourselves.

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:44.139
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's sort of our line though
 - jpegs.

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:47.850
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And that did it for
 -

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.889
&gt;Jerry Holkins: Year and a half.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:50.162
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: A year and a half.

00:14:50.162 --> 00:14:54.199
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And then eventually, we sort
of got the sense - cause we were married at

00:14:54.199 --> 00:14:55.199
this time -

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:56.199
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:57.199
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We got the sense that -

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:58.199
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:01.690
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We got the sense relying
the Internet, relying on -

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.889
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: The generosity of strangers
 ?

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:06.649
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Was not a strong strategy.

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:09.352
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It's a tough sell domestically.
Let's say that.

00:15:09.352 --> 00:15:12.660
[laughter]
When your wife wants to know, you know, where

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.990
the check is coming from and you say -

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.009
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: "The Internet."

00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:17.009
[laughter]

00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:19.819
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: People. Alright. Deal with
it. "Will we have enough to make the rent?"

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:24.749
I don't know yet. Listen it's only the 15th,
honey, I mean, don't you see my graph.

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:25.749
[laughter]

00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:28.480
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: I cannot believe we got -

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.629
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: They should never have gone
along with that plan as long as they did.

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:33.629
Yeah.

00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:37.839
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Long suffering. But, so,
shortly thereafter we received an email from

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:43.579
someone who wanted to talk to us about a business
opportunity. And I think that we all get mails

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:44.579
that -

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:48.720
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]
that describe the contours of a business opportunity

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.619
with some frequency. Sometimes from Nigeria.

00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:51.939
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:15:51.939 --> 00:15:52.960
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And so -

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.079
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We disregarded it.

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:58.689
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. Exactly. And then he
wrote us back saying that he would take us

00:15:58.689 --> 00:16:01.040
to lunch and, and it turned around.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.759
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. We perked up at that
point.

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:03.759
[laughter]

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:04.759
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:09.989
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. The concept of a free
lunch - literally a free lunch - got us interested.

00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:12.670
That was the only reason we met with Robert.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:18.269
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right. And so we did meet
him and he was able to quickly ascertain - being

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:22.800
a person of more than average intelligence
 - that we were idiots.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.800
[laughter]

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.600
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. He was at the time
running, working for a consulting company

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.850
and one of their consultants - consultantees?
consulters?

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.850
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Consulters.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.889
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: One of the companies they
were consulting for was a video game company,

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:40.119
and his idea for them was that they should
advertise on Penny Arcade.

00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:41.680
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: He was a reader. He loved
the comic.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.649
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And it was at this
point that we just started sort of trying

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:50.019
to transition from simply donations to also
doing advertising. And believe it or not,

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:52.709
I was actually the one that got pegged as
being the business guy.

00:16:52.709 --> 00:16:55.389
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yes, no doubt. But it changed
after Saga -

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:56.910
&gt;&gt;Male voice from audience: Yes.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.439
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: So we ended up, I ended up
calling up - through a number of sources I

00:17:01.439 --> 00:17:05.390
got a phone number for Saga - and I thought
this would be great. They have - we love their

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.490
games - they're gonna want to advertise on
our site.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.490
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: They called John Saga.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.940
&gt;&gt;Mike K: [laughs] Yeah. And I remember we
talked about it trying to decide - well how

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:18.059
much should we charge for an advertising slot
on Penny Arcade? And we, we came to the idea

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:21.299
that one thousand dollars for a month of advertising
would be pretty hot.

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:22.939
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: That's a lot of money.

00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:27.459
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And I'm not gonna detail
the conversation I had with Saga's very nice

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:32.721
marketing lady, but in the end she ended up
paying two hundred dollars. So I'm not a great

00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:37.510
business person, at all. It was horrible.
She just destroyed me over the phone until

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.779
I was crying and said I'd take whatever she
wanted to pay us.

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:41.779
[laughter]

00:17:41.779 --> 00:17:42.830
But we got those ads for "18-wheeler".

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.830
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: That's right.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.830
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: You know.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.830
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.830
&lt;&lt;Mike Krahulik: And so Robert could see that
we had no idea what we were doing. It's just

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.830
obvious to him.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.770
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. We had huge problems.
And it, it happened that, I mean, so the next

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.630
time that he, he wanted to start having weekly
meetings with us. And, but these meetings

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.470
included lunch. And so we continued to attend
them.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.470
[laughter]

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.240
And he would, we would eat turkey and he would
hold forth and this is a great scenario.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.190
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Remember, remember he asked
us what our ten year plan was? [laughs]

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.309
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:16.250
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We didn't have an afternoon
plan.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.250
[laughter]

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.480
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. Our plan - the current
plan was on the plate.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.480
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.370
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And after we managed that
we were gonna try to come up with a new scenario.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.370
[laughter]

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.390
But, you know, though one of these meetings
 - one of those ill-fated meetings - he came

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.929
and he just laid a piece of paper down on
the table and said "This is a five year plan.

00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:38.309
I will - I'm gonna quit my job. I'm gonna
work for you guys for free for three months

00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:43.640
and if I can't, if I can't pay my way then
I'll quit and you guys can go back to doing

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.190
what you were doing before." And, um -

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.149
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It worked out pretty good.

00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:49.149
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:50.149
[laughter]

00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:51.149
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: He did a good job. It turns
out.

00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:54.950
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Just as an index - as an
index of his organizational might - I mean

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.520
the first, the first PAX he put together in
three months.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.040
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: That's pretty incredible.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.090
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: I mean he put together a
gaming convention which is now more or less

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.940
seen as, as you know, the you know, quote
unquote consumer, right? But I'm not super

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.600
enthusiastic about that kind of terminology.
A gaming convention, you know, that is the

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.169
pride of the Western Hemisphere. It had its
genesis in a three month plan by Robert.

00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:24.270
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. So - so he came on
board and, and started really trying to actually

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.840
spin up an advertising, like a revenue stream,
I guess it what he calls it.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840
&lt;&lt;Jerry Holkins: Yes. Multiple streams.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Revenue river.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.840
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: He wanted to diversify.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.899
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And have synergy.

00:19:32.899 --> 00:19:33.899
[laughter]

00:19:33.899 --> 00:19:39.120
And so as soon as he started getting ads on
the site, we thought that it just wasn't appropriate

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120
to do the -

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.120
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: The donation -

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.710
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: the donations anymore. So
it was right when Robert came on and the ads

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:49.080
started working that we dropped the honor
system. But like I said that had worked for

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:55.830
a year and a half. And so Robert came on.
He got the advertising working. He got merchandise

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:01.169
working. All the stuff that we couldn't do
 - he did. And it allowed us to really just

00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:06.830
focus on making comics. Which was all we could
ever do anyway. [laughs] It was really the

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.929
best thing that could have happened for Penny
Arcade.

00:20:08.929 --> 00:20:09.929
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:10.929
[pause]

00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:11.929
That's it.

00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:12.929
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs}

00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:15.940
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: I mean more or less, that's
it.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:21.750
&lt;&lt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. So after a while we'd
been going to a lot of conventions around

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:27.269
the country - some of them like in school
gymnasiums. I mean we went everywhere. Did

00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:31.570
all kinds of shows. But we realized that every
one of these shows that we went to, was almost

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.270
always comics and maybe they would have like
a little bit of a gaming corner annex -

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.570
&lt;&lt;Jerry Holkins: Ghetto.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.080
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Ghetto. There, where they
had like an Xbox. Or it was all anime and

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.690
they would have a little gaming section.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.690
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.450
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We though why isn't anyone
making a gaming convention. Like this sort

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.679
of convention for gamers.

00:20:48.679 --> 00:20:51.059
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right. It can have this other
stuff -

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:52.059
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:20:52.059 --> 00:20:53.059
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: That's fine.

00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:57.960
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: But the focus of it should
be on video games. And I remember we started

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.380
working with a company that was doing a show
back East.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.380
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Uberchan.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.480
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Called Uberchan. 'Cause we
in our minds, we have no expertise putting

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.019
on shows so that what we thought is: "Well
we'll work with someone who's put on shows

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:15.050
before. We'll just have them come over to
Seattle and help us do it." And it turned

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.550
out that what they wanted to do was make an
Uberchan Seattle, instead of a Penny Arcade

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:25.180
expo. And that, we sort of came to that conclusion
late in the -

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.990
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. You mean, things had
been underway. Planning for this convention

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.030
had been underway for a while before we realized
that we were talking about two completely

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.030
different conventions.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.340
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. And so, I remember
they left after a meeting and we all sort

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.100
of looked at each other and realized what
was, what they, what had happened and what

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.559
they wanted and what we wanted, and we said
to Robert: "Can we just make our own convention?

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:50.090
Can we do that." And it was three months later
that -

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.090
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.480
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: that he had pulled PAX together.
And it's just, it's doubled every year since

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480
then. The size -

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.770
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It doubled, it you know,
it doubled until we physically could not hold

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:01.770
anymore human beings.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:02.770
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.789
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And so, I mean, that the
limiting factor now is, is the physical universe.

00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:07.850
[laughter]

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:12.230
So that's a pretty good, that's a pretty good
thing. We just, we had, and then you know,

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:17.299
five years into it we opened up PAX East,
which is gonna be in Boston at the end of

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:21.710
March, and that just sold out of three day
passes. Like months in advance of the show.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:27.840
So, pretty crazy. It's pretty crazy stuff.
Our job right there, I mean obviously we don't

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.990
have the mechanical, or you know, systemic
expertise to put something like that on, but

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.370
our role there is more or less to act as ambassadors
and try to safe -

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.370
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Safeguard the -

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.090
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Safeguard the culture of
the show.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.090
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We're figureheads.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.730
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.559
&lt;&lt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs] And Penny Arcade
itself has grown from just bringing on Robert

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:48.170
to now we have ten employees.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.529
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But the reason he pauses
is because we just, we just interviewed for

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:53.049
another position, so right now we have a quasi-

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:54.769
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We have a possible new member.

00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:58.539
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: eleventh member. And so they
haven't fully materialized in our mind yet,

00:22:58.539 --> 00:22:59.539
but -

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:00.580
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: But that's basically the
history of Penny Arcade. Right?

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.000
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: In a nutshell.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.720
&gt;&gt;Mike K: Yeah. So we would love q's for our
a's.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.331
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: If you have them.

00:23:09.331 --> 00:23:10.889
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Or we can go get lunch -

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:11.889
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We can go to the pseudo-cafe.
I understand they have a milkshake.

00:23:11.889 --> 00:23:18.750
&gt;&gt;Voice in audience: How much time do you
have do you have to game a week?

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:24.019
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Well, it depends on the week.
You know, like right now we're doing another

00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:28.909
big project, so we just, we finished the,
was it eight pages was the last Dragon H comic?

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:29.909
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Um, hum.

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:32.529
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: So we did the eight page
Dragon H comic and now we're doing -

00:23:32.529 --> 00:23:33.740
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Can we talk about that?

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.789
&lt;&lt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. We're doing a 6 page
Dragon H comic for the new expansion.

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:38.789
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Expansion.

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:41.809
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And so, on a, you know on
a week like that, I'm trying to knock out

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:46.620
pages and so I really don't game at the office
much at all. But at home, you know, I'll go

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.980
home and from when, you know, when Gabe goes
to bed at 7:30 until 11:00 or midnight, I'm

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.980
playing games.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.059
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. It's usually 8:30,
9:00 to midnight. Is like the dedicated time

00:23:57.059 --> 00:23:58.650
that I can guarantee every day.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.650
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.870
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: I, you know, it's catch as
catch can the rest of the time. And then depending

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:08.640
on the game, like sometimes, you know, sometimes,
we'll try to make time during the day at the

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.600
office. Like it, it doesn't take as much physical
time for me to do my part of these tasks,

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.120
and so sometimes I'm allowed to have more
recreation at the office.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.350
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Honestly, for me, like if
he's playing a game that's almost the same.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.270
Like he played through Call of Duty in the
office and I just sat, you know, I was at

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.909
my desk drawing and watching and so I feel
like I played Call of Duty. Like -

00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:30.909
[laughter]

00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:32.899
And, you know, with Darksiders, I played through
most of Darksiders -

00:24:32.899 --> 00:24:35.940
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Exactly. It also depends
on the game. Like it may not be our intention

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.940
to play a game -

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.940
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.750
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It may be our intention to
work on important tasks and sometimes that

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.750
does not occur.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.210
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.
And then, you know, you're playing Darksiders

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.529
for, you know, a couple weeks straight and
Robert pokes his head in and he's like: "What

00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:53.820
are you guys doin'?" And I go: "It's research."
Maybe we do a Darksiders comic, I don't know.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820
[laughter]

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.940
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We did get one.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.101
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We got one.

00:24:57.101 --> 00:24:58.101
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We got one comic - 20 hours.

00:24:58.101 --> 00:24:59.101
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. That's pretty good.

00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:04.190
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's a strong investment.
But we love to answer them, and if not, that's

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.190
totally fine. Alright.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.639
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: Are your kids old
enough to play along, read the comics or play

00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:09.980
games or that type of thing?

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.389
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Not to read the comic, no.

00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:12.669
[laughter]

00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:18.429
Oh, repeat the question. So, are our kids
old enough to repeat, to repeat the question?

00:25:18.429 --> 00:25:19.429
[laughter]

00:25:19.429 --> 00:25:25.169
Are they old enough to read the comic and
play games? Not read the comic, no. And play

00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:30.841
games, yes. Like Gabe is five now and so he
has his own DSI and he plays Lego Star Wars

00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:37.960
constantly. And it's actually sort of - we've
had some interesting discussions about Lego

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:43.049
Star Wars and Star Wars in general, because
he's, you know if your son comes to you and

00:25:43.049 --> 00:25:47.769
says "Daddy, your Clone Trooper's good" - it's
like, well that's an interesting discussion,

00:25:47.769 --> 00:25:48.769
son. So you know -

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:49.769
[laughter]

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:50.769
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Sit here on my -

00:25:50.769 --> 00:25:52.159
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It's like, you have to sit
him down. You have to explain, "Well, listen

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:55.840
they are good," but then you have to talk
about order of 66 and then you have to talk

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.789
about the Jedi and it's like were the Jedi
in decline, did they deserve what happened

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:59.789
to them? It's like -

00:25:59.789 --> 00:26:00.789
[laughter]

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:02.460
so, yeah he games.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.840
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. Were they at they a
decrepit order by that time?

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.880
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Right. I mean, did they need
to be sort of rebuilt and restructured -

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.519
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And in that case, are the
Clone Troopers actually being the agent of

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:14.529
that restructuring doing a good thing. Doing
a favor for the universe. Like -

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:15.840
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Right.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.550
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It's, still, still we're
still talkin' about it.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.550
[laughter]

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.550
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Ongoing.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.550
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Ongoing.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.330
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But my, my daughter is five
months and so she's, there's a lot of things

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:26.419
she can't do.

00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:27.419
[laughter]

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:35.540
Except charm me. She's pretty good at that.
But my son, Elliot is four and he, he takes

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:43.280
on more of a managerial role. Jump. Shoot.
You know. He'll direct me toward foes, which

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.909
I appreciate. I mean, I don't always see them.

00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:47.909
[laughter]

00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:48.909
You know.

00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:49.909
[laughter]

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:52.490
But, but no, more or less like it's just something
to talk about. It's just something to discuss.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:59.649
I mean a lot of the games that Daddy plays
are, would be completely incoherent to him

00:26:59.649 --> 00:27:04.450
one hundred percent of the time. So "Cloudy
with a Chance of Meatballs", maybe not a lot

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.760
of meat on there for a, you know for a critical
perspective, but it does have huge meatballs.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.019
[laughter]

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:11.470
So, you know, there's still something to discuss.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:20.200
&gt;&gt;Female voice in audience: Actually that
brings up another question - like will you

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.880
let them play any games they -

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.990
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Absolutely not.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.761
&gt;&gt;Female voice in audience: Do you have like
concerns about Grand Theft Auto and all these

00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:27.761
other games that -

00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:28.761
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: No.

00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:29.761
&gt;&gt;Female voice in audience: the other children
in -

00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:30.761
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And it's from my point of
view, I actually really enjoy finding games

00:27:30.761 --> 00:27:35.110
for him to play at this point, you know. And
not just, you know, like he likes Up and he

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:39.129
likes, like the movie tie-ins to the game,
to the movies that he goes and sees, but,

00:27:39.129 --> 00:27:45.379
you know, finding stuff like, trying to think
of the last one ? oh, so the, the game

00:27:45.379 --> 00:27:46.379
Modnation Racers -

00:27:46.379 --> 00:27:47.379
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: For PS3.

00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:52.110
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: For PS3. The beta that just
came out - he loved that. Like being able

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:57.900
to construct his own track and then drive
it and then, you know, put trees down and

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.900
like I think -

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.210
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: What parent wouldn't want
their child to -

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.210
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:02.210
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: invent a race track?

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.900
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: There's so much good content
out there that's great for kids, that, I mean,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.759
it's never even occurred to me that he would
have to play some violent game.

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:11.659
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: You know, it's, you know,
it's a purely generational thing.

00:28:11.659 --> 00:28:12.659
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:17.000
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: You know. You know, now that
we're creating our own larva and you know

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:25.259
and nurturing them to pupa stage - you know,
we, we aren't afraid of technology, you know

00:28:25.259 --> 00:28:30.279
what I'm saying, in the same way. Like, I
mean there are still things that are frightening

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:35.889
like RFID, but there's, you know, but at the
same time, I felt confident that material

00:28:35.889 --> 00:28:36.889
wouldn't work here.

00:28:36.889 --> 00:28:37.889
[laughter]

00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:38.889
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:28:38.889 --> 00:28:39.889
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But -

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:40.889
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulic: Strong play.

00:28:40.889 --> 00:28:41.889
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:41.889 --> 00:28:42.889
[laughter]

00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:45.691
I mean essentially, you know, the way that,
like there's a rating on the fuck - there's

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:49.899
a rating on the effing box that will tell
you if it's appropriate.

00:28:49.899 --> 00:28:50.899
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:28:50.899 --> 00:28:53.370
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And, I mean, those, those
ratings, those ratings get goofy sometimes

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:59.779
between M and T. Like there's some strange,
you know there's some demarcations there which

00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:05.830
are maybe odd. But I am a thinking being and
I'm certainly capable of discerning what kinds

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.840
of material is appropriate -

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:14.460
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And I know my son. Like I
know what he is able to take in and what,

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.659
if he's able to handle a game that yeah do
you shoot guys in this game with a laser gun

00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:23.750
like Star Wars? Well, yeah, you do shoot guys,
but I think he knows it's pretend and -

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.650
&lt;&lt;Jerry Holkins: And also I just it just sort
of like, this is what I mean by the generational

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:29.440
shift - like I mean obviously a parent, it's
like, it's like you imagine them standing

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.629
in, in the aisle at Game Stop, like just,
you know, tearing their hair out trying to

00:29:33.629 --> 00:29:37.580
conceive of, you know, how, what's my relationship
to this medium supposed to be? Well they would

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.771
never send their child to see Robo Cop or
some, you know -

00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:41.771
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:42.771
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: R rated movie, right?

00:29:42.771 --> 00:29:43.771
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulic: Yeah.

00:29:43.771 --> 00:29:47.330
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Well, it's a very similar
rating mechanism is on this box, like all

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:52.429
you have to do is be aware of the media your
child consumes. Like it's just not -

00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:54.350
&lt;&lt;Mike Krahulik: It's not too much to ask
for some people.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.370
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's not, it's not that weird.
I don't think. I mean, I am excited by the

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:04.029
prospect of being able to guide my son through
this medium and showing him the works that

00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:10.980
I think are, are, you know, crucial to it.
I'm excited about that process.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:21.130
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: One of my favorite
ones comic strips you guys did was the [inaudible]

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.130
Part 2

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.130
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: [laughs]

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.130
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: with the -

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.130
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Oh, no, you say it and then
I'll repeat it.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.130
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: Okay, yeah.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.289
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: I'm going to repeat it.

00:30:29.289 --> 00:30:30.470
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: My favorite ones
was the political cartoon where you had the

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.139
parents who were, that you couldn't find a
babysitter or whatever and they said "well

00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:33.139
just put him -

00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:34.460
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. Exactly, well let's
put him in front of, you know, Blood Demons

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.490
5 or whatever.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.620
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: Not a Q more of
an S.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.880
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: [laughs]

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880
[laughter]

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.550
He, he liked one of the comics we did.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.330
[laughter]

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.470
And we appreciate that.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.470
[laughter]

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.769
&lt;&lt;Mike Krahulik: I think there was a Q over
here.

00:30:49.769 --> 00:30:50.769
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:30:50.769 --> 00:30:58.009
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: We're all programmers
mostly so we all want our kids to make games

00:30:58.009 --> 00:30:59.539
 - what do you know that you guys want your
kids to do?

00:30:59.539 --> 00:31:06.820
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: So the question is "what
do we want our children to be?" Gabe mostly

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.309
wanted to be a boat policeman.

00:31:09.309 --> 00:31:10.309
[laughter]

00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:14.510
But he came to me, until just a couple of
days ago, he came to me and said that he decided

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.769
he wanted to be a hair stylist.

00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:16.769
[laughter]

00:31:16.769 --> 00:31:20.820
And I thought that was odd and I said "Why?"
And apparently he'd combed Mommy's hair and

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.909
she told him that it looked good and so he
thought that he was really good at styling

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:25.909
hair -

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:26.909
[laughter]

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:30.920
and so he should make that a career choice.
I explained that he has time, you know. He

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920
doesn't have to decide right now.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920
[laughter]

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.769
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's like there's actually
many human tasks.

00:31:34.769 --> 00:31:39.669
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. I don't know, I just,
I want him to do something creative. It's

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:42.470
the only thing I've thought about, you know.
When I think about his future I want him to

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.470
do something that makes him happy and is creative.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:51.990
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. I mean that's more
or less the, I would say that's probably a

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.011
universal thing. When I say universal of course
I mean the two of us.

00:31:55.011 --> 00:31:56.011
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:31:56.011 --> 00:31:57.011
[laughter]

00:31:57.011 --> 00:32:00.159
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Which is the extent of our
universe, by and large. But, yeah, yeah, I

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:07.510
mean I essentially, I want him to, I want
him to have, you know, a certain degree of

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:13.980
mastery over his, over his daily life and
his expression. I mean for me, and there's

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.690
many venues for that. I suspect I have no
idea what he'll actually end up accomplishing

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.889
and his skill set is still being revealed
to me. He hasn't put all of his points in.

00:32:23.889 --> 00:32:25.190
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.190
[laughter]

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:30.110
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But, no, it's a process that's
pretty fascinating to see unfold.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.090
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: Does he know to
horde all the points for [inaudible].

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.169
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:35.169
[laughter]

00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:36.169
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Epic tier.

00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:37.169
[laughter]

00:32:37.169 --> 00:32:38.169
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:32:38.169 --> 00:32:39.169
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: So do you have,
like an agenda or a long-term goal for the

00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:46.110
comic? Or are you kind of living in the moment?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:52.809
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Do we have a long-term goal
for the comic? For the content of the comic?

00:32:52.809 --> 00:32:55.539
&lt;&lt;Jerry Holkins: No. [laughs]

00:32:55.539 --> 00:33:00.909
And the content just as a general concept
like, you know, we sort of see it as our role

00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:05.110
to distill a given day or a given moment.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.610
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And we don't know what we
are going to do Friday.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.610
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We really don't.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.610
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: This Friday.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:10.610
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Maybe, we'll, you know,

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.610
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.900
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Maybe it'll tie into this
scenario. Maybe we'll have something really

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.900
delicious for lunch.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.900
[laughter]

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.929
And then we'll want to capture that -

00:33:16.929 --> 00:33:17.929
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:20.890
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: moment. But more or less
like when we do, when we do comics ahead of

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.610
time every now and then we'll do a story line
or something like that if we have to leave

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:29.070
town or something like that. But as a general
rule, when we do work ahead of time, we feel

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:37.259
like it's cheating. It's core to the experience
of creating the comic for us that it be immediate.

00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:41.419
And so, that's a reason that we don't, we
don't plan ahead. Like, like we sort of like

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.549
that, that element of it.

00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:44.549
[pause]

00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:50.620
&gt;&gt;Male voice in audience: I'm, wondering so,
from your site of people Dungeons and Dragons,

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:58.129
like current paper version and the video console
games, I was kind of wondering how you split

00:33:58.129 --> 00:34:05.200
your time between those on maybe also to hear
that compete for my share like to -

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.169
something now that the telephone is getting
more elaborate?

00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:14.899
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: So, he wants to know how
we split our time basically between table

00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:19.240
top and video games and if they're competing
for time. Right?

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.579
&gt;&gt;Mail voice in audience: Yeah.

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:24.919
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Well, I have a set time that
I play Dungeons and Dragons. So I have my

00:34:24.919 --> 00:34:30.960
weekly game every Monday night that I run.
And really, I mean, I spend some time during

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.980
the week, you know, planning my game and usually
on the weekend, I'll spend a couple hours

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.980
 ?

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.311
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We spend, I would say that
we spend a lot of time ?

00:34:36.311 --> 00:34:39.200
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: I spend a lot of time thinking
about my game. But I don't feel like it competes

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:45.500
for it. I mean, if anything, I think, you
know, WoW competes with every other game that

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.500
I want to do ?

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.500
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's a form of human entertainment
 -

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.500
[laughter]

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.270
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. It's like when that
stuff that comes out and like I have to let

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.950
Kiko know that I'm not going to be rating
this week and then I, you know, but you're

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:58.680
the Healer, how are we supposed to get ICC
if you don't have ? I'm like: "I'm sorry,

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.230
but--" I mean, WoW is a thing that competes.
You know.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:07.190
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But, I mean also, you know,
the time that you can spend with an electronic

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:11.859
game is pretty dynamic. I mean you can sit
down virtually anytime you have free time

00:35:11.859 --> 00:35:16.030
at home, you can sit down and have that experience.
Whereas the table top stuff it needs to be

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.980
a little bit more engineered. I mean you need
to set that time aside because it has so many

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:25.260
real world components. And so they tend not
to step on each other because the planning

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.320
phase is so real for the, you know, the human
element.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.320
[pause]

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.050
&gt;&gt;Woman's voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.210
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It is.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:41.160
&gt;&gt;Woman's voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:48.349
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: How do we balance work and
play since our--

00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:49.349
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Since our work is play.

00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:52.349
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Since our work is play. Well,
it was a lot harder when we worked from home.

00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:54.559
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: This is exactly the point
I was gonna make.

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:58.550
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: When you work from home,
you are always in the office. And so that

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:05.160
was tough, you know, and but once we got an
office, we leave at five. We go in from nine

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:11.950
to five and, yeah, I mean, we play, but when
I go home at five o'clock, I'm home. And,

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:18.760
you know, I'm Daddy and, you know, I'm makin'
dinner and it's fun times. But we needed that

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.760
specific--

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: There needed to be a demarcation.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.760
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.450
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It was horrible, especially
near the end, like before Robert got the office.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.349
Like we thought the office was going to be
this huge problem, 'cause like I said, I mean,

00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:32.270
the dynamism of getting together and creating
a comic about something that is happening

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:38.231
right now, we felt that having an office would
injure that immediacy. Which it turns out

00:36:38.231 --> 00:36:43.170
is complete-- just not true. Like if you can
make comics, you can make comics under a variety

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.980
of circumstances, it turns out. But we had
a lot of psychological investment in this

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.930
ritual. You know, we felt that the context
was somehow communicating something important

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.855
to the mix or something. And it turns out
that that's not true. We just know how to

00:36:54.855 --> 00:36:58.200
make comics and we can do that even under
those circumstances.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.220
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And it allows us to sort
of be able, you know, when you get in your

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.060
car and you're driving home, you can throw
that switch and you're like: "Okay, I'm not

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.910
making comics anymore ? I'm not checking my
email constantly ? I'm not watching Twitter

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:12.710
all the time, like I'm going home to be play
Legos, you know." Like, that's, I need that.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.950
[pause]

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:27.550
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: So you sort of
reference a lot of current games, I am wondering

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.660
if you are introducing your kids as well to
like classic games like Super Mario and so

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.890
forth, or if you're just playing new versions
of those? I know that in some cases it's hard

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.630
to play like original Nintendo stuff cause
it's hard to play the old stuff.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.630
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.630
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: I'm just kind of
curious about [inaudible]

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:42.009
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: So are we introducing our
children to older games or just the new stuff?

00:37:42.009 --> 00:37:48.780
I'd say gaming wise he doesn't, he's not really
playing anything old, just because I don't

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.620
have the consoles in the house. You know,
he's playing Super Mario Brothers but it's

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:59.370
the new one on the Wii, you know. And mostly
he just bubbles while I run around. But the

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:04.859
hardest part sort of in that, you know, in
that concept for me was when it came time

00:38:04.859 --> 00:38:07.530
to show him Star Wars. It's like well do you
start with the prequels?

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.690
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: No.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:09.690
[laughter]

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:10.690
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: No. You don't.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.690
[laughter]

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.460
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: You'll go, you'll go chronological.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.750
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: To the prequel.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.670
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: No. But now it's messed him
up to the point to where if I say: "Well that

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.829
was in, that was in the second Star Wars is
the one you're thinking about." And he's like:

00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:26.030
"Well that's the one with the adapts, right."
And I'm like: "Well, yeah, that's the second

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.940
of the good ones, but there's a real second
one that actually has", is you know, it's

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.990
tricky. Yeah, I mean, for my--, I might be
making more work for myself.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.990
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's entirely possible.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.990
[laughter]

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.990
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: I'm starting to realize this.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.160
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Well, I mean it's in, I mean,
for now I just, I'll show him something, anything

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.670
that I think has a lot of primary colors ?

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.099
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And will appeal to him. [laughs]

00:38:45.099 --> 00:38:49.079
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: More or less it sort of like,
in the same way any of his appetites must

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:54.630
be satisfied, right? I'll feed him what he'll
eat. And that's just sort of how it is when

00:38:54.630 --> 00:39:00.260
they're as young as my son is. But, I mean,
eventually I hope to have a full and robust

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:05.890
curriculum. That, you know, that will be able
to, you know, there'll be tests every so often.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:06.890
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: [laughs]

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:07.890
[laughter]

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:08.890
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: So long term play.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:09.890
[pause]

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.890
&gt;&gt;Woman's voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:11.970
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Umm--

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.790
&gt;&gt;Woman's voice in audience: How [inaudible]

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:20.960
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Well, yeah, I man PacMan
for me going back is like one of my earliest

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.960
memories of playing games.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.150
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Pizza parlor type thing.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:29.850
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah, and it ended up, you
know, when I came time to design Gabe as the

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:36.190
sort of the console gamer, it's the most iconic
thing I could think of to put on his shirt

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.170
that would say "This is a gamer who plays--

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.170
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: He plays video games.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.430
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulic: He plays video games.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.020
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Try to misinterpret this
symbol.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.020
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah, you know, and beyond
that, that was really all I was thinking at

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.830
the time was this means games. This symbol
means games.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.780
&gt;&gt;Woman's voice: [inaudible]

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:57.490
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: No, the, Gabe in the comic
had the tattoo first. And I got tired of going

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.180
to conventions and having people say: "Oh,
can I see the tattoo?"

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.180
[laughter]

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.059
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And I'd be like: "No, I don't
actually have it in real life." And so I was

00:40:03.059 --> 00:40:04.059
like, you know what screw it.

00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:05.710
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: So every convention's so
satisfying just ?

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.090
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: I actually do have it.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.090
[laughter]

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.970
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah, so I had to get it
because I had forced that upon myself.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:12.970
[laughter]

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.599
&gt;&gt;Woman's voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:25.619
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Somebody else would have
to tell us. Yeah. I think it probably has.

00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:32.050
Does having kids, has having kids changed
the nature or tone of our comic? I think it

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.050
probably has.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.930
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Well certainly there's comics
which include children.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:36.780
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: That's a big way. Yeah.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.560
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: That's a point of demarcation
there.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.200
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: But yeah, I don't know that
we could answer that as

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.450
well as somebody else could.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:48.900
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But our, you know, our comic
for today has to do with pedophile unicorns.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.350
So it's like, you know what I'm saying, like
 ?

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.150
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Maybe not-- maybe it hasn't.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.150
[laughter]

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.599
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: So a little from Column A;
a little from Column B, I guess.

00:40:56.599 --> 00:40:57.799
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:40:57.799 --> 00:40:58.799
[laughter]

00:40:58.799 --> 00:40:59.799
[pause]

00:40:59.799 --> 00:41:05.030
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: I was wondering
how you feel about celebrity and how in certain

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.640
circles you're very famous and how that affects
you.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.800
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: We've been asked to comment
on our celebrity.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.619
[laughter]

00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:19.480
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: You don't really get used
to that kind of stuff.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.030
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: No. At least if you were
not crazy.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.181
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:41:23.181 --> 00:41:29.589
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Right? And if you do not
actively seek it out ? Exactly, then you don't,

00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:33.311
if one does not, it is not something that
is--

00:41:33.311 --> 00:41:36.329
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It is not something - that
it is possible for us to integrate. Into our

00:41:36.329 --> 00:41:37.329
psychology.

00:41:37.329 --> 00:41:42.790
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And we tend to be famous
amongst a group of people that are very reasonable,

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:46.920
for the most part. So, like we were going
to the bowling alley the other night and a

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.690
guy just said: "You're Gabe." And I said:
"Yeah." He said: "I like your comic." And

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:52.060
he left. It's like: "Thank you." No flashbulbs.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.599
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah [inaudible]

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:57.330
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: You know what I'm saying?
The kind of thing we have is not what people

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.330
think of as--

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.330
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We are not in Us magazine.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:02.549
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It's just not that weird,
you know. I mean if you go to a restaurant

00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:06.530
and someone says: "Hey, I like Penny Arcade."
And then they leave. You know, that's about

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:07.530
it.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:08.530
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:13.021
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Well, I, PAX is different.
Yeah. But, you know, we sort of are able to

00:42:13.021 --> 00:42:17.710
prepare ourselves for that going in. You know
that for the next three days it's gonna be

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.540
crazy.
But the weirdest thing for me was, I took

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:28.220
my wife to Paris for her 30th birthday and
we got up super early, it was like five o'clock

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.400
one morning to take a bus trip to Normandy.
'Cause we were gonna do the whole, you know,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.809
World War II tour out there. And we're on
the bus going through, you know, farmland,

00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:41.640
it's super early, there's like 10 people on
the bus--, most of them are old guys who look

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.630
like they were probably in World War II and
are taking the tour to sort of, you know relive

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:51.369
it. And then there's a young couple next to
us and we got off in this little tiny town

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:56.000
and we're looking at a World War II monument,
and he just comes over and he goes: "You're

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Gabe, right."

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
[laughter]

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.980
That's like: And it's like: "Yeah. I am"

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:00.980
[laughter]

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.980
He's like: "I like the comic." And then he
left.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.940
[laughter]

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.940
And it's like--, it's surreal.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.540
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: I had a similar experience.
My wife and I went to Italy a super long time

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:16.430
ago, and Brenda had sent me out to get a bottle
of wine for the hotel room. And then she told,

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.549
she gave me a call and said that she was gonna
meet at the front steps or something. So I

00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:25.470
came back and I was waiting there for a super
long time and she didn't come down, but I

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:29.869
had a corkscrew in my Swiss Army Knife and
I was like: "You know, F it ? I'm just going

00:43:29.869 --> 00:43:33.460
to start drinking this bottle of wine." And
so I get the cork out and I'm workin' on it,

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.280
I mean really workin' on this bottle. And
I have the same situation where a person comes

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:41.870
up and asks me if I'm Tyco. And I'm not, this
is not the scenario you want.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:43.299
[laughter]

00:43:43.299 --> 00:43:47.369
Like this is, this is not how you want to
present yourself. I mean this is not a person

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:48.369
that one looks up to.

00:43:48.369 --> 00:43:49.369
[laughter]

00:43:49.369 --> 00:43:52.319
This is not an incredible behavior. So that
was my experience.

00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:55.710
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. It's fun. It's the
best way to say it, I think.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:58.150
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: Did you get the
cork out?

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.150
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Oh, yeah.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.150
[laughter]

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.450
Just long pulls on the, yeah, and then, wax.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:11.650
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: You probably have
a good finger on the pulse of the industry.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:15.770
Where do you think, yeah, what do you think
about the supposed death of-- PC gaming and

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:16.770
sequel of it is--

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:17.770
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Supposed is probably a good
prefix.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.470
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: The, yes, Steve
says otherwise, but the, you know how they

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.160
have to make these big blockbusters and some
of them try to go to franchise, everyone needs

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:30.270
a franchise. Where do you see, do you see
it as being a healthy industry or ?

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:34.350
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: What's our take on the video
game industry?

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:35.350
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: Yeah.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.350
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Jerry?

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:44.380
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Well, one of the big problems
certainly as it ticks forward in terms of

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:50.470
computing power, is that the games are so
expensive to make that it strips out a lot

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:58.790
of that, a lot of that - the appetite for
risk goes down as those amounts start to creep,

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:05.630
and that is true. That is just unfortunately
true. But I would say I haven't seen, I haven't

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:12.720
seen, you know, what I think of as innovation
 - I haven't innovation diluted as a result.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:19.079
There's so many more channels for people to
execute on an independent idea. I mean as

00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:23.369
that computing power grows like, the base
of people who are creating really interesting

00:45:23.369 --> 00:45:27.950
content has grown to. Even in Flash. I mean
there's games, there's games that are based

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:32.820
in Flash. Flash is a game platform that is
creating games with more sophistication than

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.940
I played as a young person.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:43.280
You know what I'm saying, like the paths to
game creation are pretty broad now. Even as

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.990
that, that point gets up. And this is where
we were talking about the AAA retail title.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:53.010
That does not represent the entire industry.
And it doesn't represent every incredible

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.010
idea that comes out.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:59.410
I mean even like DigiPan-- like some kids
from DigiPan came up with some crazy-ass S,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:04.390
and that stuff, and then here comes Valve
and they, they snatched them up. I mean Valve

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.210
has the wherewithal to do that. You know they
have the, they have the money-- they're in

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:14.079
position to do that. But there's channels
like Xbox5 Indy Games and then one step up

00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:19.920
from that Xbox Live Arcade and you have PSN--,
I mean there's a lot of pretty sophisticated

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.700
things coming out that are not a part of the,
you know, the industry at large.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:28.980
There's a lot of great ideas out there that
are still happening, MA Teams. You know what

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.800
I'm saying? And then you have, like Torchlight
 ?

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.570
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah, Torchlight's amazing.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:38.010
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's just a pure, it just
a very, very pure gaming experience. Twenty

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.180
dollars, these guys made it in a year. It's
a, you know it's a local company. I mean,

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:47.910
I just, I don't, it's you know, on the retail
shelf your game spot, yes, it's always been

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:54.940
a haven for mediocrity. That's not a new fact.
But there is, that is absolutely not the entirety

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.920
of the, of our creative outlet.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:04.810
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: So there's gaming
companies that are into [unaudible] you like

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:05.940
something that ?

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.560
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: It's happened a couple of
times. He wants to know if game companies

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:18.890
ever come to us as a very focused, focus group?
And it's happened a couple of times, yes.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:23.660
A lot of times they sort of, they might not
come to us with that intention, but they end

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:29.619
up getting it. Because we won't advertise
anything unless we play it and like it. So,

00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:33.102
you know, if a company comes to us with, I'm
trying to think of the last one, well like

00:47:33.102 --> 00:47:34.102
 ?

00:47:34.102 --> 00:47:35.102
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Like White Knight Chronicles?

00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:38.539
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah. Like White Knight Chronicles
they say: "Well, do you want to advertise

00:47:38.539 --> 00:47:42.000
it?" And we say: "We have to play it first."
And so, you know, they send us the game and

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.100
we play it and we're like: "Yeah, that's pretty
good. Yeah, we'll advertise that." But sometimes

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.480
it doesn't go that way and so we say: "No.
It's not very good. We're not gonna advertise

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.020
it." So they may not come to us wanting an
opinion, they just want ads on our site, but

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.220
we tend to give it regardless

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.180
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And its, it's a complicated
situation for us because there are people

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.881
at Penny Arcade whose job it is to try to
populate the site with advertising. You know

00:48:01.881 --> 00:48:05.990
what I'm saying? And they're paid directly
by the amount of advertising, you know what

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.059
I'm saying, like that's their job.

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:10.360
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: You sort of see them watching
us play it through the window like just praying

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360
to God that we'll like it.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.940
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: It's got to be so scary for
them because we'll just say: "No." And we're

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:17.829
basically saying: "No, you can't have any
money. No money. We're taking your money away

00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:18.829
now.

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:21.049
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: "I know you wanted that money.
You can't have it."

00:48:21.049 --> 00:48:22.049
[laughter]

00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:26.710
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: You are in the
[inaudible]

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.360
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: DRM and games-- necessary
evil or ridiculous waste of time? That was

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.710
the question.

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:37.569
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: This just, it's never-- it
just never lasts very long. You know they

00:48:37.569 --> 00:48:41.329
put the DRM on there and they have, you know,
they have some kind of internal study, some

00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:45.780
kind of internal numbers that say that the
first two weeks of a game are it's prime earning

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.950
years-- or, you know what I'm saying like
they have an idea, they have some study and

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:53.559
I don't know when the study is from, that
tells them that they have to apply that stuff.

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:59.220
But it never, but I mean zero day is still
with us. Negative one day, it's, you know,

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:04.119
a month in advance sometimes for games that
are waiting for their console versions to,

00:49:04.119 --> 00:49:05.150
you know, to appear.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:10.680
People are modifying their Xbox hard drives
as new firmware and they're just downloading,

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.630
you know what I'm saying, like you can't really
fight it, but at the same time like, I think

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:18.069
they just want to feel like they are doing
something. Like it's somebody's job there

00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:24.299
to do something and unfortunately there are
very few options for them to appear pro-active.

00:49:24.299 --> 00:49:30.609
Except for to inconvenience me. That's more
or less the policy, I think.

00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:31.609
[pause]

00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:34.460
Is that the correct answer? I hope so. I hate
DRM.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.460
[laughter]

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.650
&gt;&gt;Woman's voice in audience: Could you repeat
the last question?

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:41.840
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Uh oh, no pressure. Here,
we'll talk to you later.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.840
We'll talk in the cafe?.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.840
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: Okay, so speaking
of advertising you guys used to have like

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:51.450
a really [inaudible] policy as, just in terms
of like, you know ?

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:54.520
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: We used to have two ads a
month. I mean ?

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.200
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: But like it was
like a big blaring flash job [inaudible]

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.160
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Oh yeah, we for a while we
did no animation.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.160
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Oh, that's still true.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.160
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.460
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: So what are they
now. 'Cause I noticed you do have Flash animated

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.460
ads [inaudible]

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:05.460
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.460
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: Not like obnoxious
[inaudible]

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.460
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: They can't have audio.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.460
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: Okay.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.170
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: So a long time ago, I mean
because, we, we tried to keep the people who

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:14.170
read the site in the loop on that kind of
stuff. And what happens is that an ad gets

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:22.140
made for, you know, the entire Internet. And
so then eventually we had to create the ad

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.609
sizes to be Internet standard, because they
weren't originally. So eventually we had to

00:50:26.609 --> 00:50:32.569
standardize on that just to get ads at all.
And then so many of them were moving to Flash,

00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:36.910
that we asked, we asked the readership-- we
actually just put up a poll and said: "Is

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.410
this okay? Is this okay for us to do." And
luckily they said: "Yes."

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.299
[laughter]

00:50:42.299 --> 00:50:45.490
But no we wanted to keep them in the loop--
I mean, there's still like, like the video

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:47.530
type stuff and I hate it when--

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:48.530
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.819
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah. No way, but I hated
when you mouse over something, then it flips

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:56.510
out and does this crazy-ass. Like I don't,
I mean--

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:59.890
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: A lot of times if the ad
guys have a question, they just send us the

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.369
ad and they're like: "This one's questionable."
Like--

00:51:02.369 --> 00:51:03.369
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Yeah.

00:51:03.369 --> 00:51:05.021
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: And if it's cool then we
don't mind, you know.

00:51:05.021 --> 00:51:07.530
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: But also we don't offer site
branding which is to say --

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.530
&gt;&gt;Man's voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.059
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: The McGriddle effect, right?
Like you can't -

00:51:10.059 --> 00:51:12.410
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Penny Arcade brought to you
by Mass Effect 2.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.180
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Which would be great, cause
I love that game, but that isn't something

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.180
we offer.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.180
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Yeah.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.690
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: And so, but like the space
on the left and right of this, of the actual

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:25.250
content, like on many sites that is an ad
space, you know what I'm saying? But that

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:29.520
is actually not a product that you can purchase.
We don't allow that. Like we want it to be

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.809
legible first and foremost.

00:51:31.809 --> 00:51:32.809
[pause]

00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:35.039
&gt;&gt;Mike Krahulik: Thank you guys very much.

00:51:35.039 --> 00:51:39.060
&gt;&gt;Jerry Holkins: Thank you.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.839
[applause]
