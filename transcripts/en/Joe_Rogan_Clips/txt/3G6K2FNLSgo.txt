Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Well there are a lot of people that are growing marijuana that are using pesticides and chemicals that are, that are dangerous. And there was one, what was the company that got caught recently? Jimmy? They tested their stuff cause she put I believe, yeah. So that again, cause she punched it with the microphone and fucked up it cushy punch. Um, we had a guy named John Norris on the podcast and he wrote a book called hidden war and he started off his career as a game warden. You know, I'm investigating people that caught too much fish, things along those lines and he thought, Hey, what a great job this would be. I'm going to get in, get a job in the great outdoors. I love the outdoors and you know, I'll get to do some good for the wildlife. Well, turns out along the way they started stumbling upon these public land Mexican cartel grow operations where they would grow these marijuana plants, just giant plots of them. And they would use these extremely toxic pesticides. And also they would use poison to keep animals out. And they had vats of this shit laying around and some of the marijuana was actually infested with this shit.

Speaker 2:          01:13          Yeah. Yeah. My friend, uh, Amanda Chicago Lewis is this great journalists, folks focused on marijuana and yeah, she put the fear of God in me about those pesticides and carcinogens. And um, the other thing is just like these, you know, these different oils that people are smoking. Some of them are marketed as like all natural, but they find synthetic cannabinoids in them. And basically, you know, synthetic cannabinoids like K two and spice are what they're known as sometimes. And those are the people call it synthetic marijuana. But the big difference is that, um, THC is known as like a partial agonist. So it will like these receptors, they will, it will activate them to an extent. You're chill, it's relaxed. But the cannabinoids, they also interact with the cannabinoid receptors same as THC, but they're full agonists. And so they make you basically like go crazy and your heart starts beating fast.

Speaker 2:          02:17          You start, um, people overdose and die on these, these cannabinoids. And um, they, these are all made in China too. I went into a lab in China where they made these and they made fentanyl analogs. They let you in? Yeah, I mean it was, it was a whole thing. I like wrote them on the internet. I made a fake email address and I said, um, I'm a drug dealer, I'd like to visit your lab. May I do that when I come to China? And they said, yeah, yeah, that's like, do you have a fake drug dealer name? Um, I called myself, what did I call myself? Uh, I tried, I had this like Skype avatar picture where I looked like a bro, like a 23 year old dude with like big hair, like kind of a stoner look. And uh, they just, um, they said, yeah, come by.

Speaker 2:          03:04          And so, so I went to Shanghai and uh, I met this guy at the train station and he owned his own lab and he asked me if I was a journalist actually like pretty straight away. He was like, are you a journalist though? And I was like, nah, like no, crazy question. Do I look like journalists now? And so he didn't, he didn't know whether to trust me. So we went to his apartment. It was like the top floor of this fancy high rise. He's a total family man. He had like lived there with his wife and kid brings a stranger to his home. Yep, yep. Meets a guy who says this is a drug dealer, picks him up at the train station, says Hey come to where my kids sleep. Yeah, exactly. Wow. And so then he showed me, cause he had there the website, a lot of these companies in China, they make legitimate chemicals and recreational chemicals and they specialize in drugs that are legal in China but banned in the West.

Speaker 2:          04:01          So band in the U S so all is illegal in China. Well, in the U S we have this thing called the federal analog act. And so that bands, all these drugs even before they're invented. So anything that's similar to marijuana structurally or in fact anything that's similar to opioids is just automatically banned, automatically scheduled. But in China they have to do it one by one, by one by one. And so fentanyl itself was scheduled in China was banned in China decades ago. But these chemists spent like this when I met, specialize in this window when something is banned in the U S but it's still legal in China, but it's become popularized on the internet. So there's all these websites, these web forums where these like drug nerds basically are like, you can't get fentanyl but you can get this thing that's kind of like fentanyl and that's hilarious. Drug nerds.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Yeah, yeah. That's what they are. And like psycho naughts, I'm sure you've heard of Psychonauts, right? They specialize in these new, uh, usually psychedelics. They tend to prefer that have never been tested on human subjects. But this guy was entirely specialized in, um, fentanyl analogs and synthetic cannabinoids. And so he took out, you know, he had his like fake list on his website of all the legitimate, you know, like Cialis and you know, legitimate pharmaceuticals, things like that. But as a, at his apartment, he showed me the real list and that had all these, you know, it was a cannabinoids, fentanyl. It was like fake Vallian, like different types of Xanax. And he showed me the prices and I was like, all right, I'm looks good. Can I, can I go see your lab? And so finally he decided, he trusted me. He called up his driver on the phone and um, the driver showed up and he was kind of this big like muscular dude who didn't speak any English.

Speaker 2:          05:59          And I was a little worried. I was like, Oh, this is the dude who's going to break my kneecaps if when he finds out I'm a journalist, you know, but I just got in the car and we drove like 30 minutes to the outskirts of Shanghai and we got to the lab and it just looked like a regular office park, like a suburban office park. There was a fountain in front of the building. There was like, you know, you use the key card to get in the parking lot. And then it looked like kind of a new construction building. It smelled like cement. We went inside, um, we went up to, to the labs, all the windows were open. It was the middle of the winter and it was kind of a strong chemical smell. Um, but it looked kind of just like breaking bad, like, you know, like industrial sized glass where, um, you know, beakers Bunsen burners, all that stuff from high school chemistry.

Speaker 2:          06:52          And, um, he would point, he points up like basically I had my recorder, you know, on my phone and I had it, um, in my jacket pocket just on record. And so he told me I couldn't take pictures and so to take notes I would just say stuff aloud. I'd be like, Oh, that's um, uh, oranges, a light orange mixture that's being mixed up by a mechanical arm. And you say it's benzo fentanyl. A very interesting. And so, but, but the language barrier was such that he, you know, didn't think I was being too much of a weirdo that, uh, I clearly was, but so, but the cannabinoids would w were crazy. There was like a table like this, like almost exactly this size that was piled up with the cannabinoids that were there for drying and it was uh, they were mounds like this high just sitting right out in the open Zillow like pot?

Speaker 2:          07:50          No, because it's not a plant, you know, it's just basically it's a chemical that's sprayed onto plant matter, like dried Sage and stuff like that. So they try to make it look like pot and you know, you can smoke that stuff out of a pipe or even rolled into a joint. But if you look closely though, it's very clearly not pot. Wow. And so they're drying this stuff. That's what I think that, you know, they also had like, um, drying machines they looked like a mad at or didn't like it when I use this term. But you know, when you go into subway and there's the bread baking machines right there, it looked exactly like that. Why did he not like that term? I don't know. I think he thought subway would Sue us or something, but, um, that they had those and then they had like big buckets of one pound bags of these, these cannabinoids and these fentanyl analogs just ready for shipping.

Speaker 2:          08:44          He said they were sending them to Russia, to Belgium, to the Netherlands. And then I think a lot of times it's repackaged there. And so I don't know if you knew that the cannabinoids used to be sold legally and head shops like 10 years ago. Yeah, yeah. And they would always be in these colorful packets. They almost looked like a pop rocks package. They say like spice spice and laugh out loud and stuff. And so I think in Europe that's where they do that. They put it in this colorful packaging. They, um, and then they ship it to the U S and um, but yeah, he was saying that like, he kept like really close track of the law and all these countries, especially China, like they're scheduling this next week. So we're going to take all this and throw it away. And I thought at first he was like probably just putting me out.

Speaker 2:          09:36          But I think they actually do that. Like these guys are businessmen first. They want to make money and going to follow the law. It just doesn't, you know, it's not conducive. This is where bath salts came from. Right? Exactly. Yeah. Bath salts tend to be Kathy unknowns. So synthetic Catherine was there, have you ever heard of the cat plant? K? H? T? T? Yeah. So the, the hijackers pirates in Somalia, they, they take that. Yeah, it's really popular in the middle East. It's like, it's a stimulant. It gets you really w um, have you tried it? No, I never have. Yeah. But I, uh, grew up in Minnesota though, and there's a big Somali population and so a lot of, there was a big controversy in Minnesota, whether or not to ban cat leaves from being sold in regular stores. Is it legal? I think it is.

Speaker 2:          10:25          Um, I think it's not legal in the U S now if I'm not, but I don't know for sure. Interesting. But so H a T. S yeah, exactly. And so the synthetic cathinones are the synthetic version of that, like made in the lab, but they're there, you know, there's tons of different kinds. You don't know how strong it is. And the bath salts, um, they of course it has nothing to do with like salts for your bath. You know, this was a misnomer and they also wrote called them like incense, sometimes plant food. And on the back of all of them it would say not intended for human consumption. So that was like the way they got around. They thought they could get around the federal analogue act because part of the law says that something is automatically illegal if it's intended for human consumption. So these guys were like not intended for human consumption. Just put it in your bath. Yeah. You bet. It smells like fucking toxic chemicals. Yeah. Do you remember when the homeless guy ate someone's face? I remember that. And they said he was on beta. Yeah. But that was actually disproven. There was none found in his system. Cannibal Causeway. Cannibal. I think that, yeah. And he was just crazy. Right. I think he may have like smoked some weed, but yeah, I don't think he had any thing else in his system. It was just high on life. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:45          Oh man. Florida original Florida man. Yeah, it is. It's funny that one state is so synonymous with fuckery. Yeah. And they also had this thing called Flocka. Have you ever heard of that? Yes, I have, but I don't remember what it is. It's more Catherine. And like if you look it up on YouTube, there's all these people going crazy that killed like, I think maybe a hundred people in Florida during a time. And um, the problem is, you know, like the prohibition on drugs causes people to do really stupid things, right? So you have this cath known like Flocka. And as bad as that was, once they banned flock, uh, the chemist started manipulating the chemical structure. So they change one little thing. They add like a chlorine group for example. So like a, a chlorine like molecule, you know, it has nothing to do with the drug, but they just added on there to make it so it becomes legal.

Speaker 2:          12:43          But then it becomes more difficult for your body to like digest it so it becomes worse for you and the high becomes worse. And then they ban that and then they make something new that's even worse for you. And it's just like down the line and, um, and these Chinese. So, so that's what all these new drugs have in common. My, my book is about, uh, they're called NPS novel psychoactive substances. So fentanyl is the most famous and the most dangerous, but these include basically like synthetic new versions of every drug. So there's, you know, marijuana, the new, the NPS version is the synthetic cannabinoids. Heroin, NPS, Virgin is fentanyl. There's LSD. So you take LSD, it's like a wonder drug, right? No one has ever died of an LSD overdose. You know, people may have, um, thought they were a bird or whatever and jumped off a roof, but no one has ever overdosed on the drug itself.

Speaker 2:          13:39          But, but once they started banning, once they started really cracking down on LSD, these Chinese chemists started manufacturing this new type of psychedelic that was sold as acid. And so if you went on the dark web, this was like in the, like 10 years ago or so, 10, five, 10 years ago, you would search for acid and it, you would think you were buying LSD, but you're buying this new psychedelic that could kill you and did kill you. These drugs are called N bombs. It's like the worst name of all time. Um, these, these N bomb drugs. And they started killing people in like the suburbs in Dallas fell. Um, and, and yeah, you really were a music editor. Yeah. So, so these kids all, um, thought they just wanted, they, they did their research. These were like smart kids who said, Oh, Alice D has never killed anyone. Let's get that, this new thing. And it killed them. And so it wasn't really LSD, it was just, it totally, no note. Nothing in common at all. Yeah.
