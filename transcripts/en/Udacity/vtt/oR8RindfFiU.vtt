00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.035
Now next I'd like you to implement the drive method where the car goes to the

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:09.312
next location, one more than the current location. And then when it gets there

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:14.625
it should drop off any passengers whose destination in that new location. Now

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.116
when dropping off, that just means remove them from the list of passengers. So

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:22.557
go ahead and implement that.
