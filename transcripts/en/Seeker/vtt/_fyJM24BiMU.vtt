00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.900
People LOVE conspiracy theories, but even
when they're presented with the truth, they're

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.130
still... dumb about it.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.840
[[MUSIC PLAYING]]

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.770
Hey everyone, Trace here reporting for DNews.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.530
I'm going to start here and say, right now.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.790
Science doesn't know what CAUSES autism; there's
a lot of misinformation out there, but it's

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.320
really that...

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.390
MISinformation.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.860
We're talking about this because half of Americans.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.860
HALF.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.090
Believe in at least one medical conspiracy
theory, according to a recent survey published

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.820
in JAMA Internal Medicine.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.550
In general, Americans are a pretty easy bunch
to fool, apparently.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.980
We're susceptible to a lot of conspiracy nonsense.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.630
We didn't land on the moon, bigfoot exists,
Elvis is alive, Roswell saw aliens, cell phones

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.380
cause cancer, and the FDA and Big Pharma are
colluding to keep people sick.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.239
Regardless, they've all been debunked at one
point or another.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.000
We believe these crappy theories thanks to
the power of evolution.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.180
Thousands of years ago when we were living
in the cradle of humanity, we needed to assume

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.780
there was a malevolent predator rustling in
the bushes so we'd be ready to flee for our

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.780
lives.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.020
Still today, when we're afraid and ill-informed,
it's human instinct to assume someone is in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.899
the bushes, and their intent is bad.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.119
In the end, even education fails to help.

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.209
People prefer the complex narrative they've
invented over the reality.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.850
Really though, if you teach your kid we didn't
land on the moon, she'll eventually learn

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.850
the truth.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.509
It's not going to hurt anyone, just make some
people angry.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.490
Buzz Aldrin decked a guy who accused him of
lying.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.849
But, if you refuse to vaccinate people, out
of a misguided attempt to prevent them acquiring

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.170
autism -- that's a lifelong problem for YOUR
child AND others.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.670
Also, if it hasn't showed up by the time you're
older, you're not going to CATCH autism.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.939
So, get your adult vaccines.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.369
A study in the journal of Pediatrics looked
at the total number of vaccines children are

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.979
given in the first year of life and found
the CDC's schedule of vaccinations to be completely

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.709
unrelated to autism.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.399
Since this study was conducted, vaccines have
improved.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.579
They're less invasive, and more targeted.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.100
The U.K. Department of Health, the CDC, and
the Institute of Medicine have all studied

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.289
this too, thanks to Mrs. Jenny McCarthy's
uneducated belief in medical science's conspiracy.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.950
No one has found a statistically significant
link in a repeatable, peer-reviewed paper.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.120
Saying what CAUSES autism is problematic.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.010
The journal Cell published evidence a brain
circuit gene called SynGAP1 might be part

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.810
of the cause, another study found flu in the
mother night influence the genes too, but

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.720
scientists are still working on it.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.440
Though the number of children with autism
is increasing today, the first patient called

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.884
"Case 1" was discovered in 1943 -- and we've
been inoculating humans against disease since

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:44.310
the 1790s!

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.450
The science and advocacy organization, Autism
Speaks, has EVERY REASON to find the cause

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.370
of this neurodevelopmental disorder, so they
can repair it.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.450
They say it's GENES which set the stage, and
possibly ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS to control

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.530
when it manifests and how.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.530
They know the diet of a pregnant mother can
lower the risk, there's a connection to folic

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.431
acid... but their scientifically-focused medical
advice is extremely clear on this point: There

00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:06.650
is no evidence that vaccines cause autism,
none.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.880
The consequences of NOT vaccinating populations
of young people WILL BE the resurgence of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.070
diseases beaten back by generations of Americans.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.320
Hopefully, we realize that thing rustling
the bushes isn't a vaccine, but the only thing

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320
we should fear; fear itself.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320
What's your belief?

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.320
Why do you think vaccines are demonized?

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.320
Tell us below.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.320
Come for the facts stay for the debate.
