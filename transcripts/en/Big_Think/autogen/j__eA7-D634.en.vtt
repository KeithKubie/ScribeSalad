I don't know what to tell people I mean
 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.959
I don't know what to tell people I mean

part in graduate school was that the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939
part in graduate school was that the
 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.760
part in graduate school was that the
most talented writers were not the ones

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770
most talented writers were not the ones
 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.160
most talented writers were not the ones
who became writers it was the dog at

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170
who became writers it was the dog at
 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.520
who became writers it was the dog at
once and that that's actually talent to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530
once and that that's actually talent to
 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.199
once and that that's actually talent to
I guess is just being willing to go

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209
I guess is just being willing to go
 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:53.279
I guess is just being willing to go
every day

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289
every day
 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.730
every day

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.039
and stay there until the pages appear
every day and not I tell this to my

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049
every day and not I tell this to my
 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.660
every day and not I tell this to my
students to I'm like I know you can

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670
students to I'm like I know you can
 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.729
students to I'm like I know you can
write a short story overnight but that's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739
write a short story overnight but that's
 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.609
write a short story overnight but that's
not the job that's not a long-term skill

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619
not the job that's not a long-term skill
 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.410
not the job that's not a long-term skill
you need to write a short story over a

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420
you need to write a short story over a
 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:17.300
you need to write a short story over a
month every month and I think that's it

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.370
for everyone you know it was I was

for everyone you know it was I was
 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.830
for everyone you know it was I was
coming from New York I couldn't afford

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840
coming from New York I couldn't afford
 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.509
coming from New York I couldn't afford
anything I was having a hard time

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519
anything I was having a hard time
 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.199
anything I was having a hard time
figuring how to be a writer here and

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
figuring how to be a writer here and
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.199
figuring how to be a writer here and
going to Montana was a very attractive

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209
going to Montana was a very attractive
 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.160
going to Montana was a very attractive
completely different plan and it worked

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170
completely different plan and it worked
 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.539
completely different plan and it worked
out great for me but I'm not sure it

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549
out great for me but I'm not sure it
 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.610
out great for me but I'm not sure it
helped my writing you know because you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
helped my writing you know because you
 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.199
helped my writing you know because you
have a committee of people who are all

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209
have a committee of people who are all
 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.349
have a committee of people who are all
so long young like you and don't really

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359
so long young like you and don't really
 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.740
so long young like you and don't really
know how to do it well either so it's a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
know how to do it well either so it's a
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.449
know how to do it well either so it's a
funny committee to be as submitting your

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459
funny committee to be as submitting your
 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.819
funny committee to be as submitting your
work to and you have to really know be

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829
work to and you have to really know be
 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.259
work to and you have to really know be
confident in what you're doing

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269
confident in what you're doing
 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.940
confident in what you're doing
because I wasn't writing like anyone

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
because I wasn't writing like anyone
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.289
because I wasn't writing like anyone
else there and that was hard for me to

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299
else there and that was hard for me to
 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.020
else there and that was hard for me to
figure out and I think it would be and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030
figure out and I think it would be and
 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.440
figure out and I think it would be and
it's destructive to a novel for sure

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
it's destructive to a novel for sure
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.509
it's destructive to a novel for sure
because you meet every week with part of

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519
because you meet every week with part of
 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.819
because you meet every week with part of
a novel that really what you should tell

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829
a novel that really what you should tell
 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.460
a novel that really what you should tell
you a novelist is keep going until you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470
you a novelist is keep going until you
 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.990
you a novelist is keep going until you
finish the draft don't anyone

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
finish the draft don't anyone

Oh in Montana yeah it was it was great

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250
Oh in Montana yeah it was it was great
 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.210

but then also it was pretty cold dark
 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.830
but then also it was pretty cold dark
winters I guess that helps novel-writing

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840
winters I guess that helps novel-writing
 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.920
winters I guess that helps novel-writing
too historically but it also helps

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930
too historically but it also helps
 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.650
too historically but it also helps
drinking you know at those times but

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660
drinking you know at those times but
 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.110
drinking you know at those times but
maybe that helps a novel too but I love

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120
maybe that helps a novel too but I love
 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.580
maybe that helps a novel too but I love

like work it just feels like it feels
 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.420
like work it just feels like it feels
like when you start out writing and you

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430
like when you start out writing and you
 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.890
