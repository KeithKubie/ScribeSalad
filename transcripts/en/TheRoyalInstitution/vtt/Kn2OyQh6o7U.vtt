00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.030
You may have seen this demonstration before.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.220
If you spray a solution of sodium salts with
ethanol through a flame

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.790
you get a characteristic orangey-yellow colour.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.749
This is because when we heat up sodium

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.350
it emits a very specific wavelength of light

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.800
that our eyes see as orangey-yellow.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.539
But look what happens when we do the same
experiment

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.390
in the light of a sodium streetlamp.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.890
It looks really amazing even to the naked
eye.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.789
The edge of the flame really looks like it
is actually black.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.180
That's mad! What are you doing?

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.140
This is witchcraft, this isn't science!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.260
I feel like I'm watching a special effect.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.260
So how does this work?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.399
Let's have a look at the flame in ordinary
light.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.980
Here we have a solution of ethanol with some
sodium salts.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.250
As you can see it's glowing the characteristic
orangey-yellow colour.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.410
The usual explanation for this is when you
heat up the sodium

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.510
the electrons in the orbitals around the nucleus
get excited

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.940
and they jump up to higher energy levels.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.550
As they drop back down, they release their
energy as a photon of light.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.750
Quantum theory tells us that electrons and
atoms can only exist

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.520
at very specific discrete energy levels.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.620
So this photon can only have certain energies.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.710
As a photon's energy determines its wavelength

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.470
if that wavelength is in the visible spectrum,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.220
our eyes will pick it up as a specific colour.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.950
Sodium atoms have two very strong electron
transitions at 589 and 589.6 nm.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.390
Which our eyes see as a deep yellowy colour.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.890
To all intents and purposes these two wavelengths
are so close together

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.890
that they're indistinguishable.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.270
So you can think of this yellow light as monochromatic

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.520
and made up of just one colour.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.710
So how do we see the black flame effect?

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.930
First we need our yellow light.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.960
This is a sodium street light or a low pressure
sodium lamp.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.340
I actually bought this one off ebay, it originally
came from an army depot.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.340
If you send electric discharge through this
inner tube which is filled with gas,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.909
it glows to create the monochromatic yellow
light that we've been talking about.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.719
When streetlights first come on in the evening

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.930
you might notice that they're this pink colour.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.519
That's because there's neon and a little bit
of argon gas inside the tube

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.129
which when we send electricity along it, it
gets excited and glows pinkish red.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.370
That's actually only there to heat up and
vaporise the sodium

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.900
that you can see in little dots along the
tube.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.819
When the sodium vaporises, those atoms get
excited

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.799
and give out the lovely monochromatic yellow
colour you can see here.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.620
We don't just get this yellow light out of
sodium lamps.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.829
These pickles are soaked in brine or salt
water so they are jam-packed with sodium.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.920
When we put a huge voltage across them they
heat up, the sodium gets excited

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.219
and they give off that lovely yellow light.

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:02.939
But I digress, let's get back to the black
flames.

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.400
The reason for this effect is because in the
same way

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.030
that sodium atoms tend to emit light of a
certain wavelength, around 589 nm,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.189
they also tend to absorb light of that specific
wavelength.

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.640
And this makes the flame look dark.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.590
It's strange to think of a flame as dark

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.650
because as we know flames give out light.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.230
But the sodium is absorbing the light from
the lamp.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:36.560
That light isn't reaching the camera and so
the flame looks dark.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.939
Thanks for watching.
