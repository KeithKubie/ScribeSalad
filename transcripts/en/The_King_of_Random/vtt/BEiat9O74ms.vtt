00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.020
It actually, it looks like a little flower vase. Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back, in this video today...

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.620
we are going to be turning sand into glass. I jumped down into the comments, and I found this one from JC112...

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.140
who has been begging us to please make glass from sand.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.820
Today we're trying to make it happen for you. Now to make this happen today...

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.879
I had to bring my friend Cody from Cody's lab. You know him. Alright everyone.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.430
We've also got Andy from a channel called How to Make...

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.179
Everything you might know him as the guy who took six months to make a chicken sandwich.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.430
He did everything from scratch, including growing the grain and spawning the chicken. On my channel I explore...

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.189
what if you couldn't go to a store and buy stuff need to make it from natural sources?

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.059
Sweet so I'm looking at this. It's kind of like I don't know what you call that like Power Rangers? *laughter*

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.599
We got like all the forces joining together here to see we accomplished one great...

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.820
task. Because it's not very easy to turn...

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.570
sand into glass. Is it? Especially not clear glass. This will actually be my fourth attempt at it. I've tried various things...

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.329
use a different flux of potash made from hardwood ashes. This is my first attempt with soda ash and...

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.709
hopefully we'll have some better results. So for this video we're going to put everything to the test...

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.599
we're going to use raw materials that Andy sourced himself. We're going to use the materials that Cody refined.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.549
We're going to put them all together and see if today we can actually make clear glass with our backyard trash can...

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.839
foundry. Let's dive right in. Alright, so I have ingredients from four different states actually I have sand I collected in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.299
Then in Wyoming I collected sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate from a lake of there. Arizona...

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.938
I collected gypsum from an old mine. In Utah Cody helped me find some calcite. So my role...

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.809
here is basically the chemistry guy. I helped Andy purify his sodium carbonate I also...

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.250
helped him purify the sand a little bit and also sourced the...

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.809
nitric acid which we will convert into a calcium nitrate by reacting with...

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.600
some more calcite. Oh and if we don't have enough we might cheat a little bit. *laughter*

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.959
So the time has come guys we're going to take all of these ingredients...

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.479
and we're going to mix them all together and here's how we're going to do it.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.148
We're going to take this sand that's already had most of the iron washed out...

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.960
we're going to mix it up with some of this sodium...

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.710
carbonate and add a little bit of calcium nitrate and a bit of gypsum.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.520
We're gonna crush it all into a very fine powder.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.000
Mix the mixture together, throw it down in the crucible, and let the whole thing nuke for about 6 to 12 hours in  our trash...

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.470
can foundry. This is the kind of glass that nature makes this is obsidian that comes out of a volcano...

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.289
and you can see it's not very transparent at all. Clear glass is a very cool thing and we're going to replicate it here today.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.019
So I guess I'm mixing the other materials.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.319
Here's the sand, I think we're just going to mix these together.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.500
Kind of guess at the ratios. I'm going to try to shoot for about 30 percent by weight...

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.120
sodium carbonate.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.120
Which I'll crush into a fine powder here.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Hulk Smash! Hulk Smash!

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Who needs a mortar and a pestle?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.429
It's actually crushing it pretty well. I mean my knuckles are starting to hurt and bleed a little bit but...

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.269
I think it's worth it. *laughter*

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.059
*laughing in excitement* This is the industrial revolution baby,  two fists twice as fast energy!!

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.049
Alright, so I mixed together the ingredients now.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.869
Since the sand is still a little wet its weight is going to be off. So there's really no sense weighing it.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.920
I'm just going to kind of mix together an equal volume of sand and sodium carbonate here. Like a one-to-one ratio? Well...

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.280
This is a lot less dense than this and we only need about twenty to thirty percent sodium carbonate, so...

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.010
I might have to use all of this.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.429
The more of this we use the lower the melting point will be and the easier...

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.739
it will be to melt. See this is the kind of cooking I enjoy... when we're cooking with recipes from Cody's Lab.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.429
All right, so a little bit of gypsum... this will release some gases towards the end which will actually...

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.930
counterintuitively help...

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.049
the other gases come out. So just to clarify... this is that crushed up Crystal that we had from earlier?

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.569
Exactly. So a solid form, powdered form.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.179
It's an amazing difference. Yeah. This is the final ingredient just a little bit of calcium nitrate.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.200
This is a...

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.799
oxidizer that will help burn out impurities and hopefully it'll turn the sand from kind of a beige color...

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.439
into pure white and then it'll melt to clear. Let's just sprinkle a bit of that.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.380
Doesn't really matter if I add too much, cause it'll burn off.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.920
Let's mix it up.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.220
Oh! Actually, there's one more ingredient we're missing... that's the lime.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.360
So here's the lime.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.990
This is actually hydrated lime, or calcium hydroxide this is what happens when you add the calcium oxide to water and this will be our...

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.280
lime part of the soda lime glass.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.220
Now we're probably not going to add very much because it will raise the melting point, so it will increase the...

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600
chemical resistance of the glass.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.730
Making it insoluble in water

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.200
So yeah, we just add a few percent in there.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.940
It won't be the best...

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.780
drinking cup glass, but it'll probably work for...

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.280
It'll look yeah, pretty good for a window or whatever.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.960
Alright there it is.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.270
Still a little wet, but I think that'll work.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.160
We've got our powder crushed up ready to go, our crucible is still pretty hot from we fired it earlier...

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.820
it's ready to go. So let's mix it all together fire up the foundry and get ready to rock. Yeah!

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.142
That sand looks a lot more white now, that

00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:13.500
you mix everything into it. Yeah.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.920
*soft, cheerful music*

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.480
So now Andy since this is your fourth attempt. Why don't you tell us what you think is going to happen here today?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.999
I'm still pretty skeptical it has kind of turned into our 'White Whale' of actually making clear glass.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.080
I think we can get pretty close.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.899
I'm pretty confident Cody's ability to actually refine stuff.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.670
But I'm expecting that it's not gonna be perfect probably a little few bubbles.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.409
But I think we're going to get pretty close. That's of course assuming that the metal foundry is going to get hot enough to actually do its job.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.030
So we're going to put it to the test.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.700
We're going to throw everything in, fire this thing up put the cap on and...

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.420
basically just let it marinate on high heat for about 6 to 12 hours.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.890
Alright. Put that in there. Just as a little bit of insurance...

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.140
I'm going to have a second batch of glass going, a slightly different composition. You got another furnace over here.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.349
And if this doesn't work out well, we'll have something else that...

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.710
I think is a little bit more likely to turn out those nice clear glass. Oh, so it's the competition of the equipment?

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.710
*laughter*

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.920
So, for the second batch I've got some sand which is probably a little bit more pure...

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.249
and I'm going to mix this with, instead of using a soda lime...

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:24.369
I'm going to use soda lid, so this is a mixture here of lead oxide so PbO and...

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.469
sodium carbonate. This is actually very heavy because this is over half a lid right here.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.580
So I'm just going to mix this in with the sand.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.720
And this theoretically should make crystal glass

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.100
This should melt at a lower temperature, so I think we might have a little bit better luck with it.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.920
Here we go. Let's go put this in the other furnace. Got the crucible here...

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.740
heating inside the furnace.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.290
Just going to pull this out and add our material

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:02.780
Which hopefully will flux down make something that resembles clear glass. I just have this kind of going alongside.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100
When it gets

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.100
up to 2,000 degrees.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.480
It should melt.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.700
All right.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.460
All right now. We wait. Hopefully we get something good.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.540
Alright guys, it is the moment of truth our foundry has been running for six and a half hours.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.869
So this has been completely molten. We stopped it a couple times...

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.999
released the lid and tap the crucible a few times to let the bubbles rise the top theoretically.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.869
We're not really sure how clear the glass is yet. But we've got some tools...

00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:02.880
we're going to use to pull it out and see if we can blow it mold it and perhaps...

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.160
make a small improvised window. Let's see what we got.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.160
WOOAAAH!!

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.160
My goodness that is hot, hot stuff.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.920
Oh that's cool. Just like that? It's drippy, drippy wet

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.080
Oh wow, is that metal?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.520
Cody: Yeah it is.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.520
Oh, that's cool. Is it going to stick to the steel? No?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.520
Cody: I dunno.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.250
Alright, so we made the transfer. We got the glass in a little bin. Let's talk about what just happened there.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.510
We got two pieces of glass in our container right now. One is from the trash can foundry...

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.420
we had a little bit of trouble with it because when I was putting into the heat it touched the side of the crucible...

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.900
It got sticky and then working it around it actually got little bits of K-Wool stuck to it.

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:10.580
So it wasn't perfectly clear and we tried mashing it down, it was very very hard and started cracking, all kinds of problems.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.889
But we think we saved it.  Ran it through a few more batches and put it into a container where it can cool down without...

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.820
cracking. Also got the other bit of glass with the leaded glass.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.510
I ended up pouring that out onto the plate along with a bunch of lead because it had reacted with the crucible and flung metallic...

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.429
lead. We just poured that out on a steel plate, mashed it down and then transfer it over to the container as well.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.669
So only time will tell now. We're going to give it about a half an hour to cool down...

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.909
and then take a look at what we got. So while the glass is cooling...

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.620
we're sticking it into a bucket full of vermiculite. Which is going to help that cool down it a little bit slower rate...

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.060
it's going to help the heat stay as long as possible to prevent the glass from cracking. Now...

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.020
ideally you'd want to actually anneal...

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.809
this glass so that it doesn't crack in the future. If you use this as a window pane it would eventually crack...

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.609
due to the weather the temperature things of nature. So it would need to be annealed however for this video...

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.979
we just want to show proof of concept and I think we did it.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.110
Check it out guys. We have successfully turned sand into glass.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.070
We are most of the way there.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.719
We've got like a little bit of a greenish tinge to these which means there's still a bit of iron in there.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.750
But for the most part this stuff is looking pretty good, and it definitely is glass. Look at this piece of cody has here...

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:26.570
it's acting a lot like a lens. This is cody's bachelet it was the leaded glass. It's got a really cool blue tinge to it...

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.999
it's very interesting. There are some bubbles in there...

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.029
but it is clear, it's relatively clear. So maybe if we cook that longer we could have got it even more transparent.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.640
Little chunks of lead stuck in there.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.459
Gives you a whole new appreciation for like windows and glass bottles and things that are everywhere. Definitely.

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:48.949
So we also attempted to blow some of the lead glass and put it on the end of the rod...

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:54.109
and we blew an air bubble inside of it. It actually looks like a little flower vase.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.810
Where you can grow your little apple seeds!

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.800
This actually turned out fairly decent. That's cool. I like the blue tinge too. And we also made a little marble, a little purple marble.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.180
I'm not sure where that coloring came from? You know my guess is probably cause' it had lead on the pan.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.540
*unintelligible* But that's pretty cool, how cool is that we made our own marbles.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.660
So marbles, little tiny flowerpots, broken glass all part of an epic adventure.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.250
So let's take a second and just briefly recap. How we got to this point today.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:28.580
We started off with sand Andy collected from the Mississippi river. He brought it out here and used Cody to help purify some of the...

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.809
chemicals and we put it in the trash can foundry and let it marinate for almost 7 hours.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.910
We noticed that the sand actually melted into glass within about half an hour. We stirred it up a little bit...

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.649
and we watched it and gave it about 6 more hours after that to melt down and hopefully let some of those bubbles release.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.380
Now just for fun we reach down into the crucible with a steel rod...

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.920
we got a little bit that glass out and...

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:52.760
tried rolling it into a ball and then flattening it out the idea was maybe we could make some kind of an improvised piece of...

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.650
window? I'm not really sure that's what we got, but we definitely got glass and if you look at it...

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.509
it's relatively transparent, a little bit of a greenish tinge, but all in all it's really not too bad considering...

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:07.309
we just made this in our backyard. It's definitely glass, and it's definitely transparent you can see through it, but...

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.569
still has some bubbles so it's not quite like optically clear, not perfect for lenses, but... really close.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.910
And I think a little bit more tweaking and baking along in the kiln...

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:22.249
and we probably have it. Might even be able to crush this up and remelt it now. Because now this is glass..

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.559
it'll be much easier to work with now.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:30.109
I think if we had maybe a bit more skills with the glass working. We might have been able to do it.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.800
Yeah. So it's not clear glass, but it is glass we can crush this up.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.180
We could remelt that we can use it again.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.479
And this is really just a first attempt to any kind of glass working at all.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.860
I think if our skills improve and we happen to run into the right people with the right kind of talents....

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.200
perhaps we can actually end up making crystal clear glass. That is the goal that is the end achievement.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.809
We're just starting out on that journey. It's been a ton of fun

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.830
Thanks so much to Andy and Cody for joining us for this experiment today. As I mentioned...

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.130
I've put their links down in the description you go check out their channels.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.540
They do some incredible things on their channel like Andy spending six months to make a chicken sandwich.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:08.030
Just so you can appreciate what goes into it. And Cody doing all kinds of mind-blowing chemical experiments a lot of things that you shouldn't...

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.479
do at home That's why I like them. So I like these guys.

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:12.920
Of course a big shout-out to our friend...

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.870

Go check your YouTube inbox for sending 25 bucks. Thanks for joining us for this experiment today.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.100
We'll be looking for the next one. Talk to you then.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.470
You're a Wizard Harry!

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:32.859
Hey guys, there is an event called CVX Live that I'm going to be at August 3rd through 5th. Stage presentations meet and greets...

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.620
there's even a special superfan experience where we can hang out one-on-one.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.339
So click the link in the description and I'll be looking for you at CVX Live. :D
