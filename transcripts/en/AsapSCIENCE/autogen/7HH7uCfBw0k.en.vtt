that's a lot like bread chips so I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
that's a lot like bread chips so I
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.100
that's a lot like bread chips so I
probably have because I need a lot of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

night over each other in the ocean and
everyone like pushes the water think you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
everyone like pushes the water think you
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.030
everyone like pushes the water think you
have to like swim through it and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
have to like swim through it and
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710
have to like swim through it and
hopefully you get to the end it's like

that's an exercise now we are trying to
move it to the small Testament so then

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580
move it to the small Testament so then
 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.790
move it to the small Testament so then
so they're using terror sites and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800
so they're using terror sites and
 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.470
so they're using terror sites and
they're covered in little like

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480
they're covered in little like
 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:23.430
they're covered in little like
microscopic like this little like villi

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440
microscopic like this little like villi
 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.380
microscopic like this little like villi
which I think should be and then they

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390
which I think should be and then they
 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.270

there for a really long time it could be

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
there for a really long time it could be
 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.170
there for a really long time it could be
like six hours but it can be 50 hours

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180
like six hours but it can be 50 hours
 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.190
like six hours but it can be 50 hours
1150 hours from city why let go I'll

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200
1150 hours from city why let go I'll
 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.380
1150 hours from city why let go I'll
never let go

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
 
 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.130
 
right so you know you're walking around

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140
right so you know you're walking around
 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.330
right so you know you're walking around
the woods with a feeling so so now it's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
the woods with a feeling so so now it's
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.440
the woods with a feeling so so now it's
like this is like crazy

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
like this is like crazy
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:43.009
like this is like crazy
it stores this okay okay like ferments

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019
it stores this okay okay like ferments
 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.150
it stores this okay okay like ferments
and it turns into this like nasty that's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
and it turns into this like nasty that's
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.949

use for it anymore like I smell like
past so it goes through there through

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
past so it goes through there through
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.670
past so it goes through there through
like we know where you know where it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
like we know where you know where it
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.070
like we know where you know where it
comes from it comes out with the anus

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080
comes from it comes out with the anus
 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.229
comes from it comes out with the anus
that's the whole process it goes all the

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239
that's the whole process it goes all the
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.930
that's the whole process it goes all the
way from to like Riley Greene its but

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940
way from to like Riley Greene its but
 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.000
way from to like Riley Greene its but
there's so much has happened inside your

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
there's so much has happened inside your
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.680
there's so much has happened inside your
body's just like ah really

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690
body's just like ah really
