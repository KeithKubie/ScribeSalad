you know the question is how we can
 

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.520
you know the question is how we can
replicate that and whether groups like

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:20.530
replicate that and whether groups like

other women's rights issues what do you

00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:43.789
other women's rights issues what do you
 

00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:45.430

oh it absolutely is their fight if they

00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:47.809

dignity i mean i think that that that
 

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:56.769
dignity i mean i think that that that
was my point about the linkage between

00:33:56.769 --> 00:33:56.779
was my point about the linkage between
 

00:33:56.779 --> 00:33:58.869
was my point about the linkage between
the fight for women's rights and the

00:33:58.869 --> 00:33:58.879
the fight for women's rights and the
 

00:33:58.879 --> 00:34:00.310
the fight for women's rights and the
fight for all of human rights i mean

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320
fight for all of human rights i mean
 

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.990
fight for all of human rights i mean
it's not we all can very easily draw the

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000
it's not we all can very easily draw the
 

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.169
it's not we all can very easily draw the
draw the connections between the status

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:08.179
draw the connections between the status
 

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.139
draw the connections between the status
of women in any particular society and

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:11.149
of women in any particular society and
 

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.760
of women in any particular society and
the general status of human rights in

the general status of human rights in
 

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.020
the general status of human rights in
that society and that includes the

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:14.030
that society and that includes the
 

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.879
that society and that includes the
societies in which many of the people

00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:15.889
societies in which many of the people
 

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:21.690

live in so far as and in its the
 

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.960
live in so far as and in its the
experience of my own my own life and my

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:28.970
experience of my own my own life and my
 

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.599
experience of my own my own life and my
own my own organization that it was the

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:31.609
own my own organization that it was the
 

00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:35.710
own my own organization that it was the
struggle of women for their rights that

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720
struggle of women for their rights that
 

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.409
struggle of women for their rights that
made us understand our own our own

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:38.419
made us understand our own our own
 

00:34:38.419 --> 00:34:40.359
made us understand our own our own
rights and the way things are connected

00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:40.369
rights and the way things are connected
 

00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:42.669
rights and the way things are connected
and and the way that the approach we

00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679
and and the way that the approach we
 

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.099
and and the way that the approach we
were taking was a very narrow and very

00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:45.109
were taking was a very narrow and very
 

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:49.690
were taking was a very narrow and very
limited approach so i think it's it's in

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:49.700
limited approach so i think it's it's in
 

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:54.190
limited approach so i think it's it's in
the vital interest of every man and we

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200
the vital interest of every man and we
 

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.720
the vital interest of every man and we
of course don't live in isolation from

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:55.730
of course don't live in isolation from
 

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.170
of course don't live in isolation from
women you know we have daughters we have

00:34:59.170 --> 00:34:59.180
women you know we have daughters we have

inconceivable to me that someone could
 

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.280
inconceivable to me that someone could
say this is not of any interest to me

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:06.290
say this is not of any interest to me
 

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:08.589
say this is not of any interest to me
because I'm a male and this happens to

00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599
because I'm a male and this happens to
 

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:10.089
because I'm a male and this happens to
women any more than I would expect women

00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:10.099
women any more than I would expect women
 

00:35:10.099 --> 00:35:12.130
women any more than I would expect women

happened to Nelson Mandela because he
was a man and I'm a woman I mean what

was a man and I'm a woman I mean what
 

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.710
was a man and I'm a woman I mean what
kind of world is that where we suddenly

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720
kind of world is that where we suddenly
 

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.559
kind of world is that where we suddenly
divide our feelings about maybe one way

00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:20.569
divide our feelings about maybe one way
 

00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:22.780

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.360
woman this is how it changes within a
generation and you then move to the next

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:55.370
generation and you then move to the next
 

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.220
generation and you then move to the next
community which is the intra Marian

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:57.230
community which is the intra Marian
 

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.580

is part of that issue I think I'll think

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:07.150
is part of that issue I think I'll think
 

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.030
is part of that issue I think I'll think
it's the only one but it's a continuum

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:09.040
it's the only one but it's a continuum
 

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.280
it's the only one but it's a continuum
of how we raise the status of women and

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:11.290
of how we raise the status of women and
 

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.590
of how we raise the status of women and
how we just make intolerable practices

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:13.600
how we just make intolerable practices
 

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.880
how we just make intolerable practices
that have seemed tolerable so that's the

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:14.890
that have seemed tolerable so that's the
 

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:17.010
that have seemed tolerable so that's the
first thing and there's myriad ways for

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:17.020
first thing and there's myriad ways for
 

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.960
first thing and there's myriad ways for
people to get involved and it's not only

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:18.970
people to get involved and it's not only
 

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.820
people to get involved and it's not only
a question of the West against the

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:20.830
a question of the West against the
 

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:23.130
a question of the West against the
developing world it's also a question of

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:23.140
developing world it's also a question of
 

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.519
developing world it's also a question of
the fight within each country where

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:26.529
the fight within each country where
 

01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:28.230
the fight within each country where
these issues are still involved so I

01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:28.240
these issues are still involved so I
 

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.880
these issues are still involved so I
think that's the first thing and the

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:29.890
think that's the first thing and the
 

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:31.860
think that's the first thing and the
second thing is that amnesty is involved

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:31.870
second thing is that amnesty is involved
 

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:35.370
second thing is that amnesty is involved
