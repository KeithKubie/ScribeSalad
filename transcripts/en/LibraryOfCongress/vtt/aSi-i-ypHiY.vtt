&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
I'm Lee Ann Potter,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.330
I direct Educational
outreach here at the library.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.630
And, I'm thrilled to see you.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm thrilled to also wish you
a very happy Constitution Day.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.600
This morning, when I told my
15 year old sophomore daughter

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.820
that, she rolled her eyes
and said yeah mom whatever.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.660
And then, I told
her, trust me, honey,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.430
if you said to your U.S. History
teacher happy Constitution Day

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.960
today, he would love it.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.800
And, she assured me she would.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.690
How many of you believe
she really will.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.950
That's kind of how I feel.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.250
But, I try, I try.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.170
Anyway, we're happy
that you're here.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.640
My colleague Barbara
and I are going

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.850
to give you just a real brief
introduction to the Library

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.800
of Congress, to the
collections and then we're going

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.100
to dive into our program.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.570
So, without further ado,
Barbara, come on up.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630
&gt;&gt; Barbara Davis: Thank
you, welcome everybody.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.950
My name is Barbara Davis.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.790
I'm from the Law
Library of Congress,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.090
which I'm sure you're
all going to want

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.420
to visit after this, right.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.300
I just want to take
a couple minutes just

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.900
to show you a few things on
our website that, I think,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.860
could really help you with your
constitutional law research,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.310
since that is one of the things

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.550
that we cover in
the Law Library.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.480
So, quickly, we do
have something,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.760
this is a link that's directly
on our website which is law.gov,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.940
and it's called the
Guide to Law Online,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.570
if everyone can see that.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.030
We have a specific
constitution guide.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.210
So, the Guide to Law
Online has curated links.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.560
So, everything you see linked on
the Guide to Law Online is free.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.270
So, everything you
click on this guide

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.280
that you ca see here you can
actually access, you don't have

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.150
to go into a library for.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.450
Although, we'd love to see all

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.590
of your smiling faces
at the library.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.800
This might help you if you're
just trying to kind of figure

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.870
out how to start your research.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.520
It has constitution legal
research guides as well

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.510
as the Constitution in other
languages and other resources.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.580
Another resource that we have
on our website is our blog.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.890
And, I know people
usually tend to shy away

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.770
from blogs as a resource.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.380
But, our blog is really great.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.620
We have a lot of research
guides that could help you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.950
with your constitutional
law research.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.480
And, I've showed you one
here, we actually did one

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.410
on the framing of
the Constitution.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.730
So, the primary documents
you can find

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.000
for free online surrounding the
creation of the constitution.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.980
We also are the contact
people for congress.gov.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.960
If you haven't used
congress.gov before,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.640
it's our legislative
information system.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520
So, we have information
about all the bills

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.530
and resolution introduced
in Congress

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.370
from 1973 to the present.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.150
And, in addition to that
legislative resource,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.490
we also have what we call
the founding documents page.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.350
Founding documents page gives
a link to several web guides.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.500
So, we have a web guide
for the Constitution,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.630
the Bill of Rights, and the
Federalist papers, all of which,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.290
I think, can help your research

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.800
with regards to the
Constitution.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.660
It's not just the text
of the Constitution, but,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.580
it's also primary
resources around that period.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.400
So, newspaper articles, letters
written by people involved,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.780
all things that can help you
and all things that are free.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.380
It also has lists to books that
you can find in the library

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.950
that also talk about
that subject as well.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.590
And then, finally, you
can see a link on there

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.890
to the Constitution Annotated.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.830
This is what it looks
like, if you click on it.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.540
The Constitution Annotated
is written by members

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.150
of the Congressional
Research Services,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.790
so people who do research
only for Congress.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.650
And, they've gone
through each part

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.230
of the Constitution
and its amendments.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.580
And, they've talked about
the history of the creation

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.390
of those sections of
the Constitution as well

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.850
as U.S. Supreme Court cases

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.390
that have interpreted those
parts of the Constitution.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.740
So, another really great
resource, it's a little dry so,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.800
you know, take your time
when you're reading it.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.260
But, the good news is it gives
you places to kind of begin

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.930
and to start your
research and to move

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.960
on from there, all right.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.440
So, I think these are
all great resources.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.070
If you have your
phones, feel free to look

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.450
at them while you're here.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.790
Everything you see is free.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.870
And, I'm going to turn
it back over to Lee Ann,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.270
if she's still here,
yes, to continue on.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.510
Thank you guys.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.620
[ Applause ]

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.920
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
I'm just curious,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.880
how many of you've ever explored
the library's website before?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.280
How many of you think maybe it
might be a good idea to check

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.960
out the Library of Congress's
website once in a while?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.450
This is where you
all raise your hands.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.650
Okay, I'm going to keep going.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.810
I'm always blown away
by what is available.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.470
And, certainly, the Law
Library is no exception.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.380
But, the Law Library's
only a portion

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.800
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.410
In addition to the
resources that are available

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.170
through the library's
Law Library,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.250
there are lots of
other collections.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.380
And, I wanted to highlight
just a couple of them for you.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.900
And, I'm going to draw
particular attention

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.280
to two primary sources that are
within the Library's collection

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.410
because the stories around them,
I think, are just so terrific

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.500
that I hope they'll be
sort of the starting point

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.380
for a fun conversation that
you guys are going to have

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.680
at your tables in a little bit.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.590
So, the main library's website
is just very straightforward,

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.960
it's loc.gov.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.490
So, on the library's
main website,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.960
you'll see where it
says Library Catalog

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.830
and then it says
Digital Collections,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.860
and then Researchers,
Copyright office,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.170
congress.gov Law Library,
and then Teachers.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.550
I wanted to show you
just one little section

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.630
under that Digital Collections.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.450
The one item I wanted to make
sure you saw is the Library

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.580
of Congress holds the
papers of George Washington.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.100
You've probably heard
of this guy.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.600
And, you probably know that he
had something really important

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.330
to do with the Constitutional
Convention, yes.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.350
Have you started all that yet?

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.800
So, within his papers
are letters he wrote

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.300
to different individuals as
well as log books that he kept,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.630
receipts that he kept.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.060
George Washington was an
amazing record keeper.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.790
And, all of his papers are held
here at the Library of Congress

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.720
and all of them have
been digitized

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.340
and are available online.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.740
And, one of the items that's
in that collection is a letter

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.750
that he wrote to a man named
Henry Knox in March of 1787.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.100
Have you guys ever heard of
the name Henry Knox before?

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.400
Who was he?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.110
Do you remember?

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.150
Yeah, yeah, exactly,
so he would,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.160
he becomes the first
Secretary of War.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.730
But, during the Revolution, he
was in charge of the artillery

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.320
and he and George
Washington became really,

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.620
really good friends.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.460
I fact, I got to say it, Henry
Knox is one of those people

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.760
to really get to know because,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.590
before the Revolution,
he was a book seller.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.530
So, people here at the library
really think highly of him.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.670
He was a lover of books.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.530
Anyway, he and George Washington
were very good friends and,

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.270
very, very dear friends.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.170
And, in March of 1787, George
Washington writes him a letter.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.730
And, we know about this letter
for a couple of reasons.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.170
One, because there's a
copy of the letter in one

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.900
of George Washington's
letter books.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.440
Now, you know today when you
guys send emails to people,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.740
if you still send emails?

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.380
I know everything else is
like Snap Chat or something.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.820
But, if you send an email, you
know how in your mailboxes,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.560
you've got your mailbox, you've
got you inbox and your outbox,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.700
so you can see what you sent.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.150
Well, back then, people

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.070
like George Washington
kept letter books.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.020
And, what they were,
were literally big books

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.710
where they kept copies of
the letters that they wrote.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.890
And so, if you go into the
letter book of George Washington

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.420
from the spring of 1787,
there is a copy of the letter

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.110
that he sent to Henry Knox.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.700
And then, in another
collection is the response

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.550
that he received
back from Henry Knox.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.170
But, in the letter, he says my
dear sir, and then he goes on,

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.500
he goes on, he goes
on, and then he gets

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.920
into the meat of the letter.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.770
And, what he asks is this.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.890
He says, this again,
it's March 1787.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.270
The Constitutional Convention
doesn't even begin until May.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.640
And, he's saying to George,
he's saying to Henry Knox,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.120
he's like so I've
been asked to go

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.290
to this convention
in Philadelphia.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.370
And, I'm deciding whether
or not I'm going to go.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.190
And, I'd really like
your advice.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.910
That's the essence
of this letter.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:24.560
He's saying a thought, however,
has lately run through my mind

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.650
which is attended
with embarrassment.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.660
It is whether my nonattendance

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.690
at this convention will not
be considered as a dereliction

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.650
to republicanism nay more
whether other motives may not,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.780
however injuriously, be ascribed
to me for not exerting myself

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.750
on this occasion
in support of it.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.290
And he goes back and forth.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.590
And so, it's wonderful letter.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.890
And, you know, George
Washington,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.560
it's not language
that we hear today.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.100
But, the wishy washiness of
it is really incredible to me

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.430
because take for granted
that George Washington went

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.850
to the convention, that
he becomes the President

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.150
of the Convention

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.500
and he eventually becomes the
President of the United States.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.510
And, we assume that that's
the way it was always going

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.810
to work out.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.110
And, in this letter
to Henry Knox,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.990
we get a totally
different picture

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.470
of what could've happened
because it's so tentative.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.550
George Washington wasn't
even sure he was going to go.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.040
And, he's asking his
friend for some advice.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.000
So, that's one of my all
time favorite letters.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.860
And, it's buried within
thousands of other letters

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.910
within the Washington
papers here at the library.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.320
The library also holds
papers related to many

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.620
of the other delegates.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.480
I know that, as some of you
came in today, you saw some

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.610
of our Alexander
Hamilton collection.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.340
So the library also holds the
papers of Alexander Hamilton.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.910
And again, all of them
are available as well.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:45.140
The library also holds a diary
of a man named James McHenry.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:53.180
And, if you go to
the exhibitions part

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.500
of the library's website,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.320
there's a section called
Creating the United States.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.620
It was an exhibit that was here

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.560
at the library a
number of years ago.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.120
And, featured in that
exhibit was this diary

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.810
of this man named James McHenry.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.550
He as a delegate from Maryland.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.820
And, he wasn't at the convention
for the entire duration.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.220
But, he kept a diary for
the period that he was.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.590
And, the reason I wanted
to show you this is

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.300
because this was written
231 years ago today.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.620
So, it's September
the 18th 1787.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.370
And, this is what he
records in his diary.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.030
I don't know how
good you are reading,

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.930
you know, our handwriting here.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.550
But, it says a lady asked
Dr. Franklin, well doctor,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.650
what have we got,
republic or a monarchy?

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.960
A republic replied the
doctor, if you can keep it.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.730
You've probably heard
that story before.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.790
This is he only recording

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.340
of that conversation
ever having happened

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.080
in this man's diary
that's here at the library.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.510
And, this notion of
responsibility in terms

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.320
of what kind of a
government do we got,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.210
well a republic if
we can keep it.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.510
That's sort of the kind

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.810
of conversation we're
going to be having today.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.220
And, it is my absolute
pleasure to welcome Cynthia

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.650
and Sandy Levinston who have
written the book that's sitting

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.950
at your tables.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.870
And, they're going to be talking
with you briefly this morning

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.850
about it, about their research
about their work, and then,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.460
give you an opportunity
to do some talking as well

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.540
at your tables about some issues
related to the Constitution

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.810
and its relevancy all
these 200 years later.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.550
So, Cynthia and Sandy
thank you for being here.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.850
It's all yours.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you, let's see.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.510
Thank you.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.530
[ Applause ]

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.060
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
We want to thank Leanne

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.860
and the Law Library, the
Leader's Center, Karen, Jackie,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.430
many other people
here for inviting us.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.170
And, of course, we thank you
all very much for coming.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.680
You are he reason that
we wrote this book.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.450
And, I'm thinking having
from Barbara earlier,

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.610
really I should've
gone to the Library

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.580
of Congress Primary
Sources, even more than I did

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.600
when we were researching
the book.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.040
But, I think Sandy would like to
make some comments about those.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.340
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
Yeah, the title,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.950
Fault Lines in the Constitution,
as many of you no doubt pick up,

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.090
is an illusion to a
geological phenomenon

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:32.830
that there are fault lines that
we don't see buried in the land

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.750
or in the oceans,
particularly the East Coast.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.720
We might not think of them

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.040
because this is an earthquake
zone until and earthquake,

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.030
I think several months
ago, happened in Delaware

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.450
to the surprise of
many, many people.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.960
If one lives on the West
Coast, one is very familiar

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.120
with earthquakes
and fault lines.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:01.150
And the idea that what you
ignore most of the time and,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.020
you know, live very happy
lives in San Francisco or LA

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.690
or Seattle could, in
fact, come to an end

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.840
if the fault line slipped.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.970
And so, that's where
we get the title

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:19.550
from that there are fault lines
within the Constitution, that,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.430
unfortunately, we
rarely think about.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:27.030
But, one of the points of the
book is that, if they slip,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.880
and one of the implicit
arguments is

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.420
that they may be slipping in
front of our very eyes today,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.680
then, we are not, in
fact, all that well off.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.940
I want to make one comment
about the Knox letter

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.280
and the reference also
Alexander Hamilton.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.260
Hamilton, in 1775,
I suspect that many

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.530
of you have heard the
soundtrack of Hamilton

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.190
which I've probably listened
to, literally, 100 times.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.760
In 1775, depending on when you
think Alexander Hamilton was

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.310
born, it was either 1755 or
1757, and people aren't sure,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.510
he was either 18 or 20.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:14.170
And, even in 1787, when he
was an important delegate

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.520
for the Constitutional
Convention,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.240
he would've been 30 or 32.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.340
George Washington was one of
the old men at the Convention.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.040
He was born in 1732, 1787, he
would've been 55 years old,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.490
which made him, relatively
speaking, old.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.360
And, he was more cautious.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.310
Old people tend to
be more cautious,

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.770
younger people tend
to be more daring.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:48.280
And, nobody was more daring
than Alexander Hamilton or,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.590
for that matter, James Madison.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.590
So, one of the things you
should be thinking about and one

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.680
of the reasons we
wrote the book is

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.640
that it's extraordinarily
important that people your age,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.950
who are going to spend
far, far more time living

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.140
in the future United
States than I am,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.670
it's simply an unfortunate
fact of life.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.370
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: It's not
that unfortunate for them.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.060
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
That is true.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.720
That, we're really talking about
your future and the importance

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.450
of youngsters thinking about
the future and thinking

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.430
about the fault lines.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.510
Yes, this is Constitution
Day, and, in our own way,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.740
we're celebrating
Constitution Day.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.460
But, for me, at least, and
I think for Cynthia as well,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:44.380
part of the celebration is the
audacity of the framers thinking

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.640
for themselves about
what needed to be done.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.130
So that, Alexander Hamilton,
for example, freely referred

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:58.820
to the existing system of
government in 1787 as imbecilic.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.020
You don't have to believe
tht our current form

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.140
of government is
imbecilic in order

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.250
to believe there might be fault
lines that should be examined

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:15.810
and that the best way we
celebrate Constitution Day is

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.270
to think, as I say, about
the courage and audacity

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:25.970
of the framers and especially,
frankly, of the younger framers.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.880
George Washington never spoke
at the Constitutional Convention

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.290
until the very last day.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.130
As the letter suggests,
his importance is

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.140
that he was what will
later be called the Father

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.540
of our Country.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.840
And, if he hadn't been

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.600
at the Convention it would've
been extraordinarily important

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.100
because of who he was.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.640
But, otherwise, he was silent.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.600
That's not true of the 30 year
old Hamilton the, I think,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.980
36 year old Madison
and other people

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.090
who were roughly the
same age or even younger.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.810
They were the ones
actively talking

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:13.740
about the future really arguing
with one another losing battles.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.290
The framers did not all
agree with one another.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.470
They agreed, almost
all of them did agree

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.860
that the Constitution
wasn't perfect

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.350
and that's why there's
an amendment clause.

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:30.010
So, I want to put
Constitution Day and the framers

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.110
and the importance
and our gratitude

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.210
about you being here
in that context.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.600
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: And, you'll
see, near the end of the time

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.590
that we're here together, that,

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:46.560
we really take seriously the
need to take the Constitution

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.540
and it's fault lines seriously

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.680
and to consider how
to change it.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.970
So, in our book, Fault
Lines in the Constitution,

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.700
we talk about 18 fault lines.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.050
You'll be glad to know
we're not going to talk

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.400
about all of those today.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.080
But, we are going to
talk about three of them.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.410
Sandy is a constitutional
scholar.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.710
I write for kids.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.040
And, I do a lot of
research, of course.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.370
And, even though Sandy's been
working on this issue for well

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.620
over 20 years, I don't think
I had taken it so seriously

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.360
until we wrote this
book together.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.270
I refer to us, on various
social media, as the coauthors.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.270
One of the fault lines that
I certainly did not think

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.520
about nearly so seriously,
and as Sandy says,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.040
we do take this very
seriously, the need for change.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.960
One of the assumptions,
as Leanne says,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.700
we take the Constitution
for granted.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.030
But, one of the things I
seriously question and continue

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:48.230
to is a basic part of the
Constitution, the Senate.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.740
So, how many of you,
say in the last week,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.700
raise your hand, had serial?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.700
A muffin? I had a chocolate
muffin this morning.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.910
A soft drink?

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.010
Yeah, right, okay
a lot of hands up.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.660
What on earth does this have
to do with the U.S. Senate?

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.850
Well, it actually
is closely related.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.760
All of these food items
have corn syrup in them.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:23.200
Corn syrup is not good for us.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.600
But, it's in a lot
of foods that we eat.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.950
And, that's related to the
Constitution to the Senate.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.410
So, how does that happen?

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.340
Sandy do you want to give
the background to this?

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.640
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Yes.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.630
It happens, frankly,
because there is legislation

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.030
that subsidizes the
production of corn,

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.570
therefore of corn syrup.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.870
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: I
wonder if you want to go back

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.070
to the history and how we
ended up with two senators.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.370
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
Okay well I'll get.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.670
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Okay.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.080
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: And so,
why do we have that legislation?

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.450
The answer is not really
the House of Representatives

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.650
where representation
is presentable.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:07.920
So, California has, I think,
54 members of Congress.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.170
We're from Texas
most of the year,

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.650
Texas has 36 members
of the House.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.790
So, where small states
have small numbers

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.770
of representatives, there
are 7 states that have fewer

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.820
that have more senators
than representatives,

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.410
that is they have
one representative,

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.300
the minimum number, but
they have two senators,

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.210
because the Constitution says
each state gets two senators.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.950
So, you really have to
look at the Senate in order

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:43.040
to understand a lot of
agricultural policy.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:49.290
There, it turns out that the
small population states also

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:54.760
tend to be more rural than
the large population states.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.980
Texas has tons of
acreage but we also have 4

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.400
of the 11 largest
cities in the country.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.980
We're the most, we're the
densest state in the country,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.770
which most people don't
realize that Texas is full

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.530
of Ranches and things like that.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.720
But, the senators from the
upper Midwest, in particular,

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.590
have lots of power in the Senate

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:26.370
because of the each states gets
two senators rule and also,

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.090
the nature of bicameralism
that we talk about.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.440
Pardon? Yep.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.980
That there are two houses
of Congress not one.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.560
And, for a bill to become a
law, both houses have to agree,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.230
every dotted I every
crossed T. Now, the Senate

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.630
and the House are very
different, precisely,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.900
because House is
proportional, Senate is not.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.340
How'd that come about?

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.470
It came about because of what
is often called the Great

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.580
Compromise, capital
G, capital C,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:03.660
where the small states basically
said we're going to walk

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.560
out if you don't give us equal
representation in the Senate.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.870
James Madison, so called
Father of the Constitution,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.110
thought this was
a terrible idea.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.090
He never, ever had
a good word to say

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.020
about equal voting
power in the Senate.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.710
But, he did, ultimately,
agree to accept it

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.360
because the alternative
would be no constitution.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.120
Let me point out that another
very, very important compromise

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:37.480
that people never refer to
as a capital G capital C,

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.010
Great Compromise,
was the one saying

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:46.260
that slaves would be
counted as 3/5ths of person

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.150
for computing the
voting power of states.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:56.090
And, this meant that slave
states got extra representation

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.280
in the House of Representatives

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.690
because their slaves were
counted as if they were really

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:08.420
and truly being represented,
which of course they weren't.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.330
But, they did help give
additional voting power

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.870
to Virginia.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.730
And, that doe help to explain
why Thomas Jefferson instead

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:21.220
of John Adams was
elected president in 1800.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.610
Both of these compromises
were central

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.010
to having a Constitution at all.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.400
One of them, as I say, is often
called the Great Compromise,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.700
the other isn't.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.950
But, what's really important
is that people didn't end

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:39.170
up agreeing, you know,
it's really a fined idea

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.210
that Delaware should
have the same number

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.350
of senators as Virginia.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.530
James Madison never agreed
that that was a fine idea, but,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.790
it was a price that had to be
paid, similarly with regard

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:54.050
to the compromises over slavery.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.830
We live with both of
those compromises today

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.040
in quite different ways.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.890
But, with the Senate,
in particular,

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.550
we live with the compromise

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:12.960
in that the small states
have what we regard

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.110
as excessive voting
power in the Senate.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.420
And, the voting power
is translated to things

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.250
like agricultural
bills or subsidies,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.310
protection for coal production.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.280
Because, not only are
the states small, but,

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.820
it turns out that senators

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:39.230
from small states
represent fewer interests.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:44.130
If, in fact, the small states
were really and truly as diverse

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.200
as the large states, like Texas,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.270
then frankly it might
not matter.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.960
But, small states tend to
be far, far less diverse

00:24:53.960 --> 00:25:00.430
in ever measure of diversity
whether it's the economic base,

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.460
the tomography of the
population, small states tend

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.510
to be whiter than Texas.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:13.400
We have the most diversity in
the country is Houston Texas.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:22.300
And, this has real implications
for why bills become law

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:28.240
or why a lot of bills never
stand a chance of becoming law.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.540
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So,

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.060
there really are some
potentially dangerous

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.970
consequences, from the
Senate, as it's constructed.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.610
Every one of the
Fault Line's chapters

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.410
in the book starts
with the story.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.970
And, our story about
the U.S. Senate,

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.720
which is the second
chapter, begins with 9/11.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.760
We recently observed the
17th anniversary of 9/11.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.020
After the attacks occurred
on the World Trade Center

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:04.290
and in Shanksville and
right here in Washington DC,

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:10.450
the president asked
Congress to allocate funding

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:14.120
to protect important
sites, military sites

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.720
and commercial sites
and that sort

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.090
of thing around the country.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:24.690
The president who was in charge
of organizing that effort

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.730
to allocate funding was
Senator Patrick Leahy

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.770
from the itty bitty teeny
tiny state of Vermont.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.720
He had a lot of authority here.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.590
And, he could largely,
with some compromising,

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.390
but largely control how
the money was going to go

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:47.390
to the states, it
was getting assigned

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.610
to protect buildings and people.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:55.160
He decided that, because he
came from a teeny tiny state,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.760
he did not want to
have the funding,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.910
the Patriot Act Funding,
it came to be called,

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:06.270
to be allocated solely
on a proportional basis,

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.920
that is the big states shouldn't
get all the money compared

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.220
to the small states.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.050
So, he made sure that
three quarters of a percent

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.350
of all the funding,
as a baseline,

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.850
went to every single state.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.620
And then, on top of
that, money went based,

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.860
went to the state
based on population.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.760
But, every state
then got a baseline.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.060
And, that included
Washington DC.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.260
That meant that some states, an
arguably possibly Washington,

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.410
ended up with some money that
it didn't know what to do with.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:40.380
Well, Washington DC spent some
of its money on a rap song,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.740
that might have been
fun, you know.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.750
But, it's a little hard to
understand how that was able

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.790
to protect buildings
here or people.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.380
I think it was Montana or
Wyoming spent some money

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.160
on a robot that they
named daisy.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.380
Another state spent some money
on an air conditioned van.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.960
On the other hand, some
states, like California,

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.740
got much less funding
per capita than some

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.300
of the small states did.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.810
This is, we're showing you
some graphics from the book.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.170
And, this shows you
the comparison

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.720
between per capita
funding between California

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.080
and what's the other state
here, Wyoming, thank you.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.190
One of the people we polled in
the book said, from a small,

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.320
that is low population
state said we've got a lot

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.130
of buildings here.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.820
Well yeah, but.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.340
So, this is one of the very
current examples of the effects

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.040
of having two senators
per state.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.920
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Let me
just intervene with one thing.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.820
Those of you who are
familiar with politics

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.990
and presumably people from
Washington are more familiar

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.270
with politics than anywhere
else in the country,

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.870
know that Patrick Leahy's
a liberal democrat.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:02.760
And, the senator from
Texas is, both senators

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.170
from Texas is conservative
republicans.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:11.080
But, it's very important to
realize that, when it comes

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.730
to bringing home the bacon
for one's constituents,

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.960
it may not matter all that much

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.950
which political part
we're talking about,

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.340
that Senator Leahy

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.830
or his colleague Bernie
Sanders are very good senators

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.800
for Vermont.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.700
And, they're very
concerned to make sure

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.740
that Vermont gets
what it deserves and,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.570
from the perspective of people
that don't live in Vermont,

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.970
maybe more than it deserves.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:46.750
So, they're, you know,
there are certainly ways

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.710
in which it matters
whether people are democrat

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.010
or republican.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.500
But, with the Senate, we
really do want to emphasize

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.950
that it may matter whether
you come from a small state

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:02.700
or a big state and the Senate
is certainly stacked, rigged,

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.570
in favor of small states.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.980
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Okay, so
we've just gotten the hi sign.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.240
We're just going to go on
to a marathon here, dash.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.520
So, one of the other
graphics that we have

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.020
for the book shows
the comparison.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.650
In 2016, more than half
the population got less

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.420
than half the Senate
representation.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.800
This problem is going
to get worse.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.740
The project is that, in 2040 70%

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.850
of the U.S. population
will live in 15 states.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.280
So, 70% of the population
will have only 30 senators.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.460
The rest of the population will
get the rest of the senators.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.740
So, here's our corn
syrup graphic

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.850
and how bad it is for you.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.750
Washington DC is
chapter six in the book.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.840
You're probably very
familiar with this situation.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.590
I'm sure you know who
Congresswoman Norton is.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.690
She is looking frustrated
here because, undoubtedly,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:01.970
as you know, she can
speak, she cannot vote.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.650
I believe you made a reference
to Hamilton and whether

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.010
or not you listened to the
soundtrack or seen the play.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.320
Well, it was about
Washington DC, that the song,

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.090
it was in the room
where it happened,

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:20.120
is about because
of a compromise.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.560
This is, of course, you know no
taxation without representation,

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.540
this is your license
plates, right.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.630
And, we have a list of recent
grievances including the fact

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.280
that Washington cannot control
its own budget or its own laws.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.420
Do you want to add
something to this?

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.720
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Yeah.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.540
There has been a proposal to
make Washington DC a state.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:49.370
There is, frankly,
no possibility

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:54.350
that the amendment required
to make Washington a state

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.410
and therefore get you
one representative

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:03.100
and two senators will ever pass
because of the small states

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:08.780
or the large states that ca veto
any proposed amendment simply

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.580
by getting one quarter
plus one of all the states.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.910
And so, for a variety of
reasons, largely political,

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.310
here where being a democrat
or republican might matter,

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.740
because there's no doubt
that the two senators

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.890
that are representative from
Washington will be democrats.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:31.450
But you should know that it
is, there is zero probability

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.930
of a constitutional amendment
actually giving Washington

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:42.910
representation in Congress
and a vote for legislation.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.810
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So the
third fault line that we want

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:50.320
to talk with you about today,
very quickly, is whether

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.860
or not you can grow up to
be president or how grown

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.020
up you have to be
to be president.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.530
It's often said, everybody
in the United States,

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:00.830
you can all grow
up to be president.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.110
Well, that's not
necessarily the case.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.950
The story we tell in this
chapter is about John McCain

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.420
who was not born on the
territorial United States,

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.820
could he actually, when
he ran for president,

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.460
if he had won, become president?

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.420
It's not absolutely clear.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.280
But, one of the major
fault lines

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.480
that we take a look
at is age minimums.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.800
You have to be 35 years old.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.250
You have to have lived
in the United States

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.660
for at least 14 years.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.130
Senator McCain raised
the question

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.600
in the U.S. what is
that, where is that?

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.860
And, you have to be a
natural born citizen,

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.010
which is totally unexplained.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.070
We need to run.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.600
This is France, we need to
run through this, let me.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.570
In France, in order to run
for president, you just need

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.940
to be 18 years old and
have a bank account.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:01.690
The French are really serious
about their bank accounts.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:05.740
There were, until very recently,
two states in the country

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.420
that did not have an age minimum
for running for governor.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:16.030
So, for instance, in Kansas,
Jack Ferguson ran for Governor.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.510
He was 16 and he ran with
a high school classmate

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.360
of his, Alex Kline.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.220
They were, they actually
ultimately,

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.060
6 teenagers in Kansas
ran for governor.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.530
During the primary season,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.440
the Kansas Legislature
changed its laws.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.720
But, Alex and Jack were
allowed to participate

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.320
in a couple of the debates.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.950
The others, for some
reason, were not.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.350
One of the things
that Jack said was,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.220
after he lost the
primary, please go vote.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.750
A democracy only works when
the citizens are engaged

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.200
in the process.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.120
Another state that still
does not have an age minimum

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.860
for running for governor
is Vermont.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.470
And, here is Ethan
Sonneborn who, at 13,

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.710
ran for Governor of Vermont.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.400
And, he got in the primary
just last month in August,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.480
he got 8% of the
vote state wide.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.380
So, we're very proud, yeah.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.860
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson:
Why is this important?

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.880
It's kind of fun
and entertaining.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.630
But, participation in
debate is very significant.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:34.960
And, it's no secret that
there are differences

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.180
between people your age

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.720
and people even 35 let
alone the current Congress

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:46.800
where most people are
well, well over 35.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.400
It would be very interesting
and perhaps even important

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.750
if people your age or closer to
your age actually participated

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:02.380
in senatorial debates or
presidential debates and brought

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.830
up the kinds of issues
that are relevant to you

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.520
and might be quite
different that issues

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.440
that are most salient
to people like me.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:18.160
The age limits have the
consequence of barring people

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:23.880
from being heard during the
run up to elections even if,

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:29.690
as in Vermont, you know, the,
Ethan got only 8% and he was,

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.940
nobody ever thought
he would win.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.620
But, he was able to articulate,

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.170
he's a very articulate
young man,

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.780
issues that are really
important.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.380
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So,
the question is now what?

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.130
And, we turn this over to you.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.900
[Inaudible] said, I know the
forefathers said you have the

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.390
right to own a gun but they
also said you can own people.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:56.530
Look, the Constitution's a lot
like our grandfather, he's wise

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.190
and he means well but he's
getting really, really old.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.370
And, every once in a while
he says something crazy

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:03.670
and they got to go
to the other room

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.970
and discuss what we're
going to do about him.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.980
So, we are giving
you the opportunity

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.650
to discuss what we're going
to do about the Constitution.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.950
Sasha Doughty, I believe
is going to organize you.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.250
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
She left that to me.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.550
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Oh Lee Ann is, okay.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.970
&gt;&gt; Barbara Davis: She's going
to bring the questions out.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.240
All right so, at your tables
you, each table is going

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.350
to get a question, two tables
will have the same question,

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.170
so we actually have three
questions floating out there.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.490
And, at your tables, what we'd
like you to do is just first,

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:36.670
take a minute to read your
question, think a little bit

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.570
about what your reaction
to the question is,

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:44.320
and then start a conversation at
your table about your question.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.880
And, ultimately, we'd
love it if one person

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.120
from each table could
be your scribe.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.000
So, we've got flip boards
adjacent to each of the tables,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.990
if you could jot down, you
know, like a brain storm,

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:58.300
ideas that people have in, you
know, reaction to the question.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.350
And then, at about 11:30,
11:35ish we're going to ask

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.430
that one person from each
table to sort of report

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.340
out about what your
table talked about.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:15.280
And then, it'd be great if
somebody could certainly,

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.170
we'll walk around too and
tell you want time it is

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.560
and how much time you've got.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.330
But, keep an eye on how
much time you've got.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.800
You've basically got 20
minutes to have a conversation

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.970
about the question that's been
posed, brain storm your reaction

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.220
to it and then report back
to the rest of us about it.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.530
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: And could
you mention the blog also?

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.610
&gt;&gt; Barbara Davis: And
then, once we report out,

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:38.980
Sandy and Cynthia have a blog
associated with the book.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.190
And, they have agreed to make
their next blog post come

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.310
out of your discussions today.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.290
So, we're going to
also ask you to vote

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.850
on what topic you think
they ought to describe

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.210
in their next blog post.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.000
And, we'll do that at the end
of our conversation as well.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.330
So, you've got about
20 minutes, go ahead

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.630
and just start talking
to each other.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.920
And, I know you can tell, I can
tell watching your body language

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.220
that it's time for
you guys to talk.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.520
So, it's your turn, talk.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.130
&gt;&gt; You should have, it
should be a requirement

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.100
but you should also have
a high school education

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.400
to help you like
form your ideas.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.970
&gt;&gt; I thought we should mention
we're actually in the process

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:06.670
of fixing these problems.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:13.800
And, it forces you it not
only [inaudible] it forces you

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.360
to actually address
those problems,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.520
find the problems and fix them.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.820
&gt;&gt; So we said like how many
[inaudible] what would be the

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.120
best thing to do.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.510
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So,
this is a great discussion.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.810
I love hearing all of this.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.110
Thank you so much.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:05.440
You should know that in the
second to the last chapter

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.200
of the book, Sandy and I
actually debate this question

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.230
of whether or not
to have another

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.190
Constitutional Convention.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.690
There's an audio of the book.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.950
And, in the audio we
actually really did get

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.710
to debate each other.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.580
My, actually we were
talking earlier

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.140
about what our biggest arguments
were while we were writing

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.440
the book.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.350
One was that, the
other was whether

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:30.730
to pronounce it gerrymander
or gerrymander.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:37.420
But, we'll reprise briefly for
you what our arguments were

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.860
about a constitutional
amendment,

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.760
a constitutional
convention or not.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.870
Sandy do you want
to take the lead?

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:50.510
&gt;&gt; Sanford Levinson: Yeah, for
a variety of reasons, Congress,

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:56.040
I think, is nearly
hopeless as a source

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.290
of really serious discussion

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:03.310
about potential constitutional
reform.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:05.600
Some of this has to do
with the fact that members

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.510
of Congress benefit
from current structures.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.800
So, Cynthia mentions our debate

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.020
about gerrymandering
or gerrymandering.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.330
But, the important thing is
that the house is structured

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.010
in such a way that, I
think, has all sorts

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.550
of unfortunate consequences.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:27.300
It's unrealistic to believe the
House would really address this.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:32.320
Secondly, even if one is
less cynical about members

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.280
of Congress, they're
extraordinarily busy

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.920
and don't have the time
to take, literally,

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:45.080
months or even a
year, to discuss,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:50.640
with sufficient seriousness,
the kinds of questions, frankly,

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.610
that we raise in the book.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:58.190
Alexander Hamilton writes
in the very first paragraph,

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.920
the very first federalist
paper in 1787,

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:09.870
that the great challenge facing
Americans but also the model

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:11.630
that Americans can present

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:16.140
to the world is whether
we are capable of engaging

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.340
in reflection and choice
about how to be governed.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.310
And really, the wonderful
thing about 1787,

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:31.160
1788 is that there was intense
reflection in choice at least

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:36.590
by those people, white males,
who were viewed as part

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.810
of the political class.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:42.030
But, they were at each
other's throats with regard

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.190
to very basic discussions.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:49.470
I believe that the only
way to get the kind

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.450
of truly serious
reflection and choice

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:56.340
that we need 231 years later is

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.670
through another constitutional
convention.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.220
Cynthia disagrees.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.680
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
I think it's nuts.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.100
The framers have
absolutely no idea

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.760
of how this would take place.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.240
They just said there could
be another way to do this.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.990
There's no way to know how
they delegates would be chosen,

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:15.400
what authority they have.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.270
You may have specific
issues you don't

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:21.240
like about the Constitution
or not, you know,

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.240
a couple of groups said our
country's been fine so far.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.350
Well there was this
matter of the Civil War.

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:29.820
But, except for that
and some other things,

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.480
you might think the
Constitution's fine in general

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.460
but have a couple
specific questions,

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.140
maybe about the Second
Amendment for instance.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.520
But, there's no way to,
once you open it up,

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.260
once you have a constitutional
convention,

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.110
just the way the framers
completely overturned the

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:45.950
Articles of Confederation,

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:48.540
the whole thing could
be up for grabs.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.370
I would say we might risk
losing the First Amendment,

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.670
Freedom of Speech.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.550
Sandy thinks that
wouldn't happen.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.210
But, who knows?

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.260
So, I just think it's too risky.

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.070
And, that's the debate,
basically,

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:01.800
that we have going
back and forth

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.320
in the last chapter of the book.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.910
Second to the last chapter.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.620
In the last chapter, actually,

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.160
we give the Constitution
a grade.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.440
And, we invite you, as
you read through the book,

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.270
to think about what your grade
for the Constitution would be.

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:20.000
We based it on our device,
our guidelines for how

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.220
to judge the Constitution
is the preamble.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.210
So, we invite you to look
closely at the preamble

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.590
as the values basis
for the Constitution

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:30.910
and grade it according

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.920
to how well you think
it meets those goals

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.650
for the Constitution.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.680
We would love, there
may be another end here

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.620
by the library people,
we would love to know

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.570
if you have any ideas
for our blog.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.980
We blog twice a month.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.960
We're going to ask your
teacher's librarians over here

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.010
if they would like to
sign up for the blog.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.310
And, we would like your ideas

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.900
so that our next blog would
be, can come from you.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.780
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: On behalf
of the Library of Congress,

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.020
we are so happy that you were
able to come this morning

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.170
and that you participated
as actively as you did.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:06.510
I can't tell you how
exciting it is really, I mean,

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.480
young people talking about our
Constitution is exactly what

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.780
needs to be happening.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.080
And, the fact that we were doing

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.740
that today makes me
very, very happy.

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.680
And, I hope you had a, I hope
you had fun at the library.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.000
The Library of Congress can be a
pretty imposing and scary place.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.460
And, we don't want it to be.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.560
We want it to be a
really welcoming place.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.370
We want it to be a place
where you are excited to come

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.040
and that you want to come and
not only participate in programs

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.210
but you can also come
and do research as well.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.990
And, of course, we want you to
all become our interns one day

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.640
and then our colleagues.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.320
First of all thank you again
to the Levinsons thanks to all

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.060
of you, hope you have a terrific
Constitution Day and a big shout

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.960
out at your teachers
to getting you here.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.280
Thank you all very, very much.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.580
&gt;&gt; Barbara Davis: Thank you.
