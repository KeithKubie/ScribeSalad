My name is Jenny Korn.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.109
I am a fellow, brand new, at the Berkman Klein
Center for Internet &amp; Society.

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.920
I'll be looking at the way people talk about
race and gender, both online and in person.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.520
I've pretty much always been interested in
issues of race because I'm a woman of color

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.180
that grew up in Alabama.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.780
And I was reminded of my race in both positive
and negative ways at a very early age and

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.200
ever since then.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:37.390
Talking about race more openly I think promotes,
my hope is that it promotes a more just society

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.390
eventually.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.129
Because if we can't talk about race then we
definitely can't talk about racism.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.100
And so we have to get to the point where talking
about race is not uncomfortable or feels forced.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.620
But rather feels the same as saying what your
gender is or what your sexual orientation

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.620
is.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.059
To say it all together naturally and comfortably
so that all of us can discuss what that means

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.480
to everybody across different levels of society.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.760
The Internet has definitely changed the way
that we socialize but also the ways that we

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.660
interact with what we believe race is.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.020
We're not only consumers of the Internet.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.030
We're also producers.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.500
We actually can create different ways to discuss
race.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.420
We can share different representations of
race.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.110
And to me that's really exciting because we
are able to reduce the distance and the time

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.480
and the speed to creating those representations
online instead of relying on publishers for

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.570
books, or producers and distributors for movies.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.290
We can overlook that and use the Internet
as the way to produce and broadcast and share

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.290
those representations.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.960
And that means we can change old stereotypes
and make new representations of what we believe

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.250
it is to be of color, or to be white.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.200
It's a brand new medium in terms of how far
we can get this kind of message.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.080
I'm excited by the possibilities.
