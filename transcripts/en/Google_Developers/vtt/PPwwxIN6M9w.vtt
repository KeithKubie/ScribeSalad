00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.992
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.140
MARION CROAK: Hi,
and thank you for

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.580
that wonderful introduction.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.087
She forgot to mention
I have a cold.

00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:18.600
[LAUGHS] So if I start coughing,
I'll just get some water.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
But I'd like to welcome all of
you here today to the summit,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480
and I wish you could be standing
here with me on stage to see

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.810
how beautiful you all look.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.980
I've been in tech for
over 35 years now.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.930
I have someone that I
mentor and she said,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.070
you've been in tech longer
than I've been alive.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.580
I think that was a compliment.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.270
But as I've spanned
this long career,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.440
I've watched the rate of
women entering and staying

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.680
in the field rise and fall.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
And when I look at you all
today and I think about the fact

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.970
that there is a growing
number of universities that

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.960
are beginning to report that the
percentage of computer science

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.460
majors and engineers
are almost 50%

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.820
now at a female ratio
to men, it gives me

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.300
a tremendous sense of
optimism that we're reaching

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.810
some type of inflection
curve, and moving away

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.230
from what, as you probably
know, has been a downward trend.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.170
So again, I'm so happy
that you're here.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.690
It's a Saturday.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.830
It means a lot to us that
you joined the summit.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.190
I want to share with you a
lot from my professional life,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.440
but I'm going to
begin by telling you

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.960
a little bit about my
childhood and my early youth.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.910
And I'm going to leave
a lot out because I

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.280
have to protect the innocent,
as well as the dead.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.870
But I will let you know that I
did grow up in New York City,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.460
so I'm a lot tougher than
I actually look and sound.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.990
And when I was a child something
would break in our house

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.960
my mother, who was
a brilliant woman,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.590
would inevitably call my father.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.870
And my father would
fumble around a bit

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.220
and then inevitably he
would call a repair person.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.560
And it was a thrill of my
youth for these repair people,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.800
and they were inevitably
men, these plumbers

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.930
and electricians to come into
our house and to fix things.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.690
And I was just
enamored with them.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.570
I would follow them around.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.790
I loved their smell.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.870
I loved to watch how they
were tinkering with things

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.570
and listening to the
sound of the water going

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.780
through the pipes.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.175
And I would really watch
them and pepper them

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:08.130
with questions I'm
sure I was annoying,

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.590
but they seemed to indulge me.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.640
And that sense of wanting to
be the one who could actually

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.770
fix something that
was broken like I

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.040
wanted my mother to call me.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.410
That has stayed
with me all my life

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.260
and it has served me very well.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.510
And I just remember it
many, many times as things

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.720
start breaking and I'm
being called to fix them.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.210
But that started
when I was younger

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.580
and I remember being
a young mother.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.000
And I would come home and
my children would greet me

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.280
and then within five
minutes it would be mom,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.490
the printer's broken.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.140
The PC doesn't work.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.890
And it would be my evening
is trying to bring that

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.410
back to being, to life.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.850
And it was like, oh my god.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.510
What have I wished for?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.145
Even now they're in their early
20s and I still get the calls,

00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:08.875
the microwave's not working.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:09.750
And it's like, OK.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.320
We'll fix it.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.810
Don't worry.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.430
But I had a
fascinating childhood.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.510
It was a bit unconventional
and maybe one day

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.790
when we meet each other
in some other place

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.740
I'll tell you all about it.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.600
But when I became
ready for school,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.180
I started going to
Catholic schools.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.950
And I stayed in
a Catholic school

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.290
until I was in 10th
grade, and then I

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.270
had this burning desire to
join our local public school.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.500
And that's because probably
that's where all the boys were.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.130
But nevertheless, I can
remember to this day

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.580
my father had to register me.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.090
And the school was about
15 minutes from our house.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.420
And with each and
every step we took,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.510
he would reassure me
that I was completely

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.060
throwing my life away.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.830
And it was amazing to me that in
this kind of broken down place

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.900
of a school I met the most
stimulating teachers who really

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.390
had the expertise to bring
out the passion in students

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.430
for math and science.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.860
So I thrived in
that environment.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.920
And my father was
so relieved that he

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.500
built me my own chemistry set.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.400
And he would turn
his head when some

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.960
of the experiments I would do
would go awry, and explode,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.430
and start fires.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.140
And it would be like, it's OK.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.450
It's OK.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.890
And he was just a
wonderful inspiration to me

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.380
and very helpful.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.600
So from that school I went on
to Princeton, and then USC,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.480
and I finally got my
doctorate in what was then

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.940
called Quantitative Analysis.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.910
I believe today it's
called data science.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.220
As well as social psychology.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.210
And the combination of those
two have served me very well

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.860
in my career.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.690
So I finished my graduate
studies on a Friday

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.860
and I started working at Bell
Labs as a Systems Engineer

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.630
the following Monday.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.070
And that was in 1982, and
I haven't stopped yet.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.830
Before I tell you about some of
my professional career stories,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.130
I want to let you know that I
have three lovely young adult

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.420
children.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.920
And they have brought
immense balance to my life.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.630
And most times joy.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.270
Not always, but
they've also been

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.440
the ones that have contributed
to some of the conflicting

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.660
emotions I've experienced
throughout my career,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.720
especially when
they were younger,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.200
about being in a
demanding profession.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.700
It was hard.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.780
And at the same time they
were my primary motivators

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.620
for staying because they
were very interested in,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.180
or maybe I made them
interested, in technology.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.880
And also just in corporate life.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.460
The people that I worked
with became the people

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.680
that they thought
of as my friends.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.790
And they would ask
me, how's Magda,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.320
how Shaker, how is this person?

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.900
Because I was always talking
to them on the phone and they

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.720
would be in the car
with me and whatever.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:55.520
But it was very inspiring to
hear them ask questions, begin

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.170
to want to invent things.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.310
And I guess even
more significant

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:07.370
than that I have not quite
reached one of my major goals

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.960
in life concerning my children,
which is to completely get them

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.710
off my payroll.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:20.660
That has not happened yet,
so I continue to work.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:26.870
But I have tried very
hard throughout my career

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.660
to make them believe
and feel, and it's

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.950
been true, that they are
the center of my life.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.820
So I can compartmentalize a lot.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:42.380
So sometimes I do focus
very strongly on work,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.870
but I've tried to
make them understand

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.060
that there's a priority.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.260
So when I get a
phone call from them,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.020
I will walk out of a meeting.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.250
I learned that from my father
who worked very long hours,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.770
and yet he always
made my sisters

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.310
and I feel like we were
the center of his life.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.910
And that helped a lot.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.780
And then I also had
a department head

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.030
at Bell Labs, my first one,
who also taught me that skill

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.310
and how to do that.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.440
His name was Randy.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.080
And I remember when I
first joined the labs.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.560
Within a few months he took
me to a meeting with him

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.500
and it was with other
senior executives.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.950
And he was going to give
a talk at 3 o'clock.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:33.770
And the meeting went on
and it became 3:15, 3:30.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.690
And then he turned over to
me and whispered and he said,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.930
I'm going to leave.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.980
And so I got up to follow him
and he said, no, you sit here.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.880
And he handed me as charts.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.390
And he said, you're
going to give the talk.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.980
So my heart was thumping.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.640
And I finally, I think
around 4:30, gave the talk

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.340
and I survived.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.030
And the next day I saw
him and it went fine.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.650
It was fine.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.730
But I was very, very nervous
and stressed about it.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.900
And I saw him the next day
and I said, why did you leave?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.830
What happened?

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.570
And he said, I had to go
to my son's baseball game.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.420
And this was before I was
married, before I had children,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.580
and it was like, what?

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.060
And he could see the
puzzlement in my face,

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.830
and he said, Marion,
don't ever, ever, ever

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.170
work for a company
that's going to make

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:38.560
you choose between your
career and your family.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:48.320
And that song and those
words and that whole scenario

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.750
has stayed with me all my life.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.900
And it's really
helped and sometimes

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.770
you really do have
to make a decision,

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.610
and you always hope that
you err on the right side.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.950
But that experience and his
coaching helped me a lot.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.600
And it was maybe 10 years later
where it really came into play

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.770
and I finally understood
what he meant.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.450
Because it seemed ridiculous
to me at the time.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.070
Baseball game?

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.820
I couldn't get it.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.400
But anyway, soon after
I joined Bell Labs,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.200
I was asked to start working
on messaging applications,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.170
and to try to understand
whether or not

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.580
the messaging applications
that we had deployed

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.070
were actually compatible
with each other

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.560
and could interoperate,
or whether or not they

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.920
were on proprietary protocols.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.650
And if they were, then to
come up with a protocol

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.280
so that they could
communicate with each other.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.100
And this was at the
time when we were just

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.510
beginning to grow a certain
market segment where we would

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.180
sell into different
organizations

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.870
of a single
multinational company.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.570
And so it was very
important for there

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.770
to be compatibility among the
products that we were selling.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.940
So I did the investigation
and found out

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.880
that there was very
little compatibility.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.900
And so with a team I
created a protocol,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.000
and then Randy went
about setting up

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.490
a meeting with all the
product managers who

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.730
own these messaging
applications,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.190
as well as their
senior executives,

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.220
so we could reveal
the findings and then

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:45.380
have them deploy new products
with this common protocol.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:51.500
So from my point of view,
that meeting was a disaster.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.530
It was in a very small room.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:00.300
Maybe as big as this
stage to where I am.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.090
And there were maybe, I don't
know, 10 senior executives.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.210
So the room was way too
small for all of us.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.190
And then there were
product managers.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.460
And then it was at the
time when it was all men.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.990
And everyone had on a suit.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.420
A buttoned down suit,
very formal looking.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.260
And there was a
transparency machine.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.960
I don't even know if half
of you know what that was.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.280
But it got so hot in that room.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.600
And so I was the one that was
presenting the findings to them

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.420
and telling them
about their products.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.900
And as I went on, it
was very clear to me

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.740
that the product managers
were getting extremely

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.590
agitated and embarrassed.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.820
And they expressed
that embarrassment

00:13:52.820 --> 00:14:00.600
by relentlessly questioning
me, being very suspicious

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.640
about my findings.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.160
Some of them and then
others would say,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.850
well, you know, that's
in our roadmap already.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.530
We knew about it.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.300
This is nothing new.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.900
But their senior
executives were very quiet

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.940
and all their eyes were on
me listening very carefully

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.090
to what I was saying,
and they were not happy.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:29.700
Not with me, but with the people
who had developed the products.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.240
So I just felt mortified
in that meeting

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.240
because they were so attacking,
and they had so much animosity,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.490
and they didn't
know how to express

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.940
their embarrassment
appropriately,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.070
so they took it out on me.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:52.410
So in the end, the meeting
ended and they said,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:58.110
if we do have this problem,
we will adopt a protocol.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.110
So Randy and I left and
we walked down the hallway

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.560
and I was furious
at Randy because I

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.900
felt like he had set me up.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.090
And I had no idea
that they would

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.620
react the way they reacted.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.350
And I was like, why
did you do that?

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:18.450
Now I probably won't even have
a job in a week after this.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.080
And out of the
corner of my eye I

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.500
could see our senior vice
president walking towards us.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.390
He was a very tall,
dignified-looking man,

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.160
and he would walk
like a general.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.770
Like very ramrod straight.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.860
And he was marching towards us.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.710
And it was like,
OK, here it comes.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.640
And he looked at me
and he said, Marion,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.270
I am so glad that you are here.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.840
And he said, that was
a terrific meeting.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.240
And it shocked me.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.170
And yet at the same time
it also empowered me.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:04.950
Because I felt like, OK,
something can feel really bad,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.980
but you're actually
doing the right thing.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.350
And if you see a company
starting to veer off course

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.290
and you could have
help correct it,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.570
that's going to be appreciated.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.740
And again, that has stayed
with me throughout my career.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.100
It really helped that he
took the time to do that

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.790
and he must have realized
how I felt. But to give me

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.880
that sense of
encouragement has really,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.670
I think, helped me tremendously
throughout my career,

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:43.050
and made people think,
oh no, here she comes.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.650
Because I've been
kind of a chief

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.780
troublemaker from
that moment on.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.580
Soon after that experience
I started working on data

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.560
services and networking.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.940
And that was when 99% of
my colleagues at Bell Labs

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.260
worked on voice communications
and what was called the Core

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.010
Network at the time.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.040
Which was a network
that was designed

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.540
to carry voice traffic because
that's how people communicated.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.599
We picked up the phone
and called each other.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:20.160
And so there was relatively
little data traffic

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.780
going over that network, but
it was an aging infrastructure.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.109
And the technology
had to be replaced,

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.510
and a decision had
been made that it

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.870
was going to be replaced
by a protocol that

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:40.710
was called ATM and the existing
technologies that supported it.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.360
And ATM was a
proprietary protocol.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.050
And it was expensive, but
it was highly resilient

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.870
and had a high quality of
service associated with it.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.970
So at the time it seemed
like it was the right choice.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.250
Now, I was on this
team beginning

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.350
to explore data services and
we became very interested

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.060
in this relatively
new technology

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.070
in terms of its
commercialization called IP.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.400
And that was the
Internet Protocol.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.000
And as we started to
study it and explore it,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.020
it became clear to
us that the internet

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.210
was going to win the day.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.920
It was open.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.360
It was flexible.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.820
It was multimedia.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.660
It was very rich.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.550
It was easy to implement.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.400
And there was a
growing ecosystem

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.900
that was developing around it.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.350
So we did a lot of exploration.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.670
We did a lot of prototyping,
and a lot of invention

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.020
to make it resilient.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.580
Because in all honesty, it
wasn't a resilient protocol.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.370
And we finally
convinced ourselves

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:02.430
that it could be made to carry
mission critical information.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.330
So we had to convince
the senior executives

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:11.580
to turn from what they had
been looking at in terms of ATM

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.800
and reconsider and think
about the internet.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.880
And so we found some
allies in high places.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.210
And through a lot of
blood, sweat, and tears,

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.770
finally convinced the
senior executives at AT&amp;T

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:33.700
to reinvest their multi-billion
dollars from ATM technology

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.880
to the internet.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.320
It was a big, big bet.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.500
And it was at this time that
I realized that I really

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.000
had to change my ways.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.730
Because I was a big denial.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.850
I was a big person--

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.810
a denier, I should say--

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:59.680
where the way that I got through
life was by defense mechanisms

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.100
are useful.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.310
And they serve their purpose.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.710
You just can't use them too
much because then you get

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.870
into some type of pathology.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.850
But if you use them
to serve your purpose,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.250
they can be very helpful.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.120
So my favorite defense
mechanism was denial.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.780
And that just simply meant
that I stayed optimistic,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.940
and I looked for
the best in things,

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:27.970
and I was always optimistic
that things would turn out well.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.890
But I realized at the
time that that was not

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.230
going to serve me well
in this situation.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.920
Because the truth be
told, the internet

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.050
was not quite ready to
accept all the traffic.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.420
And AT&amp;T at the
time was pretty much

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:52.300
the dominant carrier, at least
nationwide, and to some extent

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.320
in the Western world.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.290
So I knew that the internet
was not quite capable enough,

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.530
so what we had to
do once we convinced

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.370
these executives that the
internet was the way to go,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.830
was face the brutal fact
that it wasn't quite ready.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.360
So what we did is decided
to merge the two teams that

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.880
had been vehemently opposed
to each other, the IP

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.440
team and the Voice
Networking team,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.480
and put them into
one organization.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.480
And I would lead
that organization.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.930
And that was like a nightmare.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.830
These teams who are really
quite different from each other.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.290
The IP team was
very fast to market.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.450
Would prototype a lot,
and iterate, iterate,

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.320
iterate, and do very
quick deployments.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.870
Work with friendly
customers who were

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.590
ready to try out
leading edge technology,

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.160
were willing to accept
things that had bugs in them.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.080
And if something worked
once, just put it out, right?

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.460
And so they were a great team.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.210
Very fast and fun to work with.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.970
The Core Networking
team, on the other hand,

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.770
were very methodical.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.260
Very careful.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.910
Tested things
endlessly, making sure

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.690
that things had almost
five nines of reliability

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.950
before they would ever
be released to the field.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.400
Very, very slow
in their approach,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.560
but very good as well.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.790
So these were the two
teams that we had to merge.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:43.090
So we finally, after about two
years of finding the strongest

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.480
people, finding out who
wanted to collaborate

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.440
and who just dug in their heels,
and stayed where they were,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.750
and were unwilling to change.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:57.010
After we got called that
team, so we had the strongest

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.770
members, they
became a dream team.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.450
But it took a couple of
years for that to happen.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.690
They were truly a dream team.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.870
Even when I think back
now across my career

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.370
that was my favorite time.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:17.790
Not the two years to get them
there, but after that period.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.370
And I realized that we all
had to go through that process

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.550
where we had to hold
these conflicting

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:29.740
notions at the same time
that, yes, internet was going

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.720
to win the day and it
was the right thing

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.780
to do to put all the
investment there.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.510
But at the same time
it wasn't ready,

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.720
and it wasn't really resilient,
and it was going to crash,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.790
and we just could
ruin the brand.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.280
So we had to hold those two
facts or those suite of facts

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.600
together at the same time.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.160
So believe me, we worked
really, really hard

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.480
and we did a lot of invention.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.640
And we finally got it to work.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.820
And we finally got it
to work very well, so

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.040
that the services
that we put out,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.310
and we were one of
the first carriers

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:15.250
to actually put out IP services,
and they were up to four,

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.850
sometimes even five
nines of reliability.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:24.280
So it was something that I
feel very pleased with in terms

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.070
of what the team was
able to do and what they

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.040
were able to do so quickly.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.320
And all the inventions
that came out of that.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.950
And I was very happy
that towards the end

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:41.500
of my career I'd say about
95% of AT&amp;T's traffic

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.220
was going over an IP network.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.880
I didn't think it would
ever take that long,

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.885
but it did, and so
I was very happy.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:02.410
I should also mention to you,
you can look more information

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:07.810
up about this, but holding
those two contradictory set

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:13.090
of perceptions is a
very well-known paradox,

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.140
and it's called the
Stockdale paradox.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.760
And it came about
through a person that

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.660
had been a survivor in
Vietnam for a very long time,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.730
and he was able to do that.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.160
And they studied
survivors, and that's

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.690
where that paradox came from.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.900
So you can look it
up and study it.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.730
But very quickly, after
I was able to complete

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:44.900
what I think my mission was
at AT&amp;T, I joined Google.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.430
And that was about
2 and 1/2 years ago,

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.830
and I think I have one of the
most amazing jobs in the world,

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.920
and that's to bring internet
access to the emerging markets.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.490
And as you can
see by this chart,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.980
if you look at the
blue bars, those

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.300
represent the emerging markets.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.350
And there's been
exponential growth

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.800
in those markets in terms of
the amount of connectivity

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.300
that people have.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.020
95% percent of the world,
or 7 billion people,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.239
now live within range
of a cellular network.

00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:18.280
So that's pretty amazing.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.810
And the people that live in
these markets are very vibrant.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:26.800
They're young.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.460
45% are under the age of 25.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.990
They're becoming
increasingly urbanized.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:37.660
90% of the population
growth that's

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.590
predicted to occur in India
will happen in the cities.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.650
And that's a very
important trend

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.480
because people
that live in cities

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.230
are three times as likely
to use smartphones as people

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.510
that live in rural areas.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.410
And so, as you know from what
happened in the United States,

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.740
when you're using a
smart phone, you're

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.630
going to demand
broadband access.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.540
You need broadband
access to really use

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.480
the full capabilities
of a smartphone.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.010
These people are also living in
an immense amount of poverty,

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.730
but beginning to
have an increasing

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.440
amount of disposable income.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.390
So smartphone
penetration is predicted

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:26.890
to be 60% in the next two
to three years growth.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:31.610
60% of growth of the smartphones
in the emerging markets.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.640
So there's still a huge problem
though that needs to be solved.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.360
Despite all the good news and
the amount of connectivity,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.470
there is a huge gap between
the amount of connectivity

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:46.750
that exists and the
number of people

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.670
that can use the internet.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:53.800
Over 50% of the world has
never used the internet.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.060
Never.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:59.920
And even though each region
has its own issues around why

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.740
they're not using the
internet, especially

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.950
if you look at the
red and the green,

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.360
they have some things in common.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.820
One is that typically they have
very low spec phones with very

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.300
limited memory and storage.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.960
Very unstable power sources.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.170
Very expensive data plans.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:27.250
Networks that are
congested and unreliable.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.160
And then finally, sometimes
the content on the internet

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.510
is just not relevant
for these populations.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.420
If you look at Wikipedia,
for example, one fourth

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:43.540
of the content in Wikipedia
is available to Hindi speakers

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:48.220
as to English speakers,
even though Hindi

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.820
is the fourth most spoken
language in the world.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.000
So Google, along with many
of the companies that you

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.500
come from, is working very,
very hard to fix these problems.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.210
And it's magical thinking
to believe that there's

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.390
only one technical
solution that can address

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.720
the immense amount of
population densities

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.050
and geographical terrains
that exist within the emerging

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.290
markets.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:20.200
So we're looking very strongly
to partner with as many people

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.380
and as many governments
as possible to bring

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.220
a range of technologies
and business models

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.750
to address the problem of
internet disparity that

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.370
exists within the world.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.670
And I welcome all of you
to join us in this journey.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.830
So I want to thank you again
for coming on this Saturday.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.290
It's a pleasure to
see you and I hope

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.350
I get a chance to talk to
each and every one of you

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.700
later today.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.600
Thank you.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.250
