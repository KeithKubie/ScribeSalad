00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.200
[music playing]

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.500
- Frank Rolfe?
- Yes.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.533
- Billy Mintz.
- Hi, Billy.

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.667
How are you?

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:09.867
BILLY MINTZ (VOICEOVER):
Frank Rolfe's company

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:11.800
is the fifth largest
owner of mobile home

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.233
parks in the United States.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.200
BILLY MINTZ: Beautiful place.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.033
FRANK ROLFE: Thank
you very much.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:15.834
BILLY MINTZ: Wow.

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:17.467
Show you in here.

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:20.633
Our motto is kind of we provide
a clean, safe, affordable place

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:23.033
to live, just like it is here.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.734
Micro-housing is hot.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.400
You just have a whole lot
of people who just can't

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.033
afford to buy a house today.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:30.867
It's almost
impossible for people.

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:34.000
So we're like, by far,
the least expensive form

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.433
of detached dwelling there is.

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:40.033
I mean, some homes you'll
see are like $2,000

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.233
for the entire home.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:45.266
BILLY MINTZ (VOICEOVER): Here's
how Frank's business works.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.200
He buys old mobile home
parks, makes basic repairs,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.767
gives them a fresh
coat of paint,

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.333
and then puts homes
on the market.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.433
Basically, you're
repositioning properties,

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.300
bringing them back to life.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.667
And everybody's happy.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:01.200
BILLY MINTZ (VOICEOVER):
He owns the land,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.667
so whether he rents out
the homes or sells them,

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:08.967
residents pay a lot fee of
around $250 to $375 per month,

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:11.367
providing Frank with a
steady stream of revenue.

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:13.400
So this is a unit for sale?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.000
It's for sale or rent.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.467
Renting this is $550 a month.

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:21.400
But if you want to buy it,
we'll sell it you for $500.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.867
OK, so hold on a second.

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:24.300
To rent it, it's $550.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.100
Right.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.166
But to buy it, it's less.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.367
Yes.

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:30.767
Then how does it work for
you financially, though?

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:33.233
Well, on paper, it looks
pretty stupid, right?

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:37.166
Because I've poured thousands of
dollars into the house and I'm

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.567
going to take a
loss on this house

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:41.567
of probably $3,000 or $4,000.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.734
But just to have
someone on this lot,

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.867
this lot is worth probably
$30,000 with someone in it

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:50.333
and it's worth nothing
with somebody not in it.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.200
Our big focus is we want
to be in the land business.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.533
Right.

00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:56.133
So we're willing to take
hefty losses on the homes just

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.467
to be in the land business.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:58.834
BILLY MINTZ
(VOICEOVER): It's not

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:00.633
much different from how the
mobile home business started.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:03.667
[music playing]

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.200
During World War II, a slapdash
prototype of mobile homes

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.500
housed soldiers and
factory workers.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.033
After the war ended,
small mom and pop shops

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.934
set out to make the rickety
World War II model a more

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:20.633
permanent, affordable housing
alternative, buying cheap land,

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:22.600
installing homes,
and then charging

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.967
lot fees to the residents.

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:27.800
But the difference was that
these mostly family-owned parks

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.700
usually didn't raise rents.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.767
But after 2007, the
demand for cheap housing

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:38.500
skyrocketed and people like
Frank saw an opportunity.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.633
Our industry has been a
contrarian bet on a poorer

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:43.967
America, and that
bet's been paying off

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:46.467
really big the last
eight years, right?

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:51.533
Whereas our customers are the
$10 to $50 per hour folks,

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.533
there's no other options
out there for those people.
