00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.660
Stigler and His Law of Eponymy

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.090
Back in 1968, one of the fathers of modern
sociology and National Medal of Science award

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.820
winner Robert K. Merton explored the phenomenon
of what he called the “Matthew Effect”

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.190
while writing a paper discussing how seniority
or perceived prestige seemed to be the deciding

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.900
factor in who would be given credit for a
scientific discovery or breakthrough, regardless

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.180
of the actual work put in by those involved.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.790
Merton was inspired to research this idea
while writing a paper about the history and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.520
possible explanations for the common “simultaneous
discovery” phenomenon (two or more scientists

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.800
making an identical breakthrough or discovery
at roughly the same time independently of

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.309
one another) in 1963.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.800
He noted that in almost every case he found,
the more famous scientist inevitably ended

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.820
up being credited with the discovery, regardless
of who was really first and the actual magnitude

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.119
of the contribution they made compared to
the other individual.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.319
Merton decided to dub the phenomenon “The
Matthew Effect” after Matthew 25:29, a Bible

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:17.060
verse which reads: “For to every one that
has shall be given, and he shall have abundance:

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.039
but from him that has not shall be taken away
even that which he has.”

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.319
Just joking, this is actually Steven Stigler,
the other is of Merton...

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.970
Stephen Stigler
Merton explored the concept of the Matthew

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.009
Effect in a paper aptly titled, The Matthew
Effect in Science which was read by, among

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.719
others, statistician, Stephen Stigler who
would eventually end up corresponding with

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.039
Merton over their mutual interest in the field
of sociology.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.719
In 1979, Stigler was asked if he’d like
to contribute an essay for a book dedicated

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.979
to Merton to celebrate Merton’s upcoming
retirement (such books are known in the world

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:46.979
of academia as a “Festschrift”).

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.569
Though he was initially hesitant to contribute
anything as he’d never actually met Merton

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.139
in person, only ever corresponding with him
via letters and occasionally on the phone,

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.369
Stigler read through some of his old papers
and hatched a rather novel idea.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.679
Knowing that Merton had written extensively
on the concept of misapplied credit in the

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.709
scientific world and that, as Merton had previously
coined the term “self-fulfilling prophecy”

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.569
in his 1948 paper of the same name, he had
a particular fondness for examples of rules

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.470
which proved themselves, Stigler decided to
pen a paper that incorporated both concepts.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.390
The result was Stigler’s Law of Eponymy,
a 10 page essay more or less explicitly copying

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.430
Merton’s previous work exploring the history
of misapplied eponymic rewards.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.659
In this paper, Stigler defined “his” law
as: “No scientific discovery is named after

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.409
its original discoverer”.

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.290
Presumably for anyone who didn’t get the
joke, the paper included a disclaimer in the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.290
abstract, stating:

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.760
I have chosen as a title for this paper, and
for the thesis I wish to present and discuss,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.459
“Stigler’s Law of Eponymy.”

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.790
At first glance this may appear to be a flagrant
violation of the “Institutional Norm of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.829
Humility,” and since statisticians are even
more aware of the importance of norms than

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.110
are members of other disciplines, I hasten
to add a humble disclaimer.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.670
If there is an idea presented here that is
not at least implicit in Merton’s The Sociology

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.989
of Science, it is either a happy accident
or a likely error.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.330
Luckily for Stigler, the joke didn’t fall
flat.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.609
Stigler’s Law was not only seen as a genuine,
touching tribute to a man who had made remarkable

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.670
contributions to his field, but the “law”
itself fell into general use, being cited

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.409
in over a hundred academic papers since Stigler’s
little tribute.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.909
But that’s not the end of the story.

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.719
Unbeknownst to Stigler, before his summation
of a portion of Merton’s work in a single

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:44.290
sentence, an almost identical sentiment to
Stigler’s Law had already independently

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.910
been expressed by a mathematician called Hubert
Kennedy in 1972, ironically enough around

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.829
the same time Merton was exploring the subject
and a year before his The Sociology of Science

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:55.829
was published.

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.900
Specifically, Kennedy asserted that: “Mathematical
formulas and theorems are usually not named

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.099
after their original discoverers”.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.400
Kennedy dubbed this declaration “Boyer’s
Law” in his paper on the subject, Who Discovered

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.340
Boyer’s Law?, published in the January of
1972 edition of The American Mathematical

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.340
Monthly.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.600
The “Boyer” he’s referencing here is
mathematical historian Carl Boyer, who had

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.110
himself noted a number of instances of this
phenomenon in his 1968 book, A History of

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.110
Mathematics.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.750
Specifically, Kennedy stated, in part,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.060
Boyer, in his recent text, A History of Mathematics,
has observed: “Clio, the muse of history,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.870
often is fickle in the matter of attaching
names to theorems!”

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.169
… The observation that theorems are not
named after their original discoverers is

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.430
amply supported in his book, where some thirty
such cases are explicitly mentioned in Chapters

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.620
18 through 24….

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.180
Examples here are both the Maclaurin and Taylor
Series, Picard’s Method, and De Morgan’s

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.420
rules in logic…

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.780
To conclude his little article, Kennedy stated
of his decision to name this proposed law

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.880
after Boyer,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.699
It is perhaps interesting to note that this
is probably a rare instance of a law whose

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.360
statement confirms its own validity!

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.350
To make sure we’re all the same page: Stigler’s
Law, which explicitly posits that the original

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.090
creator of an idea never gets credit for it,
a notion previously studied by Merton, was

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.310
named after the wrong person (Stigler) on
purpose and credited to someone else (Merton)

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.330
so that it was a proof of itself.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.509
And around the same time Merton had been exploring
the idea and about a decade before Stigler’s

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.180
Law was so named, a mathematician (Kennedy),
independently put forth more or less the same

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.360
law he also purposefully ironically named
after the first scientist he knew about that

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.129
had popularly noted this misattribution phenomenon
in academia (Boyer).

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.759
So, not once, but twice, Stigler’s Law became
proof of itself, while simultaneously Merton’s

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.240
Matthew Effect, which helped inspire it, is
on full display in the ordeal.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.250
Of course, before any of them, famed mathematician
and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, co-author

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.650
of the enormously influential Principia Mathematica,
noted in a lecture he gave to the British

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.639
Association for the Advancement of Science
in September of 1916, “Everything of importance

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:26.689
has been said before by somebody who did not
discover it.”
