[A SWOOSHING SOUND]

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.420
NARRATOR: Selfies--
we're obsessed with them.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.760
I thought I'd seen them all,
until I came across this one--

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.210
the orange jumpsuit,
the space helmet,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.790
and the rocket-like capsule.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.100
But how exactly
did this guy manage

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.200
to take a photo of himself
on the edge of space?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.726
His selfie game is
on another level.

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.152
Imagine looking out the
window and seeing this view.

00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:31.857
That's what this man was
lucky enough to witness.

00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:34.200
CHRISTOPHER MICHEL: Hi, my
name is Christopher Michel.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.750
I'm from San
Francisco, Californian,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.020
and I'm a photographer.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.080
This photo was taken by me
above northern California

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.866
in the backseat of U-2 spy
plane with a GoPro camera.

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.740
NARRATOR: U-2 spy planes
have been in service

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.050
since the 1950s, which is a
testament to the aircraft's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900
designer, Kelly Johnson.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.320
Christopher got his
opportunity to fly one

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.380
while reporting for
the US Naval Institute

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.420
on Johnson and the
aircraft he designed.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.190
Christopher's pilot that day
was Lieutenant Colonel Joe

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.010
Santucci.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.150
Before takeoff, both men went
through lengthy medical exams

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.650
and had their suits
pressure tested

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.525
to ensure that their
core temperatures didn't

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:09.610
rise too quickly.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.320
Christopher was nervous
about the flight,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.240
but he didn't realize
how unique the scene was

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.592
going to be until he took off.

00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:17.946
[MUSIC PLAYING AND SOUND OF
 PLANE TAKING OFF]

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:19.320
CHRISTOPHER MICHEL:
It was really

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.400
one of the very best
experiences of my life--

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.660
unusual to the extent
that I'm wearing

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.080
a spacesuit, unusual to the
extent that the airplane was

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.365
followed by [? Camaro ?] on
the runway giving commands

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:32.660
to the pilot,
unusual to the extent

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.260
that half the landing gear drops
away at takeoff to save weight.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.450
I never felt sick.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.060
I only felt wonder as the
airplane lifted nose-up,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.814
and we went straight
up to 70,000 feet.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.480
NARRATOR: At that
altitude, temperatures

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.509
can drop to 70 below
[? zero. ?] Christopher

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.050
noticed that the
glass in the cockpit

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.770
was starting to freeze over.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.575
But luckily, the ice
didn't block the view.

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:57.450
CHRISTOPHER MICHEL: A
highlight of the flight

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.100
for me was when Joe Santucci
suggested that we turn off

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.380
air traffic control-- or
at least turn it down--

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.680
and it got very quiet
in the aircraft.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.650
Really, in the spacesuit,
it was definitely quiet.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.780
And I could look up to
the blackness of sky

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.700
and down to the blue,
curved Earth below

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.482
and really have a moment
of wonder and awe.

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:25.940
NARRATOR: All too
soon, it was time

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.020
to come back down to Earth,
which with a U-2 spy plane

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.980
is a bit of a daunting prospect.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.980
It takes a skilled
pilot like Santucci

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.850
to land the U-2, which has
to stall over the runway

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.230
before it touches down.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.670
CHRISTOPHER MICHEL:
The Air Force,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.090
like the pros that they
are, met us with champagne

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.820
to congratulate having
reached that altitude.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.595
But I realized that one of the
best moments of my entire life

00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:51.130
had just come to an end.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.970
It probably was my
astronaut moment,

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.927
although I wasn't an astronaut.

00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:58.260
And it's probably going to
be as close as I'll ever get.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.750
NARRATOR: This series is all
about sharing compelling photos

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.150
and the stories behind them.

Happened Here"
