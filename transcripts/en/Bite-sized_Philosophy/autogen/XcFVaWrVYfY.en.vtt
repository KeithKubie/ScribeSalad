00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.389
 Pray and you will be given; Seek and you shall find; 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.648
 is correct and you will be opened. For everyone who prays receives. and he who seeks finds; 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.260
 and he who is right will be opened. 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.760
 That sounds pretty omitimistic again. But... 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.500
 Again, I think it is a description of existential reality and by that I mean ... 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.309
 When I am in my clinic and I observe - and this is also the case with my students - I say ... 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.940
 life is often not what people would like it to be. Then you ask, "Why?" 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 Forget about accident and catastrophes 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.180
 because that is pretty clear and we are not going to talk about that. Although, to what extent you take care of your own accident 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.080
 always indefinite, but I would never say that every terrible thing that happens to someone is something 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 what they deserve. I think that's a very dangerous one 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.380
 assumption is. Especially because everyone gets sick and everyone dies. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.980
 But one of the main reasons that people don't get what they want is that they don't figure out what that is. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.720
 And the chance that you get what would be good for you, 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.188
 let me say, what would actually be better than what you want, right? Because, maybe you are wrong what you want, 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.960
 very likely indeed. But maybe you could get what really would be good for you. 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.380
 Well, why wouldn't you do that? Because you are not trying. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880
 You don't think, "OK, 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.220
 this is what i would like if i could have it. 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.980
 And, I don't mean ... 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.440
 I don't mean in a way that you manipulate the world into delivery 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.740
 of products of status or something. That is not what I mean. I mean something like ... 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.540
 Imagine if you would take care of yourself as you would care for someone you care about and you thought, "Okay, 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.140
 I take care of this person, I would like it if everything went as well as possible for them 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 What should their life be like so that it was? 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 Well, people don't do that. They don't sit down and think, "Okay, let me figure it out!" You have a life, 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.219
 it is difficult. 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.899
 of course! It's so... 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.988
 In three years you can have what you need. 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.290
 You have to be careful with it 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.360
 you can't have everything. You can have what would be good for you, but you have to figure out what that is, 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.820
 and then you have to aim for it. 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.860
 Well, my experience with people is that if they figure out what it is that would be good for them and they aim 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.989
 then they get it. And it's weird because 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.980
 it's a strange thing, it's not that simple. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 Because, for example, you may formulate 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080
 an idea about what would be good for you 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.069
 and then you take ten steps to that end and you see that your formulation was not entirely correct. 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.750
 And then you have to reformulate your goal. 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.559
 You go a bit like that while moving towards your goal. 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.910
 But one big reason people fail is that they are the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280
 never set criteria for success. 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.240
 And so, because success is such a narrow line and very unlikely, the chance that you will stumble over it randomly 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.560
 is zero! 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.440
 And so there is a suggestion here and the suggestion is: "If you really want something, 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 then you can have it! " 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.640
 The question then is: "What do you mean by really wanting?" 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.500
 And the answer is that you re-orientate yourself in every possible way, 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.100
 so that the chance that that happens is as certain as possible. 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.660
 And that's an idea of â€‹â€‹offering, right? It is so: you do not get everything. 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.240
 Of course not. 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.040
 Of course not. But maybe you can have what you need and maybe all you have to do to get it is to ask. 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.040
 But asking is not, 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.060
 a flurry or today's wish. 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.540
 You have to be dead serious about it. You have to think: "Okay, I'm going to make an inventory of myself 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.589
 and if I would live suitably in the world and set myself up like that 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.180
 so that existence would justify itself - in my opinion - and I do not mean as a merciless judge, 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.920
 what exactly is it that i would aim for? " 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.100
 Well, one of the things that I found was that ... 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.960
 To test this theory, 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.160
 you could try this. This is a form of prayer - knocking - sit down on your bed one day and ask yourself: 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.180
 What is - what incredibly stupid things I do regularly 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.660
 to completely ruin my life? " 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.969
 And if you actually ask yourself that question - 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.569
 You must want to know the answer, right. Because that is what asking the question actually means. 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.860
 It doesn't just mean saying the words, it means you have to decide that you want to know. 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.200
 You will find out so quickly that you will be amazed. 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.120
 It's like... 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.460
 Jung thought about this, he thought people had two poles of consciousness. 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.040
 One was the consciousness of the individual with whom we all identify with. 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680
 And the other was something he called [the Self] and the Self is the ... 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.780
 You can see it as the divine within. That is a great approach. 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.759
 It is the universal part of your consciousness. It is your conscience. You can see it that way. 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.600
 Whatever your conscience may be. But it is something you can consult, it is like the daimon of Socrates. 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.900
 Socrates said it was what made him different from the rest of Greece 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.740
 was that he consulted his inner daimon, his genius. 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.300
 He asked himself how it was exactly that he had to behave 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.340
 and then he did that! Whatever it was! He did not try to force a solution. 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.409
 he did not try to force a solution in a selfish way. He asked: 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:38.260
 "I am going to manifest myself in the best possible way in the world, I would like that, 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.460
 what would that be?" 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.040
 Well, you are perfectly capable of thinking. God knows how! You are perfectly capable of ... 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.720
 huge trips of imagination and dreams and fantasies. God knows how to do that. 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.189
 What would happen if you consult yourself about the best possible outcome for you. Maybe you will get an answer! 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.860
 That is this idea.
