CHRIS BROADFOOT: So,
hi, everyone.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.930
Welcome to a Google Maps
Developers' Hangout.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.580
We're live from the
Sydney studio.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.230
And this week we have Paul
Saxman joining us from

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.760
Mountain View, isn't he?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.080
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.239
Yeah, this is kind of a rare
occasion for me to be down in

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.160
Sydney, but it's a lot of fun.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.670
The winter down here is
not so bad, is it?

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.720
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
it's lovely.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.755
PAUL SAXMAN: I think the summer
in Mountain View has

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.630
been about the same as
the winter down here.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.960
So looking forward to coming
down in the summer.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.470
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.780
PAUL SAXMAN: So we have a
few topics this week.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.620
So the big one is, we're going
to cover some of the maps that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.540
we really like.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.130
And these are new ones that
we haven't necessarily

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.170
highlighted before, so we can
give you kind of a preview of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.310
some of the things that we're
looking at recently.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.900
And then, we have covering the
sources, places that you can

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.360
go for inspiration if you're
looking for maps to kind of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.450
get some ideas from.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.620
And these are other places
around the web where people

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.060
are actually highlighting apps
or map-based apps as well.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.980
And last, actually I have
that around backwards.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.180
We're going to talk about the
places to go for inspiration,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.995
the maps that we like, and--

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:23.130
CHRIS BROADFOOT: How
we find them.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.700
PAUL SAXMAN: How we find them.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.220
There we go.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.410
So with that.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.200
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, so
we're going to start by,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.430
Paul's going to screenshare.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.050
So if I switch over there,
this is sort of how we

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.590
showcase some of the interesting
maps that we find.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.880
So maybe zoom in actually.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910
PAUL SAXMAN: Sure.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.460
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this is
the showcase on the Google

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.030
Developers website, so
developers.google.com/showcase.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.990
And if you drop down the filter,
you can filter maps,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.130
mashups, or you can look at any
of the other Google APIs.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.022
So if we switch over to
geo, under Products.

00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:07.410
PAUL SAXMAN: There we go.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.440
No wait a minute.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.090
There we are.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.440
So there are 181 geo websites.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.410
And the nice thing about
this too is it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.380
allows multiple selection.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.380
So as long as you select one
of the products, you can

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.310
actually narrow down.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.710
So you can say I just want geo
apps that have travel or that

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.090
are crime-based.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.340
That'd be interesting.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.740
One other things that's really
nice about this too, if you

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.020
look on the right-hand side here
under the Other section,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.340
you see the Street View API.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.790
Another really important one is
custom tile, styled maps,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.450
and Places API.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.570
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Let's look
at the Places API.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.020
Let's see what we have there.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.920
PAUL SAXMAN: So once you do your
filter, this is zoomed in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.760
pretty heavily right now, so
you usually can see the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.900
filters and the sites
at the same time.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.330
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Oh, we're
missing my favorite Places API

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.300
app, the Map of the Dead.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.970
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, there happens
to be a request in to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.220
get that added.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.810
Why don't we go there now?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.400
So I'd have to double
check and see.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.960
We'll go there once we start
looking at some websites.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.820
So this is where we actually
kind of highlight the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.270
applications that
we really like.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.130
So if you guys, A, if you're
looking for inspiration, this

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.100
is a great place to go.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.990
But B, a lot of developers ask
us, how can we get in this

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.290
place or get in the showcase?

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.930
And kind of the short answer is
that if you build a great

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.380
app, something that kind of
map-centric is kind of what we

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.710
like to say.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.530
If you look at a lot of these
websites that we'll feature

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.490
today, the map is the key
feature of the website.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.050
The other thing is kind of
mashups using multiple

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.120
technologies on using the map
with, for example, the places

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.040
API or having a map with the
Street View or even Street

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.640
View with places.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.760
I mean, that might
be interest.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.480
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And even
other non-Google APIs or

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.112
non-Google content
is great as well.

00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:17.630
But yeah, definitely looking at
less commonly used features

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.104
but the more exciting ones--
like Styled Maps, for example,

00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:22.370
is one of my favorites.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.700
So if you've got a really nice
style that suits the content

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.630
of your website, then it sort
of creates more compelling

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.270
user interface and consequently
grabs our

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.120
attention whenever we see
a nice Styled Map.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.610
Like the ones Paul's showing
now, it sort of just grabs us.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.895
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah and when you
look at these, like I was

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:46.800
saying before, they're really
kind of map-centric, the map

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.280
is kind of a key component.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.750
Not to say that we will only
feature applications or web

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.670
apps that put the map right
in the center, but--

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.190
Old Maps Online is
already in there.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.470
That's great.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.720
But yeah, this is--

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.480
So not only do you have to have
a really good app, but

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.860
you also have to let
us know about it.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.250
So probably the easiest
way to do that is via

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.580
Google+, I'd say.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.740
Join our Hangouts.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.940
So this is kind of an
opportunity today, if we get

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.280
some people actually sharing
some of their favorite sites.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.540
We'll maybe do this again, if
this is a popular thing.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.700
We can also--

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.690
CHRIS BROADFOOT: We'll maybe
review some maps as well.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.500
So if you have a map that you've
made recently, and you

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.070
want some advice or how to
improve it, then yeah I think

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.320
that might be another good thing
to have on the Hangouts.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.020
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.350
So join our Hangouts, let us
know what you're working on,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.410
and/or reach out to Google+.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.065
These are all great ways
to kind of get

00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:52.500
your apps in scope.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.410
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So we also
showcase apps on our Geo

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.600
Developer Blog via the Map of
the Week post, which I think

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.480
goes out on-- is it Friday?

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.630
PAUL SAXMAN: Uh, kind of
the middle of the week.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.700
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
Mid-week, yup.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.012
So if I switch over there.

00:06:09.012 --> 00:06:10.170
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, let me
zoom in this guy here.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.290
So the Geo Developers Blog--

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.070
so blogspot.com, or
geodevelopers.blogspot.com--

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.270
lot of different information
here, hopefully you

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.020
guys have seen this.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.900
But we talk about--

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.600
for example, here we're talking
about the Google

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.130
Places API developer challenge,
which is something

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.850
that we're running right now
to raise awareness of the

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.040
Google Places API and give
developers a chance to

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.170
contribute to their community.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.110
But then we talk about a lot
of different things here.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.890
For example, this is an entry on
the ad units, new ad unit.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.270
So here's some--

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.178
Mano's--

00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:56.780
CHRIS BROADFOOT: What does
he call it, Fab Friday?

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.440
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yup.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.910
So he covers basically stuff
that's going on over the week.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.920
Here's my new thumbnail, if you
haven't checked that out.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.040
Yeah, and then--

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.890
CHRIS BROADFOOT: There's me--

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.710
oh, and Marcelo.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.820
There's an interview between
me and Marcelo, who's down

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.100
here joining us.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.190
Marcelo's the tech lead
for the Places API.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.250
PAUL SAXMAN: And we'll try to
have Marcelo on again for an

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.430
event in a week or two.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.210
But if you scroll through here
or just search, eventually

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.070
you'll get to the Map
of the Weeks.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.900
So every week, we try to post
something here, one of the

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.150
maps that we really like.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.390
We'll put a little bit
of information here.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.150
It's not always--

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.170
I think a couple weeks ago, we
did Runtastic, which is a

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.600
mobile app.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.970
They did something really
innovative with

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.990
Google Earth on mobile.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.910
So we thought it would be great
to highlight that app.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.020
This one is actually the
Volkswagen Street View Quest,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.210
another really interesting
site to check out.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.890
Here's the Runtastic,
Runtastic PRO.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.870
So yeah, another great place for
you to go for inspiration.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.600
Read the blog.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.930
It's not only just the Map
of the Week information.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.810
We post a bunch of stuff on
there, good place to sift

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.670
through to find good sites.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.290
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So what's
your favorite site at the

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.350
moment, Paul?

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.625
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh!

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.540
So this is kind of an
oldie but goodie.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.230
Let's see if I have the
tab open over here.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.590
So this is gta4.net.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.600
So actually I--

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.870
this map is actually in most of
the talks I give, when I'm

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.070
actually talking about
introducing the Maps API to

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.169
developers.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.370
And the reason is there's
a bunch of really cool

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.500
technology in here.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.340
So they're using
custom overlay.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.590
This is their own map of the--

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.030
What is the--

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.250
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Custom tiles.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.640
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, custom tiles.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.933
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I don't know
what's the world called.

00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:55.640
What city?

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.180
PAUL SAXMAN: Liberty City.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.180
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Liberty
City, yeah.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.530
PAUL SAXMAN: So yeah.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.190
So they made custom tiles for
Liberty City, for the

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.110
Liberty City map.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.700
They have a bunch of
great markers.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.130
Actually, I'll just zoom in.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.610
Another great feature too, I
mean you don't have to just

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.290
look at the map embedded
in your site.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.690
So in the center here
we have the map.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.230
But on the right-hand side here
they have all kinds of

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.240
toggles, so you can show
different markers on the map.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.040
They also did custom markers.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.930
They did very custom
info windows.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.310
So if you click on any
of these guys--

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.230
actually, this is a video.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.000
That's kind of interesting.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.470
Stunt jumps, oh that's because
we're looking at stunt jumps.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.100
And the thing that always really
wows people is when you

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.750
grab the little peg man here.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.000
What they did here is they put
custom Street View panoramas

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.980
for pretty much all
over Liberty City.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.260
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
That's amazing.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:48.990
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah usually--

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:55.070
I mean it's kind of a really,
really unique use of the

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.180
Street View API, the Street
View service.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.640
So this must have been
a lot of work.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.740
I really would love to figure
out how they did this,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.240
actually get all this imagery.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.630
But yeah, they basically drove
through all the streets.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.640
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I guess they
had a Street View car drive

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.540
through Liberty City.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.250
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, maybe.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.020
That'd be interesting if you
could mod Grand Theft Auto and

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.620
make like a Google
Street View car.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.080
I think it's a great--

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.642
it not only shows like a
custom map interface--

00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:29.970
there we go, back to here.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.990
Whoops.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.070
There we go, I had to
click that guy.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.330
Custom map interface, so they
have their own tiles.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.360
They've done a really great
job with these markers.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.190
The way they actually styled the
map makes it look like an

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.580
asset of their website.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.020
It doesn't look like a Google
Map necessarily, besides the

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.990
attribution and maybe
these controls.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.450
And then just the--

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.960
kind of to top it all
off-- the Street

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.830
View is really cool.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.440
So what are you thinking,
Chris?

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.110
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Well that's
definitely one map that's

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.740
grabbed my attention
in the past.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.130
A recent favorite of mine--

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.920
actually, I showed it I think
three or four weeks ago--

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.400
was the internet map.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.190
So I actually found this
one via Hacker News.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:21.400
So just go over to the
Hacker News page.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.120
PAUL SAXMAN: I closed it.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.092
CHRIS BROADFOOT: That's OK.

00:11:24.092 --> 00:11:26.080
Well, let's have a look
at the site first.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.960
So for example, if I'm
interested in how big

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.120
google.com is in comparison to
the rest of the web, I just

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.600
hit find google.com.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.880
And there you can see related
sites as well.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.240
So they have some sort of
graph of related sites.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.850
So if I zoomed in, all the
way in, you can see that

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.910
google.com is related to g.co.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.150
True.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.430
So this is a really great
use of custom tiles.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.400
So you've got this almost
infinitely zoom-able map.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.930
I can go all the way into the
smallest sites of the web.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:10.040
And so they've embedded the
labels into the tiles as well,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.530
so that some of the labels hide
as it gets too small.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.480
PAUL SAXMAN: And there's
something, too--

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.170
the color has some meaning
with this map, right?

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.130
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I think it's
the country, like actual

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.540
geographic country.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.750
So this is not a map in the
sense of a geographic--

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.730
as in sort of in relation to the
real world because you can

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:38.020
see that as we zoom out, we've
got sort of the biggest sites

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.570
around here.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.550
And as we--

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.720
the US sites over there.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.910
And then these are all the
Chinese sites in yellow.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.700
PAUL SAXMAN: And then there's
some trick too

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.180
with kind of the--

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:57.940
like how they're packed, where
they're positioned.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.910
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So related
sites are near each other.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.880
So we might--

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.530
as we zoom in here, you can see
appspot.com, which is a

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:07.800
Google domain.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.900
And I'm guessing as we zoom
in, these might be sites

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.590
hosted on App Engine or
related to App Engine.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.540
So--

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:16.890
PAUL SAXMAN: AppNexus.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:21.130
--there's no real
way we can tell.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.190
PAUL SAXMAN: I think if I hadn't
closed the Hacker News,

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.860
I think people put some
really good insights.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.720
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, so he
also put up a really great

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.380
blog about how he
created the map.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.610
This is some updates here.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.370
And I think this is about
how it's architected.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.270
So this is a really great post
to look at if you want to do

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.870
something similar, using
custom tiles.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.545
He's just customized the map
completely, which I think is

00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:53.760
really interesting.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.370
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.920
So kind of with the
exception of the

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.430
controls, it doesn't even--

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.490
you can't even tell
it's a Google Map.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.000
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.270
PAUL SAXMAN: You're not even
using the Google Maps API.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.900
Yeah, I remember when
this one came out.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.380
This was kind of a phenomenon.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.630
I mean, it still is.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.880
It's a really interesting
project.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.605
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So I can find
the Hacker News post.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.020
This is not it.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.660
So yeah, this is one way that
we find interesting maps.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.240
I read Hacker News
occasionally.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.620
So from time to time--

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.730
that's not it.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.280
From time to time, an
interesting Maps API

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.240
site will come up.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.070
Yeah.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.120
PAUL SAXMAN: Cool.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.930
So yeah, yeah, Hacker News, I
think that's a really cool

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.050
place to go.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.250
We have a bunch of
other sources.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.060
These are the places that
we go to actually find

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.140
applications that we could
potentially feature or sponsor

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.580
in the blog.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.700
Yeah, one to point
out, Pamela Fox.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.560
I mean, she's a former Googler
and former Maps [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:10.940
right?

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.980
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.520
PAUL SAXMAN: And she continues
to carry on the torch.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.055
I mean she posts some really,
really interesting information

00:15:18.055 --> 00:15:21.500
on her blog about using
the Maps APIs

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.720
and building mashups.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.670
I think this one's about using
actually the Places auto

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.280
complete, so you don't have to
have users actually fill in

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.690
their form fields, which
is really nice.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.550
But it's kind of one thing--

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.130
also, nice to point out is if
you build a map, and you can

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.300
actually somehow contribute to
the community, that really

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.670
brings it to our attention
in a big way.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.730
So for example, if you do the
footwork of publishing your

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:55.820
map, and then maybe if it's a
free service, you can publish

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.610
something about, well here's how
we did it or here's how we

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.210
implemented this particular
feature.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.070
So kind of giving back to the
community, which is something

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.030
that we really appreciate.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.150
And it's just a really, really
good way to kind of bring it

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.400
to our attention.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.200
So a few other places that we
actually go to look for sites.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.210
This is the Google Earth blog.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:24.230
This is actually hosted by
a couple of Google Earth

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.240
enthusiasts.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.600
And actually you can find more
about these guys in there

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.900
About page.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.410
But they actually go through--

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.900
it's not just about
Google Earth.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.350
They actually talk about quite a
bit of different Google Maps

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.720
technology and sites they
find appealing.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.350
So I just want to give them
proper credit, if we go to the

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:50.100
About page, and Frank Taylor
and Mickey Mellen.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.690
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Frank has
another really interesting

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.320
blog called the Tahina
Expedition, which is a

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.410
document of him basically
sailing around the world.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:04.579
And he uses Google Earth to
track his progress and add

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.970
photos to the Earth.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.890
And it's really interesting, a
really great use of Google

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.589
Earth as well.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.864
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh yeah,
there we go.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.302
That is a fancy looking ship.

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:15.720
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:22.360
So you can follow his progress
and his intended route.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.740
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, this is
kind of another really

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.890
interesting use of Google
Maps, right?

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.660
It's not a site necessarily
based around the map, like we

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.580
were talking about earlier.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.810
But it's using it for your own
personal information or

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.110
information that you want to
capture in your website, which

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.140
is perfectly valid.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.160
Its something that we definitely
see as a good use

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.140
of the APIs.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.190
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So my favorite
site for finding new

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.870
maps is the Google
Maps Mania blog.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.870
And so this was started
by Mike Pegg, who

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.370
now works at Google.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.970
But it's still updated
very, very often.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.770
Actually, you can see a cross
post from our developer blog

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.940
about the new ad formats.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.740
So some news is posted up, but
there's also some really

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:23.310
awesome apps that Keir finds.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.380
PAUL SAXMAN: "Connect with
musicians on Google Maps."

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.630
That sounds pretty cool.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.560
Yeah so a lot of times I think
that the community can

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.638
actually find and aggregate
these faster than we can.

00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:38.330
Oh, yeah.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.857
This was actually one of the
ones that I was going to call

00:18:40.857 --> 00:18:44.560
out, Blocky, kind
of a fun one.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.340
Yeah, so these guys--

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.260
it's Mike and the current
owner is--

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.340
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Keir Clarke.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:50.960
PAUL SAXMAN: Yup.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.590
So they find just pretty
amazing stuff.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:19:00.910
And so this is definitely
a site worth watching.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.920
So what else have we got?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:13.470
Oh and another one, so this is
actually Carlos, our developer

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.220
marketing lead for the
Google Maps product.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.230
He pointed out the programmable
web as another

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.800
source for digging these up.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.900
And I've used programmable web
quite a bit before, but I

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.850
never really kind of put
two and two together.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.210
So yeah, just if you go to the
API directory, you can sort it

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.550
by popularity.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.770
And Google Maps pops up
right on the top for--

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.870
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I think you can
add your own site to here,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.120
to this site.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.180
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, a lot of
great information here, not

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.210
just about sites that
are using the API.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.660
But you can see here
there's how-tos.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.990
It's a great way to connect
with other developers.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.650
There's 7,000 APIs
sponsored here.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.660
I mean, we're only
looking at one.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.620
Google Maps apparently has
about 2,000 plus mashups.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:08.230
So I come-- oh, there's
360s, 360Cities.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.790
I come here once in a while for
inspiration, just to kind

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.230
of see what's going on.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:19.450
And I don't know, another really
great site to just dig

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.330
around and with, explore maps.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:28.350
So we have a bunch of other maps
I guess we pulled out.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.250
Maybe I'll highlight one
more and then we can--

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:32.710
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Sounds good.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.560
PAUL SAXMAN: --call it a day.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Let's take
a look at Map of the Dead.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.130
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh yeah!

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.910
CHRIS BROADFOOT: That's
a favorite one.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.270
PAUL SAXMAN: I forget about
Map of the Dead.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.680
Yeah, we highlighted that as one
of our Maps of the Week.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.740
For some reason it didn't make
it into our showcase.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.990
But like I said--

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.730
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Hey Marcelo, do
you have any favorite map?

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.520
PAUL SAXMAN: Whoops.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.770
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You might
have to unmute.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.520
MARCELO CAMELO: I would say Map
of the Dead, definitely.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:02.930
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.520
We're on the same page.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.380
MARCELO CAMELO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.630
the Place API.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.260
PAUL SAXMAN: I think we all like
it just because it is a

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.300
good Google technology mashup.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.790
I mean it's not just the map
that they've done a really

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.960
great job styling it.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.550
But also they're using the
Places API to actually--

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.090
in a really unique way, right?

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:29.470
I mean they've built a zombie
apocalypse map, using real

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.410
place information.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.790
But kind of using it in the
context of zombie apocalypse.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.930
CHRIS BROADFOOT: They have
this awesome map style as

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.440
well, highlighting
the danger zones.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.100
So we start to zoom in, we get
an idea of important venues

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.940
that you might need during
the zombie apocalypse--

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.180
so gun stores, grocery
stores, doctors.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:58.010
And then you can sort
of select them or--

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.200
I think, oh, you can't filter.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.050
Yes, just a handy reference.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.890
PAUL SAXMAN: I think the game
is in the works, right?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.540
So this is just the exploratory
map, and then

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.920
they're going to launch a
complete game around this at

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.490
some point.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.410
But--

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.560
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Coming
this summer.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.350
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, I know.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.270
I've been waiting for it.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.030
[LAUGHING]

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.030
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, so it's--

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.240
I guess the thing that I find
really appealing about it is

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.030
again, the map is really part of
their website in a big way.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.910
And it's mostly the style.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.400
It fits their entire theme.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.280
It really feels like
a map of the dead,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.740
just because they've--

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.340
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And so we
actually found out about this

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.170
site because there was
such a traffic surge.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.750
I think it was linked
off a super--

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.640
maybe in the New York Times
or something like that.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.640
So it got a huge hit of traffic,
and subsequently

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.340
Places API was--

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.190
traffic had a noticeable bump.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.970
So we went to find
out what it was.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.000
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.700
Yeah, I guess that's another
way we can find websites.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.830
But that's kind of like,
unfortunately, after the fact.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:19.020
I mean we discover them after
they've hit the popularity.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.270
So we'd love--

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.890
if anybody wants to share maps,
like I said, several

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.200
venues you can--

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.260
Google+, come join
these Hangouts.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.710
With that, actually, we'll make
one quick check and see

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:37.140
if we had anybody post any maps
that they wanted to share

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.735
because we'd love to--

00:23:38.735 --> 00:23:40.400
here's Historypin, another
one we were going

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.200
to highlight today.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.910
But definitely should--

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.840
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Was there
a question on the Google

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.470
Moderator that we
should look at?

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.814
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, let's
go take a look at that.

00:23:49.814 --> 00:23:57.530
Let me go check the Developers
Live site.

00:24:01.052 --> 00:24:05.650
[HUMMING]

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.710
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, I've got
someone wanting to join.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.620
So let me add--

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.070
circle--

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.560
so if you'd like to join,
add us to your circles

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.930
and post on our feed.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:27.272
And we can go and add you to
our circle so you can join.

00:24:27.272 --> 00:24:31.030
PAUL SAXMAN: Yup, that was a
slight oversight when I posted

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.700
the original.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.800
We're doing a Hangout
on air, so--

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.890
when you do actually invite.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.840
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So
[? Mina Minakshi, ?]

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.180
if you'd like to join.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.190
OK, so--

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.860
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, no, we
didn't have any posts.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.040
I mean this is one actually
I posted myself.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.740
We've already highlighted it
I think in the showcase.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.200
It was the Old Maps Online.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Great.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.630
PAUL SAXMAN: So I think
this site's--

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.390
I'd say it's pretty ubiquitous
at this point.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.810
As part of the David--

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.880
well actually, other
way around.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.510
So the David Rumsey Map
Collection is actually one of

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:19.570
the collections actually
featured in this site.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.100
You can actually browse
around the site,

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.130
browse around the map.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.400
Or you can actually
search the map.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.920
You can constrain by year.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.150
And as you're actually searching
the map, it's

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.410
actually bringing up historical
maps related to

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.970
what's in your view port.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.490
So it's really cool.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.370
I mean it's really interesting
because it's new technology

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.130
and old technology.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.810
CHRIS BROADFOOT: They have this
cool map overlay as well,

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:47.945
these sort of grid lines.

00:25:47.945 --> 00:25:50.160
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, it
is really amazing.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.200
I was kind of curious how they
put this together because

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.930
their Google Maps implementation
looks like a

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.190
historical map as well, which
is pretty amazing.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.460
Yeah they have the
meridian lines.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.790
And yeah.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.580
So you see as we zoom in
here, it's actually

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.530
going to pick up--

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.840
I think it's too close--

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.050
pick up new areas for
historical maps.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:24.170
And in the right-hand side here
it actually shows where

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:24.990
the map fits in.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.480
So I can click on this guy--

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.790
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It loads
the map up, right?

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.310
Yeah, there we go.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.030
PAUL SAXMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.750
view this map.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.240
It actually takes you out to a
place where you can explore

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.080
the map by itself.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.690
So yeah.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.960
It's a great way to discover
these historical maps.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.810
But it's also a really nice,
clean implementation of the

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.280
Google Maps API as well.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.400
But yeah, like I said,
this is one of the

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.260
sites in our showcase.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.330
Definitely worth checking out
not only if you're kind of a

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.920
historical map enthusiast, but
also if you want to get

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.990
another feel for different ways
you can style maps or

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.240
integrate maps into
your website.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.490
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Cool.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.880
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.220
So that's it for me.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.310
I mean I have a few in here--

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.600
But--

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.850
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Oh,
that's one of mine.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.780
PAUL SAXMAN: That's one you want
to talk about real quick?

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:18.800
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, it's
not a Google Map,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.570
but it's quite fun.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.460
It's a wind map.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.280
So I think it shows up to
date wind in the US.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.190
I think I found this through
Twitter, there was just some

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.100
people talking about it.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:33.660
Yeah.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.425
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:27:34.425 --> 00:27:36.090
I mean it's fully zoom-able.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.300
It's fully dynamic as well.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.560
I think they're-- whether
they're pulling

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.290
information from the--

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.110
it's actually live
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.310
CHRIS BROADFOOT: USGS,
something like that.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.430
PAUL SAXMAN: So, "Read more
about wind and wind power."

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.170
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
It doesn't say.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.370
PAUL SAXMAN: So I think it's
more designed as kind of an

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:54.930
artistic rendition than actually
an analytical tool.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.990
But actually you can see the
hurricane down here, which is

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.880
pretty amazing.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.970
Yeah so not only is it
beautiful, but it's also

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.610
informative, which
is really neat.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.300
And it is fully zoom-able.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.820
Actually, I couldn't figure
out how to zoom out.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.080
Oh no, it's on the left
here, un-zoom.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.390
But yeah, as you zoom in--

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.480
you can keep zooming in, and
it keeps updating the

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.130
information.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.730
So it looks like
it's actually--

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.610
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Wow.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.430
--updating the display.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.420
Yeah that hurricane's looking
kind of hairy.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.330
So thank god I'm not in New
Orleans at the moment.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.610
MARCELO CAMELO: Well, the whole
map looks a bit hairy.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.990
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.086
[LAUGHING]

00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:36.502
PAUL SAXMAN: Good point.

00:28:36.502 --> 00:28:37.750
[LAUGHING]

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.980
PAUL SAXMAN: So yeah.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.894
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK,
on that bombshell--

00:28:40.894 --> 00:28:43.164
[LAUGHING]

00:28:43.164 --> 00:28:46.110
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK, thanks
for joining us this week.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.520
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah so we'll
be up next week, Google

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.220
Developers Live back
in Mountain View.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.170
Just to give you a preview, I
think we're going to talk

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.610
about crisis maps.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:29:00.590
So I guess the wind map is
a good segue into that.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:06.120
But we'll post the abstract on
Google+ and hope to see you

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.750
guys in about a week.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.960
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And
back to the Sydney

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.094
Office Hours in November.

00:29:11.094 --> 00:29:12.030
PAUL SAXMAN: Yup.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.470
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.720
PAUL SAXMAN: Cheers,
thanks for joining.
