00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.530
Let's do some examples
comparing absolute values.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.470
So let's say we were
to ask ourselves

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.260
how the absolute value of
negative 9, I should say,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.429
how that compares to the
absolute value of-- let

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.970
me think of a good
number-- let's say

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.476
the absolute value
of negative 7.

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:25.100
So let's think about
this a little bit,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.650
and let's think about what
negative 9 looks like,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.784
or where it is on the number
line, where negative 7

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:30.700
is on the number line.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.410
Let's look at what the
absolute values mean,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.124
and then we should probably
be able to do this comparison.

00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:38.040
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.690
One is you could draw
them on the number line.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.570
So if this is 0, if this
is negative 7, and then

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.710
this is negative
9 right over here.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.310
Now, when you take the
absolute value of a number,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.780
you're really saying how
far is that number from 0,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.200
whether it's to the left
or to the right of 0.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.010
So, for example, negative
9 is 9 to the left of 0.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.280
So the absolute value of
negative 9 is exactly 9.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.250
This evaluates to 9,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.260
Negative 7 is exactly
7 to the left of 0.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.140
So the absolute value of
negative 7 is positive 7.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.010
And so if you were
to compare 9 and 7,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.760
this is a little bit
more straightforward.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.124
9 is clearly greater than 7.

00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:31.540
And if you ever get confused
with the greater than or less

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.520
than symbols, just
remember that the symbol

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.690
is larger on the left-hand side.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.600
So that's the greater than side.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.530
If I were to write
this-- and this

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.806
is actually also
a true statement.

00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:43.930
If you took these without
the absolute value signs,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.300
it is also true that negative
9 is less than negative 7.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.851
Notice the smaller side
is on the smaller number.

00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:54.350
And so that's the
interesting thing.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.980
Negative 9 is less
than negative 7,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.990
but their absolute
value, since negative 9

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.040
is further to the left of 0,
it is-- the absolute value

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.230
of negative 9, which
is 9, is greater

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.080
than the absolute
value of negative 7.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.160
Another way to think about it is
if you take the absolute value

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.660
of a number, it's
really just going

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.550
to be the positive
version of that number.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.300
So if you took the absolute
value of 9, that equals 9.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.040
Or the absolute
value of negative 9,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.310
that is also equal to 9.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.810
Well, when you think
of it visually,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.440
that's because both
of these numbers

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.310
are exactly 9 away from 0.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.820
This is 9 to the right of 0,
and this is 9 to the left of 0.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.950
Let's do a few more of these.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.770
So let's say that we wanted to
compare the absolute value of 2

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.760
to the absolute value of 3.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.080
Well, the absolute value
of a positive number

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.600
is just going to
be that same value.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.090
2 is two to the right
of 0, so this is just

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.800
going to evaluate to 2.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.682
And then the
absolute value of 3,

00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:55.140
that's just going
to evaluate to 3.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.220
It's actually pretty
straightforward.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.620
So 2 is clearly the
smaller number here.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.980
And so we clearly
get 2 is less than 3,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.370
or the absolute value
of 2 is less than 3.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.870
So we have a less
than right over here.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.570
Let's say you
wanted to compare--

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.610
I'm trying to find a suitable
color-- the absolute value

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.917
of negative 8 to the
absolute value of 8.

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:20.750
Well, one way to think
about is that they're

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.910
both 8 away from 0.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.410
This 8 to the left of 0.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.940
This is 8 to the right of 0.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.460
So both of these
things evaluate to 8.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.710
Absolute value of
negative 8 is 8.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.930
Absolute value of 8 is 8.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.830
And so, clearly,
8 is equal to 8.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.610
Let me do a couple
more examples.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.620
Let's say I wanted to
compare the absolute value

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.790
of negative 1, and I want to
compare that to positive 2.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.680
So the absolute
value of negative 1

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.260
is just the positive
version of 1,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.120
or it's just the positive
version of negative 1,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.750
which is just 1.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.770
So 1 is clearly less than 2.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.020
Or the other way to think
about it, the absolute value

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.072
of negative 1 is
clearly less than 2.
