00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.038
Yes! Yes, man!

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.773
Thank you very much!

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.775
Welcome to<i> The Nightly Show!</i>

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.778
-Man! What a great crowd today.
-(audience chanting "Larry!")

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.846
Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.049
I appreciate it.
Uh, you guys,

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.384
you got to get together on that
though.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:21.320
'Cause he was like, "Lar-ry!"

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:25.458
He was like,
"Yo, man, it's 'Larry!'"

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.327
Happy International Women's Day
out there to everybody,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.664
I just want to say. Happy
International Women's Day.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.801
Very cool.
Um, and also, you know,

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.536
this is one of those days...
I don't know how to start...

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.704
You know, I'll tell you what,
I just want to take a moment

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:42.208
to acknowledge, um, a loss
in the comedy community.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.010
And, um,
I know this happened last week,

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.746
but it's-it's just taken me
a few days to process.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.415 line:0%
REPORTER:<i> Retired neurosurgeon
 Ben Carson has pulled out</i>

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:51.751 line:0%
<i> of the Republican race.
 Carson announced</i>

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.286 line:0%
<i> that he was suspending
 his campaign</i>

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.055 line:0%
<i> at a gathering in Maryland
 on Friday.</i>

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:59.291
That's right, you guys.

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:04.297
That's right.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.703
Black Droopy the Dog
has officially put his campaign

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.638
to bed.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:18.144
(as Droopy): "Would you believe
I'm suspending my campaign?

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:22.748
"I wanted to be
the real black president.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.385
That's bull(bleep)."

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.755
-(applause) -And, uh...
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:33.426
And although we'll mourn
his sleepy, stabby tirades,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.761
uh, Ben Carson may not
be gone forever, you guys.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:38.097
Technically, he didn't quit--
he suspended his campaign.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.565
I mean, maybe he'll take
another stab at it

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.568
as Kanye's running mate in 2020,
you know?

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.904
Ben-ye 2020, y'all.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.306
That's all I'm sayin'.
That's all I'm sayin'.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.308
But you know what, here's the
thing, it also made me think,

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.644
why do candidates suspend
their campaigns

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.446
instead of just quitting,
anyway?

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.181
I'll tell you what,
to break it down and give us

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:57.783
his expert analysis, here's
rapper 2 Chainz in a segment

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.919
we call 2 Chainz Explainz.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:03.923
WOMAN:

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.892
(cheering and applause)

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.763
Hi. I'm 2 Chainz.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:14.767
And suspending your campaign
is all about the money, Larry.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.770
See, if you suspend
your campaign instead of quit,

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:20.106
you can still raise money
from suckers that don't know

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.775
you dropped out the game.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:25.511
Then the federal government
will give you matching dollars

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.181
for those same funds.
So you can stack your money,

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:31.651
stack your money, and stack your
money until you need a ladder,

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:35.188
and then your campaign
is out of debt.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:39.125
See, as of last month, Wisconsin
Governor Scott Walker's campaign

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.861
still owed vendors $1.2 million.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:45.665
That's half the cost
of my chains, man.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.133
You know how I go.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.068
"All my broads is foreign.

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.737
All my money tall like Jordan."

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.073
You kind of get where I'm going
with this stuff, right?

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.943
-True!
-All right.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.879
This has been 2 Chainz Explainz,
you guys.

new album<i> ColleGrove</i>

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.689
