for about the last 35 years or even
 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.230
for about the last 35 years or even
longer I've been asking students to work

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240
longer I've been asking students to work
 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.379
longer I've been asking students to work
on neighborhoods in New York City to do

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389
on neighborhoods in New York City to do
 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.740
on neighborhoods in New York City to do
research and get out into the city but

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750
research and get out into the city but
 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.690
research and get out into the city but
what happens over the years is you

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700
what happens over the years is you
 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.550
what happens over the years is you
accumulate a filing cabinets full of

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560
accumulate a filing cabinets full of
 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.880
accumulate a filing cabinets full of
information and some are good and some

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890
information and some are good and some
 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.190
information and some are good and some
are not good but almost all are just a

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200
are not good but almost all are just a
 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.780
are not good but almost all are just a
dialogue but between you and the

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790
dialogue but between you and the
 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.830
dialogue but between you and the
students and with the development of the

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840
students and with the development of the
 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.729
students and with the development of the
internet and more sophisticated

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739
internet and more sophisticated
 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.470
internet and more sophisticated
technological tools it becomes possible

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480
technological tools it becomes possible
 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.360
technological tools it becomes possible
to obviously save these and share them

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370
to obviously save these and share them
 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.189
to obviously save these and share them
but I also one of them because we could

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199
but I also one of them because we could
 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.000
but I also one of them because we could
do more and keep them more and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010
do more and keep them more and
 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.169
do more and keep them more and
presumably by putting them on the web

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179
presumably by putting them on the web
 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.910
presumably by putting them on the web
and making them available at least at

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920
and making them available at least at
 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.430
and making them available at least at
some point to a wider audience then they

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440
some point to a wider audience then they
 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.509
some point to a wider audience then they
really need to have a little more

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519
really need to have a little more
 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.189
really need to have a little more
quality to them this project gets them

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199
quality to them this project gets them
 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.989
quality to them this project gets them
to get into neighborhoods that otherwise

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999
to get into neighborhoods that otherwise
 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.969
to get into neighborhoods that otherwise
would never see their people to go to

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979
would never see their people to go to
 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.280
would never see their people to go to
Columbia University and well they know

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290
Columbia University and well they know
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.749
Columbia University and well they know
where the Meatpacking District is then

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759
where the Meatpacking District is then
 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.280
where the Meatpacking District is then
anywhere Greenwich Village is they can

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290
anywhere Greenwich Village is they can
 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.190
anywhere Greenwich Village is they can
get there and then go to Times Square

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200
get there and then go to Times Square
 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.420
get there and then go to Times Square
but they've never been to Brooklyn and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430
but they've never been to Brooklyn and
 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.459
but they've never been to Brooklyn and
the Bronx that might as well be on the

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469
the Bronx that might as well be on the
 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.700
the Bronx that might as well be on the
moon and yet those are part of the city

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710
moon and yet those are part of the city
 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.830
moon and yet those are part of the city
as well and so first of all I'm getting

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840
as well and so first of all I'm getting
 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.929
as well and so first of all I'm getting
them out second of all I think I'm

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939
them out second of all I think I'm
 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.340
them out second of all I think I'm
teaching them a little bit about how

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350
teaching them a little bit about how
 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.630
teaching them a little bit about how
history itself is done that it can be a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640
history itself is done that it can be a
 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.080
history itself is done that it can be a
combination of both interviews and

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090
combination of both interviews and
 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.700
combination of both interviews and
documentary research and then thirdly I

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710
documentary research and then thirdly I
 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.459
documentary research and then thirdly I
think then here's certainly the hope

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469
think then here's certainly the hope
 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.620
think then here's certainly the hope
that we're creating something here at

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630
that we're creating something here at
 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.120
that we're creating something here at
Columbia that has legs that as we refine

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130
Columbia that has legs that as we refine
 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.980
Columbia that has legs that as we refine
it and develop it and spread it out both

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990
it and develop it and spread it out both
 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.800
it and develop it and spread it out both
horizontal on Hera's on tily and make it

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
horizontal on Hera's on tily and make it
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.060
horizontal on Hera's on tily and make it
give it more depth that we can create

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070
give it more depth that we can create
 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.840
give it more depth that we can create
something that's unique that's not done

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
something that's unique that's not done
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.300
something that's unique that's not done
in New York and maybe not be done is not

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310
in New York and maybe not be done is not
 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.599
in New York and maybe not be done is not
done anywhere and that we can then make

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609
done anywhere and that we can then make
 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.819
done anywhere and that we can then make
it available to maybe to the

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829
it available to maybe to the
 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.859
it available to maybe to the
neighborhood itself I mean I think you

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869
neighborhood itself I mean I think you
 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.090
neighborhood itself I mean I think you
know I want to get ahead of myself I'm

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100
know I want to get ahead of myself I'm
 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.010
know I want to get ahead of myself I'm
no expert on this but I think the

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020
no expert on this but I think the
 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.670
no expert on this but I think the
potential for the future is quite large

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
potential for the future is quite large
 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.060
potential for the future is quite large
they know they're not just doing this

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070
they know they're not just doing this
 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.250
they know they're not just doing this
tim is a make-work project just to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
tim is a make-work project just to
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.330
tim is a make-work project just to
satisfy some academic requirement I

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340
satisfy some academic requirement I
 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.290
satisfy some academic requirement I
don't think there's anything wrong with

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300
don't think there's anything wrong with
 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.420
don't think there's anything wrong with
work just for an academic requirement

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
work just for an academic requirement
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.980
work just for an academic requirement
but this goes beyond their this this is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990
but this goes beyond their this this is
 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.700
but this goes beyond their this this is
quite explicitly something where we hope

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710
quite explicitly something where we hope
 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.360
quite explicitly something where we hope
that you will produce something that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370
that you will produce something that
 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.500
that you will produce something that
will be interesting to somebody who

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510
will be interesting to somebody who
 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.780
will be interesting to somebody who
never been to Columbia never been to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790
never been to Columbia never been to
 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.120
never been to Columbia never been to
this class couldn't care less about it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130
this class couldn't care less about it
 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.800
this class couldn't care less about it
but does care about tottenville and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810
but does care about tottenville and
 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.750
but does care about tottenville and
Staten Island or great kills in Staten

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760
Staten Island or great kills in Staten
 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.940
Staten Island or great kills in Staten
Island which otherwise would have been

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
Island which otherwise would have been
 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.920
Island which otherwise would have been
completely ignored by people to Columbia

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930
completely ignored by people to Columbia
 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.680
completely ignored by people to Columbia
so I think I think it's potentially

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690
so I think I think it's potentially
 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.460
so I think I think it's potentially
beneficial in many ways with the help of

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470
beneficial in many ways with the help of
 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.140
beneficial in many ways with the help of
the Center for a new medium teaching and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150
the Center for a new medium teaching and
 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.550
the Center for a new medium teaching and
learning it allows us the possibility

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
learning it allows us the possibility
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.050
learning it allows us the possibility
some of them can do it themselves some

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060
some of them can do it themselves some
 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.400
some of them can do it themselves some
of them need help but to broaden their

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410
of them need help but to broaden their
 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.320
of them need help but to broaden their
presentation by using video clips by

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330
presentation by using video clips by
 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.870
presentation by using video clips by
using photographs that are historic by

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880
using photographs that are historic by
 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.940
using photographs that are historic by
using interviews by making the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950
using interviews by making the
 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.720
using interviews by making the
presentation itself not interactive but

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
presentation itself not interactive but
 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.540
presentation itself not interactive but
more active period and this is something

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550
more active period and this is something
 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.620
more active period and this is something
that you can do obviously on the web

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630
that you can do obviously on the web
 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.330
that you can do obviously on the web
when you can't do it in just traditional

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340
when you can't do it in just traditional
 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.830
when you can't do it in just traditional
written history papers it's not just

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840
written history papers it's not just
 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.390
written history papers it's not just
line the other piece of paper it can be

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400
line the other piece of paper it can be
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.150
line the other piece of paper it can be
visualized and so I think that's two

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160
visualized and so I think that's two
 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
visualized and so I think that's two
different ways to see it and we want

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170
different ways to see it and we want
 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.920
different ways to see it and we want
them to in a sense be measured on both

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930
them to in a sense be measured on both
 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.500
them to in a sense be measured on both
both sides of that be happy but I do

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
both sides of that be happy but I do
 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.810
both sides of that be happy but I do
think that some percentage of those

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820
think that some percentage of those
 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.660
think that some percentage of those
students will be seriously energized by

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670
students will be seriously energized by
 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.250
students will be seriously energized by
this and really really want to take

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260
this and really really want to take
 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.140
this and really really want to take
other people there and really become

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150
other people there and really become
 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.060
other people there and really become
interested in a part of the city in the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070
interested in a part of the city in the
 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.820
interested in a part of the city in the
world that they never thought existed

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830
world that they never thought existed
 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.759
world that they never thought existed
and my larger goal is to it's arrogant

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769
and my larger goal is to it's arrogant
 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.500
and my larger goal is to it's arrogant
to say this but to change the lives of a

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510
to say this but to change the lives of a
 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.140
to say this but to change the lives of a
few people to get them excited about
