00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:02.980
- [Instructor] A 1,900 kilogram truck

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.550
has an initial speed of
12 meters per second.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.440
The driver applies the brakes

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.670
and the truck stops in 3.1 seconds.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.600
What is the best estimate

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.600
of the magnitude of the average
braking force on the truck?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.010
Pause this video, see if
you can work this out.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.900
All right, probably the
simplest way to approach this

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.230
is to say, well we could figure out

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.040
the magnitude of the acceleration,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.280
the average acceleration on that truck

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.640
as it comes to a stop.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.570
And then we could use Newton's second law,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.740
F equals ma

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.740
'cause we know its mass.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.580
And if we know the mass

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.050
and the magnitude of the acceleration,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.120
we could use Newton's second law

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.520
to come up with the magnitude
of the average braking force.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.200
And they just want us to estimate it.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.770
And we can see that these
choices are pretty far apart.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.780
So an estimate will serve us well.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.780
So first let's think
about the acceleration.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.840
The acceleration

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.410
is going to be our change in velocity

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.800
over change in time.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.410
And so that's just going
to be our final velocity

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.270
minus our initial velocity, the numerator.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.460
So our final velocity is
zero meters per second.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.030
We come to a stop.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.660
Minus our initial velocity,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.210
that's 12 meters per second.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.910
And the convention that we'll assume,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.743
and is typical,

00:01:11.743 --> 00:01:13.340
is that if we're moving to
the right, it's positive,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.570
if we're moving to the
left, it's negative.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.070
And so it's moving to the
right at 12 meters per second

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.920
so we're subtracting that
positive velocity out.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.680
So this is our change in velocity

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560
over our change in time.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.750
Well, 3.1 seconds elapses.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.980
So over 3.1 seconds.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.510
And so what is this going to be

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.760
approximately equal to?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.593
Well, let's see.

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.090
Negative 12 over 3.1

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.340
is going to be approximately four.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.130
And once again, I am estimating.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.530
It might be a little bit closer to,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.363
oh, and it's going to be

00:01:45.363 --> 00:01:47.210
approximately equal to negative four.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.710
It might be a little bit
closer to negative 3.9,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.543
around there.

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:52.560
But I'll go with negative four.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.370
And then the units are
meters per second squared.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.140
And now we use Newton's
second law to take this

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.400
to think about the magnitude
of the braking force.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.233
Which is going to be,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.460
and this makes sense that
the acceleration is negative

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.950
that our velocity's in this direction

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.380
but our acceleration is
in the other direction,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.710
it is slowing down.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.870
We're getting lower and
lower and lower velocities.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.130
And so our force is going
to be the same direction,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.530
our net force is in the same
direction as that acceleration.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.950
It's going to be to the left.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.670
So if we had a sign on it,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.940
it would be negative.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.620
But we just care about the magnitude.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.210
So when we think about
Newton's second law,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.070
we'll also just look at the
magnitude of the acceleration.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.130
So Newton's second law,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.120
the magnitude of the force,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.650
needs to be equal to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.900
the mass times the magnitude
of the acceleration.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.490
So this is going to be equal to,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.323
this is,

00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:40.860
let me write an approximation here.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.720
Because I approximated this.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.280
It's going to be
approximately 1,900 kilograms

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.530
times four meters per second squared.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.490
I didn't feel the need to
write the negative there

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.450
'cause I just wanna get the magnitude.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.920
I care about absolute value right now.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.470
So if I do this,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.000
this is going to be approximately what?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.550
7,600 kilograms.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.710
Now if I look at the choices,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.510
I don't see 7,600,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.210
but the closest one over here is 7,400.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.010
And I feel good about that

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.330
because the real value
here might be closer

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.320
to negative 3.9 meters per second squared

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.300
and if this was 3.9 right over here,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.640
3.9 times 1,900,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.370
well that gets us a lot
closer to this right here.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.740
So I like this choice.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.723
And all the other ones are
way off from our estimate.
