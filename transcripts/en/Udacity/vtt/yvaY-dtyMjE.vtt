00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.758
Because this project has multiple classes, I have to select the one that I

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:08.961
want. And now, I can scroll through in the usual way and see the methods of the

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:13.668
rectangle class. But I want to go a little bit above that and here you see a

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:18.520
summary of the constructors. There are two constructors, the first one takes no

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.296
arguments and constructs an empty rectangle. The second one takes four

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:29.342
arguments. And I can click on it, and I get the detailed description of what

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:36.021
each of the arguments are. To construct objects in a Java program, you also use

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:42.130
the new syntax. Let's have a look. Over here, you see a variable whose name is

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.872
box, whose type is rectangle. And the keyword new tells us to make a new

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:54.489
rectangle with these values for the construction. Now you know all the details

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.145
about construcitng objects.
