00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.991
Hey guys,
Tim Ferriss here.

2
00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:04.530
I'm going to show you just a few exercises that I found very helpful for hip and

3
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:08.160
ankle mobility or flexibility because these have been too weak points of mine

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.330
for a very long time.

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
I've had a lot of injuries both in the hips and in the ankles.
My,

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.180
my dorsiflex action on the left is terrible compared to the right.

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.420
So I'll show you what I mean.
If I have checked this out,

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.290
my toes on the same line.
Okay.
And I pushed my knees forward.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.270
You can see that my right knee is probably a good three to four inches ahead of

10
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:34.320
my left and the left feels bone on bone a lot of the time.

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.390
But I'll show you three things that have helped with that end with improving

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
what you might call grumpy baby.
Uh,

13
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.070
I've never been able to do happy baby and yoga,

14
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:48.450
which is effectively what I just showed you.

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.810
So working on that has been extremely important for a number of sports.

16
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:55.710
I'm working on an acrobatics and acro yoga.
So what to do.

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.780
And these were both things that resisted many different attempts previously.

18
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:03.210
So the first thing I'm going to show you is from coach,

19
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.720
summer of gymnastic bodies,
former national team coach for men's gymnastics.

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.200
And that is effectively on,
and there are many different ways to go about this.

21
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:13.560
But first,
let's just say you did 60 calf raises,
okay?

22
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.580
And candidate off and then went down into a position like this and I'll give you

23
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.770
a diagonal can't,
I'm not going to be doing this perfectly.

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.940
You notice that this is kind of out to the side to take out the hip flexor.
Uh,

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.830
and then I'm just stretching the Kellys and calf here.

26
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.940
All right?
And then I would hold this for 60 to 120 seconds.

27
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.690
You should all check out his programming because it's much more sophisticated

28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
and this is from him,
but that is exercise one.
You'd do it on both sides.

29
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.090
Next I'm going to give the ankles a bit of a break and work on the grumpy baby

30
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.220
to happy baby transition.
And this is very simple.

31
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.660
I'm going to be in this type of staggered position.
Okay?

32
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.390
My hips are square,

33
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
so not rotating like this or rotating this way.

34
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:06.600
I'm not in a warrior pose of anytime in my toes are pointing straight ahead.

35
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.320
And uh,
this is very similar to what you might've seen from say a verse Dagon,
uh,

36
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.640
or Eric Cressey does a lot of great work with this type of thing.
Uh,

37
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.170
I'm just going to drop the elbow

38
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.700
and then keeping this like in up whole with my back to get a lot of rotation and

39
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:29.541
just do this perhaps six times going to max depth for a very short half,

40
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:36.090
second or second.
Notice that if one is reasonably easy to do,

41
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.310
I'm going to inch that foot forward.

42
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.290
And then you would repeat on the opposite side.
Same Story.

43
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.610
All right and down.
And then

44
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040
just like that,
not spending a lot of time in these positions,

45
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.080
that's how you end up really,
really sore.

46
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.650
Oftentimes if you are spending a lot of time in those positions,

47
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.180
again refer to coach summer on this,

48
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.040
you're not going to be doing intensive long holds all the time.

49
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.480
You might be doing it once a week,
twice a week.
That's it.
Alright.

50
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.250
So the next move,
that'd be one,

51
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.050
two and covered the Achilles stretch after and gorging the area with blood.

52
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.810
We talked about the,

53
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.320
these sort of grumpy baby happy baby and this one is a caustic squat so nothing

54
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:29.110
has helped my ankle,
dorsiflexion Dorsey flection pulling the foot back,

55
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.110
right that range of motion as much as Cossack squats.

56
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.710
And these were really introduced to me by Pavel Tsatsouline who is very well

57
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.570
known for popularizing kettlebells in the u s among other things.
And uh,

58
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.370
you can do this without weights and you should first,

59
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.530
the key element or one of the key elements for the,

60
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.500
the goals that we have that I discussed

61
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.500
is you want to keep your hips as low as possible as you move from one side to

62
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.600
the other.
Now you can do them with your foot like,

63
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:59.320
so this is going to use the adductors more or you can,

64
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.310
you can flip this one out and get more hamstring.
I tend to do it this way.

65
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.880
And then from here you would just glide across.

66
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.350
I have a lot of trouble keeping my hips low to here.

67
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.890
I can already see that this ankle is more restricted,

68
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.740
I find because of that restriction,

69
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.780
it's counterintuitively perhaps easier when you have some weight to load with

70
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.380
and that is true with pistols.
Oftentimes one legged squats.
Okay,

71
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.440
so if I'm here and get this up just to kind of a goblet hold.

72
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.650
Okay.
Like so I tend to put it right under the Chin and then

73
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.650
just coming across like this and I'll spend a little bit of time just working on

74
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.200
each side.
A few seconds.

75
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.630
Do that six times or so,
dropped the kettle bell,

76
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.770
come on up,
relax.
And that's about it.

77
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.910
The consistency is more important than the intensity or the volume.

78
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.480
And for more on that for more than stretching or highly recommend coach,

79
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:05.050
summer s o m m e r Pavel,
Tsatsouline relaxing to stretch.

80
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.700
But as far as starter kits go,
there are three that I found very,
very helpful.

81
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.410
Hope you enjoyed the video.

82
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.770
If you would like to see my favorite piece of content that I put out every week,

83
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.070
it is a short newsletter,
five bullet Friday.
It's free.

84
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.540
It's five bullet points with the coolest things that I have been finding using

85
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.090
testing and a given week.
I put it out every Friday.

86
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.630
You can digest it in about five minutes.
Take a look.
Five bullet Friday.
