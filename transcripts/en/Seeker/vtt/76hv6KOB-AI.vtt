00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.650
Hey everyone, I know things look a bit different,
but we’ll explain all that at the end, I

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.650
promise.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.929
Way back in 2015, when the world made sense,
NASA’s New Horizon mission flew by the dwarf

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.709
planet, Pluto waay out near the Kuiper Belt
-- an asteroid field that encircles our solar

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:14.709
system.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.890
At the time scientists felt they had this
planet figured out.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.100
Then these images and the accompanying data
from Pluto completely blew their collective

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.199
braincases.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.600
Since 2006 when the International Astronomical
Union updated their classification of the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.790
word “planet” there’s been a huge debate
in the public, and in the scientific community,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.770
about the fate of dwarf planets.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.700
The IAU says a planet has to be a sun-orbiting
body that is massive enough to be round, and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.860
will have cleared its orbit -- meaning nothing
gets in the way as it goes around the sun.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.140
This definition keeps asteroids, comets, and
moons from being planets, but, it excludes

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.530
some smaller bodies (which is why Pluto is
now called a dwarf-planet).

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.880
So now, our solar system has eight planets,
and five dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Eris,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.580
Makemake, and Haumea!

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.440
That’s right, the current definition upgraded
four other objects and yet nobody talks about

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440
it!

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.820
We have 13 planets in our solar system.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.700
“Dwarf” planets aren’t technically planets,
though for some reason “giants,” and “ice

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.700
giants” are.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.950
A new paper purports to change everything
when it comes to planetary classification.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.270
The short paper, published in Lunar and Planetary
Science, wants to reclassify planets as a

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.000
round body that’s never undergone fusion,
and has less mass than a star.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.400
That’s it.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.380
This means, Pluto would be planet again…
which is great!

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.490
But it would also bring along friends; Ceres,
Eris, Makemake and Haumea would become planets

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.430
as well as 97 other objects.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.360
Under this definition, our solar system would
have 110 planets…

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.760
There are several reasons scientists care
about this.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.920
First, the current definition says all planets
have to orbit the sun.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.010
Our sun.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.660
This means, even though we’ve discovered
over 1,000 exoplanets, there are only 8 real

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.710
planets in the universe.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.879
Planets orbiting other stars, aren’t orbiting
the sun and so aren’t technically planets.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.099
Yes, it’s pedantic, this is science we’re
talking about.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.880
Pedantry is part of the game.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.969
On the other hand, both definitions count
being round as important, because it keeps

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.969
asteroids out of the planetary-club.

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.609
But, the front-row students are already pointing
out, the Moon is round.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:26.609
And, yes.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.090
Under this definition our Moon would be a
planet, as would all the round moons of Jupiter

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.620
and Saturn, and elsewhere!

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.980
Defining planets in the way the IAU does now
is quote “flawed,” according to scientist,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.489
not just because it demoted Pluto, but it
also it does seems unfair to discount celestial

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.890
bodies that are as unique and interesting
as Saturn or Venus.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.980
The researchers hope if we start recognizing
Makemake and Ceres and Io and Enceladus all

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.200
as planets, maybe we’ll get the budget to
go there!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.280
This debate really pits branches of science
against each other.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.090
Planetary geoscientists, want to physically
explore the planets, astronomers want to classify

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.529
and observe them.

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:11.609
One of the lead authors of this paper is Alan
Stern, an outspoken critic of the 2006 IAU

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.609
re-classification.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.659
This debate was reignited because of the incredible
data scientists received from Pluto.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.310
Plus, the things we’re learning about moons
like Europa, Enceladus, Titan, Io, and Ganymede.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.090
Pluto, for example, is no longer considered
a boring icy rock zipping around out past

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.150
(but sometimes nearer, than) Neptune.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.180
Instead, we know it has complex geological
processes which may hide a subsurface oceans,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.449
glaciers of nitrogen, a thin atmosphere, and
its solar-planetary interaction is unique

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.620
and unlike the octet of pompous planets in
our solar system!

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.439
But does being more interesting than we thought
warrantPluto's un-demotion?

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.449
What do you think?

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:51.400
By now you may have noticed we’ve made some
changes to both the show and the channel.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.999
And more changes will be happening over the
next couple of weeks.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.329
