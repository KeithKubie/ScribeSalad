you should bloody well pay attention and
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.039
you should bloody well pay attention and
that well the other element of that

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049
that well the other element of that
 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.630
that well the other element of that
that's not expressed in that image is

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640
that's not expressed in that image is
 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.580
that's not expressed in that image is
that you should also speak carefully pay

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
that you should also speak carefully pay
 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.860
that you should also speak carefully pay
attention and speak carefully and then

father and you can keep things
 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.349
father and you can keep things
functioning and that makes you into this

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359
functioning and that makes you into this
 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.099
functioning and that makes you into this
right so the city is always threatened

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109
right so the city is always threatened
 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.690
right so the city is always threatened
it's always corrupt and threatened and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700
it's always corrupt and threatened and
 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.310
it's always corrupt and threatened and
there's always something outside that's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320
there's always something outside that's
 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.800
there's always something outside that's
going to take it down always and that's

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810
going to take it down always and that's
 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.449
going to take it down always and that's
what's represented by the dragon that

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459
what's represented by the dragon that
 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.490
what's represented by the dragon that
little twist in its tail is something

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500
little twist in its tail is something
 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.229
little twist in its tail is something
that represents infinity and the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239
that represents infinity and the
 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.000
that represents infinity and the
courageous individual goes out of the

courageous individual goes out of the
 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.490
courageous individual goes out of the
damaged city to confront the dragon of

damaged city to confront the dragon of
 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.250
damaged city to confront the dragon of
chaos and to gain something valuable as

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260
chaos and to gain something valuable as
 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.530
chaos and to gain something valuable as
a consequence and that's what human

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540
a consequence and that's what human
 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.620
a consequence and that's what human
beings are supposed to do that's our

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630
beings are supposed to do that's our
 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.930
beings are supposed to do that's our
destiny that's our soul that's a better

destiny that's our soul that's a better
 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.699
destiny that's our soul that's a better
way of thinking about it and some of

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709
way of thinking about it and some of
 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.650
way of thinking about it and some of
that terrible dragon is just the

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
that terrible dragon is just the
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.660
that terrible dragon is just the
catastrophe and suffering of life and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670
catastrophe and suffering of life and
 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.640
catastrophe and suffering of life and
our continual attempts to transcendent

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650
our continual attempts to transcendent
 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.349
our continual attempts to transcendent
but a tremendous amount of it is also

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359
but a tremendous amount of it is also
 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.050
but a tremendous amount of it is also
the malevolence and the evil that exists

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060
the malevolence and the evil that exists
 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.479
the malevolence and the evil that exists
in our own hearts and in society and

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489
in our own hearts and in society and
 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.520
in our own hearts and in society and
perhaps to some degree even in the world

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530
perhaps to some degree even in the world
 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.219
perhaps to some degree even in the world
itself you're supposed to wake up and

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229
itself you're supposed to wake up and
 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.990
itself you're supposed to wake up and
strengthen yourself and stand up

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000
strengthen yourself and stand up
 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.539
strengthen yourself and stand up
properly and fortify yourself so that

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549
properly and fortify yourself so that
 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.250
properly and fortify yourself so that
you're a light that can shine in the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260
you're a light that can shine in the
 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.750
you're a light that can shine in the
darkness and that's something that can

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760
darkness and that's something that can
 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.330
darkness and that's something that can
withstand malevolence and tragedy

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340
withstand malevolence and tragedy
 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.120
withstand malevolence and tragedy
and what's your alternative you're gonna

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130
and what's your alternative you're gonna
 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.790
and what's your alternative you're gonna
let life crush you and make you weak and

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800
let life crush you and make you weak and
 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.530
let life crush you and make you weak and
make you resentful and bitter and then

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540
make you resentful and bitter and then
 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.960
make you resentful and bitter and then
murderous you'll take out your rage on

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970
murderous you'll take out your rage on
 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.879
murderous you'll take out your rage on
everyone you can and it'll only be

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889
everyone you can and it'll only be
 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.129
everyone you can and it'll only be
limited by your capacity to obtain power

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139
limited by your capacity to obtain power
 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.980
limited by your capacity to obtain power
that's not a good thing and so it's this

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990
that's not a good thing and so it's this
 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.320
that's not a good thing and so it's this
way or it's this way or a way that leads

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330
way or it's this way or a way that leads
 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.390
way or it's this way or a way that leads
directly to hell and we've certainly

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400
directly to hell and we've certainly
 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.250
directly to hell and we've certainly
seen that plenty of times in the last

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260
seen that plenty of times in the last
 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.290
seen that plenty of times in the last
hundred years and you'd think we might

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300
hundred years and you'd think we might
 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.900
hundred years and you'd think we might
have learned our lesson but it takes a

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910
have learned our lesson but it takes a
 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.270
have learned our lesson but it takes a
lot for people to learn and we're in

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280
lot for people to learn and we're in
 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.010
lot for people to learn and we're in
danger of repeating exactly the same

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020
danger of repeating exactly the same
 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.840
danger of repeating exactly the same
mistakes again

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850
 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.480
so you know it's one thing to complain

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490
so you know it's one thing to complain
 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.340
so you know it's one thing to complain
about the political polarization and

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350
about the political polarization and
 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.050
about the political polarization and
it's another thing to point fingers at

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060
it's another thing to point fingers at
 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.090
it's another thing to point fingers at
the post modernists and the neo-marxist

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100
the post modernists and the neo-marxist
 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.750
the post modernists and the neo-marxist
even though they they roundly deserve it

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760
even though they they roundly deserve it
 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.300
even though they they roundly deserve it
in my estimation it's another thing to

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310
in my estimation it's another thing to
 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.620
in my estimation it's another thing to
try to figure out what the proper

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630
try to figure out what the proper
 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.030
try to figure out what the proper
alternative is and the proper

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040
alternative is and the proper
 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.250
alternative is and the proper
alternative is not in my estimation to

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260
alternative is not in my estimation to
 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.490
alternative is not in my estimation to
contribute to political polarization

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500
contribute to political polarization
 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.050
contribute to political polarization
it's not good and it's not that the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060
it's not good and it's not that the
 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.700
it's not good and it's not that the
radical right is the solution to the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710
radical right is the solution to the
 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.350
radical right is the solution to the
radical left it's just another

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360
radical left it's just another
 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.750
radical left it's just another
catastrophe and the only solution that

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760
catastrophe and the only solution that
 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.460
catastrophe and the only solution that
I've been able to figure out and this is

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470
I've been able to figure out and this is
 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.260
I've been able to figure out and this is
as a consequence of much reading and

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270
as a consequence of much reading and
 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.240
as a consequence of much reading and
much thinking is that it's up to the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250
much thinking is that it's up to the
 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.520
much thinking is that it's up to the
individuals in our society sort

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530
individuals in our society sort
 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.840
individuals in our society sort
themselves out and to strengthen

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850
themselves out and to strengthen
 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.330
themselves out and to strengthen
themselves and to become wise and alert

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340
themselves and to become wise and alert
 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.969
themselves and to become wise and alert
and to shoulder the responsibility of

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979
and to shoulder the responsibility of
 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.580
and to shoulder the responsibility of
being and the demand the ethical demand

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590
being and the demand the ethical demand
 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.350
being and the demand the ethical demand
to push back malevolence in their own

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360
to push back malevolence in their own
 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.570
to push back malevolence in their own
hearts and in their society and I also

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580
hearts and in their society and I also
 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.400
hearts and in their society and I also
believe that you know it's very

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410
believe that you know it's very
 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.020
believe that you know it's very
difficult for people to respect

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030
difficult for people to respect
 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.730
difficult for people to respect
themselves because they're weak and

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740
themselves because they're weak and
 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.159
themselves because they're weak and
vulnerable and pathetic and malevolent

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169
vulnerable and pathetic and malevolent
 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.140
vulnerable and pathetic and malevolent
and so it's no and they're not what they

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150
and so it's no and they're not what they
 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.790
and so it's no and they're not what they
could be and they know it and so it's no

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800
could be and they know it and so it's no
 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.050
could be and they know it and so it's no
wonder that people don't respect

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060
wonder that people don't respect
 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.090
wonder that people don't respect
themselves and some of that's nature and

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100
themselves and some of that's nature and
 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.500
themselves and some of that's nature and
some of that's culture and some of its

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510
some of that's culture and some of its
 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.629
some of that's culture and some of its
individual weakness but one of the

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639
individual weakness but one of the
 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.010
individual weakness but one of the
things that I've learned and it's about

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020
things that I've learned and it's about
 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.629
things that I've learned and it's about
the only optimistic thought I've ever

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639
the only optimistic thought I've ever
 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.700
the only optimistic thought I've ever
come across is that if you have enough

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710
come across is that if you have enough
 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.640
come across is that if you have enough
courage to forthrightly accept the fact

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650
courage to forthrightly accept the fact
 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.350
courage to forthrightly accept the fact
that you're vulnerable and malevolent

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360
that you're vulnerable and malevolent
 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.210
that you're vulnerable and malevolent
and you're willing to do something about

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220
and you're willing to do something about
 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.159
and you're willing to do something about
it to overcome it you can develop enough

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169
it to overcome it you can develop enough
 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.810
it to overcome it you can develop enough
respect for yourself so that the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820
respect for yourself so that the
 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.909
respect for yourself so that the
terrible weight of being will not make

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919
terrible weight of being will not make
 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.640
terrible weight of being will not make
you malevolent and corrupt and I don't

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650
you malevolent and corrupt and I don't
 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.140
you malevolent and corrupt and I don't
think that you have anything better to

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150
think that you have anything better to
 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.760
think that you have anything better to
aim for unless you want blood in the

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770
aim for unless you want blood in the
 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.219
aim for unless you want blood in the
streets in a pathetic life and so you

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229
streets in a pathetic life and so you
 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.920
streets in a pathetic life and so you
might as well straighten up and get your

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930
might as well straighten up and get your
 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.200
might as well straighten up and get your
together and maybe we've got some chance

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210
together and maybe we've got some chance
 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.730
together and maybe we've got some chance
of getting through this intermediary

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740
of getting through this intermediary
 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.159
of getting through this intermediary
period of chaos that we all face and

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169
period of chaos that we all face and
 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.570
period of chaos that we all face and
make something better out of it instead

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580
make something better out of it instead
 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.779
make something better out of it instead
of something worse so that's what I have

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789
of something worse so that's what I have
 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.010
of something worse so that's what I have
to say about that

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020
to say about that
 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.710
to say about that
so thank you

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720
so thank you
 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.479
