00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.860
We just saw several software process models, and there

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.330
are many, many more. And because these process models define

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.330
the master plan for our project, the specific process

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.220
model that we choose has as much influence over a

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.700
project's success as any other major planning decision that

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.610
we make. Therefore, it is very important that we pick

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.100
the appropriate model for our development process. Picking an appropriate

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.100
model can ensure the success of a project. On the

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.830
contrary, if we choose the wrong model, that can be a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.010
constant source of problems and ultimately, it can make the project

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.830
fail. So how can we choose the right model for a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.310
project? To be able to do so, we have to take into

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.490
consideration many factors. In particular, we need to be aware of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.390
what level of understanding we have of the requirements. Do we understand

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.720
all the requirements? Are we going to be able to collect all

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.430
the requirements in advance, or collecting requirements is going to be hard and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.460
therefore, we might want to follow a process that is more flexible

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.470
with that respect. Another important point is the expected lifetime of the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.300
project. Is this a quick project that we are putting together for

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.100
a specific purpose or something that's going to last for for a number

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.910
of years and that we're going to maintain over all those years?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.380
That's going to make a difference in the way we decide to develop

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.190
that project. Also, what is the level of risk involved? Do we

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.530
know the domain very well? Do we know exactly the technologies involved?

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.100
Well, if so, we might go with a more traditional process. Otherwise,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.902
we might want to be more agile, more flexible. It is also

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:24.900
very important to know the schedule constraints. How much time, how many

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.640
resources do we have for this project? What is the expected interaction

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.870
with the management and the customer? In particular for this ladder, there

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.840
are many processes that rely on the fact that there can be

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.310
a continuous interaction with the customer. If that interaction is not there,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.230
there's no way we are going to be able to use these processes.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.580
Conversely, there are processes that don't require the presence of the customer

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.868
at all, except for the initial phase and maybe some checking points and

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:51.020
so if the customer is very inaccessible, we might want to follow

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.740
one of those processes, instead of one of the more demanding ones in

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.340
terms of customer's time. Finally, it is important to take into account

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.450
the level of the expertise of the people involved. Do we have people

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.730
that know the technologies that we're using? Do we know people that

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.590
know a specific kind of process?

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.930
Some processes require some specific expertise and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320
we're not going to be able to follow that process if we don't

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.410
have the right expertise. So we need to take into account all of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.570
these aspects, and sometimes more, in order to be able to make

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.560
the right decision and pick the right software process model for our project.
