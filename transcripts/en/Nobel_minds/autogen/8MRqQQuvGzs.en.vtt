obviously one direction in which it's

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:20.950
obviously one direction in which it's
 

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.870

so now we have a situation which was

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:34.810
so now we have a situation which was
 

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.990

so we have a diagram here showing on the

seen directly it can only be

00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:50.499
seen directly it can only be
 

00:12:50.499 --> 00:12:53.610
seen directly it can only be
reconstructed from its decays from

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:53.620
reconstructed from its decays from
 

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.249
reconstructed from its decays from
traces it lives in particles but

00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:56.259
traces it lives in particles but
 

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:59.100
traces it lives in particles but
particle detectors so from these traces

00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.110
particle detectors so from these traces
 

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.139
particle detectors so from these traces
you can reconstruct the particle mass

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:01.149
you can reconstruct the particle mass
 

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:04.410
you can reconstruct the particle mass
but it is not clear it comes out exactly

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:04.420
but it is not clear it comes out exactly
 

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.389
but it is not clear it comes out exactly
in one point you can get many different

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399
in one point you can get many different
 

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:09.629
in one point you can get many different
masses so on the horizontal Mar on the

00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639
masses so on the horizontal Mar on the
 

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:11.189
masses so on the horizontal Mar on the
horizontal axis you have the

00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199
horizontal axis you have the
 

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:13.889
horizontal axis you have the
reconstructed mass on the vertical axis

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:13.899
reconstructed mass on the vertical axis
 

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:17.340

you have the number of events found at
 

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.879
you have the number of events found at
each mass there is another caveat namely

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:20.889
each mass there is another caveat namely

00:13:26.499 --> 00:13:28.769
Higgs particles they are not the
processes you after and they will be

00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:28.779
processes you after and they will be
 

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:31.679
processes you after and they will be
shown in blue in this diagram so what

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:31.689
shown in blue in this diagram so what
 

00:13:31.689 --> 00:13:35.389
shown in blue in this diagram so what
you are going to look for is a red peak

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399
you are going to look for is a red peak
 

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:38.549
you are going to look for is a red peak
appearing in data against the blue

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:38.559
appearing in data against the blue
 

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:40.980
appearing in data against the blue
background and I'm going to show you how

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:40.990
background and I'm going to show you how
 

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.559
background and I'm going to show you how
the data evolved with time the black

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:43.569
the data evolved with time the black
 

00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:44.580
the data evolved with time the black
points will be die

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:44.590
points will be die
 

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.240
points will be die
and so look for the red peek and try to

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.250
and so look for the red peek and try to
 

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.950
and so look for the red peek and try to
follow the time development so here you

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:52.960
follow the time development so here you
 

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.700
follow the time development so here you
see it comes up as more and more data

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:55.710
see it comes up as more and more data
 

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.290
see it comes up as more and more data
collected you see the blue background

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:58.300
collected you see the blue background
 

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.590
collected you see the blue background
growing fast but also the small red peak

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600
growing fast but also the small red peak
 

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.680
growing fast but also the small red peak
appearing and this is the observation of

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:04.690
appearing and this is the observation of
 

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.190
appearing and this is the observation of
the Higgs particle now this is not the

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:08.200
the Higgs particle now this is not the
 

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.230
the Higgs particle now this is not the
data they had in 2012 now I'm showing

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240

so I think I can stop this this is what

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:27.550
so I think I can stop this this is what
 

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.610
so I think I can stop this this is what
the data looks like we see the red Higgs

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:29.620
the data looks like we see the red Higgs
 

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.560
the data looks like we see the red Higgs
peak on the blue background and so what

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.570
peak on the blue background and so what
 

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.470
peak on the blue background and so what
we have here is the final piece in the

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480
we have here is the final piece in the

there are a few big questions right

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:53.350
there are a few big questions right
 

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.770
there are a few big questions right
first the question which is still not

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:57.780
first the question which is still not
 

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.980
first the question which is still not
solved is whether there is some broken

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:01.990
solved is whether there is some broken
 

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.100
solved is whether there is some broken
supersymmetry which will manifest itself

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.110
supersymmetry which will manifest itself
 

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.030

this is the critical point for what will
 

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.510
this is the critical point for what will
happen but of course there are other

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520
happen but of course there are other
 

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.860
happen but of course there are other
problems like some of them may be

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:19.870
problems like some of them may be
 

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.220

fortune from sting and i would like to
ask you in the late 60s when you worked

00:18:59.140 --> 00:18:59.150
ask you in the late 60s when you worked
 

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.020
ask you in the late 60s when you worked
on the theory did you ever think about

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.030
on the theory did you ever think about
 

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:09.130
on the theory did you ever think about
the discovery of the Higgs boson oh yes

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:09.140
the discovery of the Higgs boson oh yes
 

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.480
the discovery of the Higgs boson oh yes
but the whole thing at that time

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:13.490
but the whole thing at that time
 

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.480
but the whole thing at that time
when first the late 60 is not really

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:16.490
when first the late 60 is not really
 

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.400
when first the late 60 is not really
when the thing was done it was the

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.410
when the thing was done it was the
 

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.300
when the thing was done it was the
beginning of the sixties and 64 it was

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:22.310
beginning of the sixties and 64 it was
 

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.640
beginning of the sixties and 64 it was
published after a lot of thought at that

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:24.650
published after a lot of thought at that
 

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.380
published after a lot of thought at that
time we saw that we're going to solve

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.390
time we saw that we're going to solve
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.520
time we saw that we're going to solve
this way the problem of shortage forces

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:33.530
this way the problem of shortage forces
 

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.440
this way the problem of shortage forces
which was completely and sold in that

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:35.450
which was completely and sold in that
 

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.540
which was completely and sold in that
time and which obviously is related to

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:37.550
time and which obviously is related to
 

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.280
time and which obviously is related to
the problem of the origin of mass so the

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.290
the problem of the origin of mass so the
 

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:46.930
the problem of the origin of mass so the
boson by itself is something that is the

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:46.940
boson by itself is something that is the
 

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.510
boson by itself is something that is the
experimental test of the existence of

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520
experimental test of the existence of
 

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.880
experimental test of the existence of
the whole mechanism and one had to wait

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:53.890
the whole mechanism and one had to wait
 

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.490
the whole mechanism and one had to wait
certainly we had to wait first before

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:56.500
certainly we had to wait first before
 

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.490
certainly we had to wait first before
the theory itself was applied to

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:00.500
the theory itself was applied to
 

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.260
the theory itself was applied to
something which is a standard model

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:02.270
something which is a standard model
 

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.370
something which is a standard model
which took some time it had took some

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:06.380
which took some time it had took some
 

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.100
which took some time it had took some
time to first prove the consistency

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.110
 
 

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:17.530
 
which was 17 during the 17th 7

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:17.540
which was 17 during the 17th 7
 

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.390
which was 17 during the 17th 7
understand that model was better done

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400
understand that model was better done
 

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.440
understand that model was better done
and only after that could one look for a

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:23.450
and only after that could one look for a
 

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.140
and only after that could one look for a
test because the standard model was

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.150
test because the standard model was
 

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.840
test because the standard model was
wonderfully very fine except for the

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:28.850
wonderfully very fine except for the
 

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.420
wonderfully very fine except for the
missing element which was that boson

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:31.430
missing element which was that boson
 

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:41.610
missing element which was that boson

olga Bachner this year's price must have

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680
olga Bachner this year's price must have
 

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.490
olga Bachner this year's price must have
been the most anticipated price in the

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500
been the most anticipated price in the
 

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.150
been the most anticipated price in the
Nobel Prizes history so why did we have

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160
Nobel Prizes history so why did we have
 

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.760
Nobel Prizes history so why did we have
to wait for more than an hour

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:19.770
to wait for more than an hour
 

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.819
to wait for more than an hour
for the press conference oh you have to

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260
day when it is not so there was a
 

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.680
day when it is not so there was a
discussion and there should be a

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:33.690
discussion and there should be a
 

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.349

actually wrote the theory in the 60s

00:35:57.819 --> 00:35:57.829
actually wrote the theory in the 60s
 

00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:01.040
actually wrote the theory in the 60s
1964 so they had to wait even longer for

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.050
1964 so they had to wait even longer for
 

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.280
1964 so they had to wait even longer for
the prize

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.290
the prize
 

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.500

well you know there is a lot of theories

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.510
well you know there is a lot of theories
 

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.900
well you know there is a lot of theories
out there and I'm gonna experimental it

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:08.910
out there and I'm gonna experimental it
 

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.910
out there and I'm gonna experimental it
myself so you have to understand that my

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920
myself so you have to understand that my
 

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.720
myself so you have to understand that my
attitude church theorist is okay so

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:14.730
attitude church theorist is okay so
 

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.490
attitude church theorist is okay so
there's a fear there a lot of theories

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500
there's a fear there a lot of theories
 

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.410
there's a fear there a lot of theories
out there there's a lot of theories out

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420
out there there's a lot of theories out
 

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.950
out there there's a lot of theories out
there but in the end it's the interplay

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960
there but in the end it's the interplay
 

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.839
there but in the end it's the interplay
between experiment and theory which

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:23.849
between experiment and theory which
 

00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:27.470
between experiment and theory which
decides what nature has chosen as the

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480
decides what nature has chosen as the
 

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.500
decides what nature has chosen as the
grand scheme

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:28.510
grand scheme
 

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.800
grand scheme
and so it took 15 years for the

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:31.810
and so it took 15 years for the
 

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.340
and so it took 15 years for the
prediction they made in 1964 to turn out

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:35.350
prediction they made in 1964 to turn out
 

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:39.300
prediction they made in 1964 to turn out
to come true and the thing which makes

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.310
to come true and the thing which makes
 

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.180
to come true and the thing which makes
the prize interesting right now you

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:42.190
the prize interesting right now you
 

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:45.210
the prize interesting right now you
asking why 50 years is because of this

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:45.220
asking why 50 years is because of this
 

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.700
asking why 50 years is because of this
observation of a new particle at CERN

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:47.710
observation of a new particle at CERN
 

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:50.849
observation of a new particle at CERN
where the properties expected them by

00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:50.859
where the properties expected them by
 

00:36:50.859 --> 00:36:53.460
where the properties expected them by
the theory so this is why sometimes I

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:53.470
the theory so this is why sometimes I
 

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.740
the theory so this is why sometimes I
have to wait 50 years and sometimes the

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:55.750
have to wait 50 years and sometimes the
 

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.830
have to wait 50 years and sometimes the
theory may turn out to not be true this

00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:58.840
theory may turn out to not be true this
 

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.270
theory may turn out to not be true this
is this so-called Higgs particle many

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280
is this so-called Higgs particle many
 

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.310
is this so-called Higgs particle many
people have heard about it but why was

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:05.320
people have heard about it but why was
 

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.640
people have heard about it but why was
it so hard together to discover it well

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:10.650
it so hard together to discover it well
 

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:13.859
it so hard together to discover it well
there are several things one thing is

00:37:13.859 --> 00:37:13.869
there are several things one thing is
 

00:37:13.869 --> 00:37:16.740
there are several things one thing is
that the theory predicted that there

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:16.750
that the theory predicted that there
 

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.530
that the theory predicted that there
ought to be a particle it could tell us

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:19.540
ought to be a particle it could tell us
 

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.690
ought to be a particle it could tell us
the properties of this particle so how

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:21.700
the properties of this particle so how
 

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.880
the properties of this particle so how
it interacted with other particles with

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:23.890
it interacted with other particles with
 

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:26.160
it interacted with other particles with
matter particles and force carrier

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.170
matter particles and force carrier
 

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.530
matter particles and force carrier
particles but it couldn't tell us what

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:28.540
particles but it couldn't tell us what
 

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.440
particles but it couldn't tell us what
the mass of this particle was and so we

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:31.450
the mass of this particle was and so we
 

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.400
the mass of this particle was and so we
didn't know where to look and so

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:34.410
didn't know where to look and so
 

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.900
didn't know where to look and so
actually for the past 50 years this

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:36.910
actually for the past 50 years this
 

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.380
actually for the past 50 years this
particle has been looked for at every

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:40.390
particle has been looked for at every
 

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.190
particle has been looked for at every
accelerator in existence so it has been

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200
accelerator in existence so it has been
 

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.200
accelerator in existence so it has been
looked for the eyesore it has been

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.210
looked for the eyesore it has been
 

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.390
looked for the eyesore it has been
looking for the sps at CERN

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400
looking for the sps at CERN
 

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.250
looking for the sps at CERN
at the left Collider at the temperature

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260
at the left Collider at the temperature
 

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.980
at the left Collider at the temperature
this is this was an ongoing harness so

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:55.990
this is this was an ongoing harness so
 

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.700
this is this was an ongoing harness so
from other properties one could try to

00:37:59.700 --> 00:37:59.710
from other properties one could try to
 

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.520
from other properties one could try to
narrow the range of mass and what bit so

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:02.530
narrow the range of mass and what bit so
 

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.800
narrow the range of mass and what bit so
both of them at 11:00 and the Tevatron

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:04.810
both of them at 11:00 and the Tevatron
 

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.710
both of them at 11:00 and the Tevatron
so in the end we knew more or less that

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720
so in the end we knew more or less that
 

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.650
so in the end we knew more or less that
if it existed it had to be bad and then

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:10.660
if it existed it had to be bad and then
 

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.590
if it existed it had to be bad and then
the LHC came in it is the most powerful

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:13.600
the LHC came in it is the most powerful
 

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.470
the LHC came in it is the most powerful
accelerator in existence could produce

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480
accelerator in existence could produce
 

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.190
accelerator in existence could produce
enough energy to make this happen and so

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.200
enough energy to make this happen and so
 

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.140
enough energy to make this happen and so
we found the particle

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.150
we found the particle
 

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.440
we found the particle
where is this person important

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:25.450
where is this person important
 

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.859
where is this person important
well the particle in itself is not as

00:38:28.859 --> 00:38:28.869
well the particle in itself is not as
 

00:38:28.869 --> 00:38:31.170
well the particle in itself is not as
important as the theory which is

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:31.180
important as the theory which is
 

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:36.359
important as the theory which is
represents so the theory tells us why we

00:38:36.359 --> 00:38:36.369
represents so the theory tells us why we
 

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:41.460
represents so the theory tells us why we
exist because as I said in my talk this

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:41.470
exist because as I said in my talk this
 

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.319
exist because as I said in my talk this
is a philosophical question then again

00:38:43.319 --> 00:38:43.329
is a philosophical question then again
 

00:38:43.329 --> 00:38:46.200
is a philosophical question then again
but maybe tells us why we don't float

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:46.210
but maybe tells us why we don't float
 

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.630
but maybe tells us why we don't float
away like the photo I mean we all know

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640
away like the photo I mean we all know
 

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.029
away like the photo I mean we all know
that we are massive we know that we

utilize protons and electrons and
neutrons this is what we consist of but

00:38:59.700 --> 00:38:59.710
neutrons this is what we consist of but

these particles ought to have been

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:05.980
these particles ought to have been
 

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.000
these particles ought to have been
massless and we know that unfortunately

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.010
massless and we know that unfortunately
 

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.620

learner people but definitely not
 

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.170
learner people but definitely not
massless so there is something wrong and

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.180
massless so there is something wrong and
 

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.319

the theory proposed their solution and

00:39:19.319 --> 00:39:19.329
the theory proposed their solution and
 

00:39:19.329 --> 00:39:21.120
the theory proposed their solution and
this is where the theory is important

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:21.130
this is where the theory is important
 

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.069
this is where the theory is important
and the particles is important as a

00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079
and the particles is important as a
 

00:39:23.079 --> 00:39:25.010
and the particles is important as a
manifestation of

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020
manifestation of
 

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.640

so all quarters get the masses from the
 

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:32.109
so all quarters get the masses from the
Higgs field the Higgs field theory and

00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119
Higgs field the Higgs field theory and
 

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:36.740
Higgs field the Higgs field theory and
where does this Higgs particle exist is

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:36.750
where does this Higgs particle exist is
 

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.520
where does this Higgs particle exist is
it here around us where is it well I

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:40.530
it here around us where is it well I
 

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.490
it here around us where is it well I
have to modify this a little bit all

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500
have to modify this a little bit all
 

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:49.040
have to modify this a little bit all
particles that we consist of get mass

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:49.050
particles that we consist of get mass
 

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.650
particles that we consist of get mass
from the Higgs particle they're

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660
from the Higgs particle they're
 

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.109
from the Higgs particle they're
particles which do not seem to interact

00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119
particles which do not seem to interact
 

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:55.880
particles which do not seem to interact
with the Higgs particle names in which

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:55.890
with the Higgs particle names in which
 

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.250
with the Higgs particle names in which
she knows and so the standard model is

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260
she knows and so the standard model is
 

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.000
she knows and so the standard model is
not completely complete there it is

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.010
not completely complete there it is
 

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.190
not completely complete there it is
probably only a low-energy approximation

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200
probably only a low-energy approximation
 

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.260
probably only a low-energy approximation
of something larger which also explains

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:06.270
of something larger which also explains
 

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.359
of something larger which also explains
the mass of the neutrinos which also

00:40:08.359 --> 00:40:08.369
the mass of the neutrinos which also
 

00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:10.640
the mass of the neutrinos which also
explains the dark matter so the moment

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:10.650
explains the dark matter so the moment
 

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.950
explains the dark matter so the moment
we don't know but electrons and protons

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960
we don't know but electrons and protons
 

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.240
we don't know but electrons and protons
and neutrons the quartz inside them get

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:17.250
and neutrons the quartz inside them get
 

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.520
and neutrons the quartz inside them get
masked by interaction interacting with

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:19.530
masked by interaction interacting with
 

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.609
masked by interaction interacting with
the Higgs so one way of looking at is to

00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619
the Higgs so one way of looking at is to
 

00:40:22.619 --> 00:40:25.580
the Higgs so one way of looking at is to
imagine that the Higgs field is

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:25.590
imagine that the Higgs field is
 

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.410
imagine that the Higgs field is
something which pervades all the

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420
something which pervades all the
 

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.980
something which pervades all the
universe it's everywhere it's here in

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:30.990
universe it's everywhere it's here in
 

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.770
universe it's everywhere it's here in
the room it's out in in the black space

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780
the room it's out in in the black space
 

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.480
the room it's out in in the black space
it's everywhere and so every particle

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:37.490
it's everywhere and so every particle
 

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.250
it's everywhere and so every particle
moves through this field and it's forced

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260
moves through this field and it's forced
 

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.750
moves through this field and it's forced
to will interact with the Higgs

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760
to will interact with the Higgs
 

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.130
to will interact with the Higgs
particles in that way yes now all the

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140
particles in that way yes now all the
 

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.050
particles in that way yes now all the

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:59.730
getting their mass through interactions
with means there's also the question why

00:43:59.730 --> 00:43:59.740
with means there's also the question why
 

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.930
with means there's also the question why
the Higgs is so light maybe there are

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:03.940
the Higgs is so light maybe there are
 

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.060
the Higgs is so light maybe there are
more more Higgs particle maybe this is

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:06.070
more more Higgs particle maybe this is
 

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.100
more more Higgs particle maybe this is
just one of them and are more to be

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:08.110
just one of them and are more to be
 

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:08.730
just one of them and are more to be
found

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:08.740
found
 

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.340
found
so today the belief is that the standard

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:11.350
so today the belief is that the standard
 

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.590
so today the belief is that the standard
model is a low-energy approximation of a

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:13.600
model is a low-energy approximation of a
 

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.110
model is a low-energy approximation of a
more complete theory and this whole

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:16.120
more complete theory and this whole
 

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.420
more complete theory and this whole
complete theory is what particle physics

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:18.430
complete theory is what particle physics
 

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.760
complete theory is what particle physics
is after now so there are various

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:20.770
is after now so there are various
 

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.460
is after now so there are various
speculations supersymmetry

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:23.470
speculations supersymmetry
 

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.530
speculations supersymmetry
maybe a possible extension of the

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:25.540
maybe a possible extension of the
 

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.559
maybe a possible extension of the
standard model they're also people

00:44:27.559 --> 00:44:27.569
standard model they're also people
 

00:44:27.569 --> 00:44:33.050
standard model they're also people
speaking of extra dimensions so that our

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060
speaking of extra dimensions so that our
 

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.290
speaking of extra dimensions so that our
four-dimensional world is just what we

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:37.300
four-dimensional world is just what we
 

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.660
four-dimensional world is just what we
perceive of a larger ten dimensional

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:39.670
perceive of a larger ten dimensional
 

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.640
perceive of a larger ten dimensional
worlds and the other dimensions I just

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:41.650
worlds and the other dimensions I just
 

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.800
worlds and the other dimensions I just
tiny rolled up and we don't see them so

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:43.810
tiny rolled up and we don't see them so
 

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.930
tiny rolled up and we don't see them so
there are many speculations out there

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:45.940
there are many speculations out there
 

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.630
there are many speculations out there
and like with the Higgs you know

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640
and like with the Higgs you know
 

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.900
and like with the Higgs you know
experiment will eventually show which

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:51.910
experiment will eventually show which
 

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:56.400
experiment will eventually show which
theory

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:56.410
