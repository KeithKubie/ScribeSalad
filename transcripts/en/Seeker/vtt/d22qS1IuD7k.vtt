00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.410
Right now, you’re looking at a rendering
of a nuclear-powered tunneling robot designed

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.650
to find life on Europa.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.260
Look at that big ol’ alaskan bull worm!

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.790
At the American Geophysical Union’s conference
in December 2018, scientists gathered from

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.780
around the world to present their concepts
for future space missions.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.970
There were dragonfly inspired drones for Titan,
probes designed to take the temperature of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.720
Io’s volcanoes, but perhaps the coolest
of them all, was a tunneling worm robot designed

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.860
to bore through Europa’s icy shell!

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.929
The bot was designed by NASA’s COMPASS team,
a group of engineers tasked with ideating

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.800
system designs for space exploration missions.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.840
And Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, is a prime
target because, well, there might be life

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.840
there.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.859
For years, scientists have suspected Europa
has an iron core, a rocky mantle, and a global

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.879
ocean of liquid water.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.390
And, in 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope observed
possible evidence of plumes of water on Europa’s

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.690
surface, suggesting it’s geologically active.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.679
Scientists even think there could be hydrothermal
vents on its seafloor supporting all kinds

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:03.929
of alien life!

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.799
So obviously we want to go there and take
a swim.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.369
But the oceans lie beneath an estimated 15-25
kilometers of ice, which makes exploring them

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.369
a challenge.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.090
That’s where the tunneling robot comes in.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.670
About 5 meters in length, the robot is covered
with hotplates that would melt the ice during

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.590
its descent into the deep unknown.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.340
Onboard, the bot would carry all sorts of
instruments and equipment allowing it to take

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.090
samples as it goes.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.649
It would also have cables or a flotation device
to keep it from sinking once it reaches Europa’s

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.490
ocean, so it can just hang there, stickin’
its nose into the alien bikini bottom.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.990
All the data gathered would then be transmitted
via fiber optic cables back to a lander at

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.990
the surface.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.400
Oh yeah, and the whole thing is either powered
by General Purpose Heat Source bricks containing

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.979
plutonium, or an onboard nuclear reactor.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.979
Rad.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.460
General Purpose Heat Source modules rely on
the radioactive decay of plutonium, and they’ve

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.610
been used frequently in NASA missions.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.590
But the U.S. hasn’t launched a nuclear fission
reactor since 1965.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.869
For the last few years though, they’ve been
revisiting fission with their Kilopower project,

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.100
an effort to find affordable nuclear fission
systems that could provide the increased power

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.310
needed for space travel.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.360
Kilopower systems are already being tested,
so it’s possible a future iteration could

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.350
be used for the nuclear worm bot.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.870
Which brings us to the question, what’s
the timeline for this project?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.760
When will the big worm get to fly?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.950
Well, NASA’s Europa Clipper mission is slated
for sometime in the 2020s.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.640
But as of now, that mission only includes
an orbiter, and for the tunneling worm to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.939
be used, there would need to be lander.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.989
NASA has hinted at a possible Europa lander
mission, but there’s nothing concrete yet.

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.959
That being said, the probe was commissioned
by NASA, so there’s clearly interest in

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.170
the feasibility of a design like this.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.549
And with the tantalizing possibility of finding
life on Europa, it’s probably only a matter

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.120
of time before we try to peek under its shell.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.489
But in the meantime- I guess we can hope a
Hollywood director has seen these sketches

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.689
and is gonna make a kick-ass sci-fi movie
about tunneling alien robots??

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.880
Yeah, I would definitely
watch that.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.540
Want more videos about insane space mission
designs from the COMPASS Team?

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.170
Let us know in the comments!

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.650
As always, thanks for watching, and I’ll
see you next time on Seeker.
