Hello.
I'm Tess Lynch,

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:07.106
and tonight we're going to learn
about the mother of Halloween.

[dark chuckle]

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.910 line:92%
Mrs. Elizabeth Krebs.

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.980 line:92%
[cackles]

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.518 line:92%
[gulps]

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.520 line:92%
[continues cackling]

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:21.621 line:92%
 Freaking me out.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.122
You're freaking me out.
Wow.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.259
<i> In the early decades
 of the 20th century,</i>

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:29.629
<i> Halloween was celebrated
 in a far different way.</i>

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:33.399
<i> This was 1912 in
 Hiawatha, Kansas,</i>

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:36.269
<i> and groups of kids
 would gather together,</i>

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.471
<i> wear masks and they would
 just, like, destroy shit.</i>

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:41.841
<i> And they're like,
 oh, shoot, an outhouse.</i>

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.309
<i> What're we gonna
 do to that outhouse?</i>

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.411
<i> Tip it the hell over,
 yeah, that's right.</i>

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.747
<i> And then they would set it
 on fire and then they'd laugh.</i>

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.850
<i> And then before you know it,
 the entire town is just like,</i>

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.586
<i> turned-over outhouses,
 beheaded chickens,</i>

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:54.987 line:92%
<i> babies punched in the head.</i>

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.589
<i> The kids--
 the hooligans are like,</i>

00:00:56.622 --> 00:01:00.326
<i> I'm a--I'm a boy with a penis.
 I'm peeing in the hole!</i>

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.395 line:92%
<i> Devil's night, mother [bleep].</i>

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:03.596 line:92%
- That's scary.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.131
- It's terrible.
It's just, like...

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:06.666 line:92%
It's just terrible.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.069
<i> So, on the morning of
 November 1st, 1912,</i>

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.038
<i> day after Halloween,
 obviously,</i>

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.775
<i> Elizabeth Krebs, founder
 of the Hiawatha Garden Club,</i>

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.511
<i> wakes up,
 parts the curtains,</i>

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:23.282
<i> and saw her garden
 was completely [bleep] up.</i>

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.184
<i> And she's like,
 [in accent] this is insane!</i>

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:28.087
<i> The heirloom roses...
 [whooshes]</i>

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.822
The asters...
[whooshes]

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.358
<i> The, like, gourds...
 [whoosh]</i>

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.161
<i> And she's like,
 what's wrong with these kids?</i>

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.462 line:92%
<i> What do they need?</i>

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.231
<i> You know what
 I think they need</i>

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.532 line:92%
<i> is a party.</i>

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:42.502
<i> Burn off that
 demon-ous energy.</i>

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:43.536 line:92%
<i> Is that a word?</i>

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:44.570 line:92%
- Yeah.

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:46.005 line:92%
- Anyway, listen.

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:49.976
<i> October 31st, 1913.
 Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.011
<i> I'ma have a--I'm gonna
 have a decent-sized party.</i>

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:55.047
<i> Not a big party. Who am I?
 The King of Rome? No.</i>

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.382 line:92%
So, she does it.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.050
And then the neighborhood
kids come, they're like,

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:00.620
<i> hey, pretty cool party,
 Mrs. Krebs!</i>

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:04.090
<i> Bobbing for apples, like,
 I'm MVP of bobbing for apples.</i>

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.993
And then it just keeps going,
like, ad nauseam on repeat

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.494
until the end
of--of the evening.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:09.896
<i> So,
 Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.298
<i> I have a feeling
 this is really gonna work.</i>

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:16.202
<i> I've exhausted this youthful
 population to the point where</i>

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:19.138
<i> they can't do shit.
 This is awesome.</i>

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:21.240 line:92%
<i> So, she goes to bed,</i>

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.577
<i> wakes up the next morning,
 November 1st, 1913,</i>

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.279 line:92%
<i> parts the curtains...</i>

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.747
<i> but everything's
 leveled again.</i>

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.915 line:92%
<i> And Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:32.318
<i> no shit!
 Are you kidding me?</i>

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.154
<i> And look at that.
 A mail truck's on fire.</i>

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:36.689
<i> Someone's waiting
 for a postcard</i>

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:38.691
<i> that's never gonna arrive
 because that mail truck</i>

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.159 line:92%
<i> got lit the [bleep] on fire.</i>

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.595
<i> And she's like,
 I had this decent-sized party.</i>

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:44.230
<i> How could these kids
 even have it in them</i>

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:45.798
<i> to take a piss
 on everything?</i>

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.433
<i> But then,
 Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.968
<i> you know what?
 [snaps fingers]</i>

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.002 line:92%
<i> I got an idea.</i>

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:51.804 line:92%
So, she goes home.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.473
And Elizabeth Krebs spends
the entire next year

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:56.075
<i> planning
 for this party.</i>

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.245
<i> And she devoted all
 of her own time and resources</i>

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:03.283
<i> and money into making
 a [bleep] huge rager.</i>

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.519
[gulps]
Oh, I spilled.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:07.520 line:92%
- Happy Halloween.

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:08.754 line:92%
- And now look--

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:10.389
for the whole rest of it.
- What happened?

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:13.259
- I dribbled, man.
I [bleep] dribbled.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.961
- [laughs]
- So...

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:18.965
<i> It is October 31st, 1914.
 She's waiting at town square.</i>

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.334
And eventually...
poof-poof-poof-poof.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.437
<i> What's that?
 Kids in costumes</i>

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.940
<i> trickling in
 to the town square,</i>

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:29.642 line:92%
<i> ready to [bleep] rage.</i>

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.143
<i> And she's like,
 thank God because</i>

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.246
<i> I knew this was gonna
 be a thing and it was.</i>

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.381
<i> So, these kids--
 these hooligans</i>

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:38.551
<i> are at this party and band
 comes in, starts playing.</i>

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.486 line:92%
<i> ♪ Too-too-too-too... ♪</i>

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.954 line:92%
<i> That's--felt weak sauce.</i>

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:43.389
[laughs]
Was that weak sauce?

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:44.957
- I love that song.
- So, anyway.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.860
<i> The hooligans are like,
 hey man, I'm pretty shocked</i>

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:50.263
<i> that old Mrs. Krebs
 is throwing, like,</i>

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:54.133
<i> the [bleep] coolest party I
 ever seen in Hiawatha, Kansas.</i>

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:56.769
<i> And so, everybody
 gets marched down</i>

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:59.205
<i> to the Armstrong opera house.
 And Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.307
<i> Yo, that's a long way
 and those kids</i>

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.442
<i> are gonna be [bleep] tired
 by the time they get there.</i>

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.978
<i> And they're actually
 really enjoying themselves.</i>

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.180
<i> And they're like,
 man, this is my jam.</i>

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:10.683
<i> This is "Danny Boy."
 This is top of the charts.</i>

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:12.852
So, the band keeps
playing, playing, playing

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.121
until these kids are,
like, zombified.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.789 line:92%
<i> It's, like, "Thriller."</i>

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:19.392
<i> And Elizabeth Krebs is like,
 that's good. I like that.</i>

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.660 line:92%
<i> I like that.</i>

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.161
<i> So, she goes home,
 she goes to bed,</i>

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:25.131
<i> wakes up next morning,
 November 1st, 1914,</i>

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.232 line:92%
<i> What does she see?</i>

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:27.600
How's her garden looking,
Derek?

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:29.135
- I'm not sure.
I'm a little worried

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.469
that it's gonna
be destroyed.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:31.637 line:92%
- No.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.838 line:92%
<i> Phoo.</i>

00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:34.573
<i> She looks out.
 And she's like,</i>

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:37.677
<i> Asters, right there.
 Heirloom roses, right there.</i>

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.578 line:92%
<i> [bleep] gourds, boom.</i>

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.447
<i> It's like,
 all the shit is lined up.</i>

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.882 line:92%
<i> It's exactly as it should be.</i>

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.717
<i> People are in awe of her.
 They're like,</i>

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.086
<i> Elizabeth,
 nobody destroyed my house.</i>

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.587 line:92%
<i> Nobody broke my windows.</i>

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.922 line:92%
<i> Chief of police comes up.</i>

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.224 line:92%
<i> Thank you, Elizabeth Krebs.</i>

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:53.859
<i> Thank you,
 because guess what?</i>

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.829
<i> Vandalism reports? [whooshes]
 Way down precipitously.</i>

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:59.598
<i> And actually,
 nobody was up to anything</i>

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:02.335
<i> other than partying
 at your [bleep] rager.</i>

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:03.602
<i> She's like,
 [bleep] damn straight.</i>

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:05.037 line:92%
<i> And he's like,</i>

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.672
<i> we're gonna keep this
 tradition rolling</i>

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:07.940 line:92%
<i> pretty much forever.</i>

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:09.275
<i> She's like,
 sounds good.</i>

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:14.180
So, it changed the way we
celebrate Halloween here

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.182 line:92%
and everywhere.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.317
<i> That was all because
 one woman...</i>

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.455
<i> Elizabeth Krebs said,
 Halloween is not about</i>

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.524
<i> turning over outhouses
 to put poo on people's lawns.</i>

00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:27.793
<i> It is about
 dressing up really cute,</i>

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:29.829
<i> getting a shit-ton
 of candy.</i>

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.397 line:92%
<i> Booyah.</i>

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.668
Oh, shit.
This is like...

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.336 line:92%
Real serious makeup.

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.572
This is my favorite Halloween,
by the way.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.173
'Cause I've never liked
Halloween. [laughs]

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:43.008
- Me too.
I think you're looking good.

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.745
I think I've pretty much
handled it at this point.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:48.647
[laughs] I think I pretty much
got to the bottom of it.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.982 line:92%
- Is it all gone?

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:51.617
- There we go.
- [laughs]

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.519
- That's really good.
You looking good, dude.

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:55.285
I like it.
I like it a lot.
