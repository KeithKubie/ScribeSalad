little some demos and we'll even talk

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
little some demos and we'll even talk
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.049
little some demos and we'll even talk
about a little code so first let's talk

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
about a little code so first let's talk
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000
about a little code so first let's talk
about physics engines what's a physics

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
about physics engines what's a physics
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.100
about physics engines what's a physics
engine well it's your favorite thing in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
engine well it's your favorite thing in
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469
engine well it's your favorite thing in
the world oh that's right so a physics

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
the world oh that's right so a physics
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.609
the world oh that's right so a physics
engine is the mathematical simulation

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
engine is the mathematical simulation
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.350
engine is the mathematical simulation
that helps you create procedural

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
that helps you create procedural
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149
that helps you create procedural
animations filled with physical bodies

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
animations filled with physical bodies
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.090
animations filled with physical bodies
so in a game you're simulating per frame

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
so in a game you're simulating per frame
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
so in a game you're simulating per frame
and the system divided times into little

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
and the system divided times into little
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.249
and the system divided times into little
slices and updates on all the objects

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
slices and updates on all the objects
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410
slices and updates on all the objects
each frame based on their positions and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
each frame based on their positions and
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359
each frame based on their positions and
velocities so if there are conflicts

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
velocities so if there are conflicts
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.490
velocities so if there are conflicts
like collisions then the system resolve

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
like collisions then the system resolve
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890
like collisions then the system resolve
those safely the most basic physics

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
those safely the most basic physics
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.999
those safely the most basic physics
simulation you can think of is actually

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
simulation you can think of is actually
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.130
simulation you can think of is actually
pong with a single body it's moving

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
pong with a single body it's moving
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870
pong with a single body it's moving
around bouncing off against two paddles

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
around bouncing off against two paddles
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.490
around bouncing off against two paddles
yes that's true this is obvious a little

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
yes that's true this is obvious a little
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.310
yes that's true this is obvious a little
bit more complicated liquid fun that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
bit more complicated liquid fun that
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.929
bit more complicated liquid fun that
we're providing is just a numerical

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
we're providing is just a numerical
 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.819
we're providing is just a numerical
simulation we have a little simple

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
simulation we have a little simple
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319
simulation we have a little simple
visualization but in your game you're

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
visualization but in your game you're
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810
visualization but in your game you're
gonna want to add art sound story and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
gonna want to add art sound story and
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.130
gonna want to add art sound story and
all the rest red stuff so this is just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
all the rest red stuff so this is just
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.170
all the rest red stuff so this is just
the mathematical so like like in a you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
the mathematical so like like in a you
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910
the mathematical so like like in a you
know model-view-controller kind of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
know model-view-controller kind of
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.710
know model-view-controller kind of
analogy this would be the model this is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
analogy this would be the model this is
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480
analogy this would be the model this is
telling me where everything is in my

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
telling me where everything is in my
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.340
telling me where everything is in my
game but it would be up to my game to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
game but it would be up to my game to
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.690
game but it would be up to my game to
actually take that information and turn

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
actually take that information and turn
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910
actually take that information and turn
that into something on screen that I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
that into something on screen that I
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800
that into something on screen that I
would present to my player exactly all

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
would present to my player exactly all
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.370
would present to my player exactly all
right

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380
right
 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.960
right
so this is a superset of box2d box2d I'm

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970
so this is a superset of box2d box2d I'm
 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.870
so this is a superset of box2d box2d I'm
sure you've heard of box yes it's it's a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880
sure you've heard of box yes it's it's a
 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.410
sure you've heard of box yes it's it's a
very popular physics 2d physics engine

very popular physics 2d physics engine
 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110
very popular physics 2d physics engine
developed by Aaron kado I believe and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
developed by Aaron kado I believe and
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.699
developed by Aaron kado I believe and
it's used in like just about any game

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709
it's used in like just about any game
 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.320
it's used in like just about any game
out there that uses physics I know Angry

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330
out there that uses physics I know Angry
 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.690
out there that uses physics I know Angry
Birds is it anything with 2d physics has

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700
Birds is it anything with 2d physics has
 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.760
Birds is it anything with 2d physics has
a pretty good chance they're using box2d

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770
a pretty good chance they're using box2d
 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.160
a pretty good chance they're using box2d
if your game uses box 2d you should be

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
if your game uses box 2d you should be
 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.870
if your game uses box 2d you should be
able to drop this engine in it will just

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880
able to drop this engine in it will just
 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.360
able to drop this engine in it will just
work so just as a view this is our the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
work so just as a view this is our the
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.380
work so just as a view this is our the
typical whoops this is our typical

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
typical whoops this is our typical
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.820
typical whoops this is our typical
piston demo here that shows just rigid

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830
piston demo here that shows just rigid
 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.470

bodies interacting with each other and I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
bodies interacting with each other and I
 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.640
bodies interacting with each other and I
mean this is demonstrating a lot of

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650
mean this is demonstrating a lot of
 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.809
mean this is demonstrating a lot of
interesting things right it's sort of

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819
interesting things right it's sort of
 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.000
interesting things right it's sort of
demonstrating like well first gravity

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
demonstrating like well first gravity
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.490
demonstrating like well first gravity
and also momentum and I guess you would

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
and also momentum and I guess you would
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.650
and also momentum and I guess you would
see like angular momentum if that joint

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
see like angular momentum if that joint
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.380
see like angular momentum if that joint

we're adding with liquid fun is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
we're adding with liquid fun is
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.240
we're adding with liquid fun is
obviously particles hmm yes so let's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250
obviously particles hmm yes so let's
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.300
obviously particles hmm yes so let's
look at some particle demos this is a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310
look at some particle demos this is a
 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.800
look at some particle demos this is a
whole bunch of particles and a giant

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810
whole bunch of particles and a giant
 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.390

particles Wow
 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.660
particles Wow
yeah it's a lot of particles they had

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670
yeah it's a lot of particles they had
 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.100
yeah it's a lot of particles they had
thousands and thousands of particles

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110
thousands and thousands of particles
 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.170
thousands and thousands of particles
running around inside there and this is

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180
running around inside there and this is
 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.120
running around inside there and this is
an active simulation so if I grab hold

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130
an active simulation so if I grab hold
 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.400
an active simulation so if I grab hold
of this I can kind of I can kind of swim

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410
of this I can kind of I can kind of swim
 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.930
of this I can kind of I can kind of swim
through this and push these guys out of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940
through this and push these guys out of
 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.259
through this and push these guys out of
the way I can touch groups of particles

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269
the way I can touch groups of particles
 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.780
the way I can touch groups of particles
and throw them around it's pretty cool

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790
and throw them around it's pretty cool
 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.300
and throw them around it's pretty cool
yeah because normally when I think of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310
yeah because normally when I think of
 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.860
yeah because normally when I think of
particles I think of them used for like

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870
particles I think of them used for like
 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.449
particles I think of them used for like
sort of visual only effects like fire

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459
sort of visual only effects like fire
 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.550
sort of visual only effects like fire
and smoke but I guess what you're saying

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560
and smoke but I guess what you're saying
 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.500
and smoke but I guess what you're saying
is particles could also be used for for

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510
is particles could also be used for for
 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.759
is particles could also be used for for
generating things that look like water

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769
generating things that look like water
 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.860
generating things that look like water
yeah exactly and and these particles are

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
yeah exactly and and these particles are
 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.780
yeah exactly and and these particles are
actually and these particles can

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790
actually and these particles can
 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.670
actually and these particles can
interact with the entire rest of your

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680
interact with the entire rest of your
 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.530
interact with the entire rest of your
physical system and this is your typical

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
physical system and this is your typical
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.420
physical system and this is your typical
wave machine you can actually see kind

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430
wave machine you can actually see kind
 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.479
wave machine you can actually see kind
of wave physics going back and forth as

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489
of wave physics going back and forth as
 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.300
of wave physics going back and forth as
it swims around gotcha and so I mean

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310
it swims around gotcha and so I mean
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.490
it swims around gotcha and so I mean
basically this this engine is simulating

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500
basically this this engine is simulating
 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.809
basically this this engine is simulating
each of these thousands of particles

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819
each of these thousands of particles
 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.229
each of these thousands of particles
individually and sort of by by grouping

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239
individually and sort of by by grouping
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.360
individually and sort of by by grouping
all these behaviors together you get

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370
all these behaviors together you get
 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.830
all these behaviors together you get
something that suddenly creates waves

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840
something that suddenly creates waves
 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.449
something that suddenly creates waves
yeah it looks like water it's pretty

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459
yeah it looks like water it's pretty
 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.010
yeah it looks like water it's pretty
neat yeah that's cool

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020
 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.020
so as I mentioned before the engine is

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
so as I mentioned before the engine is
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.420
so as I mentioned before the engine is
cross-platform it's written in C++ and

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430

they want to add gotcha so there's a

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610
they want to add gotcha so there's a
 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.830
they want to add gotcha so there's a
pretty good chance I could add this to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840
pretty good chance I could add this to
 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.810
pretty good chance I could add this to
any mobile game I wanted mm-hmm all

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820
any mobile game I wanted mm-hmm all
 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.490
any mobile game I wanted mm-hmm all
right so this is kind of way out of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500
right so this is kind of way out of
 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.570
right so this is kind of way out of
scope but we'll talk a little bit about

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580
scope but we'll talk a little bit about
 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.240
scope but we'll talk a little bit about
how physics engines work so in physics

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250
how physics engines work so in physics
 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.990
how physics engines work so in physics
engine you basically create a world you

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000
engine you basically create a world you
 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.270
engine you basically create a world you
add some rigid bodies to it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280
add some rigid bodies to it
 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.370
add some rigid bodies to it
so here circle and triangle you might

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380
so here circle and triangle you might
 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.890
so here circle and triangle you might
add some joints to connect them and then

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900
add some joints to connect them and then
 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.900
add some joints to connect them and then
you stop the simulation for it and in

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910
you stop the simulation for it and in
 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.650
you stop the simulation for it and in
this case since there's nothing

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660
this case since there's nothing
 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.000
this case since there's nothing
supporting those guys they're just gonna

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010
supporting those guys they're just gonna
 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.180
supporting those guys they're just gonna
they're just gonna fall no but the again

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190
they're just gonna fall no but the again
 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.190
they're just gonna fall no but the again
the secret sauce with liquidfun is that

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200
the secret sauce with liquidfun is that
 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.350
the secret sauce with liquidfun is that
we're adding very large numbers of

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360
we're adding very large numbers of
 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.240
we're adding very large numbers of
particles that can interact with these

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250
particles that can interact with these
 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.180
particles that can interact with these
rigid bodies okay so what makes a

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190
rigid bodies okay so what makes a
 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.930
rigid bodies okay so what makes a
particle different than a rigid body so

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940
particle different than a rigid body so
 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.720
particle different than a rigid body so
particles are the smallest unit of

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730
particles are the smallest unit of
 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.480
particles are the smallest unit of
matter that can interact with thing they

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490
matter that can interact with thing they
 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.970
matter that can interact with thing they
are they act like rigid bodies but they

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980
are they act like rigid bodies but they
 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.620
are they act like rigid bodies but they
don't have rotation so we consider them

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630
don't have rotation so we consider them
 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.240
don't have rotation so we consider them
uniform circles and they are sort of

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250
uniform circles and they are sort of
 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.909
uniform circles and they are sort of
packed intelligently in the system so

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919
packed intelligently in the system so
 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.560
packed intelligently in the system so
they can be rendered and simulated very

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570
they can be rendered and simulated very
 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.560
they can be rendered and simulated very
quickly okay rigid bodies basically are

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570
quickly okay rigid bodies basically are
 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.670
quickly okay rigid bodies basically are
going to be slow and expensive and

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680
going to be slow and expensive and
 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.590
going to be slow and expensive and
particles are small and cheap so by

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600
particles are small and cheap so by
 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.570
particles are small and cheap so by
basically placing a few limitations on

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580
basically placing a few limitations on
 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.220
basically placing a few limitations on
these things the engine is then able to

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230
these things the engine is then able to
 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.900
these things the engine is then able to
render hundreds or thousands of them at

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910
render hundreds or thousands of them at
 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.380
render hundreds or thousands of them at
once thousands okay so particles come

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390
once thousands okay so particles come
 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.300
once thousands okay so particles come
with basic physical characteristics like

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310
with basic physical characteristics like
 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.740
with basic physical characteristics like
color size position velocity color is

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750
color size position velocity color is
 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.570
color size position velocity color is
for your reference when you're rendering

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580
for your reference when you're rendering
 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.890
for your reference when you're rendering
them they don't actually it doesn't have

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900
them they don't actually it doesn't have
 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.270
them they don't actually it doesn't have
actually have any effect on the

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
actually have any effect on the
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.430
actually have any effect on the
numerical simulation I can i can ping

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440
numerical simulation I can i can ping
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.320
numerical simulation I can i can ping
the model and say hey what's this what

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330
the model and say hey what's this what
 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.560
the model and say hey what's this what
color is this and then also strength so

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570
color is this and then also strength so
 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.450
color is this and then also strength so
if you have particles that are Kohi

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460
if you have particles that are Kohi
 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.620
if you have particles that are Kohi
that are sort of stuck together like

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630
that are sort of stuck together like
 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.480
that are sort of stuck together like
viscous particles you can say how strong

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490
viscous particles you can say how strong
 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.689
viscous particles you can say how strong
you want that viscosity to be okay

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699
you want that viscosity to be okay
 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.790
you want that viscosity to be okay
and as noted there's no rotation for

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800
and as noted there's no rotation for
 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.650
and as noted there's no rotation for
particles so if you rendered them as

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660
particles so if you rendered them as
 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.540
particles so if you rendered them as
little like top hats the top hats would

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550
little like top hats the top hats would
 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.980
little like top hats the top hats would
always be facing up even though

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990
always be facing up even though
 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.230
always be facing up even though
thousands of them are smacking against

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240
thousands of them are smacking against
 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.710
thousands of them are smacking against
each other

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720
each other
 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.510
each other
gotcha so as a general rule you probably

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520
gotcha so as a general rule you probably
 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.219
gotcha so as a general rule you probably
don't want to render them as it's

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229
don't want to render them as it's
 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.830
don't want to render them as it's
something that anyways where you would

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
something that anyways where you would
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.600
something that anyways where you would
notice it doesn't rotate yeah exactly

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610
notice it doesn't rotate yeah exactly
 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.659
notice it doesn't rotate yeah exactly
in fact most likely I might kind of

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669
in fact most likely I might kind of
 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.610
in fact most likely I might kind of
apply some sort of filter to kind of not

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620
apply some sort of filter to kind of not
 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.379
apply some sort of filter to kind of not
show the individual particles but kind

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389
show the individual particles but kind
 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.760
show the individual particles but kind
of group them together so I might see a

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770
of group them together so I might see a
 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.159
of group them together so I might see a
big wave or something no actually in

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169
big wave or something no actually in
 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.230
big wave or something no actually in
these simulations we were just sort of

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240
these simulations we were just sort of
 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.710
these simulations we were just sort of
rendering a Gaussian spot and as lots of

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720
rendering a Gaussian spot and as lots of
 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.020
rendering a Gaussian spot and as lots of
them are as they sort of the spot is a

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030
them are as they sort of the spot is a
 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.250
them are as they sort of the spot is a
little bit bigger than the body and as

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260
little bit bigger than the body and as
 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.689
little bit bigger than the body and as
they kind of overlap each other you can

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699
they kind of overlap each other you can
 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.460
they kind of overlap each other you can
you get this sort of areas of they look

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470
you get this sort of areas of they look
 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.590
you get this sort of areas of they look
kind of solid okay so here's the code

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600
kind of solid okay so here's the code
 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.360
kind of solid okay so here's the code
for creating a particle if you use box2d

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370
for creating a particle if you use box2d
 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.980
for creating a particle if you use box2d
before this should seem really familiar

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990
before this should seem really familiar
 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.590
before this should seem really familiar
you create a particle def you can set

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600
you create a particle def you can set
 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.409
you create a particle def you can set
some flags on it and you can also set

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419
some flags on it and you can also set
 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.480
some flags on it and you can also set
its position and its velocity but not

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490
its position and its velocity but not
 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.390
its position and its velocity but not
its rotation and then you tell the world

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400
its rotation and then you tell the world
 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.980
its rotation and then you tell the world
i'd like to create a particle using this

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990
i'd like to create a particle using this
 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.990
i'd like to create a particle using this
definition what is that elastic particle

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000
definition what is that elastic particle
 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.760
definition what is that elastic particle
there mean so elastic particles are

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770
there mean so elastic particles are
 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.740
there mean so elastic particles are
springy particles they're particles that

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750
springy particles they're particles that
 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.750
springy particles they're particles that
are that are connected together like a

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760
are that are connected together like a
 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.640
are that are connected together like a
jelly we'll see one in just a minute all

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650
jelly we'll see one in just a minute all
 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.680
jelly we'll see one in just a minute all
right we'll see a lot of elastic

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690
right we'll see a lot of elastic
 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.500
right we'll see a lot of elastic
particles in just a minute particle

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510
particles in just a minute particle
 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.480
particles in just a minute particle
group is created by instancing sets of

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490
group is created by instancing sets of
 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.850
group is created by instancing sets of
particles together in a different in a

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860
particles together in a different in a
 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.980
particles together in a different in a
shape there ways for you to create and

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990
shape there ways for you to create and
 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.510
shape there ways for you to create and
destroy lots of particles at the same

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520
destroy lots of particles at the same
 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.230
destroy lots of particles at the same
time so you can set all the regular

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240
time so you can set all the regular
 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.060
time so you can set all the regular
properties like velocity and position

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.070
properties like velocity and position
 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.450
properties like velocity and position
but you can also add the rotational

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
but you can also add the rotational
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.700
but you can also add the rotational
angle if you have one of these jellies

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:48.710
angle if you have one of these jellies
 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.520
angle if you have one of these jellies
you can also set sorry you can even

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:51.530
you can also set sorry you can even
 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.140
you can also set sorry you can even
rotate the shape and then you can set

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.150
rotate the shape and then you can set
 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.879
rotate the shape and then you can set
the rotational velocity as well if you

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:54.889
the rotational velocity as well if you
 

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.650
the rotational velocity as well if you
have one of these jellies okay so

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:56.660
have one of these jellies okay so
 

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.390
have one of these jellies okay so
particles don't have rotation but a

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400
particles don't have rotation but a
 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.909
particles don't have rotation but a
particle group does have a rotation if

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919
particle group does have a rotation if
 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:03.390
particle group does have a rotation if
it's if it's an elastic one yeah okay I

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400
it's if it's an elastic one yeah okay I
 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.650
it's if it's an elastic one yeah okay I
think I think you're gonna need to show

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:05.660
think I think you're gonna need to show
 

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.420
think I think you're gonna need to show
me a demo I think we're gonna show it mo

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:07.430
me a demo I think we're gonna show it mo
 

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.210
me a demo I think we're gonna show it mo
all right so creating product groups is

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:12.220
all right so creating product groups is
 

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.550
all right so creating product groups is
again should feel pretty familiar to

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560
again should feel pretty familiar to
 

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.800
again should feel pretty familiar to
box2d people you create a shape you

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:17.810
box2d people you create a shape you
 

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.909
box2d people you create a shape you
create a particle group definition

00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919
create a particle group definition
 

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:20.800
create a particle group definition
object and then you instance the group

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:20.810
object and then you instance the group
 

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.779
object and then you instance the group
with that so what is the shape here mean

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:22.789
with that so what is the shape here mean
 

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:24.980
with that so what is the shape here mean
a shape is a bar

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:24.990
a shape is a bar
 

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.840
a shape is a bar
to be primitive so it's gonna be like a

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:26.850
to be primitive so it's gonna be like a
 

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.700
to be primitive so it's gonna be like a
polygon so you can make a circle you can

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:28.710
polygon so you can make a circle you can
 

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.410
polygon so you can make a circle you can
make a John square you can make an

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:30.420
make a John square you can make an
 

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.060
make a John square you can make an
l-shaped you do it okay and is the idea

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.070
l-shaped you do it okay and is the idea
 

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.380
l-shaped you do it okay and is the idea
these particles have to fit into that

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:33.390
these particles have to fit into that
 

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.310
these particles have to fit into that
shape all the part of it will create

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320
shape all the part of it will create
 

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.170
shape all the part of it will create
particles with the density in the shape

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180
particles with the density in the shape
 

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.150
particles with the density in the shape
that you specify hmm okay I'm a little

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.160
that you specify hmm okay I'm a little
 

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.340
that you specify hmm okay I'm a little
confused maybe maybe maybe can go

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:46.350
confused maybe maybe maybe can go
 

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.480
confused maybe maybe maybe can go
through this code and let me know what

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.490
through this code and let me know what
 

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.190
through this code and let me know what
you mean right so you can see here we

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200
you mean right so you can see here we
 

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.530
you mean right so you can see here we
have the particle group definition and a

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540
have the particle group definition and a
 

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.800
have the particle group definition and a
shape the shape is just a box and then

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:57.810
shape the shape is just a box and then
 

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.920
shape the shape is just a box and then
the on the particle group definition

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:00.930
the on the particle group definition
 

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.240
the on the particle group definition
we're saying you know look at this shape

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.250
we're saying you know look at this shape
 

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.740
we're saying you know look at this shape
we're setting some flags on it its

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:06.750
we're setting some flags on it its
 

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.660
we're setting some flags on it its
initial angle its initial angular

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:08.670
initial angle its initial angular
 

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.610
initial angle its initial angular
velocity and that's the angle of the

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620
velocity and that's the angle of the
 

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.820
velocity and that's the angle of the
entire shape that we're setting and then

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:13.830
entire shape that we're setting and then
 

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.070
entire shape that we're setting and then
we're instancing five groups of these

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080
we're instancing five groups of these
 

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.180
we're instancing five groups of these
all at once so you're creating I see

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.190
all at once so you're creating I see
 

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.600
all at once so you're creating I see
you're creating five groups of of square

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:23.610
you're creating five groups of of square
 

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.720
you're creating five groups of of square
shaped particles but then within these

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:26.730
shaped particles but then within these
 

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.410
shaped particles but then within these
you're not

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420
you're not
 

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.270
you're not
you do need to then create the particles

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.280
you do need to then create the particles
 

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.490
you do need to then create the particles
that are attached to these shapes no

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500
that are attached to these shapes no
 

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.530
that are attached to these shapes no
when you say create particle group you

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540
when you say create particle group you
 

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.180
when you say create particle group you
just pull human since all these

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.190
just pull human since all these
 

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.460
just pull human since all these
particles at the same time okay and so

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.470
particles at the same time okay and so
 

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.750
particles at the same time okay and so
that's kind of that's where the shape

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760
that's kind of that's where the shape
 

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.100
that's kind of that's where the shape
definition comes in is it's creating

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.110
definition comes in is it's creating
 

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.460
definition comes in is it's creating
these groups that that essentially fill

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:43.470
these groups that that essentially fill
 

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.050
these groups that that essentially fill
this shape yeah gotcha

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060
this shape yeah gotcha
 

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.840
this shape yeah gotcha
and the the density of particles within

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:47.850
and the the density of particles within
 

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.070
and the the density of particles within
that shape is that something that I

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080
that shape is that something that I
 

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.200
that shape is that something that I
would specify or yeah you can say you

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.210
would specify or yeah you can say you
 

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.040
would specify or yeah you can say you
can set the particle size okay so I

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.050
can set the particle size okay so I
 

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.650
can set the particle size okay so I
don't need to have like two for nested

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660
don't need to have like two for nested
 

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.500
don't need to have like two for nested
for-loops that create I'll just you just

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:00.510
for-loops that create I'll just you just
 

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.720
for-loops that create I'll just you just
make a shape and and it will fill it

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:02.730
make a shape and and it will fill it
 

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.400
make a shape and and it will fill it
with well that makes a whole lot more

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.410
with well that makes a whole lot more
 

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.720
with well that makes a whole lot more
sense all right so if you want to

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:08.730
sense all right so if you want to
 

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.150
sense all right so if you want to
destroy particles as a group it's pretty

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160
destroy particles as a group it's pretty
 

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.760
destroy particles as a group it's pretty
easy this code example here walks the

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:13.770
easy this code example here walks the
 

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.770
easy this code example here walks the
entire list of particle or the entire

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:15.780
entire list of particle or the entire
 

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.090
entire list of particle or the entire
list of groups in the world and just

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100
list of groups in the world and just
 

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.350
list of groups in the world and just
destroys all of them this would be like

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360
destroys all of them this would be like
 

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.389
destroys all of them this would be like
a simulation shut down step

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399
 

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:26.319
if you the particles in the groups can

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:26.329
if you the particles in the groups can
 

00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:28.059
if you the particles in the groups can
interact with each other but then you

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:28.069
interact with each other but then you
 

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:32.470
interact with each other but then you
can kill the groups on Moss so let's say

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480
can kill the groups on Moss so let's say
 

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.660
can kill the groups on Moss so let's say
I have two groups here and I mix them

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:34.670
I have two groups here and I mix them
 

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.160
I have two groups here and I mix them
all together and they form this you know

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.170
all together and they form this you know
 

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.170
all together and they form this you know
giant message I can then say kill Group

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:38.180
giant message I can then say kill Group
 

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.699
giant message I can then say kill Group
a and like half my water will suddenly

00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:39.709
a and like half my water will suddenly
 

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:42.759
a and like half my water will suddenly
disappear exactly huh so I guess you got

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:42.769
disappear exactly huh so I guess you got
 

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:44.139
disappear exactly huh so I guess you got
to be careful about using that to make

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:44.149
to be careful about using that to make
 

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:45.999
to be careful about using that to make
sure that that's actually the side

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:46.009
sure that that's actually the side
 

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.840
sure that that's actually the side
effect that you want

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:46.850
effect that you want
 

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.540
effect that you want
exactly okay once you start pulling

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:49.550
exactly okay once you start pulling
 

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.759
exactly okay once you start pulling
those together they become international

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:51.769
those together they become international
 

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:54.220
those together they become international
yes particles have a lot of human

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:54.230
yes particles have a lot of human
 

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.900
yes particles have a lot of human
behaviors by default they operate as a

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.910
behaviors by default they operate as a
 

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.970
behaviors by default they operate as a
simple liquid but you can add these new

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:57.980
simple liquid but you can add these new
 

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.100
simple liquid but you can add these new
particles like elasticity with a with

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.110
particles like elasticity with a with
 

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.340
particles like elasticity with a with
flags so let's let's show some demos

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:03.350
flags so let's let's show some demos
 

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.420
flags so let's let's show some demos
here okay

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:04.430
here okay
 

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:10.780
here okay
so first I'm going to show you a set of

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:10.790
so first I'm going to show you a set of
 

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.059
so first I'm going to show you a set of
particles that are elastic so here you

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:13.069
particles that are elastic so here you
 

00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:14.739
particles that are elastic so here you
can see they're kind of acting like

00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:14.749
can see they're kind of acting like
 

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:18.189
can see they're kind of acting like
jelly and if I grab any small collection

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:18.199
jelly and if I grab any small collection
 

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:19.960
jelly and if I grab any small collection
of particles and move them the whole the

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:19.970
of particles and move them the whole the
 

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.549
of particles and move them the whole the
whole body moves at the same time gotcha

00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:21.559
whole body moves at the same time gotcha
 

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:22.809
whole body moves at the same time gotcha
and I can see they're trying to keep

00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:22.819
and I can see they're trying to keep
 

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:25.720
and I can see they're trying to keep
sort of their original shape but they

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:25.730
sort of their original shape but they
 

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.460
sort of their original shape but they
can still be deformed if I drop objects

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:27.470
can still be deformed if I drop objects
 

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.470
can still be deformed if I drop objects
on them they're gonna they're gonna sort

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480
on them they're gonna they're gonna sort
 

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.410
on them they're gonna they're gonna sort
of deform to accept that and so these

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:32.420
of deform to accept that and so these
 

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.419
of deform to accept that and so these
were created by particle groups mm-hmm

00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:34.429
were created by particle groups mm-hmm
 

00:11:34.429 --> 00:11:35.860
were created by particle groups mm-hmm
yeah this has a shape that's a circle

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:35.870
yeah this has a shape that's a circle
 

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.569
yeah this has a shape that's a circle
the other has a shape that's a rectangle

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:37.579
the other has a shape that's a rectangle
 

00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:40.389
the other has a shape that's a rectangle
you give them elasticity which means

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399
you give them elasticity which means
 

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:43.329
you give them elasticity which means
that they are springy and they cannot be

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:43.339
that they are springy and they cannot be
 

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:45.910
that they are springy and they cannot be
broken apart right okay so that would be

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920
broken apart right okay so that would be
 

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.199
broken apart right okay so that would be
useful for like if I wanted to create

00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:47.209
useful for like if I wanted to create
 

00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:50.139
useful for like if I wanted to create
bouncy balls or just fun looking jelly

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:50.149
bouncy balls or just fun looking jelly
 

00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:52.360
bouncy balls or just fun looking jelly
types of things like somehow yes is such

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:52.370
types of things like somehow yes is such
 

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.280
types of things like somehow yes is such
a cool jelly and somehow it's important

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.290
a cool jelly and somehow it's important
 

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.569
a cool jelly and somehow it's important
for my game to make sure that this is

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:55.579
for my game to make sure that this is
 

00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:57.369
for my game to make sure that this is
still one solid object it doesn't get

00:11:57.369 --> 00:11:57.379
still one solid object it doesn't get
 

00:11:57.379 --> 00:11:58.989
still one solid object it doesn't get
broken apart right okay

00:11:58.989 --> 00:11:58.999
broken apart right okay
 

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:01.389
broken apart right okay
so here's an example of particles that

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399
so here's an example of particles that
 

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:04.929
so here's an example of particles that
can color mix so this is a regular fluid

00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:04.939
can color mix so this is a regular fluid
 

00:12:04.939 --> 00:12:07.900
can color mix so this is a regular fluid
but as the particles brush against each

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:07.910
but as the particles brush against each
 

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.600
but as the particles brush against each
other it averages their color as they as

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:10.610
other it averages their color as they as
 

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.540
other it averages their color as they as
they as they rub so you can see the red

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:13.550
they as they rub so you can see the red
 

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.069
they as they rub so you can see the red
and green turned into this yellow on the

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079
and green turned into this yellow on the
 

00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:17.829
and green turned into this yellow on the
left and if I kind of if I kind of mix

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839
left and if I kind of if I kind of mix
 

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:22.929
left and if I kind of if I kind of mix
these whoops I kind of spilled if I mix

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:22.939
these whoops I kind of spilled if I mix
 

00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:24.970
these whoops I kind of spilled if I mix
these I can I can kind of bring the

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:24.980
these I can I can kind of bring the
 

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.710
these I can I can kind of bring the
green

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720
green
 

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.019
green
a blue and get kind of a uniform light

00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:28.029
a blue and get kind of a uniform light
 

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:29.730
a blue and get kind of a uniform light
blue gotcha and so these colors

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:29.740
blue gotcha and so these colors
 

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.759
blue gotcha and so these colors
basically mix just based on because I'm

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:32.769
basically mix just based on because I'm
 

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:35.249
basically mix just based on because I'm
when they touch yeah so I could like

00:12:35.249 --> 00:12:35.259
when they touch yeah so I could like
 

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:36.569
when they touch yeah so I could like
let's say as a developer I could use

00:12:36.569 --> 00:12:36.579
let's say as a developer I could use
 

00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:37.769
let's say as a developer I could use
this if I wanted to like you know

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:37.779
this if I wanted to like you know
 

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:39.480
this if I wanted to like you know
measure like some hot water and some

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.490
measure like some hot water and some
 

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.980
measure like some hot water and some
cold water or something and like yeah

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:40.990
cold water or something and like yeah
 

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.300
cold water or something and like yeah
you can I would just sort of ping the

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.310
you can I would just sort of ping the
 

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.309
you can I would just sort of ping the
color as sort of a way to represent how

00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:44.319
color as sort of a way to represent how
 

00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:46.550
color as sort of a way to represent how
hot or cold these things are sure okay

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560
hot or cold these things are sure okay
 

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.590
hot or cold these things are sure okay
and so I've noticed these break apart

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600
and so I've noticed these break apart
 

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.759
and so I've noticed these break apart
brazen so these are not elastic

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:50.769
brazen so these are not elastic
 

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.259
brazen so these are not elastic
particles no no these are these are

00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:52.269
particles no no these are these are
 

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:56.069
particles no no these are these are
regular fluids okay and lastly here are

00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079
regular fluids okay and lastly here are
 

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:57.960
regular fluids okay and lastly here are
some viscous fluids flowing through a

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:57.970
some viscous fluids flowing through a
 

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.090
some viscous fluids flowing through a
maze and then we have a couple of little

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:00.100
maze and then we have a couple of little
 

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.829
maze and then we have a couple of little
pumps that are kind of moving it back

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839
pumps that are kind of moving it back
 

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:03.990
pumps that are kind of moving it back
and forth and you can see I'm getting

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000
and forth and you can see I'm getting
 

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.910
and forth and you can see I'm getting
this sort of blob down here in the lower

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920
this sort of blob down here in the lower
 

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.800
this sort of blob down here in the lower
left mm-hmm

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:07.810
left mm-hmm
 

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.740
left mm-hmm
and also if you look up at the right you

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:10.750
and also if you look up at the right you
 

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.960
and also if you look up at the right you
can see I'm applying a constant force to

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:12.970
can see I'm applying a constant force to
 

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.240
can see I'm applying a constant force to
this pump and it can't compress these

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.250
this pump and it can't compress these
 

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.329
this pump and it can't compress these
this viscous fluid enough so it kind of

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:18.339
this viscous fluid enough so it kind of
 

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.490
this viscous fluid enough so it kind of
bounces off of it sort of like real

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:20.500
bounces off of it sort of like real
 

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.769
bounces off of it sort of like real
water I guess exactly and then down at

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:22.779
water I guess exactly and then down at
 

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:25.139
water I guess exactly and then down at
the bottom oh there it fell by itself I

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:25.149
the bottom oh there it fell by itself I
 

00:13:25.149 --> 00:13:26.939
the bottom oh there it fell by itself I
can use this to sort of pump water

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:26.949
can use this to sort of pump water
 

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:32.129
can use this to sort of pump water
uphill and and knock the knock this

00:13:32.129 --> 00:13:32.139
uphill and and knock the knock this
 

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:34.049
uphill and and knock the knock this
other rigid body into the into the drain

00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:34.059
other rigid body into the into the drain
 

00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:37.590
other rigid body into the into the drain
and so by saying these are viscous what

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600
and so by saying these are viscous what
 

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.639
and so by saying these are viscous what
you're basically saying is like these

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:38.649
you're basically saying is like these
 

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:40.019
you're basically saying is like these
have some amount of surface tension

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:40.029
have some amount of surface tension
 

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:42.059
have some amount of surface tension
mm-hmm yeah there's probably want to

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:42.069
mm-hmm yeah there's probably want to
 

00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:43.439
mm-hmm yeah there's probably want to
stick together this gives me more

00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:43.449
stick together this gives me more
 

00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:45.540
stick together this gives me more
realistic looking water than if they if

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:45.550
realistic looking water than if they if
 

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.769
realistic looking water than if they if
they were not like it would probably

00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:46.779
they were not like it would probably
 

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:48.449
they were not like it would probably
look like sand if you did not have this

00:13:48.449 --> 00:13:48.459
look like sand if you did not have this
 

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:50.759
look like sand if you did not have this
visit yeah he turned on yeah they would

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:50.769
visit yeah he turned on yeah they would
 

00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:53.579
visit yeah he turned on yeah they would
look it would look more it wouldn't it

00:13:53.579 --> 00:13:53.589
look it would look more it wouldn't it
 

00:13:53.589 --> 00:13:54.990
look it would look more it wouldn't it
wouldn't you couldn't go here as much

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000
wouldn't you couldn't go here as much
 

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.970
wouldn't you couldn't go here as much
you wouldn't end up with the as many of

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:56.980
you wouldn't end up with the as many of
 

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.069
you wouldn't end up with the as many of
these sort of big blobs gotcha

00:13:59.069 --> 00:13:59.079
these sort of big blobs gotcha
 

00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:00.780
these sort of big blobs gotcha
and the more and more viscous kind of

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:00.790
and the more and more viscous kind of
 

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.299
and the more and more viscous kind of
the yeah and you were like toothpaste or

00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:03.309
the yeah and you were like toothpaste or
 

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:04.049
the yeah and you were like toothpaste or
yeah exactly

00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:04.059
yeah exactly
 

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:07.980
yeah exactly
all right and the maple syrup I'm trying

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:07.990
all right and the maple syrup I'm trying
 

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.530
all right and the maple syrup I'm trying
to think of yeah yeah something like

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:10.540
to think of yeah yeah something like
 

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:10.860
to think of yeah yeah something like
that

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:10.870
that
 

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.879
that
okay and we have more particle behaviors

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:13.889
okay and we have more particle behaviors
 

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:17.730
okay and we have more particle behaviors
besides besides even these like powder

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:17.740
besides besides even these like powder
 

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.470
besides besides even these like powder
and tensile and wall and things like

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480
and tensile and wall and things like
 

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.019
and tensile and wall and things like
that what do those need powder mean so

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:22.029
that what do those need powder mean so
 

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:24.809
that what do those need powder mean so
powder would be something like smoke it

00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:24.819
powder would be something like smoke it
 

00:14:24.819 --> 00:14:26.429
powder would be something like smoke it
be things it doesn't stick the walls

00:14:26.429 --> 00:14:26.439
be things it doesn't stick the walls
 

00:14:26.439 --> 00:14:28.019
be things it doesn't stick the walls
very well and it doesn't want to stick

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:28.029
very well and it doesn't want to stick
 

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:29.519
very well and it doesn't want to stick
to itself very much at all so as a

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:29.529

open-source you can pull it into your
 

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:53.699
open-source you can pull it into your
game right now and publish it and that

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:53.709
game right now and publish it and that
 

00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:54.329
game right now and publish it and that
would be great

00:14:54.329 --> 00:14:54.339
would be great
 

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:56.789
would be great
awesome well that sounds like a very

00:14:56.789 --> 00:14:56.799
awesome well that sounds like a very
 

00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:58.219
awesome well that sounds like a very
useful thing mm-hmm

useful thing mm-hmm
 

00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:01.219
useful thing mm-hmm
why are we giving this to the world wolf

00:15:01.219 --> 00:15:01.229
why are we giving this to the world wolf
 

00:15:01.229 --> 00:15:03.179
why are we giving this to the world wolf
because we want to make games better oh

00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:03.189
because we want to make games better oh
 

00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:04.979
because we want to make games better oh
that's a good idea we want to make

00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:04.989
that's a good idea we want to make
 

00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:07.439
that's a good idea we want to make
people's games awesome all right well

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:07.449
people's games awesome all right well
 

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:08.669
people's games awesome all right well
this seems like a good start

00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:08.679
this seems like a good start
 

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:11.039
this seems like a good start
I'm as someone who is a big fan of

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:11.049
I'm as someone who is a big fan of
 

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:12.749
I'm as someone who is a big fan of
physics games I encourage you all to

00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759
physics games I encourage you all to
 

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:14.609
physics games I encourage you all to
take a look at this and start adding

00:15:14.609 --> 00:15:14.619
take a look at this and start adding
 

00:15:14.619 --> 00:15:16.409
take a look at this and start adding
crazy-looking jelly things to your game

00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:16.419
crazy-looking jelly things to your game
 

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:18.359
crazy-looking jelly things to your game
there's probably a whole probably a

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:18.369
there's probably a whole probably a
 

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:20.159
there's probably a whole probably a
whole world of like water and jelly

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:20.169
whole world of like water and jelly
 

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:22.079
whole world of like water and jelly
games that we just have a onra of jelly

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:22.089
games that we just have a onra of jelly
 

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:23.989
games that we just have a onra of jelly
again just waiting to be discovered and

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:23.999
again just waiting to be discovered and
 

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:28.019
again just waiting to be discovered and
so maybe that will be you yeah seriously

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:28.029
so maybe that will be you yeah seriously
 

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:29.429
so maybe that will be you yeah seriously
check it out I think the physics engine

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:29.439
check it out I think the physics engine
 

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:31.109
check it out I think the physics engine
always defined really interesting

00:15:31.109 --> 00:15:31.119
always defined really interesting
 

00:15:31.119 --> 00:15:33.469
always defined really interesting
because it's like a very complicated

00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:33.479
because it's like a very complicated
 

00:15:33.479 --> 00:15:36.209
because it's like a very complicated
system where you can have a lot of kind

00:15:36.209 --> 00:15:36.219
system where you can have a lot of kind
 

00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:38.549
system where you can have a lot of kind
of rich behavior and create a lot of

00:15:38.549 --> 00:15:38.559
of rich behavior and create a lot of
 

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:39.929
of rich behavior and create a lot of
really interesting rich puzzles but at

00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:39.939
really interesting rich puzzles but at
 

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.489
really interesting rich puzzles but at
the same time like you know a

00:15:41.489 --> 00:15:41.499
the same time like you know a
 

00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:43.409
the same time like you know a
three-year-old intuitively understands

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:43.419
three-year-old intuitively understands
 

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:44.429
three-year-old intuitively understands
how everything in the world is going to

00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:44.439
how everything in the world is going to
 

00:15:44.439 --> 00:15:46.919
how everything in the world is going to
react well I think it makes for a really

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:46.929
react well I think it makes for a really
 

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:48.389
react well I think it makes for a really
good game design I think why there's so

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399
good game design I think why there's so
 

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:50.219
good game design I think why there's so
many good space game designs out there

00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:50.229
many good space game designs out there
 

00:15:50.229 --> 00:15:52.049
many good space game designs out there
it's really a sandbox for emergent

00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:52.059
it's really a sandbox for emergent
 

00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:53.489
it's really a sandbox for emergent
gameplay

unexpected things happen when you put

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:55.149
unexpected things happen when you put
 

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:56.579
unexpected things happen when you put
physics together and that makes a little

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:56.589
physics together and that makes a little
 

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:59.099
physics together and that makes a little
surprising and fun or you could you know

00:15:59.099 --> 00:15:59.109
surprising and fun or you could you know
 

00:15:59.109 --> 00:16:00.119
surprising and fun or you could you know
really just kind of make this wave

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:00.129
really just kind of make this wave
 

00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:01.769
really just kind of make this wave
machine and I'd watch that first several

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:01.779
machine and I'd watch that first several
 

00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:04.049
machine and I'd watch that first several
hours yeah this you get hooked just

00:16:04.049 --> 00:16:04.059
hours yeah this you get hooked just
 

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:04.979
hours yeah this you get hooked just
looking at these things

00:16:04.979 --> 00:16:04.989
looking at these things
 

00:16:04.989 --> 00:16:06.959
looking at these things
so you said OSX can I make a screen

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:06.969
so you said OSX can I make a screen
 

00:16:06.969 --> 00:16:08.519
so you said OSX can I make a screen
saver using this stuff if you want to
