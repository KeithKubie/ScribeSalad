00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.050
The First Car Accident

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.670
Car accidents are a sad fact of life.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.200
Every day thousands lose their lives in collisions,
crashes and accidents.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.490
Though the car itself is a fairly recent invention,
the first recorded accident involving them

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.179
could have happened almost 300 years ago.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.450
Depending on what your definition of a car
is.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.250
Though it looked nothing like the modern cars
you see on the road today, the very first

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.790
accident involving an auto-mobile is said
to be one involving the creation of French

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.039
inventor, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1771.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.640
Cugnot supposedly built the very first “self
propelled mechanical vehicle” capable of

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.230
carrying passengers.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.800
We added that extra part at the end because
the first “car” (a word we use in the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.510
loosest possible sense) was thought to have
been invented by Father Ferdinand Verbiest,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.079
a Flemish missionary.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.860
Of course, as is the way with every single
invention ever, Verbiest was in China when

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.309
he invented his toy, because China seemingly
invented everything, even toilet paper.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.840
We’re not using the word toy in a chiding
manner either, Verbiest’s invention was

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.470
literally intended to be nothing more than
a toy for a Chinese emperor.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.470
As such, the final creation (if it was ever
created at all) was far too small to accept

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.060
passengers; thus, Cugnot holds the title of
creating the first known auto-mobile that

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.060
you could ride in.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.880
However, as noted in this Jalopnik article,
Leonardo da Vinci beat everyone to the punch

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.720
by two clear centuries in coming up with the
basic idea of powered transport.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.060
But we digress, Cugnot’s, fardier à vapeur
(steam dray), is likely the very first built

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.510
and assembled steam powered vehicle in history
that could transport a human being, though

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.130
it never actually saw widespread use.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.450
The story goes that some time in 1769 Cugnot
showed French officials his prototype design

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.320
for a steam wagon capable of carrying cannons
for the military; however, it wasn’t until

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.420
1771 that Cugnot had a working prototype people
could ride on.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.659
Cugnot then reportedly invited several French
officials to join him on the maiden voyage.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.630
During the trip, the vehicle careened out
of control and smashed into some unlucky person’s

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.870
garden wall at a nail-biting 2MPH.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.610
However, some historians question whether
this event actually happened, due to scant

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.899
direct documented evidence.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.260
To find a better documented accident, you
actually need to travel 98 years into the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.739
future to 1869.

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.230
On August 31st in the City of Birr in Ireland,
Mary Ward, a scientist and writer had the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.030
unfortunate privilege of becoming the first
known person to be killed by an auto-mobile.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.000
On that day, Mary and three companions were
enjoying a trip on a steam powered carriage.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.280
While in motion, the carriage hit a bump,
throwing Mary from her seat and into the path

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.440
of one of the carriage’s wheels where she
was crushed and instantly killed.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.510
Mary’s death was reported the next day in
the King’s County Chronicle and a formal

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.680
inquest was held to discover the cause of
death and whether anyone was at fault.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.319
In the end, the jury decided that Ward’s
death was nothing more than a terrible accident,

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.770
though the reason for the carriage suddenly
jolting and throwing Mary to the ground was

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.770
never discovered.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.120
This murderous steam carriage itself was invented
by the pioneer of the steam turbine and Ward’s

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.650
cousin, Sir Charles Algernon Parsons and his
brother.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.060
Remarkably, Parsons was only 15 in 1869, meaning
he invented one of the earliest precursors

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.980
to modern transport at an age when many of
us are just discovering girls.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.410
Although, at 16, Alexander the Great was busy
conquering Maedi, when they dared revolt against

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.190
Macedonia; also, at 16, a peasant girl by
the name of Jeanne d’Arc, aka Joan of Arc,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.920
was taking her first steps into historical
baddassedness by having the gall to approach

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.489
a garrison commander and trying to tell him
how to do his job, so take that Sir Parsons.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.349
Parsons didn’t just invent the death mobile,
he and his brother were two of the passengers

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.909
on board the carriage when Mary was killed.

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.420
Luckily for the world, Parsons wasn’t deterred
from inventing by this terrible accident and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.110
went on to contribute massively to the world
of engineering.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.629
It would take until 1896 for the first fatal
accident to occur on English soil whereas

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.470
the first accident in the US occurred five
years earlier than this in 1891.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.890
In the case of the former, the victim, Bridget
Driscoll, was struck and killed by an auto-mobile

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.890
going 4MPH.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.310
If you’re wondering how Bridget was hit
by a raucous vehicle powered by explosions

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.690
and fire travelling slower than most people
walk, according to witnesses of the time,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.009
Bridget saw the vehicle “zigzagging” towards
her and simply froze out of either fear or

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.359
utter confusion, which resulted in her being
unable to get out of the way.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.039
As for the first accident to happen on American
soil, this was decidedly less dangerous and

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.509
ended with all parties leaving unharmed.

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.139
The event itself occurred in Ohio in 1891
and it involved auto-mobile legend, John William

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.139
Lambert.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.610
The accident itself was the result of Lambert
hitting a tree root and swerving out of control…

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.900
If only he’d thought to invent power steering
first.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.860
So, in the end, there are two possible stories
about the world’s first car accident, it’s

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.110
either, “A lady was horribly crushed in
front of her teenage cousin by the invention

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.550
he created in 1869“, or “A Frenchman smashed
into a large stationary object, a wall at

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.249
2 MPH in 1771 and walked away unharmed.”

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.499
We really wish there was more direct evidence
of the latter, because the first accident

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:22.039
ending in a death is decidedly less humorous.
