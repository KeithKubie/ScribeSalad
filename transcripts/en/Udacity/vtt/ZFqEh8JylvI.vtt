[Sebastian:] Thank you Kathleen. I really appreciate it.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This code has a little bit more stuff than you just talked about.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It actually assimilates noise, but the noise filters are all set to 0,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and those noise filters are really important for particle filters

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so you can play with those if you like.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In fact, there's a function over here called set noise.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It allows you to set them,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then later on we have a function that makes kind of no sense right now,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but really important as we implement particle filters called measurement probability,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and this accepts a measurement and tells you how plausible this measurement is.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's kind of the key thing for the survival of the fittest rule in particle filters.

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So, if you look through the codes don't be confused by this function; we will actually use it later.
