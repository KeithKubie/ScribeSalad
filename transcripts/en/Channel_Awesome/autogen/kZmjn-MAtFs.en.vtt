about being a gay couple

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959
about being a gay couple
 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.550
about being a gay couple
it's just overkill um and I I have no

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560
it's just overkill um and I I have no
 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.380
it's just overkill um and I I have no
problem with that if they really were a

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390
problem with that if they really were a
 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.849
problem with that if they really were a
gay couple like that would be an

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859
gay couple like that would be an
 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.770
gay couple like that would be an
interesting story to tell but if you're

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780
interesting story to tell but if you're
 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.680
interesting story to tell but if you're
not going that route it just is yeah

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690
not going that route it just is yeah
 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.590
not going that route it just is yeah
just to overkill yeah and again I think

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600
just to overkill yeah and again I think
 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.960
just to overkill yeah and again I think
because really cuz the writing is so

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970
because really cuz the writing is so
 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.460

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470
good in the acting so good it's kind of
 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.870
good in the acting so good it's kind of
like what we said in the last one where

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880
like what we said in the last one where
 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.210
like what we said in the last one where
I was like that face he gave when he saw

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220
I was like that face he gave when he saw
 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.160
I was like that face he gave when he saw
the body of the old woman it's like we

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170
the body of the old woman it's like we
 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.810
the body of the old woman it's like we
got in that hit us so hard it's like

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820
got in that hit us so hard it's like
 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.039
got in that hit us so hard it's like
that's enough and then when you can't

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049
that's enough and then when you can't
 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:42.849
that's enough and then when you can't
keep going with it

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859
keep going with it
 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.009
keep going with it
exactly that's overkill on this one it's

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019
exactly that's overkill on this one it's
 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.140

stuff that's actually not really that

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.430
stuff that's actually not really that
 

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.520
stuff that's actually not really that
bad you know but I think it's because we

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:09.530
bad you know but I think it's because we
 

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.450
bad you know but I think it's because we
cared so much on everything else it's

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:12.460
cared so much on everything else it's
 

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.410
cared so much on everything else it's
everything else in this episode was so

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:14.420
everything else in this episode was so
 

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.920
everything else in this episode was so
good yeah that's part of it so um so

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:17.930

yeah I mean it again it's I would say

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.330
yeah I mean it again it's I would say
 

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.420
yeah I mean it again it's I would say
this is necessarily nitpicking as if it

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.430
this is necessarily nitpicking as if it
 

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.490
this is necessarily nitpicking as if it
was slow and I think people that want to

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:24.500

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.510
would probably say yeah this did feel
kind of slow and then I I have no idea I

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:28.520
kind of slow and then I I have no idea I
 

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.490
kind of slow and then I I have no idea I
