00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.103
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:11.878
Most places that we visit
show us only their beauty.

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.382
You opened up
and showed us your honesty.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.085
I will give you $50 to stick
your head under this blanket.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:24.390
Ew ew ew! (groans)
(laughing)

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:27.227
Oh, okay gang, I just got off
the phone with Carson City

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:30.363
and, uh, it's true
the FBI is coming in to,

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.566
uh, take a look
at the investigation.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:38.838
I make my own meats.
I make my meats.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.273
(smack)
He's a genius.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:44.043
The man knits sweaters
out of human hair.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.478
It's just got a really pretty-

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:48.581
Don't touch.
Don't touch the box.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.792
An unfolding scandal has rocked
this city to its core.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:06.733
Lieutenant! Lieutenant Dangle
the people have a right to know!

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:09.903
-Whoa!
-We got somethin'.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.405
(gasps)
Ah!

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.140
You know what
I think it is, Jim?

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.209
I think somebody
got stabbed in the back.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.012
You know I bet
if we'd said something,

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.848
he would have done this
in the nude.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.987
The likeness between Craig
and the Truckee River Killer

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.722
-is eerie.
-Yeah.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:33.759
But, Craig's also just one of
those little weird white people

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.394
who looks like a serial killer.

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.864
I got some great classic pieces
in here.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.665
This is for
chopping off fingers.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.134
I'm just kidding.
(forced laughter)

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.169
Hey guys, let me
show you this piece.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:50.443
He told me that he would
cut my head off

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:53.513
and eat it
if I ever needed him to.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.248
That's love.

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:01.320
You're probably wondering
why I'm not around.

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.289
It's â€˜cause I killed a bunch
of people!
