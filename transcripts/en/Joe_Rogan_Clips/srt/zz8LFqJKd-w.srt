1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,090
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:07,050
I start to wonder who is it
that's involved in this stuff.

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,900
I started at what it's where I'm at now.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,060
Is All we even capable
of belonging to groups,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,871
units,

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:20,871
tribes of free hundred million people or
60 million people with so many diverse

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:26,670
ideas. Is this a time to look
at federalism differently
to start breaking down?

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,310
Well, you know the, I exists
within this tribe of people,

9
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,500
but I collaborate with
all these other people.

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:34,650
I don't know how municipal action gets
done and how you run an army and build

11
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:37,260
roads if people are starting
to operate in smaller units.

12
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:42,261
But I am thinking that we need to have
a real sense of community and connection

13
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:47,400
and we got to let go of looking for ways
to object to and judge other people was

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,820
some sort of primary for way of
forming their own identity. No,

15
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:51,840
I completely agree.

16
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:55,560
And I think we're probably moving towards
some sort of understanding that a lot

17
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:59,880
of these boundaries and these clans of,
you know,

18
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,320
states and countries,

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,370
they were all established without our
consent before we're born and we're,

20
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:10,080
we're just, we're a part of a system
that we just were, we didn't agree to it.

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,010
We just all of a sudden found ourselves
in it and we're trying to make it fit us.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,120
Yeah, that's right. And there's aspects
of it that are appealing, you know,

23
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,000
like sort of June in a World Cup,

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,620
I've really should feel English and
for now like I feel a genuine sense of

25
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,820
connection and investment,

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
but if I'm being asked to live
according to rules that don't affect me,

27
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:34,290
that affect except for,
you know,

28
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,170
that for affect me financially and
don't speak to I am as an individual,

29
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:42,120
then I'm like, Whoa, what is this? This,
this is for my benefit. Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,180
When the inclination to form teams and
to root for your team and a root against

31
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:52,060
other teams, it's a, it's so
deep seated in us. It's a,

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,150
and it can cause so many unnecessary
conflicts for no reason. It's just,

33
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:01,470
it's, it's so, it's so
escapable too. It's, it's some,

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,390
so if you can objectively analyze the
way human beings behave and interact with

35
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,150
each other and go, well, why do we
do this? Let's just stop doing that.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,250
It's just if we disagree on things,

37
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:15,630
how much are these disagreements actually
affecting me on a daily basis. Dot.

38
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:19,770
That much. Can we just communicate?
Can someone say what they think?

39
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:24,240
And I say what I think and we just decide
like what makes sense and what doesn't

40
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:27,150
make sense based on our own
interpretations. Isn't that possible?

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,330
It seems like it's, that's the
direction we'd go ahead. And I did a,

42
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:35,331
as I know you've done a podcast with
Candice Owens who like on the subject of

43
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,610
individual, like when
she says stuff like, uh,

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,250
people should go over slavery
or it's as if it didn't happen.

45
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:44,940
I don't agree with that. I feel like
that has a massive social impact.

46
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,220
That is that those statistics
and not come incidents,

47
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:51,390
the number of people of certain
ethnicities in prisons and in poverty or

48
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,640
whatever. For me, that's
not just a coincidence,

49
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,470
but I said I couldn't agree with more
profoundly on according to social

50
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:02,320
criteria, some very, very
important issues. One in, in
a personal level, I fought.

51
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:06,140
She was absolutely delightful,
not so funny and sweet and she's

52
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,053
very young.

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,940
If you really stop to think that was
going only 28 which is amazing. Right?

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,793
Is that correct?

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,040
She's so much smarter than I was when I
was 28 she sent me a lot more confident

56
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,400
and not worse.
It's prettier to 28 or 29 same thing.

57
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,150
So when I was 29 I was a fucking moron.
Okay.

58
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:29,290
And no one would ever listen
to my opinions on anything
and on the world stage.

59
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,490
Yeah, we're listening to
her. I mean she's, she's
testifying in front of Congress.

60
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,324
I mean,
she's,

61
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,290
so I cut her a lot of slack with
some of the things that she's made,

62
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,790
like missteps on that.

63
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,540
I think sometimes when people say those
things like people should get over

64
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,440
slavery.
It's like,

65
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,450
it's almost like you're saying things
that you think other people want to hear

66
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,600
more than you're saying things
that are really rational.

67
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,520
So whether or not we should
get over slavery. Sure,

68
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:58,210
slavery was over more than a hundred years
ago, but the repercussions of slavery,

69
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,590
the echoes of slavery still exist and
they exist in all these different southern

70
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,370
states and cities and all these different
neighborhoods that had been a part of

71
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,170
systemic racism where they literally
forced black people to live in certain

72
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:16,150
areas and didn't even allow them to
buy homes outside of those areas.

73
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,140
They made laws and those laws are
in place in places like Baltimore.

74
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,520
And you know,
I had this guy,

75
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:25,690
Michael Wood on [inaudible] who was a
police officer and the city of Baltimore.

76
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:30,610
And one of the more profound things that
he said was that they found papers that

77
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:35,611
we're documenting crimes from the 1970s
in Baltimore and they were in this same

78
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:36,640
area,

79
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,930
the same crimes that he was facing in
the two thousands when he was a police

80
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,740
officer. So he was looking at this
going, what in the fuck? Like this is,

81
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,610
am I just a part of something that's
never going to be fixed and never going to

82
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,230
be changed.
And you know,

83
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,970
as he learned more about the city
and the city's laws and how these,

84
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,060
these systems were set up to keep people
in certain places and how the crime and

85
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,900
the violence and the drugs is all just
in this one concentrated area and it's

86
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:09,040
always been there and no one does anything
to change it. You realize like, wow,

87
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,090
this is a, this is a crazy echo of a
horrible past and that's what it is.

88
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,870
I had a couple of conversations that made
me recognize how powerful systems and

89
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:21,560
institutions are and their
ability to maintain themselves.

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,240
It regardless of any individual,

91
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,030
cause it seems like what happened there
with the man you were chatting to is

92
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:28,710
that he's an individual woke up, I'm
like, oh my God, hold on a second.

93
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,410
In some sort of weird grid.

94
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,000
And I spoke to his fellow called Ken Ross
who worked for the British diplomatic

95
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,800
service at the time of nine 11 and was
privy to confidential information about

96
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:44,270
how that was handled on a military and
geopolitical level and he said like he's

97
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,040
come away from that thinking,

98
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:50,510
well these institutions function and in
a totally corrupt way to pursue their

99
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:51,291
own objectives.

100
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,950
Disingenuity in dishonesty is just part
of the system and it was him that made

101
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:58,100
me think about Aneca ism in a
different saying that people,

102
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,540
the assumption that people if they were
not tightly governed with big government

103
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,040
and huge control would go around merger
in each Haverim raping each other simply

104
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,730
not true.

105
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,780
That's one of the means by which the
state continues to justify its existence.

106
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,110
People will behave better the closer
they are to self governing community self

107
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:19,030
governing committee and they sit like,

108
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,070
and I was interested in that because
he's talking from this is why sore on the

109
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:27,040
inside. This is how I saw it was running
like your cop friends there and like, uh,

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,560
another person I spoke to that had been
inside a system and then woken up within

111
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:38,420
it. Who was that? Yanis Varoufakis he,
when Greece had that mad revolution,

112
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:39,860
he was like one of the
leaders of the party.

113
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,290
Cerisa and for a minute
it was like Theresa said,

114
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,140
we ain't paying back all those debts.
You screwed us financially.

115
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,010
You screwed Greece.

116
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:51,011
So he was there at the EU meetings telling
like the German chancellery we're not

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,420
Perry Greece ain't going
to repay those debts.

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,340
And he just said that the way that the
system reassert itself was magnificent to

119
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,001
watch in a way.

120
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,420
And he said none of those individuals
have any power except the power that that

121
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,990
role gives them.
If you are the German finance minister,

122
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,390
you've got the power of the
German finance minister has,

123
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,340
you can't step outside it and
start going, right? Listen,

124
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,720
why don't we do this and
why don't we do that?

125
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:16,010
The system itself is beyond
individual decisions. You know, it's,

126
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,840
it's a self sustaining system.

127
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,320
It won't come up with ideas or
support ideas that freshen it.

128
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,150
And that's why I
continued to keep hearing.

129
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,820
And I'm sure you're having similar
conversations that if you are really

130
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,050
interested in changing the world,

131
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,010
you have to participate in systems that
are outside of it. Set up new ideas.

132
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:33,500
Don't worry about trying to smash
this one down with a hammer.

133
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,160
It will atrophy on its own as it
becomes less and less relevant.

134
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,550
I think also change yourself
and when you change yourself,

135
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,410
becomes evident to the people around you.

136
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,570
And if your change is beneficial
and attractive people,

137
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,580
they gravitate towards that idea that
you can improve yourself and you can,

138
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,530
you change your perspective on things.

139
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,170
Okay.
