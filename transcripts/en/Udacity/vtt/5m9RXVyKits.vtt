00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.240
That ends this section specifically
on Particle Filtering.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.490
You've now seen the algorithm
in some details.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.120
State and dynamics and censor models.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.110
And the really good thing
about particle filters is that

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.320
you can make them as
complicated as you want.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.500
But you can start off simple and
get something running.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.270
You then have to worry about how, how
many dimensions are in your state space,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.240
because if you get too many, then you
might have to have too many particles.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.050
You have to worry about re-initializing.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.970
We talked about that before,
of scattering some particles around

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.030
in order to you know,
in case something has happened quickly

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.370
that you didn't anticipate there
would be some particles there.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.220
But the good news is it,
it's really quite accessible,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.140
there's a lot of papers to read.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650
You can actually start with
that condensation paper.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.610
It, it really lays it out.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.060
In fact, there's a conference version of
it, that came out even earlier that I

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.180
think is even clearer
because it has less detail.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.240
So so I hope most of you will get,
will get to understand that.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.990
And certainly the OMS students,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.950
you will, as you will be
doing it on the problem set.
