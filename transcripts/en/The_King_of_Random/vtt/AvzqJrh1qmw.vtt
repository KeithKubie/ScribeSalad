00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.170
Hey guys, we are back

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.910
And I'm super excited because today's the day we get to rip open the silicone molds and see how our

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.180
pokeballs turned out.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.300
These have been sitting out for about a day and a half now and they still look really shiny.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.800
It almost looks like you could touch it and get sticky fingers. You can even see bubbles forming on the top here

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.080
However, this silicone has fully cured and should be completely rubber.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.760
Ooh, check this out.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.519
So this is our leftover silicone, and you can see it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.179
just peels right out of the bowl and leaves the bowl almost as clean as when we started. It's almost like a rubbery skin.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.730
Super Stretchy.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.820
Look at that. (pop)

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.570
Well as cool as this is, this is garbage and we can throw that away.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.119
The time has come to extract our pokéballs

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.980
and I don't think we're going to be able to get these silicone chunks straight up and out. They created a vacuum seal and that's

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.280
gonna be nearly impossible.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.400
Now to clean up these edges we can just take an exacto knife and just kind of carve around to clean everything up a little bit.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.109
Obviously, we're not going to be able to pull this thing off the bottom. So we're just going to take this and pull them off the base plate

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.049
Here we go. The hot glue served its purpose so we can peel that away

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.139
Oh man the friction. That's really tough. You know might be best if I just cut this thing with a hacksaw.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
There we go!

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.108
With your acrylic cut we can just split it open,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.130
set it off to the side and there is a rubber plug.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.608
So there we go, you can see we've got a solid chunk of silicone now

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.499
The acrylic is fully removed and on the bottom all we have is this layer of hot glue and then our pokeballs inside

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.899
so let's use something like an exacto knife to slowly carve away the silicone to see if we can extract the pokeball

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.059
And salvage ourselves a silicone mold!

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.919
And we gotta make sure we don't scratch up the actual pokeball itself. It doesn't belong to me. (laughs)

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.829
Making some good progress here

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.929
There we go. That makes me wonder...

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.419
Oh yeah, so looking inside here it looks like we did get some little air bubbles along the ridges,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.170
which is a little bit too bad, but it's definitely something we can work with.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.140
All right down the last piece here...

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.349
Yeah!

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.268
Alright! One side has released. We can get the rest of the ball out

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.689
just by simply peeling the silicon away and gently prying the ball back.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.360
We had a little silicone that went underneath that hot glue.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.810
And there it's released, in almost as good condition as it went in! There is a chance that even with these imperfections

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.409
we will still be able to cast it and it will come out fairly clean

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.120
So I'm just gonna stop there. We're going to call it good and theoretically we should be able to put this thing back together.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.109
And now we've got a little hole where we can pour in anything that we want and cast

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.060
ourselves our own little pokeball. I like having the rocks in there because it adds weight,

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.209
and I can probably just set this on my bookshelf and leave it kind of as a centerpiece. That's really cool.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.180
Now, we've got these two halves and when we press them together

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.869
It creates a little opening in the top where we can pour in anything that we want and make ourselves our own little pokeball

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.190
So this is pretty much gonna be the same deal as the last one, but I gotta be a little more delicate

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.890
There we go, I can feel that letting go now

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.450
and boom.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.580
There's our ball!

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.900
Salvaged!

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.080
Now this is kind of cool. Look down inside here and inside the mold you can actually see all the battle wounds the battle

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.719
bruised pokeball wounds which is going to translate into our castings when we make them. Just thought that looked kinda cool.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.059
There we have it! Mold number two good to go!

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.380
You see the thing causing this problem was the silicon is hanging up in these little gaps here

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.000
Those aren't completely airtight

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.940
Unfortunately.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.800
It still work?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.410
Still works!

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.139
Look at the way the silicone actually seeped inside the pokeball and collected all these rocks.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.209
Silicone has this amazing way of creeping into every place that is not completely airtight.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900
The nice thing is that it cleans up very easily and

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.769
doesn't make that big of a mess. The electrical cords actually got sucked right into the silicone,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.440
and now they are rubberized! (laughs)

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.290
For free!

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.510
Got almost everything out now

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.519
So this is pretty cool guys. Now that got ourselves a pokeball mold what you want to see me do with it?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.410
I had one idea I thought might be fun

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.579
So I went down to the store and picked up a couple of colored candles so all that's left to do now is take this

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.050
wax and throw it in a pot so we can melt it down, pour it into these molds and then let it sit overnight

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.228
So tomorrow we can open these things up and see what kind of results

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.869
they actually produce and if it actually works out

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.750
I've got an idea for a future project that might be a lot of fun.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.080
So there you have it guys we successfully extracted our pokéballs from the silicon and now we've got a couple of molds filled with wax

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.570
You'll find out in another video exactly how they turn out

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.229
And Devon you'll be happy to know that I got your ball back out scratch free, it's coming back your way. And to everyone else,

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.889
thanks so much for joining me for this experiment. I'll be looking for in the next video. Talk to you then.

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.969
You got the chocolate bar out and the silicone cleaned up, and now we've got a custom silicone mold for making snicker bars

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.560
mmm.
