I'm just checking in on you.
I am just checking in on.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,620
You've seen how your week's going. How's
your week going? Oh yeah. Really? Oh,

8
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:26,360
you don't say oh God bless you.
God bless you.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,040
God Love Ya. God fucking love Ya. Um,

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,970
I'm having a great week. Um, we just,

11
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:39,080
today we did the table read for episode
10, the final episode of season four.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,510
Doctor Dee Dee.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,630
Um, that's it. It's fucking killed. And
I think that we got, uh, coming together.

14
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:51,770
This was going to look like it's an
even better season than last season. Um,

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,790
amazing writers' room this year.
So I mean every year of course,

16
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,830
but this year went to another level,

17
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:02,500
so thank you to everybody helping out and
all of a sudden the clouds is stat and

18
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:06,280
a pot and old freckles.
I'm going to have time to aroma size.

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,290
You know, I docked out the, um,
all things comedy we're doing,

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,190
we're doing some business with the comedy
central, made some standup specials,

21
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:20,840
and then we have a, a sort of a
premium blend type show that we, uh,

22
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,640
been recording the last two days. It
shooting at I should say. And then a,

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,360
tonight's the last night.
Um,

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,730
where the fuck is that? I always
forget the name of that Damn Theater.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,230
Let me see here.
It's on seventh AV theater.

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,410
Seventh Av,
Los

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,030
[inaudible] Los Angeles.

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,060
I did a standup show there before
the terragon or something like that.

29
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:50,260
Is that what it's called? You
fucking asshole bill. Why the

30
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,140
Hell Tara Gone Theater? That's it. The
terragon theater. Um, does that it?

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,430
No, that's not it. Hang on a second.

32
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,040
The teragram ballroom,
that's where the show is at tonight.

33
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,330
And I'll be doing like a,

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,980
like a half hour after all the young
bucks go up there and they do their thing.

35
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,130
Um, I'm going to close out the
show with a half hour stuff.

36
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:22,900
Most of it new shit since my last
taping on my special. So, uh,

37
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,500
look at me. I got this special behind
me. I got the, this taping behind me.

38
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,630
I got the fucking,
my s my

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,050
efforts for families kind of getting
behind me. I've got to edit it for them,

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,540
you know, help edit it for the next, I
don't know how many months, but uh, yeah,

41
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,990
it's all good. So I don't, I don't know
what the fuck I'm going to do with myself.

42
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,330
Maybe get caught up on my reading.
Um, speaking of getting caught up,

43
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:51,040
how about your Boston Bruins last night?
How'd you like that?

44
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,090
Well, if you didn't, you're from
Montreal or Toronto. Everybody else.

45
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,630
That's what I love about being a Bruins
fan is around the league. People love us.

46
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,650
I've never seen a team when less cups
and have more hatred around the league.

47
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,341
You know what I mean?

48
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,450
You'd think we were actually successful
and so we want one cup since 1972.

49
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,420
Why don't you guys relax? All
right. What do you fucking boots?

50
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:19,900
Is there anything worse than listening
to somebody complaining about, you know,

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,050
physical play,
some of these fucking Toronto fans?

52
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,060
I mean,
I know Bruins fan is probably just as bad,

53
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,810
but of course I don't look at that shit.
You know,

54
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,610
they lose game two and all of a sudden
that they're putting out pictures of like

55
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,900
the refs wearing Bruins
jerseys. It's like, well,

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,520
were they wearing Toronto jerseys in the
first fucking game? You assholes. Um,

57
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,650
if we lose the refs cheated pool,
um,

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,460
no, it was another, uh,
heart stopping game where we,

59
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,190
I forget what the fuck we were up.
We went up like five, three years.

60
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,360
I thought the game was fucking
over and then all of a sudden they,

61
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:57,880
they closed it to like, I dunno, four
to three or something like that that my,

62
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,170
my daughter came down. I
missed a little bit of it. I,

63
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,870
I've just been catching it in
patch is a like patches of it.

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:06,790
Um,

65
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,080
even though I'm emotionally all in because
everybody in the house laughed at me

66
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:14,020
when the Bruins scored. How about
Marshawn sticking with that pass? Huh?

67
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,980
I don't know. I think he gave
it to, I think it was the
to pasta knock first pass.

68
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:21,100
Went into the Defenseman,
skates a nice play,

69
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,440
and then went right back on his stick
and they gave my day all right there.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,370
Fucking Freddo. Um, loved it.
And the shocker of all shockers,

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,160
Tampa Bay losing four straight,

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,840
give it up for your Columbus blue jackets

73
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,610
dire right now they're going to have a
long layoff in the big thing they gotta

74
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,380
worry about. It's a let down. I mean, they
gotta be flying. I after beaten this Jay,

75
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:51,150
but last time I checked, you gotta
Win 16 Games before your host hoists,

76
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:55,380
Lord Stanley over your head. I'm an old
white guy and I'm talking in Queen Shit.

77
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:57,250
Cliches.
Can't even say what I'm trying to say.

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,660
I want to how long you could
filibuster as a sports announcer.

79
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:06,260
Just saying all that cliched stuff.
Maybe by going out there,

80
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:07,340
I played like a team.

81
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,090
Everybody was involved or tell you when
you get all lined fire and good things

82
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,130
are gonna happen.
They went to the net and I'll tell you,

83
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:16,040
that's where the goals are. Okay? You
can't be out there on the perimeter.

84
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,920
Nobody's ever scored from behind the
goal except for Wayne Gretzky and you're

85
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:20,690
not Wayne Gretzky.
So I'll tell you why.

86
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,740
Now you've got to get your
fucking Canadian as Russian
ass or whatever the fuck

87
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,380
you are right in front of that Goddamn
now. Cause that's where the goals are.

88
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,080
Yeah, he's God. You have kids say
they're on the wrong side of the puck.

89
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,170
They trying to get on Instagram.
Make it a fucking degree of difficulty.

90
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:37,020
This isn't high dive. We're not high
dive in here. We're playing hockey.

91
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,513
Yeah.

92
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,300
If I see one more fucking mascot
and one of these Goddamn Marines,

93
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm going to throw a kid
down on the ice mark. Oh,

94
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,660
getting a lot of your anger route.
Um,

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,560
and I watched a little bit of NBA
basketball or watch some of the, uh,

96
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,650
the Boston Celtics, uh, and you know,

97
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,280
great game there. We fucking
won that game. But uh, I'd
be honest with you, dude,

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,780
I don't even know what the fuck goes on
in the NBA anymore. I try to watch it,

99
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:10,610
but uh, I have a theory on what
happened to the NBA. All right.

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,930
Sit down for this one.

101
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,050
If you want to hear somebody who was
picked last in gym class, tell you what,

102
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,430
tell you what's wrong with the NBA.
All right. I'm going big on this one.

103
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,830
I'm going to say it all right.
Michael Jordan,

104
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:25,340
the greatest basketball player
of all time was also, uh,

105
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:29,270
one of the worst things that
ever happened to NBA hoop. Okay.

106
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,460
The same way Eddie van Halen in 1978
with van Halen one was one of the worst

107
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:40,280
things that ever happened to
guitar playing in the 1980s.

108
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,870
All right.

109
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,490
And basically why I'm saying is when you
have somebody of their level of talent,

110
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,730
just an absolute genius,

111
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:54,731
they are so far beyond everybody else
that when mere mortals interpret what they

112
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:56,270
do,

113
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,270
they get it wrong because they are limited
by the talent that they were blessed

114
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,640
with.
So with Eddie van Halen,

115
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,680
I know I've used him as a
reference before. So many
people that came after him,

116
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,340
what they looked at Eddie and
they would just like take guitar,

117
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:18,341
Solo plays many notes as you can within
whatever the four bars that you have.

118
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,650
And then it just became noise.
The whole fucking,

119
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,730
it's some of these fucking guitar Solos.
I mean, I know these guys could play,

120
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:29,110
but like, you know, it's just like,

121
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,820
it's almost like you ever get cornered
in a party by some fucking coke head and

122
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,200
there's,
there's no back and forth.

123
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:39,190
There's no conversation that
just fucking punishing you. Yeah.

124
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,410
That's what a lot of those soldiers were.
All right.

125
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,920
And before Michael Jordan came along,
you had to have a big man to,

126
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,860
when you had to feed your big man and
blah, blah, Blah and all that shit.

127
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:51,910
And he came in with such a talent. He
said, not only do I not need a big man,

128
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm going to jump over your big man and
you fucking power forward and I'm going

129
00:07:56,561 --> 00:08:00,890
to sell dominate this game that
the rest of my teammates are.

130
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,770
Their nickname is going to be my
supporting cast nine oh one he started,

131
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,270
you know,
passing the ball and everything.

132
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,400
That's when he started
to beat the Pistons.

133
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,620
I'm not saying he was just
totally doing it himself,

134
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:15,370
but like all these people
that came after him grew up,

135
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:18,250
they wanted to be like
Mike and then not Mike,

136
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,440
but there's still play in that way.

137
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,210
So everybody tried to fucking
win and it didn't work.

138
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,310
So the fallout of that, I believe, was
then the pile on championship team,

139
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,940
because Michael set the bar at six
championships in the modern era.

140
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,330
If you wanted to beat Mike or be
as good as him, you had to win six.

141
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,790
And people just weren't good
enough to fucking do it.

142
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,080
So they just had the pile on teams and
it started with Colby and check with the

143
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:48,400
Lakers, and then you had the big three in
Boston and then the Miami fucking hate.

144
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,680
And now you've got the, uh, the Golden
State Warriors. If you watch it,

145
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,850
I swear to God.
And this,

146
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:59,851
this fall out of that is you now have
the person that's taken it beyond Jordan

147
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,740
where it's like,
not only do I not need my other teammates,

148
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,240
I don't even like being coached.
So you have somebody out there,

149
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,560
you know, people always, oh dude, he's
got like 21 points in the first half.

150
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,041
It's like,
dude,

151
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,660
the only fucking number that matters
is the score went down by three.

152
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,140
I don't give a fuck east east, this
person is, I just see these guys,

153
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,990
they turn their team into this
one dimensional, an attack.

154
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,670
It's like this guy's going to try to
fucking beat the entire fucking team. Um,

155
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,300
and somehow if you play team basketball,

156
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,810
like the San Antonio Spurs,
nobody pays attention.

157
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,860
And I saw this thing on Instagram showing
all these big stars that have since

158
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,930
retired and they go,
who do you miss the most?

159
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,070
And of course everybody's picking Coby.
I mean, he's probably, I don't know,

160
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,720
I would say he's gotta
be at least the top two,

161
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,690
one on one fucking players of all time.
Absolute beast.

162
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:59,520
And then you combine that with his wanting
to win and all of that shit. However,

163
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:03,030
sitting right in the middle and nobody
talking about them was fucking Tim Duncan

164
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,660
. And I might just be an
old fucking asshole here.

165
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:11,490
But what I liked about Tim Duncan is Tim
Duncan could win with anybody where I

166
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:14,640
felt like Coby could win,
but he needed everybody.

167
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,680
He needed like a zillion fucking free
agents every fucking year it seemed they

168
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,740
would just every three years they would
clean house and he would get a fresh

169
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:27,720
batch of some of the best people in
the NBA to play with. Um, I don't know.

170
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:31,110
So when I watched the fucking game now I,
I'll tell you,

171
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,210
when you got to declare his caliber,
you know,

172
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,690
he's going to have to get his touches.
It's like, dude, fuck his touches.

173
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,650
I was watching the game
last night. Okay. And uh,

174
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,660
what's his face, Reggie Miller.
We go into the fourth quarter.

175
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,360
I think we were up by like two points.
He goes, you know, for the, you know,

176
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,340
the rest of this game is
going to be all Kyrie.

177
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,420
Now maybe he was saying passing the
ball or whatever too. But I dunno,

178
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,390
I just hear that all the time and I've
taught, it makes me feel so old. I'm,

179
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,470
I sit there yelling at the TV like,
Reggie,

180
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:05,640
you don't believe that you
didn't play that kind of ball.

181
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,800
Even when you were fucking
destroy in the Knicks,

182
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:12,570
you still knew you had to play team
ball. I know. I don't know. Whatever.

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,920
Okay. I'm done with my old man rant.
All right. But I think that that's,

184
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,770
that is basically, like I said, I'm
done and I'm still gonna go here.

185
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,400
I think that that's what's happened with
basketball and for an old guy like me,

186
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,950
that's why I don't get it when I'm
watching it, I'm like, oh my God,

187
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
they're down by 10.
And that guy came down,

188
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:32,190
the court didn't pass it and just launched
a three and throw up a fucking brick.

189
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,830
They're going to call a time out and
put them on the bench and they don't.

190
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,610
It's just how it's played
now. So, but what I will say,

191
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,230
there are things that are
way better. Okay. Before I'm,
I'm that fucking asshole.

192
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,670
You know, giving you the global warming
speech about professional sports. Um,

193
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,170
in no time in basketball,

194
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,110
have there ever been this many people
over the height of six foot 10 that can

195
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:57,340
hit a fucking three pointer like a guard.
I mean it's, it's fucking unbelievable.

196
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,080
So there are whatever they're
out there are better things. Um,

197
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,870
I will tell you though,
uh,

198
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,230
NHL has changed a lot since I
was a kid and I actually, I like,

199
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,640
I mean I missed the fights. I do miss
two line passes in that type of thing.

200
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:15,160
But it's, it's a fucking
great game. It's still,

201
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,600
you can't have one guy go out and try to
just take over the entire fucking gay,

202
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,434
by the way.

203
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,680
How about a Vegan knocking
out that fucking 19 year
old can such a weird thing.

204
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:30,610
He's 33. He outweighed the
kid by fucking 40 pounds.

205
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,250
The kid asked him to fight. What's he
supposed to do? Jesus Christ again,

206
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:41,170
the old two piece there.
I felt bad for that kid,

207
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:45,490
but I also respect them having
the balls. You know, 19 years old,

208
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,390
you're playing in the NHL and you
take on a 33 year old Russian. I mean,

209
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,590
you got balls. I got
to give them that. Um,

210
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,870
I don't even know what that
series is at right now, but um,

211
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,860
hang on a second.
Washington Post.

212
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,730
Why the fuck does it say that?
Since when the hell do I look at that?

213
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:10,720
Maybe I looked at an article.
Washington capitals.

214
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,710
All right.
Why would I want to go to Wikipedia?

215
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,850
Why is that my default fucking thing
every time. Don't enough people.

216
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,081
Not Enough people.

217
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:24,290
Go to your Goddamn site that you got
to fucking directly right there. Um,

218
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,870
all right. Washington capitals.
The series is two games to one now.

219
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:33,250
It is fucking wide open.
Wide. Fucking open.

220
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,860
Now the Tampa Bay is, is out of it is
ever bet everybody's eyes fucking lit up.

221
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,380
What a story that would be of the fucking,

222
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,980
yeah.

223
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,920
Columbus blue jackets end up winning
the east. Can you imagine that?

224
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,090
I'm actually enjoying watching them.
Wanting just to see fucking Twitter.

225
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,830
Really smiling. I've never seen
that guy smile so much of my life.

226
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:58,090
When they went up two games to none,
he was like the smile on his face.

227
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:59,620
The way he was holding his hands together.

228
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,640
He looked like he was watching his
firstborn take their first few steps.

229
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,070
And as a recovering angry lunatic,

230
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,320
it's fun to see an angry guy
like that show. Just pure joy.

231
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,410
Um,
I feel like in his head it,

232
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,560
he felt like finally I drew up a
game plan that my team heard and they

233
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:26,860
completely fucking executed it to
a t and it fucking worked. I mean,

234
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,380
that's got to end.
It's gotta be Nirvana for F for a coach.

235
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:33,070
So that was definitely a
definitely fun to watch.

236
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,110
But I apologize to all the
young people listen to this,

237
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:39,010
be bitching about the game, but
those are just my theories. Um,

238
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,850
and as you get older, the more theories
you have because it keeps that voice out.

239
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,550
He had, that's guy guy.
You're going to die soon.

240
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,780
Keeps that out of your
fucking head. Um, anyways,

241
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,570
how many minutes have I done here?
How many new meds at the time for the,

242
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:00,560
the read already?
Fucking penguins lose four straight.

243
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,290
Now is that guy in the front
office? Uh, Josh, Anna Myers,

244
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,780
who's taping is set tonight,
uh,

245
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,700
from the goddamn comedy jam
and the 500 podcast. He's a,

246
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,850
he was telling me that, uh, the capital's
last year, it didn't pay their fee,

247
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,720
their front office guy,
that GM

248
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,330
and all he did was just lead them,
you know,

249
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:22,270
put together a team that led them to
their first Stanley Cup in the history of

250
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:26,920
the team and they don't pay him. They
went a little Theo Epstein, dare I say

251
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,430
number that Theo Epstein ended up fucking
86 year curse and they started fucking

252
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:36,510
with his money. He's like, I'm Outta
here. And then, no, no, no, no, no, no.

253
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,440
Then they paid him. Then a few
years later he was gone. That guy,

254
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:41,020
he's gotta be the greatest
a front office guy ever.

255
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,640
The guy ended almost a combined 200
years of curses and we wouldn't pay him.

256
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,700
Speaking of which, how about
your Boston Red Sox? My Gut,

257
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,430
all I've been hearing is the stories.
I haven't had time to watch.

258
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,520
Yankees are kicking our ass and
there in fucking last place.

259
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,680
A little bit of a hangover from
the world series party. Once again,

260
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:06,730
it goes to Wikipedia. Like I don't
know what the Boston Red Sox are.

261
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,750
All right, I know what they are. They're
a fucking last place team right now.

262
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,520
We lose five to three from the new,
from your New York Yankees and that,

263
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,200
that game, I believe we're
six and 13. I wonder,

264
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,530
you know how many fucking assholes at new,
at Yankee Stadium.

265
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,110
We're too busy under the stadium.
Eaton prime rib.

266
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,260
I just have to say as a fucking
baseball fan, that fucking uh,

267
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,570
Roman feast that they have for everybody
down behind home plate. It's just,

268
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:40,630
it's the fucking worst.
You're the New York Yankees.

269
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,050
You have the most fucking world series
titles. You have the most titles.

270
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,240
Anybody in the four major sports and,
and where are we?

271
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,530
Where are your fucking fence?

272
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,453
Okay.

273
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,440
Down there talking to fucking Rachael Ray.

274
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,000
We have a fucking celebrity chef
is down there cooking for him.

275
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:59,490
Fucking watching the game to stay
home. Stay home. You [inaudible]

276
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,070
I actually got those seats one
time I went to a game, but I mean,

277
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:08,890
at least 10 fucking years ago. I forget
how long ago that Steve has been around,

278
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:11,110
but it feels like it was like 10
years ago, maybe eight years ago.

279
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,760
And I sat down there, I just loaded up,
got my food and got the fuck out there.

280
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:19,990
And I watched the game and it was
ridiculous. Like the Yankees of course,

281
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:21,280
probably we're in first place.

282
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:25,620
And to sit there you felt
like they were like, you know,

283
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,260
already mathematically
eliminated. Um, I dunno,

284
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,040
that's a sad thing. And they said, well,
you know, that's how it is. It's like, no,

285
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,090
it's just greed.

286
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,530
It's greed by the fucking owners
where that capitalism thing, well,

287
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:44,040
you can't just be a fucking billionaire.
You gotta be a multibillionaire. Yes.

288
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,980
And uh, to the detriment. I don't begrudge
anybody, God knows on my tax rent,

289
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,210
I don't progress as long as
you pay your fucking taxes, um,

290
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,050
but grudge anybody making any more money.

291
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,160
But when it's detrimental to
your product out there right now,

292
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,380
that's when you got to take
a step back and, you know,

293
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,640
try to figure out what matters.
Um,

294
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,150
I dunno, I gotta I gotta fucking, uh,
I guess sit down and watch the game.

295
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,410
I have had a ridiculous urge now that
I have a little bit of time off here.

296
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,890
I mean, I'm going to Iceland during
this toy that goes from Iceland, Israel,

297
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,190
but I really have a,

298
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:27,160
I have a couple few weeks off in May
before it starts to get crazy again.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,420
And uh, I would love to go
to a fucking Dodger's game.

300
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:34,720
I think like an old man,
you know,

301
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,250
it fucking keeps score and
have myself a fucking hot dog.

302
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,850
I only wish there was a smoking section
if I could just sit there and smoke

303
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:49,980
cigars, God dammit. Um,

304
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,170
okay.

305
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,400
In hand with one of my cigar buddies
like Bert Kreischer, you know,

306
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,080
Brits always down to fucking smoke a
stick. Josh, Adam Meyers, you know,

307
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,023
um,

308
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,450
be a hell of a thing or Mike binder
who actually directed my latest special

309
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,700
coming out. And when you guys see
how fucking beautiful this thing is,

310
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,740
you might actually forget this shitty
material you're listening to and that's

311
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:19,130
what we're going for. All right, let's
do the advertising here. Butcher box,

312
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:21,310
everybody. Oh, before I forget,
I get to tell you the latest,

313
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,420
cutest thing that my daughter did, right?
The love of my life, the apple of my eye.

314
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,390
Um, I woke her up, right? I didn't
wake her up. She was up. Am I coming?

315
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,090
She's silly as hell and uh,

316
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,490
she's so smart and just keeps
getting more and more beautiful.

317
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,710
And I know I'm bragging is a debt,
but I'm telling you right now,

318
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,160
it's a good looking kid. So, uh,

319
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,480
I get her up and I'm getting a change
and everything. So I said, hey,

320
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,210
I go, you want pancakes for
breakfast? She goes, yeah, I go,

321
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,860
all right. I go, or do
you want a smoothie?

322
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,400
She looks at me and she goes,
pancakes and smoothly.

323
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,390
That's the first time she's used and
she knows to Lincoln or Smoothie as she

324
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:13,290
says. Um, I just gave her the
pancakes. The healthy wants to,

325
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,330
uh, that I've been making here. All right,
a butcher box, everybody. Here we go. Oh,

326
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:21,090
I love these guys. Oh, do I love
these guys and you know something.

327
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,890
I'm going to be cooking up some of their,
their heritage bread, pork tomorrow.

328
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,240
I got this, this recipe. I'm
trying, I'm one of those fucking,

329
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,420
you know when you're in line at the
grocery store and they have like a little

330
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:36,870
magazine that has like a,
just a bunch of recipes.

331
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,280
So this whole issue is dedicated to
just make it an entire meal in like a

332
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,970
skillet, you know, and they
had this great recipe for a,

333
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,780
for a, a, a pork chop dinner. You
know, you sear it on both sides,

334
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,690
up top and then you,

335
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,070
you finish it in the oven with
the heat thermometer did this,

336
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:56,860
you don't overcook it, dry it out
the fucking thing. Worst thing ever.

337
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,450
It's really involved and there's a
couple of reducing of liquids and putting

338
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,330
pork chops in a, in a, in
a, in a, an aluminum tent.

339
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,360
This is fucking involved and I'm giving
myself permission to only do an okay job

340
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,550
the first time,
but I'm going to get this,

341
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,570
this meal down and this is going to
be one of these meals that when I have

342
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,530
people over, when I'm entertaining,
okay. When I'm wearing one of my, uh,

343
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,950
evening gowns, uh, this is,

344
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,480
this is the meal that I'm going to pull
out to fucking impress people. Of course,

345
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:32,170
I'll make it. So, um, we,
I'm sorry. We're Vegan now.

346
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:37,120
It looks delicious if you're into
murdered pigs. Um, all right. Butcher box.

347
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:42,121
Everybody butcher box delivers healthy
100% grass fed and grass finished beef

348
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,750
free range,
organic chicken and heritage breed pork.

349
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,380
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

350
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:54,610
raising animals humanely and free of
antibiotics and hormones before they're

351
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:59,320
slaughtered. Each box comes with at
least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

352
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,980
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

353
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,210
Or if you're a fat fuck at a Yankee game
that I'd get you to the third inning.

354
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,860
Uh, you can choose from five different
box types, all beef, beef and chicken,

355
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,730
beef. And pork mixed box
custom box. Let you choose,

356
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,360
lets you choose your own
cuts telling you right now.

357
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I don't give a shit if you're
a fucking bulimic vegetarian,

358
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,700
you owe it to yourself. The heritage
breed pork man, I'm telling you,

359
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,860
it's unbelievable. Okay,
the butcher box difference,

360
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,130
but your Brock's meats come from
the humanely raised open pasture.

361
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:39,610

hormones or fatty fillers.

the talking points below. Well,

if you're fucking wrote it, I'm going to
read it. How long we've been in business.

376
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,810
All right.
Heloc sleep.

377
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,940

answers to match your body type and sleep
preferences to the perfect mattress.

379
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,470
Whether you're a side sleeper,
a hard sleeper,

380
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,330
like a plush or firm bed.
Oh, behave with helix.

381

384
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,980
Helix Helix can even split
the mattress down the middle,

385
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,050
providing individual support needs
and feel preferences for each side.

386
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,870
Let me ask you this. When you
fuck, which side are you on?

387
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,020
I think that depends on
who's on the bottom. Um,

388
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,440
doggy style would be confusing.
Both my knees are on the mattress,

389
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,330
so are mine and my hands. Okay, fair
enough. Honey. Your side of the bed.

Um,

402
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,500
oh yeah, I was too. I was telling
you Versie my uh, by the way,

403
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,510
Paul Versey is down in Raleigh,
North Carolina at the Improv this weekend.

404
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,250
And uh, catch him now before he goes
to the theaters. I'm telling you,

405
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,190
I'm telling you, I saw it. I
saw it at that set and God,

406
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,860
he's been absolutely murdering.
But I'll tell you,

407
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:38,840
it's hard when you're a half Greek,

408
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:43,030
half Sicilian New Yorker to go down to
Raleigh the first time and headline and

409
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,180
sell some tickets. Uh, go down there and
say that you were there for the first,

410
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:51,500
his first headlining gig down
there. Um, last I talked to him,

411
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,750
I think he was doing a bunch of radio down
there. So I've been a lot of, you know,

412
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:58,580
that he's, he's in town. Uh, but I was
talking to him on the phone about, um,

413
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,640
that whole theory that I had on like
basketball because he was laughing,

414
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,950
you know, he always laughs at me
because, you know, he's like the fucking,

415
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,450
and he's a kid to me,
you know,

416
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,020
wearing the Jordans and all that shit
and I'm this fucking old man wearing a

417
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:12,950
fucking Irish sweater.

418
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,790
Oh, I hate how true that is. And I was
saying like, dude, I swear to God, they,

419
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:25,310
they treat this stars in this, in the
NBA, they treat them like hot chicks,

420
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,900
you know, I guess they kind of do that in
all leagues, but I dunno, I have no idea.

421
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:32,480
Bill, please don't go back to
your stupid theories about a game.

422
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:34,880
You were never really that good
at. You know what? Fair enough.

423
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,800
Fair enough is my impression of
a fucking Laker Fan. Oh yeah.

424
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,410
Of Colby said bad.
How come he also won an Oscar?

425
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,660
Why does he have a fucking Boston
accent? Bill? Let me do that again. MMM.

426
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,370
Oh my God. If like
Kobe's is that bad, like,

427
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,520
you know how many Oscars did
bill Russell when golden globe.

428
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:58,394
Much.

429
00:26:59,680 --> 00:26:59,980
Yeah.

430
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,630
Then half time yet. I want to get
some botox. I'm sorry. Sorry La.

431
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:08,440
I love it out here. What am I doing?
Um, all right. Is that the podcast now?

432
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:12,140
I still got another three
minutes. Um, so anyways,

433
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:14,380
tonight and we'd be down with that
fucking theater. The ballroom there,

434
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,020
the terragon ballroom a,
is that what it's called?

435
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,020
I gotta look up ballroom.
Is Tara gone like a food?

436
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,150
I Dunno. No, that's Tilapia. That's
a fish. The fuck is terragon.

437
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,220
The Terra Graham is Tara
gonna Spice terragon spice.

438
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,840
Yeah, it is. All right. Okay. I
thought I was going fucking crazy. Oh,

439
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:49,720
I bet a lot of terror gun's been
putting in bags of weed before. Huh?

440
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,360
I wonder what it's good for.
Tara gone is so good.

441
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:59,830
If you have tingling in your ass,
just rub a little bit.

442
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,900
All right.
Terragon is a,

443
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,110
is a spices of perennial
herbs in the sunflower family.

444
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,300
I knew I didn't like them. It's a redhead.
You don't like anything about the sun?

445
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,120
Uh,

446
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,120
it is widespread in the wild across
much of your Asia and North America.

447
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:23,120
America. What is your Asia, is
that Europe infused Asia? Yeah,

448
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,630
and his cult is that the Middle East and
is cultivated for culinary and medical

449
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:28,860
purposes.
You know the amount of people,

450
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:33,130
if you ask them what continent
Middle East is in, um,

451
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,570
they would not guess Asia. No,
they would not. And then Turkey,

452
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:41,800
I believe is half in Europe,
half an Asia. I don't know bill,

453
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,690
but we're all half listening
at this point. Okay.

454
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:47,770
You're going to fucking shit on the NBA
and then give us what a geography lesson

455
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,590
via a spice. Nobody gives a fuck
about. All right. Fair enough.

456
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,540
Fair enough. Um, all right. Listen,

457
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,450
God bless. All of you. Have a wonderful
weekend. Let's go Bruins. Let's go.

458
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,320
Celtics Red Sox.
It's not too late to turn it around.

459
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,630
I'm sure ESPN is already
having the sky for it. Is it,

460
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,920
is it too early to make a move?
Uh,

461
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,160
it's still snow on top of the
green monster. Um, anyways,

462
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,220
there's going to be a little break here.

463
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:24,340
Enjoy some music and then they're going
to be another half hour bonus material

464
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,030
of a Thursday afternoon
just before Friday,

465
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,500
Monday morning podcast from a Thursday
earlier this year or from seven years ago.

466
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:34,060
Whenever the fuck I started doing this.

467
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,790
I'm sorry if this podcast
was a little bit off.

468
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:40,830
I was icing my calves the entire time.

469
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,310
Um, one of the things, I swear to God,

470
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,280
I didn't realize how fucked
up my God damn body is.

471
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,200
I'm still undoing 40
years. I'm talking, I'm 50.

472
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:54,034
Yeah,
40 years.

473
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,950
Cause I feel like the first 10 years
it's like a brand new car and you can run

474
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,900
around, do whatever.
Somewhere in like my teens,

475
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:03,901
I had my first threw out my back and
I'm finally fucking getting this shit

476
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:08,920
worked out. But uh, Jesus
Christ, dude, I swear to God,

477
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,360
my calves, the lady, she went
to put her fucking elbow in it.

478
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:16,960
I felt like I literally
had like a softball size,

479
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,580
like ball of Hornets in each of my calves.

480
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:22,770
Like I was like popping up off the table.

481
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,180
She had to take like this candle thing.
She like,

482
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,460
like I didn't know what the fuck it is.
Like she likes it,

483
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:35,170
it heats it up and she has to hold it
like a half inch away from the skin to

484
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:36,250
like melt up,

485
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,280
melt all of the fucking Gristle I've
had from years and years of just,

486
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:44,890
you know, nobody's stretched
in the 80s you just worked out.

487
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,330
I used to bench do all
the dumb 80 shit right?

488
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:50,800
And that's how I fucked up my shoulders.

489
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:55,540
And then I would get on a bike and I
would ride it for like 15 miles every

490
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,740
single day, 18 on Saturday, and then
I would take a day off on Sunday.

491
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,080
We'll your shredded bill.
Yes I was.

492
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,420
I was shredded and a but I never stretched
and now I'm paying the price for it.

493
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:11,470
Now I look like a fucking bald freckled
Mister Magoo limping around my house.

494
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,970
I literally sit down for like 10
minutes watching TV and when I stand up,

495
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:16,900
I feel like I've been,

496
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,830
you know that feeling you have when
you've been asleep for eight hours for all

497
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:23,440
you are the old people out there
of people beginning to feel old.

498
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,500
I've said this before in
the podcast and God damn,

499
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,390
and I'm going to say it again before
you get out of bed in the morning.

500
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,460
All right, take your toes and
pointed back at your knees.

501
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,990
If you immediately feel a Charley Horse,

502
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:38,980
just point your feet in the opposite
direction and it'll release and you'll be

503
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,040
all right. But pointed met
your needs. If you can,

504
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,830
I'm doing it right now. Oh,
it feels great, right? You
just leave it there for like,

505
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,740
you know, a good 30 seconds,
then go in the other direction.

506
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,650
Point in the other way to get a
Charlie horse that way. Same thing.

507
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:56,590
Just bring your feet back up
and it'll go away. Hopefully.

508
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,770
But I'm not a professional,
so don't hold me accountable here.

509
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,080
And then once you've
done those two stretches,

510
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,380
move your feet clockwise
and counterclockwise and uh,

511
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,970
and then get up. Don't get up. Cause
what fucks you up is that first step,

512
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,620
that first step of the day when
you haven't stretched and well,

513
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,000
what a way to start, you know, you know,
like, you know when you get out of bed,

514
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,420
you just take that first
step, right? You wake up,

515
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,790
your wife or husband or whatever, you
know, you don't want to do that shit.

516
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,570
All right, that's it. This is
a very old podcasts. You know,

517
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,920
if I keep podcasting like this,

518
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:33,610
complaining about sports leagues
and my physical ailments,

519
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:38,080
I think my next big advertiser is going
to be like Geritol did they still make

520
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,890
that shit? They used to always have
that on uh, the Lawrence Welk show.

521
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,600
If you do like these
ads for Geritol Geritol

522
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,170
is that how you spell it? Chevre.
Tall liquids. It's still exists.

523
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,510
What is it for now? The one time I want,
I want fucking Wikipedia to help me out.

524
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,350
I think it's, it's spying on me. All
right, well we're making him mad.

525
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,290
Let it go to Google.
Wiki.

526
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,570
Geritol is United States trademark
name for various dietary supplements,

527
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,240
past and present.
Oh,

528
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:18,990
see what they did was they
changed with the time and I see,

529
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,200
remember that I'm going to lunch.
Well, good night. Sleep tight

530
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,180
and pleasant dreams to you
is the whitest show ever.

531
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,710
There is a wish and a prayer for every
three become true. I swear to God.

532
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,130
Z on the south end of the show.
Yeah.

533
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,473
And uh,

534
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,310
two we meet [inaudible]

535
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,490
adios.
Or of wealth.

536
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:41,810
This is them like in a very
like passive aggressive way.

537
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,670
Like shouting out all the people that
we had oppressed. Avi does a night,

538
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,980
we had the, the, the Mexicans in
there, the French and the fucking,

539
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,230
the Germans right there.
What do we do to the French,

540
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,730
French and Indian war right there. I
don't know about near America. There's,

541
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:01,050
there's a, there's a, this it

542
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,880
America's like Tom Brady were like,
he's beat every team in the league.

543
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,620
I think at this point we've defeated,

544
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,200
we've defeated everybody. You know
I'm cool. Of course I'm kidding.

545
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,840
I'll tell you, you know what?
I'm Manny Pacquiao. Fight
his number. That patio, uh,

546
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,490
uh,
Floyd Mayweather fight.

547
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,940
That should have happened for 10
years and it never did that. That's,

548
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,110
that's the United States and Russia.
I think by the time we get together,

549
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,620
no one's going to give a fuck. That's my
prediction. All right, old fucking bald.

550
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:34,910
Freckled asshole. Thanks for cheering
me up. Fuck all y'all. I'm sorry.

551
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,390
All right. Enjoy the music
and enjoy the bonus half hour.

552
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,940
Have a great weekend and
I'll see you on Monday.

553
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,073

Monday morning podcast for Monday,

I was so focusing on saying
2011 clearly I fucked up April.

558

Did you catch that? I say April,

560
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,760
It's built bird is some money.

561
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,530
Morty podcasts for April 18th,

562
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,820
2011 I can't say without slowing down
like some second grader trying to read out

563
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:46,230
of his book. Greenfield USA.
Did anybody else read that one?

564
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,510
I was talking to somebody the other day.

565
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:52,590
That's the last geography class I had
in the United States of America was in

566
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:57,270
second grade. I read a book called
Greenfield USA and I loved it.

567
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,750
They talked about all the
different goddamn states, you know,

568
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:05,140
they talk about the heartland and
they'd show us a little pictures,

569
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,760
some farmer with the cow holding a bottle
of milk and I remember thinking, Wow,

570
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:13,140
I wish I lived on a farm and I had a cow.
You know,

571
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,660
my little imagination running wild.

572
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,400
Then they just cut it out and now look,
look at Americans.

573
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,850
You know,
we can't find shit anymore.

574
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,780
Someone was telling me the
other day they found somebody,

575
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,110
they were quizzing these college kids
and kids were putting like Delaware,

576
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:33,870
like where New Hampshire is.
You know,

577
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,150
that's like that to me that is a
fucking deal breaker. Like if I,

578
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:42,660
if I was dating a girl, right?
Hottest girl on the Goddamn planet.

579
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,410
And if she thought Delaware was where
was where like New Hampshire was,

580
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,263
you know,

581
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,120
I w I would end that relationship
within eight months because she's hot.

582
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:58,980
I continue fucking her and then,
uh, hopefully I'd get tired of her,

583
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,230
but in the back of my head it would
just be keeping this bitch doesn't know

584
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:05,160
where the states are. Well, why,
why would that matter? I mean,

585
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:09,870
everybody has the talent. Everybody
has their good side and their bad side.

586
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,750
Why did women just defend
every fucking woman out there?

587
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,610
Is it because there's more of you than
there are of us? Is that what it is?

588
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:22,790
You just gotta be constantly spinning
broad shit in a positive way as you guys

589
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:27,630
just sit there fucking battling with
each other, Huh? Is that what it is?

590
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,440
I don't know.
Why is my head so fucking itchy this week?

591
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,900
Um, are you supposed to wash your hair
every day? I hear different things.

592
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:41,880
You're not supposed to, are you? You're
supposed to let your natural oils produce.

593
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:47,280
Is that what it is? You know, walking
around like some stinky European,

594
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,750
you know, getting off your fucking
awful peewee Herman Bicycle.

595
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,460
What is it with Europe in
those old bicycles? Is He,

596
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:59,100
because you guys have such
small roads over there,

597
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,490
is that what it is that you guys can't
progress in a bicycle kind of way?

598
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,660
You know?

599
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,560
Is that why we win the Tour de France
every year when we go over there and all

600
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:09,570
those,
you ever see the bikes that they ride?

601
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,060
Even like the bikes that they
ride in the Tour de France,

602
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:15,180
the Italian bikes are terrible,
horrible bikes.

603
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,010
Just trying to get them going just in
case I have any Italian fucking listeners

604
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:24,780
over there. Bellissimo
Mangia Mangia you know, bad.

605
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:27,600
I want to fucking go to Italy
and just gained 900 pounds.

606
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,590
Evidently you don't because they haven't
fucked with their food over there.

607
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,240
I've been reading more and more about
food. Basically what we eat over is,

608
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:39,790
is it the closest thing to straight up
poison? I don't even think we're fat,

609
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:43,660
lazy fucks. I just think
they're poisoning us. Um,

610
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,280
like I guess the Pasta over there
in Italy is like, I don't know.

611
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,740
It doesn't gluten free.
Whatever the fuck that means.

612
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,130
I don't know what glutenous but
evidently you don't want a lot of it.

613
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,710
Your Pasta and their shit over there.
It's gluten free.

614
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,570
I don't mean,

615
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,320
I don't know if that means there's no
gluten over there or the gluten they have

616
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:06,940
is not oppressed like it is in this
country. I don't know what it is,

617
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:10,570
but all I know is those motherfuckers
over there, you know, they just sit there,

618
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,130
this eat spaghetti all day.

619
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,000
They have conversations with the shit
hanging out of their mouth. You know,

620
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,710
using that tie is a napkin
and everybody has a Ferrari.

621
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,520
Isn't that what it is?
You guys know what I did this week?

622
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,110
You know what I did this fucking week?

623
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,610
I actually went down and I finally
decided I'm getting a second car.

624
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,380
I decided, fuck it. I'm telling you,

625
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:35,740
that shit over there in Japan
really fucked with me. You know,

626
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:39,070
considering I live on a fault line,
all right,

627
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:44,320
I realize I need to live for today and
I also realize I need to be prepared in

628
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,550
case some of that shit went down.

629
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:50,200
So my first step in secure in my perimeter

630
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,590
is all of them. Good old boys do down
the south. Everybody makes fun of them.

631
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,420
Hey, we're all just fucking
stupid rednecks, right?

632
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,530
Those rednecks are the
smartest motherfuckers on
the planet as far as they are

633
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:08,610
ready for. When the shit goes
down, they're ready. All right?

634
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:13,140
They got trucks, they got guns.
They know how to kill Shit. Skin it,

635
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,710
gut it, cook it, eat it, fuck it.
They know how to do all of that.

636
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,220
Laid out a head for the hills,
man, they know how to do that.

637
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,170
They live in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

638
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,190
The great thing about living in the middle
of fucking nowhere is you don't have

639
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:31,110
that many games on your schedule. You know
what I mean? You live in the city. Okay?

640
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,400
You got a full schedule of potential
zombies and whatever coming over the

641
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:39,240
fucking Goddamn rail trying to run up
the stairs to your apartment. Okay?

642
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,040
I don't care how many
fucking bullets you got.

643
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,770
You're going to run out and
eventually they're going to overrun.

644
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,210
Yet they're going to take your shit and
fucking have sex with your dead body.

645
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,260
Jesus bill. Really? Yeah. Really? That's
how it goes down in the apocalypse.

646
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:54,240
Those rednecks,
they live in the middle of nowhere.

647
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,960
They got a big field
all around their house.

648
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,980
They got like 12 kids so they can
all look out every fucking window.

649
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,030
Who's kidding?
Who?

650
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,030
They can put four kids for their three
windows right in each window on all sides

651
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:13,350
of their little fucking outhouse, and
there's no way to sneak up on them. Yeah,

652
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,780
you got to crawl on your fucking elbows.
You're not going to do it.

653
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:20,900
You're going to leave him alone. They
live in the middle of fucking nowhere.

654
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:25,100
But when you live in the city,
that's when you got to get worried.

655
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,250
You know, unless you're lucky
enough to live in a gated community,

656
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:34,160
gated community. You know, why did
I say that? Pick up the papers.

657
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,750
Pick up the papers. You know,
the gated community, you know,

658
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,280
either you're so famous or you've stolen
so much from regular people that you

659
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:47,720
feel the need to live behind
a fucking wall. You know?

660
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,200
Have you guys noticed that on Google
maps that when you try to take the little

661
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:55,970
guy and bring him down into
a gated community, they
won't let it do it? You know?

662
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,780
Why are they so fucking special?
What did they do?

663
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,943
You know,

664
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:07,590
have you guys do me a favor? Can,
can you guys, my listeners now,

665
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:12,090
you should not do this.
You shouldn't do this.

666
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,440
I'm not advocating doing
this. Wink, wink. But, uh,

667
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,310
why don't you sprays,

668
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:21,450
paint something on the wall outside of
gated community that just makes those

669
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:24,660
people not feel so God damn comfortable.
You know,

670
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,350
I'm sick of them being Cousey smug counts.

671
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,060
Just sitting in there thinking
everything's going to be all right.

672
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:33,150
Just do something.
Don't do anything to any of them.

673
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,110
Just spray paint something crazy

674
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,730
like, hey fuckers, your next.

675
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,223
MMM,

676
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,060
where's the bailout?
I Dunno what the fuck.

677
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:51,050
Just write something that's vague
that kind of includes all of them.

678
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:54,620
So they don't know who's a target just
so they're a little bit nervous when

679
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:59,360
they're in there eating their gluten
free pasta that they have flown in,

680
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,753
you know?

681
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,170
Oh, so anyways, so you know what I
did? I went down to this, oh Jesus.

682
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:08,820
What the fuck did I just do?
Oh,

683
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:12,050
I thought I just hit that you were at
they raised button. No. So anyways,

684
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:13,200
so I went down to this,

685
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:18,201
this place where they specialize in old
mustangs and I went down there and I was

686
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:20,790
going to a, I was going to
order one and just say fuck it.

687
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,040
This is the year I want,
this is what I want on it.

688
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,840
Tell me how much it fucking costs and
I'm going to book some road gigs and uh,

689
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,680
do the level of Catholic guilt,
even though I don't even fucking,

690
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,880
I don't even believe in that shit anymore.
I don't believe in it.

691
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,813
Okay.

692
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,140
I Dunno if you go somewhere when
you die or any of that type of shit,

693
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,070
but I know all his fucking religious
stuff. Other than the basics,

694
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,630
the 10 commanded switch, you know, you
really could have made one commandment.

695
00:43:48,631 --> 00:43:52,500
Just don't be a cunt, right? Isn't
that what it's all about? Tapia can't.

696
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,270
Don't take the Lord's name in vain.
Don't disrespect your parents.

697
00:43:57,271 --> 00:44:00,450
Don't steal my shit. Don't fuck my
wife. Don't want to fuck my wife.

698
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:05,370
Don't be a content. What's wrong with you?
Hey, look at me. Yeah, you, you're a cunt.

699
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,050
Cut it out. That basically sums
up the foundation of every,

700
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,080
every religion and then
it turns into guys,

701
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,460
right? Buddha. I like Buddha.
That's a good one. You know,

702
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,700
some happy fat fuck just
sitting there all jolly.

703
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,580
Can't even see his dick and
he's still happy. You know,

704
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:28,920
there's something empowering
about that. Jesus. I'm not
into, you know, I, you know,

705
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:31,980
and it's not even his fucking pot smoking,
you

706
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,180
know, Goddamn hackey sack of
vibe that he's putting out.

707
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,360
You know,
his God damn

708
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:44,020
rope made out of Ganja. It's
not even that. It's, it's a,

709
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,970
I hate the fucking martyr
aspect of my religion. You know,

710
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:53,350
I did it for you. I hate
that shit. You know,

711
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:57,580
somebody slaps you in the face, you
turn the other cheek, do it again.

712
00:44:57,581 --> 00:44:59,500
Will that make you feel better?

713
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,160
Yeah,

714
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,760
the meek shall inherit the earth.
It's just,

715
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,180
it's just a blueprint for being a pussy,

716
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,320
you know,
fucking can't stand it.

717
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,480
And that is Jewish religion.
I don't know shit about it.

718
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,660
I just know when you get really into it,
you got to grow those curly Q Elvis side

719
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,780
burns and then you got
to wear that little, uh,

720
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,840
that little round thing on the
back of your head, you know,

721
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,200
and then wear the same shirt at the
same pants every fucking day or the same

722
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:33,240
style.
You know,

723
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,020
what are you fucking Albert Einstein or
you over there working on theories of

724
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:42,000
relativity. You're not, you're not.
Alright, go get yourself an izod shirt.

725
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,070
I had a little fucking color
to your wardrobe. Can you,

726
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:47,790
can you fucking have a little bit of fun?
Um,

727
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,583
what else?

728
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:50,970
Yeah.

729
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,200
Oh,
then the Muslim religion.

730
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:54,750
I don't want to get down on my knees
every day at four in the after I'm fucking

731
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,270
old. My knees hurt. I
don't want to do that shit.

732
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,920
I got to carry a yoga mat
around everywhere. I fucking
go and try and figure out,

733
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,270
you know, which way is South East
or whatever the hell hubspot I had,

734
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:07,740
I want to do this. I don't
wanna fucking do any of that. So

735
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,180
I think that's pretty much co Scientology.
That's the last one.

736
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,373
You know,

737
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,620
that one I would actually join because
it's just something funny about it,

738
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:22,150
you know, being a fly on the wall, hanging
out with that level of Weirdo. You know,

739
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:25,440
I think they're the weirdest.
I'd have all of them sign

740
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,560
ontologist just because
the fucking religion,

741
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:32,370
like all other religions were started.
They'd seems way the fuck back in the day.

742
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:37,700
So there's this vagueness that there's
no proof that it's complete bullshit,

743
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,270
you know?
But l Ron Hubbard has a quote,

744
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,690
if you want to make you want to become
a millionaire, start a religion.

745
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,840
He basically admits that he
kinda just made all this shit up,

746
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,940
said that he was the guy.

747
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,010
He did it in like the forties you know,

748
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,230
and they're all sitting
around there waiting for a
fucking spaceship to show up.

749
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,180
I just want to go down there and have a
really fucking intense conversation with

750
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:09,230
Tom Cruise, you know, and just
see if I can get them going.

751
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,783
You know

752
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,910
what I would do is I would just say that
was a little confused about a certain

753
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:18,840
aspect of my life, just to watch him go
into fucking motivational speaker mode.

754
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,090
You know, laughing maniacally,
you know, Scientology,

755
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,150
they got in all religions,
they have those giant cavernous buildings.

756
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:29,680
So when somebody laughs Menai maniacally,
you get that,

757
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:32,260
the fucking amazing acoustics,
you know,

758
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,760
I'll the same acoustic set or like a
Jimmy page's stairwell when they recorded

759
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:39,940
the drums for when the levee breaks,
you know, good. Those drums sound.

760
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,840
Just imagine somebody laughing
in that fucking stairwell,

761
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,880
you know what, should I add some reverb
here and give you a maniacal laugh?

762
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,680
That'd be too much fucking work. Um,
anyways, so this is what I did, the suit.

763
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:55,390
So I went down there to go a fucking,

764
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:00,340
see if I could get a Mustang and the
place was closed and then I'm driving back

765
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,850
and I'm like, what's that a sign? Was
that a sign that I shouldn't have done it?

766
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:06,760
And it's like, no, Bill, that's
a sign that you're a dumb fuck.

767
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,830
And he didn't check to see what
their hours were, so whatever,

768
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,550
whatever. So this is what
I did this week. All right.

769
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,150
I did a lot of shit this week,
by the way. Let me, let me,

770
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:22,680
let me remember before I tell
you that fucking story. Uh,

771
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:28,340
I did Kevin James
podcast this week and uh,

772
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,350
that is gonna be, I say
Kevin James. Kevin Smith.

773
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:35,860
I did Kevin.

774
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,140
Oh,
JJ.

775
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,420
That's going to be one of
these fucking weeks, isn't it?

776
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:51,510
I did Kevin Smith's podcast. It's
going to be uploaded today. Um,

777
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,820
he does actually. He did. He
didn't show up. He was sick.

778
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:59,230
So I actually sat in for him, which was
really nerve wracking because I, you know,

779
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:00,851
mommy where like what?

780
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:05,200
Like the ice capades when I saw him
in 1976 at the old Boston Garden,

781
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,180
I saw him in the late seventies.
Actually,

782
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,020
Dorothy Hamill didn't show up and we
were all fucking upset and they had some

783
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:14,350
other chick,
a substitute and everybody fucking boots.

784
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,400
So I was worried that these, these
comic book Reading Psi Phi Fans,

785
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,280
we're gonna boo me and
they didn't. Um, and uh,

786
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:27,160
fortunately, uh, Ralph Garman,

787
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:32,320
his cohost fucking hilarious.
He made me feel totally comfortable.

788
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:37,030
I did the show with him and that, um,
that podcast is going to be up today.

789
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,890
All right. See you getting to two
podcasts from me today. All right.

790
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,500
You're probably going to be
completely second, ma'am.

791
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:48,190
I am getting over exposed in the podcast
world. I did Doug Benson's last week.

792
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,541
I did,

793
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:54,070
I did Kevin Smith's on Saturday EHRs
today and on Wednesday I'm going to do the

794
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:57,910
Sklar brothers.
I'm making the podcast rounds people.

795
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,900
I think I am becoming a fucking
goto guest and the podcasting world.

796
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,170
You know, like back in the day
when somebody canceled all fuck,

797
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:12,040
we need a guest back in the day and the
tonight show who they go with. They, they,

798
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,970
they bring in George Gobel,
they bring in Burt Reynolds.

799
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,180
Dude, that fucking
cannonball run laugh, right?

800
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,080
That's what are becoming
in the podcast world.

801
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:26,780
I did Joe Rogan's like
fucking three weeks ago.

802
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,670
Who else am I doing? I think I'm
doing Chris Porter's coming up.

803
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,060
Ah,
you know,

804
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,280
I am just doing all kinds of free work
here in the podcasting world. People,

805
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,360
that's what it's all about.
Speaking of which,

806
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,150
speaking of which,
um,

807
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:52,580
I actually on the MM podcast
page for the first time ever,

808
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:54,650
we have installed a donation button.

809
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:59,200
So if you want to stop listening to me
cry like a cunt, if you'd like, you know,

810
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,860
whatever. If you want to donate to the
podcast, I'd really appreciate it. Uh,

811
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,330
cause this is a ton of work.

812
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:09,050
I do appreciate the fact that I do get
to communicate to you guys, but you know,

813
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:12,260
if you want to fucking
donate or whatever works,

814
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,510
we're starting to take this
thing to the next level.

815
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:17,240
I came up with the new
Monday morning podcast logo,

816
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,760
or actually at the real thing
is I paid somebody to do it.

817
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,230
We got tee shirts and shit like that.
We got some merchandise coming. So,

818
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:29,630
uh, so that way the podcast can continue
to be free. If you want to donate a buck,

819
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,700
whatever you want to donate, five
bucks, fucking six bucks, three 50,

820
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:38,840
whatever the fuck you want to donate.
If you go to Yemen podcast page, mm,

821
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,500
podcast.com it's on the right hand
side, just under the, uh, Twitter,

822
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:46,490
Facebook buttons you'll see
donate. Just click on there, uh,

823
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:51,470
and go right through paypal, whatever. All
right. Donation. Only just like a church.

824
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,120
Can I guilt you guys?
How can I get you like Jesus?

825
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,400
And he said it under you with
go fuck with yourself. Um,

826
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,060
and what else? I really gotta
get this shit out of the way.

827
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:09,410
I have to make sure that I do treat my
career like a business at some point here,

828
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:13,160
so I do have to hire a couple of
things here. All right. Uh, my pop,

829
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:16,300
my web guy said, remind everyone to
follow you on Twitter. He made a list,

830
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:20,090
a list here because I blow
this every week. All right.

831
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:24,700
Follow me on Twitter at Bill Burr.
Uh, I believe that's my Twitter. Now.

832
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:29,300
You know my fucking Twitter name. It's
either add bill burr@billboard.com.

833
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:33,620
I think it's just at Bill
Burr B. U. R. R. A. I tweet,

834
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,480
I talk about things I Twitter, I
don't tweet. That's the masculine way.

835
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,880
Let's see. Homophobic way of
tweeting you Twitter. What else?

836
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:48,650
Who also feel also tell them to feel free
to hit the share button when you post

837
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:52,130
videos on your Facebook page. Oh yeah.
I'm trying to get my Facebook page,

838
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,400
the fan page,
trying to get those numbers up.

839
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,720
Revet at 2,500 people since Tuesday.
We're trying to keep that thing going.

840
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:02,780
You know what people, I'm actually,
for the first time in my career,

841
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,640
I'm going to try to use the
Internet to my advantage. See,

842
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:10,670
up until this point, I really
had no game plan. It was like,

843
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:11,900
I'm just going to go on here.

844
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,950
I'm going to say a bunch of
stupid shit for a fucking hour.

845
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,650
And you know, if people like it, they
fucking like it man. And if they find it,

846
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:24,590
they fucking find it. And I
realized that, you know what,

847
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:26,460
there's nine zillion podcasts

848
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,030
out there. I need to, I gotta
advertise. I got to fucking,

849
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:33,240
I got to do what the fuck I gotta do here.
I'm finally realizing that, you know,

850
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,990
turn in 43 in Jude.
You know,

851
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:41,040
at some point I would like to,
uh,

852
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,330
feel that if,
you know,

853
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,800
I don't know what if I
was to lose my pancreas,

854
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:54,270
I could still have a enough money
squirreled away that I could,

855
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,970
I could afford oatmeal for
breakfast for the rest of my life.

856
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:59,040
Isn't that what everybody wants?
Don't you guys have,

857
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,970
don't you have a number in your fucking
head? What's your number? You know,

858
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,200
if you guys watch breaking bad,
you guys watch that fucking show.

859
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:11,220
Do you know uh Eisenberg is Mr. White?
His,

860
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:12,930
his big numbers 600 grant.

861
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,150
You can get 600 grand in cash squirreled
away into the bottom of his house.

862
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,780
If he kicks the bucket, his
family's going to be okay. See,

863
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:26,610
so I don't have a family. I got my
girl. All right. And I got my dog.

864
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,351
All right.

865
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:32,730
But I plan on fucking living and I don't
have a terminal disease like Mr. White.

866
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,710
Actually he's in remission on that show.

867
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,750
Sorry I'm getting a little
fucking breaking bed.

868
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,320
I'm going a little geek here
for that show. Um, excuse me.

869
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,920
What would be my, I have no fucking
idea where my finger would be.

870
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,850
Definitely six.
You need six figures,

871
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,030
right? What'd you guys do that? You know,
cause everybody wants a fucking house.

872
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,380
It's easy. Here's something
for you. Everybody wants a
house. All right. Oh wait,

873
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:58,990
let me explain that shit real quick
cause I don't even think I explained it.

874
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,290
I May, I may Facebook page, the fan
page. We're going to start posting.

875
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:03,790
Some are some of the funny videos,

876
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:07,240
the youtube ones and if you like them only
feel like, if you think they're funny,

877
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:10,510
just share them with the rest of your
friends and then hopefully they'll see

878
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:13,810
that and they'll be like, well, who
the fuck is this redheaded character?

879
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,570
And then they'll go onto my
page and if they like my comedy,

880
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,010
then they fucking add me,

881
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,950
you know?
And then maybe I can catch up

882
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,820
with some of the of these other
comedians out there who are playing these

883
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:28,820
gigantic venues with,
with uh,

884
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,990

the end of their shows. Right. People,

885
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:39,040
I want to sell out everybody that
there's an assignment for you this week.

886
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:42,540
Come up with a catchphrase for me.
What is something that I can see?

887
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,190
What

888
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,510
can I die? No Matte. What can
I say at the end of my jokes?

889
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:53,490
Huh? Maybe I can just do that path at the
everywhere with, would that be enough?

890
00:55:53,491 --> 00:55:56,010
And then I sell, Huh? T shirts at the end.

891
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,610
Is that what I gotta do you know
what this really is? People.

892
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:00,444
I know what you're thinking is,

893

fucking integrity in order to, this is,

894
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:07,530
I need a fucking vacation.
I need a fucking vacation.

895
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,540
It's coming up in June
1st two weeks of June.

896
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,840
I'm on vacation and I know what you
think and you're going to still do the

897
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:16,530
podcast, man, of course I'm gonna.
I'm not gonna leave you hanging.

898
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,190
I'm fucking, I'm gonna. I want
to go to the middle of nowhere.

899
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,880
I want to get a cabin.
That's what I want to do. Are

900
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,310
there any rednecks, listen to this shit
anyway. Can you recommend me some shit?

901
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,820
Who's going to be the first podcast
listener to take me hunting?

902
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:35,440
All right, and you got to know, I
don't know how to shoot anything,

903
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:38,950
but I will fucking shoot something.
I don't have a problem killing an animal.

904
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,200
I don't. If I'm out there, it, they'll,

905
00:56:42,201 --> 00:56:46,240
they'll be enough mosquitoes that
I'll be in enough of an ornery mood.

906
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,531
You know,

907
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:51,130
I already told you I could shoot a
fucking deer as long as it didn't have any

908
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,090
dear friends standing around or any
little kids, doe's whatever it is.

909
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,370
You know,
I was kidding.

910
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,830
Who if it was a really majestic
looking one with a bunch of fucking,

911
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,940
what do they call it? A 12 pointer or
something. I couldn't shoot that either.

912
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,650
We just, it had to be a stupid
looking deer just standing.
They have fucking just,

913
00:57:09,651 --> 00:57:12,650
you know, you could just tell
a bear's going to club it
over the head soon, right?

914
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,440
Isn't that how bears kill their fucking,

915
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,110
their prey and they
like picked up a stick.

916
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,000
They start bashing it over the fucking
head, like Hannibal Lecter. Um, anyways,

917
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:27,980
that he finished hype and everything.
Uh, I think that's it. Oh,

918
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:31,490
and this week I'm also going to be at the
PABST theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

919
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:37,100
Um, there's only a little as only a few
tickets left for that one and the Detroit

920
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:38,720
show is sold out.

921
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,610
So I want to thank both those blue collar
towns that I'm finally making my way

922
00:57:43,611 --> 00:57:47,230
to. I got there without having to
have a puppet or a catchphrase.

923
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,900
People very proud of that.
But now I want to play,

924
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,510
I wanna play Tiger Stadium.
So I need,

925
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,630
I need a catch phrase.
Everybody come on.

926
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:00,800
Okay.

927
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,170
And I'll try him out too.
I'm not beyond it.

928
00:58:03,171 --> 00:58:05,210
I will try them out next
week on the podcast.

929
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:07,040
Come up with a fucking horrific one.

930
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:09,323
MMM.

931
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:10,731
Oh wait a minute.

932
00:58:10,731 --> 00:58:13,580
Didn't what's his face already do this
Ricky Gervais based and he'd do that.

933
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,790
Did he do his show? He used to
watch that show. He was an extra,

934
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,740
are you having a laugh?
That's such a great fucking,

935
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:25,230
that's the perfect,
that's just,

936
00:58:25,231 --> 00:58:26,850
that's brilliant writing
right there that they,

937
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:29,460
I don't know if Ricky Gervais' came up,
but I don't know who came up with that,

938
00:58:29,461 --> 00:58:33,660
but that is just so fucking, that
is, that's just perfect Gad. Damn.

939
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,530
That's just where might even funny. Right
now. I'm just sitting here just fucking,

940
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,490
not just, you know, you don't
wanna do it right now. I am.

941
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:42,700
I'm sitting right now on my bed,
legs sideways on my bed, uh,

942
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,780
laying on my side with my head in my head.
You know,

943
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,290
like I'm posing for playgirl
magazine, you know, like the,

944
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:54,030
the Burt Reynolds pose back in the 70s.
Look at me, I think. I think I'm getting,

945
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,620
I think I'm getting a fucking ego.

946
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,440
Got An extra 2,500 friends
on my Facebook page.

947
00:59:00,441 --> 00:59:02,840
I'm telling people to follow
me on Twitter. Look at me.

948
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:07,970
I'm not even being funny this
week. I'm just hyping shit and a,

949
00:59:07,971 --> 00:59:11,600
we got to the New Lady,
Bill Byrd Tank tops coming out.

950
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:15,110
I can't fucking do this shit. All
right, let's plow ahead here. Uh,

951
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,090
let's get into the podcast,
shall we?

952
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,713
MMM.

953
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,490
I have so much shit to talk. I'm very
25 fucking minutes into this thing. Uh,

954
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,690
let's try to blow through this quickly.
My parents came to town this week,

955
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,920
this weekend, came out here to
visit. And uh, you know the deal.

956
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,750
You feel like you're an adult. You feel
like you're a man. You're a guy's guy.

957
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,710
You're driving down the street.
Yeah.

958
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:41,330
Hybrid with your fucking arm hanging
out the window and you made sure you put

959
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:44,430
sunblock on so he didn't get cancer
because you're a fucking fat,

960
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,020
right?
You think he got the world figured out,

961
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,110
then all of a sudden your parents show
up and immediately you turn into a kid

962
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:57,160
again, you, you want their
approval. So, you know,

963
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:58,240
I don't have any kids.

964
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,730
I don't have anything to show that I am
living for anybody other than myself.

965
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,230
I am living a selfish artist's life.
I play guitar,

966
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:12,970
I play drums, I play hockey.
I fucking tell jokes,

967
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,640
fuck it,
do whatever the hell I want to do.

968
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:20,320
I just sit around all day
staring at my both. It's great.

969
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:24,160
It's fucking great. I don't know
why the fuck you guys ever, I know.

970
01:00:24,161 --> 01:00:27,370
I get shows love.
I don't know why you ever gotten married.

971
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,460
I don't know why you ever had kids and
then you fucking change yourself to your

972
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:31,870
cubicle.
I don't know why you did it,

973
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,590
but evidently it's worth it because
everybody I know has kids goes [inaudible]

974
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:36,640
yeah.

975
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,640
I pluck a workout day and every morning
my boss comes in and slaps me in the

976
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:45,760
face with his tie and calls me a
bitch. And I say, thank you sir.

977
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:49,840
May I have another? Am I fucking hate
my job? Or I tell you when I get home,

978
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,100
when I get, Oh, and I just
see my kid. Yes. Vag. Yeah,

979
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,640
whatever they say all they fucking
horse shit. And the thing is,

980
01:00:57,641 --> 01:01:01,060
is I know it's true. I know it's
true. I know when I have a kid,

981
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,640
I'm not going to give a
fuck how I look anymore.

982
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,880
You know I'm not going to moisturize.

983
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,020
I want to be walking around in old
clothes and old fucking gym shoes.

984
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,530
That's my biggest fear. If I ever become
a parent, I'll just become a parent,

985
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:24,690
you know, and just dress like shit and
drive that old car. I don't want to do it.

986
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,900
Why? Why? If you become a parent,

987
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:31,110
why Jerry Seinfeld has Porsches,
what am I talking about?

988
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,430
See there's a smart fucking guy, you
know, we made his dream come true.

989
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,410
He made his half a fucking billion.

990
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,010
He got a fleet of Porsche's and
then he went down to the gym.

991
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:44,940
He picked out some check. I don't give
a fuck if you fucking engaged. Let's go,

992
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:47,250
sweetie. I got half a billion
dollars. Come over here,

993
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,940
come over here and ride my rich cock,
right?

994
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:57,560
Then he starts pumping out the fucking
kids. Late forties early fifties people.

995
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,620
That's if you're in your early
twenties that's how you do it.

996
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,820
That's how you do it.
You make your million first.

997
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,190
Then you grabbed some
bitch by her fucking here.

998
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,370
You drag her up the stairs and you say,
listen woman,

999
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:14,440
I know you want shiny shit.
I can buy you shiny shit.

1000
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,070
All right,
so make a decision.

1001
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,700
Go ahead and choose love. You fall in
and out of it during the relationship.

1002
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,820
You know it's gonna wear off
and that way you're going to be,

1003
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,240
you're going to be sitting
there and some fucking house.

1004
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:34,560
I'm drab ass fucking house.
Cheerio's in your hair.

1005
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:38,620
Bunch of little ones running
around. And then what? Oh,

1006
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,070
you could choose me shiny shit.

1007
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:46,440
You want a nice shiny kitchen counter
with the shiny fridge. You know,

1008
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,570
I'm 50 years old.

1009
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,490
I've been working for 35 fucking years.
I have no dependents.

1010
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,970
I can buy you the shiny shit you want.

1011
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:02,660
So why don't you come over here and
ride my half a century old cock.

1012
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,873
Yeah.

1013
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,430
You know,
take my fucking dusty seaman,

1014
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:17,860
fertilize you, and then we'll have
a couple of fucking kids you know,

1015
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,730
and you can be the one who plays with
them and I'll just sit here and a fucking

1016
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:26,590
old sweater rocking back and forth
going, I did it. I did it. Eaten pot,

1017
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:28,720
cookies, whatever the fuck I
want to do. I don't give a shit.

1018
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,900
I have enough money for help.
That's my game plan.

1019
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:35,050
People as I sit here in
a one bedroom apartment,

1020
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,870
my early forties and sweatpants
and a fucking tee shirt,

1021
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,770
I'm still holding on to that dream people.
Anyways,

1022
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,440
the fuck was so my parents come to town.

1023
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:45,570
That's what the fuck
I'm trying to tell them.

1024
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,340
It's what it's what really try to talk
about here. If my parents come to town.

1025
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:52,130
Yeah. And uh, so I don't have any kids.
I don't have anything to show him.

1026
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,700
I'm driving a fucking hybrid. Nothing I'm
doing is really that impressive. So, uh,

1027
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:59,680
what do I do?
I just start taking them out to,

1028
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,470
you know that that was the only card I
had the play. Look at all the cool places.

1029
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:08,100
I know where to go.
That's all I have people,

1030
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,490
you double my age.
I'm 84,

1031
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:16,250
42 years of living on this planet.
That's all I can show.

1032
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:18,050
My parents is places to eat.

1033
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,020
So I've been actually been doing
really good with the hiking,

1034
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:23,090
taking my fucking awesome dog for hikes.

1035
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:27,290
And then I come home and I have a big
bowl of fucking oatmeal, you know,

1036
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:31,400
and I have it the real way. I just
have oatmeal like of prisoner of war.

1037
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:34,400
Just swap it right in the bowl,
throw a little bit of raisins on it.

1038
01:04:34,401 --> 01:04:38,030
That's the only fucking excitement
I allow during my breakfast moment.

1039
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,400
You know, all you fucks out there
trying to lose weight. What do you do?

1040
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:46,120
You make something healthy and then you
fucking had your drugs to it, don't ya?

1041
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:49,000
You sugars, salts, put a little milk in.

1042
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:50,910
There would have been a
little cinnamon sugar. How,

1043
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,860
but I put a scoop ice cream on top of it.
What'd you have for breakfast?

1044
01:04:53,861 --> 01:04:58,800
I had oatmeal. I'm telling you
it's my metabolism. No, it isn't.

1045
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:04,540
You cheat and fuck. Stop putting up
the, the, the food steroids, India.

1046
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,240
Healthy food.
You got to sit there and yet,

1047
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,630
you know what you gotta do is
you got to get that fucking,

1048
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:15,090
you gotta get that, uh, that desire,
that craving out of your body.

1049
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,130
You know, like you guys do. If you watch

1050
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:22,660
my standup specials, you
guys realize that, uh,

1051
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,500
I have a sweet tooth. I hate that about
myself. Eh, but you know what it was?

1052
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:30,670
I fucking just stopped eating
them and it took about a week.

1053
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,120
Every night he'd be driving home going,
I want a piece of cake. What the fuck is,

1054
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:36,280
what is your, your, your birthday
bill. The fuck's wrong with me.

1055
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:40,150
I want a piece of cake or like a pint
of ice cream. I just wanted it. Right.

1056
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,800
But then after a fucking week, your body
just gets that craving audio system.

1057
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,420
Now I don't want it anymore.

1058
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,780
And you know what's funny is
now that it's out of my system,

1059
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:54,320
I walked into this place the other day
and they had to go in and get this,

1060
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:58,450
this three bean salad. You
know, cause I'm really,

1061
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:00,370
I'm trying to get the booze weight off,
you know,

1062
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,210
cause I quit Busan but I just kept
eating like an idiot. I'm trying to make,

1063
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,800
get my head back down to the
size it should be. Right.

1064
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:08,380
So I'm going in the order that,

1065
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,900
and I'm sitting there of course right
in the front, they get like, you know,

1066
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:13,030
seven different kinds of
cakes and all this shit.

1067
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:17,470
And because I wasn't craving sugar
like it looked, it looked bizarre.

1068
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:21,630
It looks like clown food, all these
bright colors and shit. Like why the fuck?

1069
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:25,810
Why would you even eat that shit? Um,
you know, the week before or find it.

1070
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,970
And it had some,
some bad food.

1071
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,620
I would have fucking bad my face
pressed up against the glass trying to,

1072
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:37,150
you know, just one, eat
half the cake, so whatever.

1073
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:38,500
So I've been doing great with,
with my,

1074
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,090
my date and all that type of shit
that my parents come to town. And uh,

1075
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,040
that's all I had. I was just like, I,
you know, I just started taking them out.

1076
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:48,850
I fucking had, you know,
a couple of cheeseburgers.

1077
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:52,780
I was eating a fucking
grand slam breakfast last
night at some fifties diner.

1078
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,850
Took him out to some French restaurant,
eaten beef Borgen y'all

1079
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:02,200
the Stewpot that looks like the
jolly green giant made the shit.

1080
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,350
And uh, I'm at that age a
couple of days, eaten bad again,

1081
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,970
like five fucking pounds. Now I've
got a big doughy white stomach again.

1082
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,590
It's killing me. So anyways, this is
how fucking hilarious my parents are.

1083
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,380
They come out to visit me in Hollywood.
All right.

1084
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,790
Where do you think they want it to go?
What? Tourist attraction. Go ahead,

1085
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:27,870
I'll give you a second to guess.

1086
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,750
What are you going to guest to go
look at the Hollywood walk of fame?

1087
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,280
All those stars on the sidewalk,
Mann's Chinese theater,

1088
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:41,010
Hollywood bowl, sunset strip. Go down
and look at the paramount studios.

1089
01:07:41,011 --> 01:07:43,470
Get their picture taken in
front of the Hollywood sign.

1090
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,690
Now you know what they want it to go.

1091
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,530
They wanted to go to the
Ronald Reagan library,

1092
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:59,430
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
How fucking awesome is that?

1093
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:01,343
You know,

1094
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,920
you know the deal on it.
Whenever you live in a city for awhile,

1095
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,120
if you live in Saint Louis,
every time you come there,

1096
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,730
what are people want to go to? The
fucking arch. You don't want to go there.

1097
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:09,570
You don't give a fuck.

1098
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,090
They want to ride that little
stupid elevator up to the top.

1099
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:14,910
You don't want to do it, but you
gotta do it. You live in New York.

1100
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,070
Douchebag wants to go

1101
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,160
to the top of the empire state building.
You don't want to do it.

1102
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,050
So my parents came out here
and I'm thinking, Oh God,

1103
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:22,580
I gotta take him to the usual spots.

1104
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,960
And they said that they wanted to go to
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

1105
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:30,810
And I was like, that. That's in Hollywood.

1106
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:36,360
They're like, no, no, no.
It's, uh, out west west of, uh,

1107
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,030
la. And I was like, you know
what? I'll fucking do that.

1108
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:44,860
I'll do that in a second. And I went out
to him and I had a great God damn time.

1109
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:49,630
Uh, that's something you ought to do.
You gotta go to a presidential library.

1110
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:50,411
It's fucking hilarious.

1111
01:08:50,411 --> 01:08:54,610
Especially if it's a president where
you were alive when all the shit that

1112
01:08:54,611 --> 01:08:56,050
happened went down.

1113
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:59,650
So then you can go into their library
because the libraries are hilarious.

1114
01:08:59,651 --> 01:09:03,130
I don't give a fuck who it is.
They are going to make that guy look,

1115
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,500
this is like the third library.
I bet at the JFK.

1116
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:10,060
I've been to the Richard Nixon
and I've been to the, uh,

1117
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,830
now the Ronald Reagan.
None of these

1118
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,770
where my ideas, I'm a, I'm a fucking
moron. I don't want to go to these things.

1119
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,630
I've just always with people
who want to go to this shit.

1120
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:22,290
And what I've noticed with the libraries
is they just make the person seemed

1121
01:09:22,661 --> 01:09:25,300
just like the greatest
fucking person ever. Like,

1122
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:28,840
evidently Ronald Reagan
was the greatest guy ever,

1123
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,900
which amazes me because I
thought it was Richard Nixon.

1124
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:36,220
And before that I thought it was
fucking JFK. They just, uh, you know,

1125
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:40,510
they had one part of it. They
had this whole, you know,

1126
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:45,511
that whole just say no to drugs thing
that they came up with was a miserable

1127
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:51,040
failure. I remember it. I remember
that people used to make yes, well

1128
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:55,690
just say no. Okay, well that
solves the crack epidemic.

1129
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:00,640
When somebody asks you for
drugs, just say no. Okay.

1130
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:01,841
Meanwhile,

1131
01:10:01,841 --> 01:10:05,140
we're going to cut funding for anything
that would help you get out of your

1132
01:10:05,141 --> 01:10:09,670
financial fucking problem
in the inner city. You know,

1133
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,280
and then the one viable commodity,

1134
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,360
the drugs which you either sell and make
money or you take to fucking numb the

1135
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:23,350
pain of living in a goddamn war zone.
Just say no to that.

1136
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:26,380
Just just say you don't want to do it.

1137
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,130
And then continue going
to an incredibly unsafe,

1138
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:34,360
shitty school that we're not going to
help to try to make anything better.

1139
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,000
So they, but in the library, it was
just an absolute smashing success.

1140
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:45,790
And they was showing her just say no
and her hugging some inner city children

1141
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,400
and the dress she wore,

1142
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:51,650
this is just the Nancy Reagan part
and that they actually, you know,

1143
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:55,000
was the best part. They had an,
they had to just say no board game,

1144
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:57,100
which I was trying to take a picture of,

1145
01:10:57,101 --> 01:10:58,750
but the fucking security
kept looking at me.

1146
01:10:58,751 --> 01:11:02,950
You weren't allowed to take pictures and
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

1147
01:11:02,951 --> 01:11:04,410
And I just wanted to see like,
you know,

1148
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,030
I just wanna I wanna I gotta
look that up on the Internet.

1149
01:11:07,031 --> 01:11:09,280
I want to know what happens.
How do you lose that game?

1150
01:11:09,281 --> 01:11:13,410
Do you like slowly become a junkie as
you play that game? Are they like know

1151
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,740
if the end of the board game
is there one gated community,

1152
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:20,250
nice neighborhood where you live with
all the banker costs and then there's

1153
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:23,220
another one where you make the left
turn and you just send some fucking slum

1154
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:26,760
that they cut funding to.
Is that basically yet? Um,

1155
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,600
so having gone to that and then the, the
Reagan thing was just like, you know,

1156
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:35,100
obviously I like to Shitty did where
he strengthened our military, you know,

1157
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:38,490
and then the Russians tried to
strengthen their mallets military,

1158
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,060
then they fucking went bankrupt.
That was a great fucking move.

1159
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,440
Ended up being the worst
thing for this country though.

1160
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:47,550
I think because you need an adversary,
you need one.

1161
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:48,780
Cause if you don't,

1162
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,680
then you just become a greedy cont cause
there's nobody stopping you from just

1163
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:57,050
fucking eating every piece of cake
that's on the goddamn table. But anyways,

1164
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,800
so I haven't gone to the Reagan won.

1165
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:03,830
I now want to go to the Bill Clinton one
because I want to see how they spin all

1166
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:08,310
that. Monica Lewinsky. I finger fuck
some fat whore in the White House.

1167
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:12,510
I just got to see, cause they gotta
address it cause he got impeached.

1168
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:18,300
He's only, only two presidents in
history have ever gotten impeached.

1169
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,300
It's him and some other fucking guy.
I forget the other guy.

1170
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,350
Everybody thinks it's fucking Nixon.
But he did.

1171
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,940
Nixon resigned before that shit happened.
He pulled a Manny Ramirez.

1172
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:30,420
I'm going to Spain, I'm out. See Ya. Um,

1173
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,790
but,
uh,

1174
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,800
I dunno man.
It was really,

1175
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:39,750
it was as much as I'm making fun
of Reagan and that type of Shit.

1176
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:43,050
Like, you know, I don't buy
into Democrats or Republicans,

1177
01:12:43,051 --> 01:12:46,020
they all serve the same fucking guys.
It doesn't make a difference,

1178
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:50,600
especially at this point. But it was
just interesting to see. Uh, I'd like, I,

1179
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:52,200
I'm still into the memorabilia,

1180
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,400
like the creepiest part of the Reagan
library is you fucking go through it.

1181
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:00,270
And remember when John Hinckley
tried to kill him, they,

1182
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:01,860
you walk into this one part,
they go,

1183
01:13:01,861 --> 01:13:06,540
this is the assassination part of
the Ronald Reagan fucking library.

1184
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:10,170
And you walk in there and there's three
screens all showing the exact same thing.

1185
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:11,760
And they go,
it'll start in 10 seconds.

1186
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:16,560
And they just show the raw
footage of Reagan walking out.

1187
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,020
And this guy squeezing up
six fucking shots. You know,

1188
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:26,550
Brady got shot in the head. Thank God
it was a 22 or is he would've been dead.

1189
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,740
But, uh, uh,

1190
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:32,190
a DC police officer and the secret
service officer all got shot.

1191
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:35,460
And then Reagan took one that
ricocheted off the car and caught him.

1192
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:39,810
So it's just the raw footage.

1193
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,580
There's no like, uh, you know, like
fucking Tom Brokaw go on tonight.

1194
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:47,310
Nightly News. [inaudible] good.
What'd your checking to be?

1195
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,480
Sure there wasn't any of that.

1196
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:53,481
They just showed it like you was standing
there was the creepiest shit ever.

1197
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:57,690
Just these walking out waving and
then pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

1198
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,720
And then everybody just died.
[inaudible]

1199
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:05,160
the car fucking drives away
and you're like, Jesus Christ.

1200
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,380
So then you walk into the next room,

1201
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:12,550
which is like 10 feet away
and there's no door. Okay.

1202
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,750
And now you're looking at the suit that
Reagan wore when he got shot and there's

1203
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:18,820
a bullet hole right in the fucking,

1204
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,930
the coat decided the
coat and then you know,

1205
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:25,930
the fucking assassination,
the attempt,

1206
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:28,390
the raw footage is
playing every 10 seconds.

1207
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,820
So now you're looking at the suit and
then all of a sudden you just hear pop,

1208
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,160
pop, pop, pop [inaudible]
here. And it just kept playing.

1209
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,110
[inaudible] it just was like,
dude, what the fuck? And I,

1210
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:44,350
that was the only part of the library
I didn't like. It's like a gut.

1211
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,680
Jesus Christ and I had to leave,
but the best part of the library,

1212
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:52,681
and I got pictures of this up on the MLM
podcast.com is they fucking had a air

1213
01:14:55,481 --> 01:15:00,430
force one,
a seven 57 the entire fucking plane.

1214
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,330
They had it in case within the building
and you could go and you could go on the

1215
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:08,380
fucking thing and they had the place
where the guys set with the, you know,

1216
01:15:08,381 --> 01:15:10,240
the nuclear devices turn your key.

1217
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:13,870
This is what blew my mind too when
you got on the plane is, you know,

1218
01:15:13,871 --> 01:15:17,380
now we're just starting to
get the technology where
US regular people can be on

1219
01:15:17,381 --> 01:15:19,120
the Internet and use phones and shit.

1220
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,360
They had that technology on Air Force
One back in the day when fucking Reagan,

1221
01:15:25,361 --> 01:15:27,430
Carter,
all those guys you could,

1222
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:31,360
you could pick up a rotary
phone and call the Kremlin,

1223
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:35,960
whoever the fuck you needed to
talk to on a goddamn rotary phone.

1224
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:39,230
So that means that their technology is
at least 35 years ahead of us that, that,

1225
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,600
that would be the only reason why
I would ever want to be president.

1226
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:46,150
I just want to see what,
like Obama's cell phone looks like,

1227
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:50,860
the capabilities of it, you know, anybody
was any of that fucking interesting.

1228
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,880
Um, all right, let's, let's move on here.
Uh, real quick and then we'll start.

1229
01:15:55,330 --> 01:16:00,220
I'm going to get into the whole
fucking, ah, questions for the week. Uh,

1230
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,113
oh.

1231
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:05,340
Coming up this next week, Tribeca
Film Festival starts and, uh, me,

1232
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:08,520
Robert Kelly and Joe de Rosa
have a movie that got selected,

1233
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:13,200
a short film called cheat. And somebody
sent me an email about it. It said, uh,

1234
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:17,340
hey bill, how you doing? So Dude, just
watch the trailer for cheap and man,

1235
01:16:17,341 --> 01:16:20,550
I got to tell you, it looks quite
good. It's really cool to see you,

1236
01:16:20,551 --> 01:16:24,330
Bobby and Joe and even dumb fos
doing something serious like this.

1237
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,150
Is it going to make it,
yeah.

1238
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,910
Run across theaters.
Uh,

1239
01:16:28,911 --> 01:16:33,410
what are the chances of it being on
DVD sometime? Uh, this is the deal.

1240
01:16:33,411 --> 01:16:36,100
It's just short film. So, uh,

1241
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:39,290
we'll probably try and put it
in other film festivals, but,

1242
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,410
um,
we're currently

1243
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:45,020
are writing a book, me,
Joe and Bobby and uh,

1244
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:49,220
that's based off of the movie and
the book will be out next year,

1245
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:53,800
beginning part of next year hopefully.
And in the back of the book, um, the, the,

1246
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,140
the full movie will be
available. So the, the,

1247
01:16:56,141 --> 01:16:59,540
the movie itself cheat will
come with the book and a,

1248
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:02,250
I can't tell you what it's about because
I don't want to ruin the fucking movie.

1249
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:06,750
So I'm glad you think that it looks cool.
And, uh, anybody in the New York area,

1250
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:11,450
please go onto the Tribeca
that I don't have.

1251
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:14,330
Of course, as always, I don't have any
information. I'll have it next week,

1252
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:15,470
next week. By the way, a,

1253
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:18,990
I'm going to Bobby and Joe de Rosa
on my podcast the first time ever at,

1254
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:23,660
there's going to be three people on my
podcast, a two guests at the same time.

1255
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,840
I'll see how I handled that. I went
out and I bought a third mic. People,

1256
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:31,580
I'm ready to do it. So, uh, what else?

1257
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,330
What else did I want to talk about?
Um, oh, how about the Bruins? Huh?

1258
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,500
How about the Bruins? Digging themselves
a fucking hole. I still have faith.

1259
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,370
I got to feel, and the Bruins are
going to go into Montreal tonight.

1260
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:46,890
They're going to kick the shit out of
those fake fucking Parisian motherfuckers

1261
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:50,960
up there. Um, you know what's annoying me?

1262
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:53,830
It's not even knowing me that we're
losing to the Canadians, cause I know.

1263
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:57,580
I don't know why people were picking
the Bruins to win the cup. I just was,

1264
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:01,610
was still missing at least two major
pieces to have a championship run.

1265
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:07,090
But what's killing me is they're making
Carey price look like he's Ken Dryden.

1266
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,260
Any isn't. He isn't. These are
the first two playoff games.

1267
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:17,030
This guy is ever fucking one and
his entire career. All right.

1268
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:18,860
The last time we saw
this guy in the playoffs,

1269
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:23,120
we beat them four games in a fucking row.
What's going on now is the Canadians,

1270
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:26,180
they have their, their forwards in their
defense when they're blocking shots,

1271
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:30,140
they, it, the Bruins, just a play
in the dumbest fucking hockey

1272
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:34,910
tickets. Slap shots. There's nobody
in front. He, you go, Carrie,

1273
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:39,260
is there enough ice between me and you
see can get a nice bead on this puck.

1274
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,120
Fucking horrific.

1275
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,750
And I know a lot of Bruins fans of
pissed that showered in play game too.

1276
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,030
They said he was dehydrated
and everybody went,

1277
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:51,020
all these fucking European players
are such pussies. Drink some Gatorade.

1278
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:55,280
I think that that they couldn't say that
he was puking and shitting his brains

1279
01:18:55,281 --> 01:18:58,580
out probably, uh, for 24 hours.

1280
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:00,590
I think he had what I
had like a month ago.

1281
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:05,480
So hopefully he'll come back and it'll
crunch another one of those pussy fucking

1282
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:09,980
Canadian players into the boards and
then they can fucking make a goddamn

1283
01:19:09,981 --> 01:19:13,670
federal case out of it. Um, I dunno,

1284
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:18,350
the series is not over. There's no
fucking way. There's no way it's over.

1285
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,890
I have faith. We got to fucking win. We
gotta win tonight. All right, that's it.

1286
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:26,870
And other than that, I've
just been watching the, uh,
these are my predictions.

1287
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:32,180
I think the lightning are going
to be Pittsburgh. I think. Uh,

1288
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:36,160
I think the Bruins are going to come
back and beat the Canadian sets.

1289
01:19:36,161 --> 01:19:39,910
My heart talking flyers.
We'll beat the sabers.

1290
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,620
Who else? These are easy to.
Troy's going to be Phoenix.

1291
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:49,500
Vancouver is going to be Chicago
and a way.

1292
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:52,410
What route do you think San Jose is
going to choke this year? Everybody.

1293
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:55,320
Do you think the kings are
going to come back and beat him?

1294
01:19:55,321 --> 01:19:57,240
I have no fucking idea. All
right. Let's plow ahead here.

1295
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,660
My finals are the obvious. I
think it's, I think the flyers.

1296
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,510
No. What about the catalyst? She, the
capitols of finally pushed through.

1297
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,070
I got a funny feeling.
The rangers going to beat the capitals.

1298
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,140
I felt that even though
they lost game one,

1299
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:12,780
I thought the Rangers were going
to come back and steal game too,

1300
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,290
but when they did and they went up two
games to none I, that's when I was like,

1301
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:19,380
ah, I guess the capitals are going to
do it this year, but now that they won

1302
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,090
game three, I don't know. I don't know.

1303
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,650
There's a lot of pressure on the
capital's lot of fucking pressure on those

1304
01:20:28,651 --> 01:20:32,820
fucking cuts in DC. All right, let's plow
ahead here. All right. Uh, very happy.

1305
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:34,920
Stay at home. Dad writes, dear bill,

1306
01:20:34,921 --> 01:20:38,670
after listening to one of your recent
podcasts and also watching let it go,

1307
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:40,380
I felt compelled to write in.

1308
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:45,390
I have major issues with stay at home
moms complaining about how hard it is.

1309
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:50,010
Oh Gee, age. Perhaps this
topic has played out,

1310
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,920
but I think my situation may
bring a new light on the matter.

1311
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:54,870
I'm a stay at home dad.

1312
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:58,710
I'll spare you how I became a stay at
home dad and just tell you that it's

1313
01:20:58,711 --> 01:21:03,090
terrific. I love it. I do all
of what you'd expect. Clean,

1314
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:03,924
do laundry,

1315
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:09,210
yardwork cook homework with the kids
and pickups and dropoffs and have no

1316
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:13,350
problem with any of it. Dude, that
sounds like a fucking vacation.

1317
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,750
Wouldn't it be art hanging
out with fucking kids?

1318
01:21:17,751 --> 01:21:20,150
I know it sucks when that baby's,
but once they become like,

1319
01:21:20,151 --> 01:21:21,200
just like little people,

1320
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,313
you know,

1321
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:29,290
and plus all the technology that they
have to fucking in case your children.

1322
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:29,891
You know what I mean?

1323
01:21:29,891 --> 01:21:34,450
Just like put up those little barricades
that you can make those little rubber

1324
01:21:34,451 --> 01:21:36,070
rooms so they can't hurt themselves.

1325
01:21:36,071 --> 01:21:38,880
And then you stick like the teletubbies
on and the lady that's like, you know,

1326
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,850
Lsd for kids and they just sit in there
tripping as you're in the other room,

1327
01:21:42,851 --> 01:21:47,440
making yourself a little
scotch. Um, anyways. Yeah,

1328
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:48,340
there's no boss.

1329
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,360
And every day is like fucking Saturday
you get to hang at your house,

1330
01:21:52,361 --> 01:21:56,200
she gets to sleep in your bone bed.
I know the grass is always greener,

1331
01:21:56,201 --> 01:21:59,860
but that sounds fucking awesome. Anyways,
she says, I'm a pretty organized person,

1332
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:03,310
so the House always looks good and I've,
oh, and I've always been a good cook.

1333
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,310
Now I'm an even better one. My, my,

1334
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:09,880
my wife comes home to great meals in a
clean house and at the end of her day

1335
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,730
needs only to eat, relax, and
hang out with our daughter.

1336
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,160
Another child is on the way this July.

1337
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:19,600
What does your wife do for a living
that she can, uh, support you?

1338
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,140
You guys live in Nice. That's even better
if she's got some insane fucking job.

1339
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,370
One of the biggest problems
with my situation is when
she decides to reclaim one

1340
01:22:27,371 --> 01:22:29,800
of the traditional female
roles around the house.

1341
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:34,830
This happens periodically about once a
month, usually less. It must be PR, uh,

1342
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:38,290
primitive genetic code that kicks
in every so often. What it does,

1343
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,910
my world gets fucked.

1344
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:44,740
Suddenly I'm told nothing is where it
should be in the kitchen and he and I and

1345
01:22:44,741 --> 01:22:49,741
we need to organize it or
that parts aren't good enough
or that shit is too high

1346
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:54,580
on the shelves. I have a foot
like a foot taller than my wife.

1347
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,290
You know what happened with this,
this reading here,

1348
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:57,880
I was just thinking
how well I was reading.

1349
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,380
Now I'm in my fucking head
and I'm screwing up. Just
try to regroup here, Bill.

1350
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:06,540
All right or worse when she decides to
go food come home was shit we don't need

1351
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:12,130
or we have never eaten before because
she felt we should try it or worse yet

1352
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:16,300
when she decides to cook a meal, her
cooking isn't bad, but when she cooks,

1353
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,530
I don't get the night off. My job is to
show her where everything is, spices,

1354
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:25,420
dry goods, pots, et Cetera, and also
to reach shit she can, when she's done,

1355
01:23:25,421 --> 01:23:28,840
I spend the next day reorganizing
everything to my liking. Dude,

1356
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:30,430
you gotta be like a broad there.

1357
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:34,900
You've got to claim the kitchen
that don't go around moving things.

1358
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:37,630
I have everything where I need it
just shoots. You'll get out of here,

1359
01:23:37,631 --> 01:23:42,010
I'll do this. That's what you gotta do.
Your problem is, is you're letting her in.

1360
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:45,880
See Women can shoe guys out of the
kitchen because we don't usually,

1361
01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:48,880
most guys don't want to be in there and
in the end we always try to keep it in a

1362
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:51,880
good mood. So maybe you'll blow
us that night. You know, women,

1363
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:53,800
they don't have that kind of sex drive,
you know?

1364
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:57,220
And plus they always have the option of
bag and someone at work if they want to,

1365
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:58,330
you know,

1366
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:02,800
with absolutely no game whatsoever other
than just fucking wearing some hoary

1367
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:06,910
shoes and hiking her skirt up that are
even needed an open in line. You know,

1368
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,410
their lives are so fucking easy other
than fucking having to squeeze a kid out.

1369
01:24:11,411 --> 01:24:14,440
That's the one thing I'll give
you those nine months of hell.

1370
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,000
But you get paid back.

1371
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:19,810
You get to tee off 12 to fucking 20
yards in front of me at the golf course.

1372
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,140
People hold doors for you.
You don't have to pay for a movie.

1373
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,960
You show a little cleavage,
you get free drinks all night.

1374
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:29,740
What the fuck are you broads bitching
about? All right, plow ahead here. Um,

1375
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:34,210
so anyways, he goes, I don't go to her
office rearranging Shit on occasion.

1376
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,120
On the occasions I dropped by.
Oh Jesus.

1377
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:41,500
So don't laugh at me when I tell you
certain things go in certain areas of the

1378
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:45,490
fridge and wide sneeze. Oh No, I do it. I
totally get it. I'm not giving you shit.

1379
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,390
He said, I used to complain
out loud to her about it.

1380
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:52,780
Now I just grin and bear it on occasion.
On occasion it happens.

1381
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:56,320
I figured it's better not to rock,
rock the boat less.

1382
01:24:56,321 --> 01:25:00,460
She wises up and sees how good I have it.
Dude,

1383
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:04,710
you live in the fucking life.
You know what you are, dude.

1384
01:25:04,711 --> 01:25:07,920
You're basically retired
and your wife is out there.

1385
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:09,500
Yeah,

1386
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,150
providing your your pension.

1387
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,660
I think that's phenomenal.

1388
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:20,500
I think that is absolutely phenomenal
and I don't know why more women don't

1389
01:25:20,721 --> 01:25:24,770
enjoy being stay at home. Mom said, I'm
not trying to be as chauvinist pig here,

1390
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:30,620
you know? Okay. Those first
few years suck without a doubt.

1391
01:25:30,621 --> 01:25:34,670
But then you've got to understand
once they, they, they go to school,

1392
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,251
all right,
late.

1393
01:25:37,251 --> 01:25:40,670
They take start going to school
at nine and they get off at three.

1394
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:46,270
You got six hours in the middle of the
day to do whatever the fuck you want to

1395
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:47,530
do and you know something.

1396
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,510
And that's one of those classic points
that you bring up to women or stay at

1397
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:56,530
home moms and they freak the fuck
out. And then they go, oh, you know,

1398
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,780
then they try to make
those six hours difficult,

1399
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:02,830
like all the fucking shit they have to
do. It's like, what do you have to do?

1400
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:08,240
What exactly do you have to do?
You got the kids dressed and you fed him.

1401
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,370
Now he's just fucking school.

1402
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:13,340
Someone else's watching the
kid for the next six hours.

1403
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:17,600
What exactly is it that you
have to fucking do laundry?

1404
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,371
Oh my God,

1405
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:24,371
that that's gotta be so difficult
to separate whites from the darks.

1406
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:29,270
Stick it in a fucking machine and press
a button and have it clean it for you.

1407
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:33,610
Where? Where is the, you just, if,

1408
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:38,270
if those six hours aren't enough for you,
you're just creating work for yourself.

1409
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,273
You know,

1410
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,560
you can actually be sitting on the
couch drinking a margarita as a machine

1411
01:26:45,561 --> 01:26:49,400
washes the fucking clothes.
It's not that big a fucking deal.

1412
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,313
It really isn't.

1413
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,460
Go out food shopping and you get to
go out during the day when there's no

1414
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,040
traffic and there's nobody around.
You go to the post office.

1415
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:02,390
He just sort of putz around town.
Your little Mayberry town.

1416
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:07,100
That's a fucking dream, you know? I Dunno.

1417
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,330
I just think that,
you know,

1418
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:12,440
that just seems like a
fucking awesome life.

1419
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:16,400
And then the kids come home and it gets
loud or whatever, but they, your kids,

1420
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:20,120
you love them.
You make them fucking sandwiches,

1421
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:24,200
you know? And then, then what? I
mean, how much longer do they go?

1422
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:28,580
You put into bed by fucking eight.
They get home at like, what, three 30

1423
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:34,430
I just don't understand what, what,
what, what the big fucking deal is.

1424
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,750
I just don't get it. I really
don't get it. Somebody, please,

1425
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:43,310
if you don't understand,
if every fucking day,

1426
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:47,570
that's another thing too. And the at
the, at the end of all of that bitching,

1427
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:52,220
it's like, well, you didn't
have to be a mom. You know?

1428
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,550
It's very easy. There's
condoms, there's the pill,

1429
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:57,290
there's a whole bunch of prophylactics,

1430
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,030
all different kinds that
you can choose from.

1431
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:02,140
You fucking chose the job and
now you're bitching about it.

1432
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:06,770
What is your fucking problem?
Jesus Christ. If you want,

1433
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:07,880
you don't want to go food shopping,

1434
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:12,950
just go buy a jar of peanut peanut
butter in a big giant jar of jelly,

1435
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,700
peanut butter jelly sandwiches.
They you go bang.

1436
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:20,030
You could do that like three,
four times a week.

1437
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:24,110
They don't give a fuck big glass of milk,
some cheese and crackers.

1438
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:28,360
Why? You're overthinking it ladies.
You're over fucking thinking that.

1439
01:28:28,361 --> 01:28:30,170
I really don't.
I don't think it's so fucking hard.

1440
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:34,970
I think you guys are full of Shit.
You know what it is?

1441
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:39,971
Just like how this guy said at the end
of his email where he's just sitting

1442
01:28:40,701 --> 01:28:44,000
there grinning and bearing it and he
doesn't want to rock the boat less.

1443
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:46,040
She wises up to see how good he has it.

1444
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:47,990
I think that that's why
those stay at home moms.

1445
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:51,200
I'm not talking about working moms
and talking about stay at home moms.

1446
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:55,670
I think that that's why they complain
that much. Um, the only complaint

1447
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,190
there are aspects.

1448
01:28:58,191 --> 01:29:01,650
I do understand the fact that you guys
sit there and talk and Gugu Gaga talked

1449
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,840
the whole fucking day and you just
want to hang out with an adult.

1450
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:07,680
At some point that would drive me
a little bet shit. But you know,

1451
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:12,681
everything has its ups and downs and I
just don't see the fucking downside is

1452
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:17,580
being that that steep with that job.
I really don't.

1453
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:22,920
Um, anyways, sitting, they
make it macaroni trees

1454
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:24,983
get out,

1455
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:29,150
taking them to the fucking playground
and pushing them on a swing. I mean,

1456
01:29:29,151 --> 01:29:32,900
how difficult is that?
That's difficult.

1457
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:34,760
That's harder than sitting in a cubicle,

1458
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,190
having somebody coming over
and telling you what to do.

1459
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,890
Did you ever think what's great about
being a stay at home mom is you're your

1460
01:29:39,891 --> 01:29:44,340
own fucking boss. Nobody's telling
you what to do. Nobody's 10.

1461
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:46,940
Don't even fucking tell me your kids
are telling you what to do. Okay?

1462
01:29:46,941 --> 01:29:50,480
Get your Goddamn kids in order. All right.
That's what they invented sticks for.

1463
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:53,023
You know,

1464
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:57,070
slap him around a little bit.
You put the fear of death in them

1465
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:02,490
and then they shut the fuck up. That's
what my mom used to do. She had a paddle.

1466
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,890
My Dad went to who was a
member of a fraternity.

1467
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,140
He saved the paddle and we would decks.

1468
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:10,110
My mother would line all of us up and
she beat the shit out of all of us.

1469
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,490
And you just be standing there in line
waiting for the fucking beaten to come.

1470
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,400
Right.

1471
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:20,040
Then you'd always try to block it with
your hand and fucking smashing knuckles

1472
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:24,390
and then she'd send us all the bed.
That was like her break.

1473
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:27,690
She do that once a day and like the
afternoon, that was her afternoon break.

1474
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:30,570
She'd send us to bed and
then we'd go upstairs crying,

1475
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:35,550
all sweaty and crying and shit and sticky
from whatever the fuck we just spilled.

1476
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,480
That caused her to kick the shit
out of us. And then, you know,

1477
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:40,590
we'll be up there 10 minutes,
then we just fall asleep.

1478
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,433
That was it.

1479
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:48,540
I ain't, what the fuck I'm talking about.
All right. As Bill Promise. You say, Bill,

1480
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:51,690
I'm a senior in high school and have
not been to any of my school functions.

1481
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:55,770
I've been there, sir. I've
been there. I didn't go there.

1482
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:58,920
I went to my senior prom. I didn't
go to any of the other ones. Uh,

1483
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:03,500
I was a fucking orange haired freak
in high school. Um, and I didn't,

1484
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:05,100
I didn't even have the
courage to ask anybody out.

1485
01:31:05,101 --> 01:31:07,200
I just saw what was in the
mirror and I was just like,

1486
01:31:07,201 --> 01:31:10,770
I'm not going to do this to somebody else.
Why would I put this on someone else?

1487
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:14,640
Um, I have never been to a school dance
and only a few football games at my high

1488
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:15,630
school career.
Dude,

1489
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:18,870
did I write this in a drunken stupor at
that sounds like my high school career.

1490
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:22,530
Next week is the prompt for my school.
And I was wondering if I should go.

1491
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,910
I know people say I should go and it would
always be a special moment in my life,

1492
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:29,980
but uh,
will,

1493
01:31:29,981 --> 01:31:34,180
it really is prom overrated dude.
You know what?

1494
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:39,180
This is a fucking depressed
individual. You know, dude,

1495
01:31:39,181 --> 01:31:43,100
you want to go and now you're going to
sit there. You're seeing order it. Dude,

1496
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:44,940
you're too fucking
smart for your own good.

1497
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,250
He can sit there and you're
going to break down the prom.

1498
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,990
How fucking stupid it is and the dumb
songs and the Dj and how you never,

1499
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:54,030
you know,
it's senior year.

1500
01:31:54,031 --> 01:31:57,180
You're never going to see these people
again your life anyways. Should I not go?

1501
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:00,280
Dude, you should definitely
go get the up to ask somebody.

1502
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:04,030
It's a great exercise because someday
you're going to see a girl that you're

1503
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:07,840
going to want to talk to. You want
to have a couple at bats? All right,

1504
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:11,560
so just fucking ask someone to the prom.

1505
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:16,600
Go get dressed up. Take the
pictures, have a good time. Don't,

1506
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:19,390
don't do what you're doing, dude.
You're, you're overanalyzing life.

1507
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:23,110
You're going to start pulling back from
the herd and you're going to end up like

1508
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:23,944
me,

1509
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:30,790
some psycho babbling to himself and
it takes you 20 years to get it right.

1510
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:34,240
Took me 20 years before he met Nia and
I finally got it fucking right and I'm

1511
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:37,840
starting to function like a human being
and thinking about having kids and

1512
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:42,340
having a dog. I'm telling you,
man, I'm telling you. All right.

1513
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:46,780
It's, it's a part of growing
up. It's a social thing.

1514
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,400
It's very important.

1515
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:53,530
I think it's very important to go to your
prompts and your social events because

1516
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,000
that's what life is about.

1517
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:58,900
There's a great documentary out
there on Hbo called his way.

1518
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,660
I am really bad with names.

1519
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:06,460
It's about this really successful a
Hollywood producer. And as I watched it,

1520
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:11,140
like I saw life lessons that I
learned only recently in life.

1521
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:15,760
And I realized how backwards I had life
when I was a loner because that's not

1522
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:20,500
what life is about. Life is about
networking, hanging out with other people,

1523
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:21,850
laughing with other people,

1524
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:27,240
and becoming successful in life is all
about your ability to connect with other

1525
01:33:28,031 --> 01:33:32,470
people and a, so you got to start as
young as possible, man, you still young.

1526
01:33:32,471 --> 01:33:36,820
I would definitely do that then,
you know, and uh, that's it man.

1527
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,720
I would definitely, I would
debt, oh, he asked me some odd,

1528
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:43,990
did you ever go to a prom and
wasn't magical? No, it wasn't.

1529
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,741
It should've been,

1530
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:48,430
but it wasn't because I was a Waldorf
psycho and I apologize to the woman that I

1531
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:52,150
went with. Um, I was just like
you, I was sitting there, um,

1532
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:55,330
when I read the rest of us here,
I was thinking about going,

1533
01:33:55,750 --> 01:34:00,430
but then came to the collusion conclusion
of going by myself would just be, oh,

1534
01:34:00,431 --> 01:34:02,140
I was thinking of going by myself,

1535
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:06,220
but then came to the conclusion that going
by myself would just be awkward. Yeah,

1536
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:09,400
dude, you don't want to do that.
You're going to freak people out.

1537
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:10,690
People are going to feel bad for you.

1538
01:34:10,691 --> 01:34:13,780
And then the mean people are going to
teach you and it's just going to suck and

1539
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:16,630
then you're gonna want to come back like
Carrie and kill everybody. It's just,

1540
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:21,460
it's a bad road. Um, she
says, so if I don't go,

1541
01:34:21,461 --> 01:34:25,960
what should I do? Dude,
go. Just go. Definitely go.

1542
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:29,260
You want to go? I'm telling
you. If he didn't want to go,

1543
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:31,870
you wouldn't be asking me. Just
definitely go. Just ask somebody.

1544
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:35,110
I know there's some girls left.
Ask sooner rather than later.

1545
01:34:35,111 --> 01:34:36,880
And you know what dude?
Aim High.

1546
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,430
Who gives a fuck if she says no, fuck
her. She probably just end up being some,

1547
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:47,590
some fatty at a reunion. One day. This
is now when you want to go in there,

1548
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:50,650
just I'm telling you, you'd go
there, psych yourself up. Aim.

1549
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:54,280
I ask a girl that you think is
out of your league. You know,

1550
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:59,060
take it to the prom maker, fucking laugh
and then see if you can a, you know,

1551
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:03,460
a little something might happen. Who gives
it and if it doesn't, who gives a shit?

1552
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:07,510
Who gives a shit? Sunday when you see
your dream girl sit there and Applebee's,

1553
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:11,920
you'll have the balls to go up to her
cause you fucking talk to that cut in high

1554
01:35:11,921 --> 01:35:15,100
school. All right, there's my advice.
All right, let's move on here. Uh,

1555
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:19,990
number two friend is going to be a
dad trying to get him to kill it.

1556
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:26,770
Wow. Wow. Okay. Wow.

1557
01:35:26,771 --> 01:35:29,170
We're already at an hour here.
This is going to be a long podcast.

1558
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:34,200
A friend is going to be a dad
dash trying to get him to kill it.

1559
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,700
Oh Jesus.
Here we got bill.

1560
01:35:36,701 --> 01:35:40,090
My friends got himself into a
shitty situation recently. Gee,

1561
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:41,200
I wonder what this is.

1562
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:44,740
I'm really interested to hear
if you have any advice for him.

1563
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:45,671
And what you have to say.

1564
01:35:45,671 --> 01:35:49,450
I got a call from him about a month ago
and said he was going to be a father.

1565
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,400
This is the last thing I expected to hear.

1566
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:57,290
He's 26 and pretty much just
started getting laid. Are
you fucking poor bastard?

1567
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:01,370
See? See this. This is another reason
why you want to go to your prom,

1568
01:36:02,530 --> 01:36:03,460
cause you don't want to be this guy.

1569
01:36:03,461 --> 01:36:06,700
The Guy who first gets laid at
fucking 26 doesn't know anything.

1570
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:12,130
I just fucking dumps his load in the
first fucking stupid waitress. He fights.

1571
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:16,690
This is a very sad thing to happen to
one of your best friends. It really is.

1572
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:21,550
What Saturday is the girl? He knocked up.
What's sad or is the girl he knocked up?

1573
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:24,730
Oh my God, this is depressing me. Uh,

1574
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:27,130
she's not someone you'd
want to mother your child,

1575
01:36:27,131 --> 01:36:30,970
let alone be attached to for the rest
of your life. She's a nice enough girl,

1576
01:36:30,971 --> 01:36:32,200
but a little off.

1577
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,000
She admittedly has some issues in
her head and loves pills in weed.

1578
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:40,000
A little too much. Oh my
God, what did this kid do?

1579
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:43,630
Let alone she is secretly
married to someone.

1580
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:46,523
What

1581
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:49,870
Dude? Are you sure he didn't want
to send this to Jerry Springer?

1582
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,450
I don't really know this story,

1583
01:36:52,451 --> 01:36:57,451
but let's assume he is foreign
and there is no love involved.

1584
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:01,600
Oh, an arranged marriage is that we
have saying anyway. When I got the call,

1585
01:37:01,601 --> 01:37:02,434
my friend,

1586
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,333
uh,

1587
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:08,080
you spelled the word wrong,
I guess respectively

1588
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,060
repetitively was at the barn.
And what word you're trying to say?

1589
01:37:12,061 --> 01:37:15,870
That my friend was at the bar and
yelling about how he wants to kill it.

1590
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:17,510
Um,

1591
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:20,370
I take it you're against
abortion considering you're
saying kill it or are you

1592
01:37:20,371 --> 01:37:21,710
just trying to be funny?
Uh,

1593
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:25,410
a day or so later when
our buddies get the news,

1594
01:37:25,411 --> 01:37:30,210
we all meet up with him to have a
convince your friend to have an abortion

1595
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:35,130
dinner. Uh Oh,

1596
01:37:35,131 --> 01:37:37,700
I see what you want. One of your buddies
were down there talking about it.

1597
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:40,230
They want to kill. All right, so you're
going to sit down with him to, okay.

1598
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:44,160
All right. Here we go. He now has
given up and it's going to have it.

1599
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,330
He said he tried talking to her a few
times about getting an abortion and she

1600
01:37:48,331 --> 01:37:49,164
won't have it.

1601
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:53,430
She wants to have the kid and every time
he brings it up she hangs up on him or

1602
01:37:53,431 --> 01:37:56,220
won't answer his calls
and avoid him for days.

1603
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,760
So now in defeat he's going to
have the poor kid. Well you know,

1604
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:03,480
that's one of the things there.
It's not the guys choice,

1605
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:08,450
which is funny when they sit there and
they say proach are you pro choice?

1606
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:11,810
You know that that's not for the guy.

1607
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,070
The woman decides unless you're
really smooth talker. Um,

1608
01:38:16,071 --> 01:38:20,060
I really think about having the kid will
make her feel some sort of self worth

1609
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,060
and that's why she
wants to have it so bad.

1610
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,970
My friend is a sweetheart and I have
no doubt he'll be a good father,

1611
01:38:25,971 --> 01:38:27,230
but it's situation sucks.

1612
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:30,800
We keep telling him that he'll be attached
to this girl forever and he really

1613
01:38:30,801 --> 01:38:34,100
needs to talk to her and
that will even talk to her.

1614
01:38:34,101 --> 01:38:38,870
And of course a bunch of us pushing her
down a flight of stairs. Jokes followed

1615
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:41,293
God.

1616
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:46,370
Now he is going with her
to get an ultrasound and
stuff and won't even talk to

1617
01:38:46,371 --> 01:38:49,910
us about it. I don't know how
this stuff works, but she does,

1618
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,230
but she's about two months preggers and
we think he has a month left to get rid

1619
01:38:54,231 --> 01:38:57,710
of the thing. What can he do and
what can we as friends do to help?

1620
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,530
Um,
uh,

1621
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:07,160
you know what guys? He's going to
have the fucking thing. I would say,

1622
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:13,800
I would say leave them alone and just
support him and tell him whatever he does,

1623
01:39:13,801 --> 01:39:18,150
do not marry this woman.
Okay. He fucked up.

1624
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,530
He got her pregnant. She wants to
have it. He doesn't have a say in it.

1625
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:28,260
And uh, that's it. It's
going down. It's going down.

1626
01:39:28,261 --> 01:39:29,094
So

1627
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,640
you know, he fucked up,
you know, that's life.

1628
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:38,540
Do you know you fuck you? Sometimes when
you fuck up, you don't get a do over,

1629
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:43,880
which is basically what an abortion is.
Uh, she's not going for the duo over.

1630
01:39:43,881 --> 01:39:46,940
She's like, Nope, this is the game
plan and we're sticking with it.

1631
01:39:46,941 --> 01:39:50,030
Just like the Rangers, even though
people are breaking their fucking ankles,

1632
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:54,710
they're going to keep trying to block
shots. All right? That's what she's doing.

1633
01:39:54,711 --> 01:39:59,710
She wants to have the kids. So now
he just has to go with it. And, uh,

1634
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:03,350
this is what he has to do. Never
move in with her. Never marry her.

1635
01:40:03,351 --> 01:40:06,050
Don't do anything like that.
She's going to be a single mother.

1636
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:10,020
He's going to be a baby daddy. And, um,

1637
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:16,630
what he needs to do now is he needs to
buy a fucking lifetime supply of condoms.

1638
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:21,680
Uh, he needs to go out and find the woman
that he's supposed to knock up in Mary.

1639
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:23,780
And in the meantime,
support that kid.

1640
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:28,520
That's what he has to do because he busted
a nut in her and she's keeping it so

1641
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:32,120
he's fucked.
He's fucked when it comes to that.

1642
01:40:32,121 --> 01:40:34,390
But his life is not over.
He can,

1643
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:37,490
he only has to deal with this
bitch for 18 fucking years.

1644
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:39,620
He has to deal with this kid for life.

1645
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:44,240
I think what he should do is the
kids should be the priority. Um,

1646
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:48,920
he should come to some sort
of zen realization that
he's not going to convince

1647
01:40:48,921 --> 01:40:53,860
this woman not to be a fucking maniac
if she is a psycho, like you said.

1648
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:58,030
Uh, what I would do is I try to convince
her not to smoke weed or take any pills

1649
01:40:58,031 --> 01:41:02,890
during the fucking pregnancy. Um, and,

1650
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:03,790
and that's it.
I mean,

1651
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,790
his only other route is if maybe
she wants to put it up for adoption,

1652
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:10,210
but it doesn't seem like she
wants to do that. But, uh,

1653
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:13,150
he just needs to settle into the
fact that he's having a fucking kid.

1654
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:18,310
But what you guys need to make sure is
that this woman does not talk him into

1655
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:22,420
getting married and being legally,
he, all he has to do is plate pay,

1656
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:23,254
child support.

1657
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:26,740
If he gets married to her now you talk
in alimony and all that type of shit.

1658
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:31,510
And then when he wants to start his family
with the fucking woman he wants to be

1659
01:41:31,511 --> 01:41:36,250
with, that's going to be a fucking
nightmare. So, uh, that's it.

1660
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:40,180
All right. So that's what I would
do. I would just say, listen,

1661
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,840
just support them as a friend and say,
dude,

1662
01:41:43,841 --> 01:41:47,500
if you ever fucking bang
another girl without a condom,

1663
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:50,320
I am got a,
I'm going to disown you.

1664
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:52,780
I'm going to disown you
because it's killing me.

1665
01:41:52,781 --> 01:41:56,410
Watching you go through this shit.
So just make sure you fuck the abortion.

1666
01:41:56,411 --> 01:41:58,900
He's not doing it.
They haven't the kids.

1667
01:41:58,901 --> 01:42:03,580
So now what you gotta do is do not
marry this woman. Do not marry her.

1668
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:08,680
And uh, and that's fucking it.
That's it man. That's a brutal,

1669
01:42:08,681 --> 01:42:13,180
brutal, brutal fucking
situation. They are.

1670
01:42:13,181 --> 01:42:17,050
But for the grace of God, I'm
anyways, here we go. Let's
read this guy from London,

1671
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:20,920
Guy from London, look at us all
the way across the fucking pond.

1672
01:42:20,921 --> 01:42:24,760
Needs advice about girl with STD.
Jesus Christ.

1673
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:26,380
You guys are fucking killing me this week.

1674
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:30,360
I'm a Londoner who just discovered your
standup podcasts. I've got to tell you,

1675
01:42:30,361 --> 01:42:32,770
you one of the best can be. Thank
you man. That's fucking awesome.

1676
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:35,890
You know great debt is to
hear from another country.

1677
01:42:35,891 --> 01:42:37,690
You make me laugh from
the pit of my stomach,

1678
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:41,350
which is a pretty special
gift to give someone, so thank
you. Thank you. All right,

1679
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:44,320
let's see if I can help you out of
your fucking problem here. Anyway,

1680
01:42:44,321 --> 01:42:46,990
I'm writing you because I
just joined a dating website.

1681
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,690
I don't know how you
feel about online dating,

1682
01:42:49,691 --> 01:42:52,570
but my opinion has always
been that it's fucked up.

1683
01:42:52,571 --> 01:42:57,280
Who needs to join a website to get laid?
Who isn't in some way a fucking lunatic.

1684
01:42:57,281 --> 01:42:59,950
Right. Um, I think that's the
way it was in the beginning,

1685
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:03,490
but now it's becoming this phenomenal
way of avoiding a cover charge and having

1686
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:07,810
to buy somebody a drink and just going
right towards the chick you want.

1687
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,980
Uh, Nino. What's going on?

1688
01:43:11,981 --> 01:43:15,850
My girl just walked in
fucking brutal questions this
week. You want to hear that?

1689
01:43:15,851 --> 01:43:20,200
Just the titles of these questions?
Uh, or just one in general? Um,

1690
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:25,270
I guess it was just this one friend is
going to be a dad trying to get him to

1691
01:43:25,271 --> 01:43:29,410
kill it. Yeah. Okay.

1692
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:33,940
All right. Now I already answered
it. I just thought she, you know,

1693
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,460
that that whole pro choice
thing are you pro choice.

1694
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:40,900
That choice is really the woman's, you
know, if she wants to vacuum it out,

1695
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:45,700
like the hoovers getting
turned on and, uh, if, if,

1696
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:51,010
what, could you not say it like that?
When a guy makes a joke like that,

1697
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,250
even though you've never had a kid,

1698
01:43:52,251 --> 01:43:56,120
do you still feel a little quivering
in there? No, I do not. No, you do not.

1699
01:43:56,180 --> 01:44:00,830
What other disgusting question. You look
really good. Thank you. Good deal. Um,

1700
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:01,341
you want it,

1701
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:05,450
you want to help me with this one guy
from London needs dating advice about girl

1702
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:09,090
with this CD. Okay. So
anyways, uh, so he, he,

1703
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:13,370
he always thought the online dating things
for those online dating websites were

1704
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:16,250
just filled with a bunch of psychos
cause who can't just get laid.

1705
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,220
But at this point, I think
it's normal now. Yeah.

1706
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,370
It's totally normal now to do
online stuff. It's not like,

1707
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:25,720
I don't think there's a stigma attached
to it anymore. People do it well.

1708
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:29,020
I think there's an STD attached to
it. Let me read the rest of this. Uh,

1709
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:32,330
so I'd avoided it, uh, being more than
capable of hooking up in real life.

1710
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:36,290
But my problem is that for about two
years now, that's all I had been doing,

1711
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:40,490
hooking up dating, meeting girls
who never do that thing to me. Oh,

1712
01:44:40,491 --> 01:44:43,520
nobody that he falls in love with.
I feel like a Husk,

1713
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,940
a 31 year old. I don't know what
that means. Guys from London.

1714
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:51,350
I guess that means like the old guy at
the bar, 31 year old and I'm dead inside.

1715
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:52,071
Oh,
I see.

1716
01:44:52,071 --> 01:44:57,071
He's dead inside because no girl can
make me feel how I used to in the school

1717
01:44:57,111 --> 01:44:59,600
playground. Oh, with
the first crushes star.

1718
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:02,930
The thing that makes you want to make
pancakes in the morning for a walk through

1719
01:45:02,931 --> 01:45:05,360
the park or put on some
Lionel fucking Richie.

1720
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:10,130
All they want to do is come home lately.
Uh,

1721
01:45:10,131 --> 01:45:14,390
I want to do after I come lately is wash
her off my dick and bouncer out. Yep.

1722
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,980
Yeah, I've been there, which
is no way to live. What? Nia.

1723
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:22,040
I banged a lot of broads before
I met you and that was the thing.

1724
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:25,730
You were like the second year did you
jumped up? You said, hang on a second,

1725
01:45:25,731 --> 01:45:26,420
let me get,
let me,

1726
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:30,170
you act like you were getting something
for her and you went in and she figured

1727
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:33,690
it out when she heard the sink was on
too long that you had your Dick and you

1728
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:34,640
are washing it up.

1729
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:38,960
I say is take the hand fucking soap and
it just fucking act like I was jerking

1730
01:45:38,961 --> 01:45:43,340
off with soap and that's why I
have the clean cock I have today.

1731
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,230
All right. Plowing ahead the thing that
makes you want to blah blah, blah, blah,

1732
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:50,540
blah blah. Okay. Uh, which is no way
to live. I'm actually a romantic guy.

1733
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:54,230
I cry at Disney movies at Jesus do it.
I don't want to read this shit. I fall,

1734
01:45:54,231 --> 01:45:57,950
I want to fall in love again. It sounds
like lyrics to a Lionel Richie Song.

1735
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:02,420
It's 2011 people join these sites.
So I made a profile anyways,

1736
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:05,890
this is a fucking long ass
email. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

1737
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:10,760
Okay. So anyway, she's on this fucking
website anyway, after two weeks,

1738
01:46:10,761 --> 01:46:13,700
I'm probably thinking about
shutting down the profile.

1739
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:18,620
The only notable exception so far
being a divorcee, who does yoga?

1740
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:20,570
She invites me to a bar.
We have a drink.

1741
01:46:20,571 --> 01:46:24,980
She complains of being tipsy and needing
to drive. I asked what she wants to do.

1742
01:46:24,981 --> 01:46:26,330
She corks up the bottle.

1743
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:29,930
It takes me back to her place
and literally takes a run at me.

1744
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,580
It was nuts to kind of seedy,
like she'd watch some porn after this.

1745
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,510
After the split with her husband decided
that that was the way the world was now

1746
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:43,340
and decided to emulate it for real. So
I'm banging a mature, granted, pretty hot,

1747
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:48,230
mature woman who's looking at me
with this angry look on her face.

1748
01:46:48,231 --> 01:46:50,100
That porn star fuck face thing.

1749
01:46:50,101 --> 01:46:55,101
That makes me feel uneasy all
ready while saying things like,

1750
01:46:55,831 --> 01:46:59,640
do you like that? Huh? That tick
is nicer. Warmer my pussy. Huh?

1751
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,260
Jesus Christ.
Are you going?

1752
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:05,460
Are you going to blow your nuts
right inside this pussy? Yeah.

1753
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:08,220
And she's seen it with the English
accent too. That's fucking hilarious.

1754
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:11,820
And I'm just feeling a bit
sad and signed side as I nod.

1755
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:18,420
Anyways, this is the thing. I meet this
girl 26 beautiful and I made beautiful.

1756
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,950
She looks like a little Elf or something
that just made it creepy and angels

1757
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:26,430
smoking and she's smart, funny,
Kooky, but in a good hot way.

1758
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:28,800
Probably that dangerous going
to break your heart way too,

1759
01:47:28,801 --> 01:47:32,070
but I'm a sucker for that. Anyway,
we go for a walk around the zoo.

1760
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:36,570
Not really given a shit about the animals
because we're too into each other like

1761
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:41,040
a, hey, look, an aardvark. Oh,
you have really pretty hair.
It was great. I'm not the,

1762
01:47:41,041 --> 01:47:43,980
I'm not a bad person. After all, my
heart is beating again for this girl.

1763
01:47:43,981 --> 01:47:47,910
I feel happy. Whizzy STD thing here.
All right, so we leave the zoo,

1764
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:51,240
go to the bar for a kiss. It's
amazing electricity. Then she goes,

1765
01:47:51,241 --> 01:47:55,740
I've got to tell you
something. Oh Jeez. Here we go.

1766
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:59,550
Here we go.
You got to admit,

1767
01:47:59,551 --> 01:48:01,680
at that point you were worried
that she had a dick. Right?

1768
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:04,530
There's something I have to tell you.
Um,

1769
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:09,530
I have three nipples and I'm married
to seven different men in Iraq. Uh,

1770
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:12,420
which is the sentence you don't want to
hear on a first date, blah, blah, blah.

1771
01:48:12,421 --> 01:48:17,310
So she, anyways, oh no, I
just looked ahead. Oh, Jesus.

1772
01:48:17,311 --> 01:48:20,610
Brace yourself. I look
at her and I say, go on.

1773
01:48:20,611 --> 01:48:25,290
And she goes on to tell me that a few
months ago she was seeing some guy who

1774
01:48:25,291 --> 01:48:28,800
went down on her and it
turns out she had a cold,

1775
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:33,390
he had a cold sore on his
mouth and now she has herpes.

1776
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:36,613
Ugh.

1777
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:42,570
So she's got an incurable STD that
can be passed on at any point.

1778
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:45,580
What do I do about that?
Obviously I get the hell out.

1779
01:48:45,581 --> 01:48:49,810
I should be running as far from her
pussy as I can. Right. But I like her.

1780
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:54,580
I haven't liked anyone like this for a
long time, but I also never had a disease.

1781
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:58,720
I look at my shit in that. I look,
I look after my shit in that way.

1782
01:48:58,721 --> 01:49:02,110
So I'm in a dilemma. I like
her, but she's damaged. She's,

1783
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:06,340
she's a bit of a skank in the past,
possibly.

1784
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:10,000
But she did the right thing and
laid that on the table for me.

1785
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:15,100
What should I do? I'm clouded right
now. How much am attracted to her?

1786
01:49:15,101 --> 01:49:19,870
I need you to help bill. Um, yeah.
You get get the fuck out. Get Out.

1787
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:24,520
Get Out. Get Out. Yeah,
you'll meet another girl too.
You don't need to do that.

1788
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:28,690
Listen, she fucked up. You didn't fuck
up. No, no, no. I, I'm saying my shit.

1789
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:32,770
She didn't fuck up.
Someone gave her an STD.

1790
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:37,180
And how do you don't know how she got
the STD? That's just a story she told.

1791
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:40,360
Well either way like that should happen.
It's not like a,

1792
01:49:40,361 --> 01:49:41,860
it's on a death sentence and B,

1793
01:49:41,861 --> 01:49:44,880
you shouldn't judge people because
they have an STD. Let me ask you Steve,

1794
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:47,920
let me ask you a question.
She takes her meds,

1795
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,650
she is on top of it and make sure that
you know, she doesn't have any breakouts.

1796
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:53,231
If she does,

1797
01:49:53,231 --> 01:49:58,231
she does what she needs to do and they
use protection the entire time and he

1798
01:49:58,691 --> 01:50:01,560
goes to his doctor and consult about,
listen, my girlfriend has this,

1799
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:02,321
I don't want to catch it.

1800
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:06,880
What can we do or he finds some of with
the clean pussy that makes his heart go

1801
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:10,210
pitter patter
and all.

1802
01:50:10,211 --> 01:50:12,220
I don't think it's right to be like no,

1803
01:50:12,221 --> 01:50:16,570
stay away from her because she has herpes
because it's like people have STDs.

1804
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,540
It's not, listen, if you want to
find the right person to life,

1805
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:23,440
you got to be selfish and I don't know
anybody who has on the list when they

1806
01:50:23,441 --> 01:50:26,980
think of this soulmate. Nobody
has herpes. No, of course not.

1807
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:29,970
In an ideal world,
you're both clean. Yeah.

1808
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:33,760
In an ideal world you don't have
sores on your genitalia. I know,

1809
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:37,990
but sometimes that shit happens and
like this is what they need to do.

1810
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:43,050
They need to have a herpes social network
and people can just meet each other on

1811
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:49,150
the herpes social network and they can
just pass it back and forth to each other.

1812
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,310
They don't have to worry about
it. Yeah, and then they can,

1813
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:54,820
they can go halvsies on their
herpes meds and it's all good.

1814
01:50:56,140 --> 01:51:01,090
It's all good. Think halvsies is,
I'm preaching STD segregation.

1815
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:04,720
I'm reaching out separate
but equal social website.

1816
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:07,780
I think it should be tolerant and I
think he should talk to her about it.

1817
01:51:07,781 --> 01:51:11,290
She probably knows everything that she
needs to do in terms of medication.

1818
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:15,350
I think you're full of shit. I think
if the guy had sores on his dick, he,

1819
01:51:15,351 --> 01:51:17,140
you'd be like, you'd be like, girl,

1820
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:19,300
can you start rolling your head
like you're on a talk show?

1821
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:21,740
You need to get out
debt. Shit, no, I wasn't

1822
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:27,490
really like the guy or girl. Then you
should just talk about it. You know?

1823
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,020
What do they say?
Like in Manhattan,

1824
01:51:29,021 --> 01:51:32,290
like one in three people has an STD
now please don't quote me on that.

1825
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:33,124
I could be wrong,

1826
01:51:33,190 --> 01:51:37,630
but something insane where like
STDs are like through the roof.

1827
01:51:37,631 --> 01:51:40,420
So obviously you should do everything
in your power to protect herself.

1828
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,400
But again,
he's also just dating this girl.

1829
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:46,150
He doesn't have to sleep with her right
away. Then there's no fucking point.

1830
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:50,680
There's no fucking point as a guy,
see how it goes and you let me finish.

1831
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:51,640
There's no point.

1832
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:54,040
There's no point in being with a
woman unless you're going to bank.

1833
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:57,250
There's no fucking point.
Well, I understand that.

1834
01:51:57,251 --> 01:52:00,280
But they could have like
an open conversation about
that and go to the doctor

1835
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:00,670
together.

1836
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:05,470
They can like they can have a mature open
line of communication about it. Look,

1837
01:52:05,471 --> 01:52:09,010
I'm not sure if you actually, if you
feel like this girl is the one then,

1838
01:52:09,011 --> 01:52:10,150
I mean that's pretty powerful.

1839
01:52:10,151 --> 01:52:13,210
The fact that she has herpes and
you're still being like, you know,

1840
01:52:13,211 --> 01:52:16,420
but I've actually, and
he, hey, easy, easy,

1841
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:20,950
easy up and down fucking Camden
street or any, and he's been careful.

1842
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:25,030
He's been careful. He kept his
breastplate on, he fucking had his,

1843
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:28,570
his condom on can catch an STD,

1844
01:52:28,571 --> 01:52:32,380
especially through oral sex because how
many people are using condoms when they

1845
01:52:32,381 --> 01:52:37,180
go down on a guy and how many people are
using dental dams? Nobody. Can I, can I,

1846
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:39,480
can I give some one night happens.

1847
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:42,460
So if you're going to be
doing that kind of stuff, yes.

1848
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:45,290
One needs to be aware that
that could happen. All right,

1849
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:49,210
I'm going to give some one night stand
advice from a dirty, filthy old man.

1850
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:53,540
All right, one nice Dan
in seven years. So what?

1851
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:58,940
So what I saw about it. You don't
have it anymore. You're done baby.

1852
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:03,650
I got you. It's over all. Wait
a minute. This is what you do.

1853
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:07,280
One of the first things you want to do is
you want to romance to, so you get out,

1854
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:12,280
you get, you get out your George
Michael, a cassette tape. No,

1855
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:17,480
this is the thing, okay? Certain things
don't change. Certain things don't change.

1856
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:22,460
Okay? One night stand. You
never ever, ever repeat.

1857
01:53:22,461 --> 01:53:26,930
Ever go down on somebody. You don't do
anything. Okay? I don't even kiss him.

1858
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,040
One night stand. You go in, you talk
shit. You pull the fucking hair,

1859
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:35,300
you bend them over and you put on a condom
and you bang them. That's what it is.

1860
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:39,590
What am I trying to fucking
be a gentleman? We're here
to fuck. We are fucking,

1861
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:41,920
you do it. Just the way prostitutes,
dude. That's why prostitutes,

1862
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:45,260
you know that there's no fucking
kissing anything. Did you want to bang?

1863
01:53:45,261 --> 01:53:48,590
You put a condom on and you just
do the act. You don't fucking,

1864
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:51,230
you don't try to sit there
and impress him with,

1865
01:53:51,231 --> 01:53:54,140
what do you mean in your port
on garden gardener gloves.

1866
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:55,820
You finger pop them a little bit

1867
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:02,240
and this isn't helping this
guy. Don't ever, don't ever,

1868
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:03,470
I'm trying to help other guys.

1869
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:07,730
Don't ever go down on a
woman you don't know ever.

1870
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:11,660
You shouldn't do it ever and you should
wait until you guys are in a serious

1871
01:54:11,661 --> 01:54:16,310
relationship and then have her get tested
and make sure that that that lamb may

1872
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:21,350
finish, that you're not going
down on a God damn sewer.

1873
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:24,260
Yeah. The same thing with the
same thing with women guys.

1874
01:54:24,261 --> 01:54:26,540
What guys stick their dicks.
Half them joined frats.

1875
01:54:26,541 --> 01:54:30,890
They had a fucking ox at some point or
some sort of farm animal. You never,

1876
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:34,880
oral sex is for someone you're in
love with. I didn't give a shit.

1877
01:54:34,881 --> 01:54:38,170
If you fucking into it, you
just, you don't do it. Okay,

1878
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,700
so you can avoid something like this.
So this is what I would say. Listen,

1879
01:54:40,701 --> 01:54:43,310
if you think this girl is the one then by,
I was just trying to be funny.

1880
01:54:43,311 --> 01:54:46,970
That by all means. I guess, you know,
do it, but you're also early, early.

1881
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:52,580
You said it, you already said it. I don't
need to say it again. People heard it.

1882
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:56,990
There's a rewind button. Um, I'm an
I'm an I'm an hour. Well go grab it.

1883
01:54:57,220 --> 01:55:00,890
Grab a Mike. They're right
there in the closet. Yeah.

1884
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:02,030
Why don't when you walk in here,

1885
01:55:02,031 --> 01:55:05,720
just come in with a mic and
be prepared for the Gig. Um,

1886
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,470
yeah, don't ever go down on
somebody in a one night stand.

1887
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:14,270
I really need to make that into a
bumper sticker. Um, last question.

1888
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:16,730
If you really liked, I said,
if you really likes her then,

1889
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,390
then definitely pursue it. But you know,
also, do you want to deal with this shit?

1890
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:23,150
You know, it's got understand that you
fall in and out of love with somebody in a

1891
01:55:23,151 --> 01:55:25,580
relationship and when you
fallen out of love with her,

1892
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:28,430
when you're really getting mad, you're
going to be thinking, herpes shit.

1893
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:32,300
You fucking cold sore
fucking motherfucker. You
give me thinking crazy shit.

1894
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,540
Just don't. I mean if you're
gonna pursue her or whatever,

1895
01:55:35,541 --> 01:55:39,020
don't be using that is in
your back pockets a thrown
in our face because like I

1896
01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:41,270
said,
anyone can get an STD at any time.

1897
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:44,340
It doesn't mean you're a
slut or you're a dirty guy

1898
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:47,520
that does a bunch of stuff irresponsibly.
Sometimes shit happens,

1899
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:50,700
it's life and other times
you are other times,

1900
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,220
other times you were filthy fucking whore,

1901
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:57,060
a man whore or a female horror and what
you do is you got to listen to you.

1902
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:59,280
When you got an STD,
you're fucking damaged goods.

1903
01:55:59,281 --> 01:56:00,930
So you got to come up
with the fucking story.

1904
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:04,950
I just go one time told me she had herpes.
She told me she had it on her knee.

1905
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:09,090
She said she was in a hot tub.
She told me,

1906
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:12,760
she told me she was in a hot tub,
someone in their hat,

1907
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:16,170
she scraped her knee and she just got
it on her knee and as long as she didn't

1908
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:17,580
in those quadrants of nerves,

1909
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,830
as long as she didn't stress
it wouldn't fucking move.

1910
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:24,660
And gradually she starts telling me more
of the story and it magically moved up

1911
01:56:24,661 --> 01:56:27,720
to her fucking VGG.
Yeah,

1912
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:30,180
she had fucking genital herpes
and she didn't fuck it. Tell me.

1913
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:34,200
Fortunately I work God damn condom.
And the second she told me the nice story,

1914
01:56:34,201 --> 01:56:38,370
I was like shoving off to buffalo,
shoving up the buffalo low.

1915
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:42,450
You know everybody, if you're
out there that you, you
know, you, you run into shit.

1916
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:47,670
Okay. But that's why you always wear
a fucking condom. Always. Always.

1917
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,070
And yes,
and guidance.

1918
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:53,610
A lot of guys out there who can't fucking
maintain a fucking erection because

1919
01:56:53,611 --> 01:56:55,920
they're so used to raw dog
and that if you put that on,

1920
01:56:55,921 --> 01:57:00,300
it feels like they're wearing
a winter coat. All right?
This is what you gotta do.

1921
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:05,190
Don't jerk off for a few days and then
try it. Cause then you're just be site.

1922
01:57:05,191 --> 01:57:08,900
Anything is even remotely touching you
down there or rub one out with a conduct.

1923
01:57:08,901 --> 01:57:11,400
Just get used to it. It sucks.
But I'm telling you this,

1924
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:14,280
it's gotta be nothing worse than
fucking waking up and having that shit.

1925
01:57:14,281 --> 01:57:16,830
You know, core is, it's terrible. And you,

1926
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:20,640
and she probably feels really bad and
embarrassed about it, so it's like,

1927
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:24,960
I don't know. And she could also be lying
how she got it. She could be like him.

1928
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:27,720
She could have been a fucking whore
going out bang and everything.

1929
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:29,840
And that's how she got it.
Yeah. Here and you're right.

1930
01:57:29,841 --> 01:57:32,790
And people need to take responsibility.
If you get herpes,

1931
01:57:32,791 --> 01:57:36,870
you need to take like 50% of it.
You're 100% right. But I'm just saying,

1932
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:41,490
I would just feel bad if someone was like,
oh, I have herpes and nobody, you know,

1933
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:44,790
wants to be with me, even though I'm
trying. I know you're right. I'm trying.

1934
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:45,720
I'm trying to be funny.

1935
01:57:45,721 --> 01:57:48,210
I'm out trying to find balance to try
and give this guy some good advice.

1936
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:51,240
Good advice. You know, you
don't have to settle in life,

1937
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:53,970
but if you feel like this person's
the one that definitely pursue it,

1938
01:57:53,971 --> 01:57:56,280
but don't be fucking just sitting there.
You know?

1939
01:57:56,281 --> 01:57:59,100
The worst way to go into a relationship
is if you feel bad for somebody,

1940
01:57:59,101 --> 01:58:01,230
I feel bad. I want to help
them. It's fucking pathetic.

1941
01:58:01,231 --> 01:58:02,220
You don't want to do that shit.

1942
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:06,420
You want someone who's your equal or if
not bet aim fucking has was telling this

1943
01:58:06,421 --> 01:58:07,380
kid he wanted to go to a prom.

1944
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:10,780
I go fucking definitely go to your prom
and as some girl that you think Saudi

1945
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,830
eleague, that's how you improve
your life. You shoot her.

1946
01:58:13,831 --> 01:58:18,780
How the fuck did I ended up with you?
Yeah, I'm definitely out of here. Oh,

1947
01:58:18,781 --> 01:58:22,740
I had low self esteem that night and I
was just like, ah, fuck it. I'll, Nah,

1948
01:58:22,741 --> 01:58:25,830
I'm just joking. We are an hour
and 23 minutes into this podcast.

1949
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:28,110
I haven't even talked about the
youtube videos. I got to go.

1950
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:31,440
These are the best fucking youtube
videos that we've had in a while.

1951
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:34,260
A fat kid reviews thin mints,

1952
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:40,050
fucking Hilarious Guy
Throws bike to stop thieves.

1953
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,520
These guys,
these guys are stealing like a vesper

1954
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:43,541
and this,
this,

1955
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:47,440
this fucking agent dude just takes
his bicycle and throws it at him.

1956
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:50,680
It's fucking,
it's Chuck Norris to the 10th power.

1957
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:54,730
And then for those guys who love to watch
a baseball manager yell at an umpire,

1958
01:58:54,731 --> 01:58:59,731
we have to Wally Backman videos of
him just absolutely losing his shit.

1959
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:01,540
One of the one's hilarious.

1960
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:05,740
Like this guy hits a foul ball on the
other team and they call it a home run.

1961
01:59:05,741 --> 01:59:08,400
In this guy, he just comes out,
he's already cursing. What, what,

1962
01:59:08,401 --> 01:59:13,180
what the fuck was that? Wasn't even
close. It wasn't even close in.

1963
01:59:13,181 --> 01:59:16,360
The empire. Just goes, what are you
talking about? And he just snapped.

1964
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:19,930
What the fuck you're there. What am
I talking about? It's awesome. Um,

1965
01:59:19,931 --> 01:59:24,280
and then the last one is a comedian who's
drunk off his ass just talking shit.

1966
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,310
Uh, Ryan Mervis, ah, checked that one out.

1967
01:59:27,311 --> 01:59:30,710

videos up on my Facebook page, uh,

1975
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:54,880
I have overhead now.

1976
01:59:54,881 --> 01:59:58,540
It would be nice if you guys
could a kick at some money there.

1977
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:01,000
I could give him a nice
little fucking salary.

1978
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:05,910
Everything could get a little nicer here.
Yada, Yada, Yada. I'm also on Twitter. Uh,

1979
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:10,900
what, what is my Twitter name at Bill
Burr at Bill Burr is my Twitter name.

1980
02:00:10,901 --> 02:00:12,820
I wasn't sure.
That's my handle.

1981
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:16,400
I wasn't sure if that was a at
bill burr or at Berto competence.

1982
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:20,380
My Twitter name is ed. Bill
burr and a that said, go Bruins.

1983
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,160
They're going to kick the fucking habs
asked tonight. I'm not being the tip.

1984
02:00:24,190 --> 02:00:25,300
You don't want to,
I didn't even read.

1985
02:00:25,301 --> 02:00:29,620
I Bet Dan Shaughnessy that
fucking God of misery. I bet.

1986
02:00:29,621 --> 02:00:31,180
Now he's writing about hockey.

1987
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:34,060
That's the only store he doesn't know
shit about hockey. I bet if he didn't,

1988
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:38,170
if he didn't give him
Lou Cheech Chara or uh,

1989
02:00:39,070 --> 02:00:42,160
or fucking Bobby or I don't
think he could name five Bruins.

1990
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:46,000
I don't think total Ray Borg Cam Neely,
you take all of them out.

1991
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:49,600
That's it. That's a podcast for
this week. Ladies and gentlemen.

1992
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:53,380
I hope you guys had a good time.
Uh, if anybody has an STD out there,

1993
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,770
hope that wasn't too fucking harsh. I'm
not blaming you. I'm not being a dick.

1994
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:01,480
Okay? Yeah. Be honest about it. Don't be
a cunt, because that's how you got it.

1995
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:04,930
Cause someone else wasn't fucking, yeah,
that's right. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.
