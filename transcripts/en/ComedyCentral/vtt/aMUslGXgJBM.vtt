00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:04.237 line:85%
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, PINOCCHIO.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.843 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: GREAT TO BE

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.612 align:start position:0% line:85%

AND BEFORE WE BEGIN -- BRUCE,
YOU'RE A HERO.

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:15.848 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOOD ON YOU.

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:18.885 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PUPPET-TO-REAL BOY COMMUNITY
SUPPORTS YOU.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.087 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, GOOD.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.222 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SO YOU LIKED THE INTERVIEW.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.591 line:91%
BECAUSE I KNOW SOME GROUPS WERE
WORRIED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:26.826 size:81% position:41% line:85%
SOME KIND OF MEDIA CIRCUS.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.728 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: I THOUGHT IT WAS
GREAT.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.998 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN AGAIN, BRUCE AND I ARE A
LOT ALIKE.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.633 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'VE BOTH BEEN FAMOUS FOR A
LONG TIME.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.335 line:91%
I WAS TRAPPED IN THE BELLY OF A
WHALE, HE WAS TRAPPED IN THE

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:40.006 line:91%
CAST OF "KEEPING UP WITH THE
KARDASHIANS," AND WE BOTH GET

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.008 size:88% position:44% line:91%
ADVICE FROM A WELL-DRESSED
MUSICAL FRIEND WHO SPEAKS IN

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:42.942 align:start position:0% line:85%
RHYME.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.711 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:46.646 line:85%
HE HOSTED SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.316 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.218 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND YOU WENT THROUGH
A TRANSITION, AS WELL.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.187 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: THAT'S RIGHT,
LARRY.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.089 align:start position:0% line:91%
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A REAL
BOY.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.057 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN MY HEART, I KNEW I WASN'T A
PUPPET.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.058 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO I TRANSITIONED.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.094 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WAS LUCKY I HAD INSURANCE TO
COVER THE PROCESS.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.862 align:start position:0% line:91%
BLUE CROSS --
&gt;&gt; Larry and Pinnochio: BLUE

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.397 align:start position:0% line:85%
FAIRY.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.134 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.837 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR -- NOT
EVERY PUPPET WHO WANTS TO

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.904 size:84% position:42% line:85%
TRANSITION HAS THAT OPTION.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:13.673 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO MOST PUPPETS --
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: WHOA, LARRY!

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:14.774 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE CAN SAY PUPPET, YOU CAN'T SAY
PUPPET.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.910 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, I'M SORRY.

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.613 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE P-WORD.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:24.117 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.952 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: BUT YES, LARRY,
SOME HAVE TO LIVE A CONFUSED

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:26.819 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND UNFULFILLED LIFE.

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:32.125 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SOME GROW BITTER AND ANGRY.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.093 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I KNOW BRUCE TALKED
ABOUT NOT FEELING LIKE HE'S IN

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.430 align:start position:0% line:85%
CONTROL OF HIS LIFE.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:40.600 size:81% position:41% line:85%
HAVE YOU FELT ANY OF THAT?

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.301 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: BIG PROBLEM.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:42.135 line:85%
ESPECIALLY WITH THE MARIONETTES.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.336 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, THAT'S AWFUL.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.437 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: LISTEN, THAT'S
WHY I'M SAYING BRUCE JENNER IS A

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.638 align:start position:0% line:85%
HERO.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.140 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS,
AND HE'S DOING IT PUBLICLY.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.442 size:81% position:41% line:85%
MY TRANSITION WASN'T EASY.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.743 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: TELL US A LITTLE
ABOUT IT.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: HIGH SCHOOL WAS
A TOUGH TIME.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.579 align:start position:0% line:85%
KIDS CAN BE CRUEL.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.281 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, THEY WERE NICE TO ME,
BUT I SAW WHAT WENT DOWN IN WOOD

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.483 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOP.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:01.254 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THOSE WERE MY FRIENDS, TOO.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.989 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT HAD TO BE
ROUGH.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.390 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: PLUS, THE HUMAN
BODY IS KINDA GROSS.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.025 align:start position:0% line:85%
I MEAN, MEAT STINKS.

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.960 line:85%
I HAD A NICE CEDAR SMELL BEFORE.

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:09.328 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BUT THINGS ARE GOOD
NOW?

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:10.796 line:85%
YOU'RE HAPPY YOU TRANSITIONED?

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.698 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Pinocchio: SURE.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.902 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, I WANTED TO BE A BOY AND
RUN AROUND AND DANCE FOREVER,

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:25.244 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT HERE I AM A MIDDLE-AGED MAN
I'M ESTRANGED FROM GEPPETO.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:28.347 line:91%
HERE I AM I HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
AND A PROSTATE THE SIZE OF A

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.914 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOFTBALL.

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:29.848 size:75% position:38% line:85%
BUT WOULD I DO IT AGAIN?

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:30.716 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF COURSE, BECAUSE THIS IS WHO I
ALWAYS WAS.

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:31.918 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEE, AND YOU KNOW I'M TELLING
THE TRUTH.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.284 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL RIGHT.
