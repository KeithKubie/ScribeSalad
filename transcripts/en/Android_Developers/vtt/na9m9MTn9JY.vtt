RICHARD HYNDMAN: Ping ping.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.790
Hey there.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.740
Welcome to this week's Android
Developer Office Hours from

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.610
Google London.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.390
I'm Richard Hyndman.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.690
STEPHAN LINZNER: Stephan
Linzner.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.690
NICK BUTCHER: Nick Butcher.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.740
CHRIS BANES: Chris Banes.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.570
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We're all
here to answer Android

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.630
development questions and
generally talk about Android

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.490
development topics this week.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.066
Welcome to the people who have
joined us in the Hangout.

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:29.358
We've got Johan and Yossi
and Giuseppe there.

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:31.214
Hey, guys.

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:31.680
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.785
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And there's
blue, Ali, on the end.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:34.370
Hi, Ali.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.270
ALI: Hello.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.415
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There's a
salesman of course, Paul

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:39.670
Hanson as well, and our
video is very good.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.510
MALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.690
I don't know what
is the problem.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.610
NICK BUTCHER: But at least
he's factory [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.221
RICHARD HYNDMAN: What are
you drinking there?

00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:48.680
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.790
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Do
you think he is?

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.330
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.640
color.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.610
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.290
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
I know, right?

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.235
I haven't learned
my [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:56.500
colors properly yet.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.060
So we're going to start this
week's show off with a little

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.680
announcement.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.370
This is going to be the last
of the Android Developer

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.300
Office Hours.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.740
We're taking a break for
Google I/O, which

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.210
is now 28 days away.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.540
27 days?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.920
It's coming very, very quickly,
very quickly for

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.590
anyone's who's got to write
a presentation, get it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.790
rehearsed, perfect it up, and
then live in the next 30 days.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.120
So we're taking some time to
focus on Google I/O now.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.750
We'll be all heading out to
Mountian View soon for

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.260
rehearsals and all that
sort of good stuff.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.530
So it's going to be hard to keep
the show running through

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.050
that period.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.940
We will be back after I/O when
we should have a brand new

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.460
studio here in London, so
everything will be a bit more

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.750
professional.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.590
We won't have to turn the lights
down to this grainy

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.480
level to make it not
look super bright.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.016
NICK BUTCHER: And hopefully
Chris won't be able to pull

00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:39.070
the power out just before
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.730
CHRIS BANES: I'm sure I'll still
find a way to do it.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.650
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We're going to
actually use tape to tape

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.750
all the plugs in
our new studio.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.480
So we're going to come back with
a new show after Google

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.010
I/O. So these last 25 minutes
of Android Developer Office

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.790
Hours for this month, I
guess, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.305
So we'll kick off, see
if anyone in the

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:00.550
Hangout has a question.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.730
Can we jump into
the Moderator?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.952
MALE SPEAKER: We've got
lots of of moderators.

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:05.660
JOHAN PELGRIM: I've
got a question.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.630
I want to create a widget,
but I only have a server.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.220
I can only do pull to the
server for information.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.470
And of course, with the widget,
you have to keep the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.385
refresh to a minimum.

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:22.850
I don't know what it was,
like 30 minutes or an

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.950
hour with the device.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.610
Is there still a way, maybe with
a service, to frequently

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.910
pull the back end service and
notify a widget to update, or

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.240
do you have any experience with
that kind of scenario?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.250
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
so can't you--

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.410
are you going to know when the
data's ready on the server?

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.366
Can you look at the GCM
which points to a

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.430
service on the device?

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.420
JOHAN PELGRIM: It's updating
frequently.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.450
Basically, it's a music player,
so to speak, but we

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.450
don't have a two-way
communication.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.885
It's only one-way, so the--

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:04.220
RICHARD HYNDMAN: But you could
use GCM to go from your server

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.640
to our servers, and
we'll notify the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.260
device to do an update.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.910
JOHAN PELGRIM: No, no, no.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.315
It's a proprietary server, so
it's running some Linux or

00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:15.000
PERL or whatever.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.510
So I don't have any influence
on that set of parts.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.580
I can pull the server for
information, but there's no

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.730
way the server is going to
communicate back to me when a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.570
next song is playing
or whatever.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.500
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so you
could [INAUDIBLE] on the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.130
device, but it sounds like your
best bet is going to set

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.660
up some kind of another server
side thing, so like an App

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.910
Engine project or something
like that to pull it.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.080
And when something has changed,
then poke our GCM

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.240
servers, and we'll deliver a
message to the device to tell

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.701
it to then update the widget.

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.470
JOHAN PELGRIM: That is the way
to go, otherwise you're going

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.275
to have the servers running,
pulling too often and draining

00:03:55.275 --> 00:03:56.110
the battery.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.490
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, if pulling's
your only option,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.310
then try and do it off device,
because it's going to destroy

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.160
the battery.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.170
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And check
Richard's talk from last

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.180
year's I/O. He has some good
tips on that, because if

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.550
you're pulling every five
minutes, it's going to keep

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.920
the radio on maximum power and
crazy things like that.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.050
So there were some good tips
about battery usage and

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.620
[INAUDIBLE] if you
have to do it.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.420
JOHAN PELGRIM: OK, great.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.089
Thanks.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.290
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.932
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: I have
a question, guys.

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:22.360
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
Hey, Giuseppe.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.590
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Hey.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.322
We use a [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:26.322 --> 00:04:32.570
Google Drive API version
one in our application.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.830
Two days ago, we found an update
using the Google API

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.110
plug-in for Eclipse, and
then this upgraded to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.820
version two, OK?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.670
Starting the update through
the Google Play Store, and

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:00.350
about 3% of our worldwide users,
they are experiencing

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.890
invalid file corrupted.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.480
The only change that we have
done, just update this API and

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.750
then republish the APK, and now
they are getting end time

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.280
from the Google Play Store, they
are getting invalid file.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.570
Do you have any suggestions?

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.360
Anything that I can check?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.870
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I've seen this
happen once or twice,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.380
very rarely before.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.280
And the Google Play Store is
cached throughout the world at

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.720
various cache servers.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.030
And occasionally, it does appear
that a file may get

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.170
corrupted on one of
those servers.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.160
And the best way to resolve the
issue is just to republish

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.380
the application again
into the Play Store.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.820
I've seen it happen
a couple of times.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.810
I've had people mention it.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.850
And when they republish, all the
caches get cleared again

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.980
and flushed and it goes through,
and then it all

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.530
starts working again and--

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.170
NICK BUTCHER: Just change your
version number and spit out a

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.960
new signed APK.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.300
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's the
quickest and easiest way to

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.240
get around the problem.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.450
If that fixes it,
then fantastic.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.316
I guess it will.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.200
It may also be in some
operator's cache somewhere.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.180
It may not be in one
of our caches.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.320
These APK files are quite large,
and people cache a lot

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.860
of stuff on the [INAUDIBLE]
internet.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.190
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Richard, why
this happened just to a

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.760
few customers and
not to everyone?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.740
If the file is corrupted on
the Google server, why--

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.170
RICHARD HYNDMAN: No, no.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.250
Not on a Google server, it will
be corrupted on a cache

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.050
somewhere on the internet.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.910
It could be on one Telco
operator's server in one

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.210
country for one group
of people.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.280
It could be anywhere.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.770
Often, you'll see that you get
clusters of people who suffer

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.670
from this issue at
one time, though.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.750
And the easiest way
to get around

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.730
it is to just republish.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.380
It may not even be in our
content delivery network.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.090
It could be somewhere outside.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.630
I've never debugged it enough
to find out exactly where in

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.700
the system these corrupted
files occur.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.870
CHRIS BANES: It could
be anywhere.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.983
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: So this
problem is not the first time.

00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:46.600
Already, you had some experience
about that.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.330
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes, it's the
third time I've someone now

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.220
mention that a group of users
are getting a corrupt file.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.360
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: I got it.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.790
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.240
Play Store here, and never have
we been able to find the

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.950
corrupted file on our system.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.910
So I'm guessing it's outside of
our network, but who knows?

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.850
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Thank
you very much.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.350
Thank you very much.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.600
I got it.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.936
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:07.390
Cheers, Giuseppe.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.450
Have you got one lined
up from the

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.760
Moderator we can jump into?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.080
CHRIS BANES: Yes.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.620
So Andy from India has asked
[INAUDIBLE], Web View memory

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.045
is not garbage collected.

00:07:16.045 --> 00:07:17.380
Is there any way to do that?

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.410
Thank you.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.400
I'm not exactly sure what
you mean by that.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.770
I don't really know.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.210
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Which
bit of it?

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.580
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.560
STEPHAN LINZNER: I remember
there were some issues with

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.110
sometimes the Web View keeping
a reference of current

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:39.860
activity and that the garbage
collection was kicking in at a

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.775
later time.

00:07:40.775 --> 00:07:45.320
I think we had a similar
problem, but I think we tried

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.620
to set everything--

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.250
we even queried the current
activity and we're setting

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.390
everything to now--

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.240
but then we didn't have really
a solution for it.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.010
But I know this has happened
to us, too.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.490
CHRIS BANES: One thing I've
found out actually is that

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.240
there's a Destroy method on
Web View, which apparently

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.340
removes all residencies.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:05.817
RICHARD HYNDMAN: What
we used to call it.

00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:08.680
Of course, the whole
Android now.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.570
STEPHAN LINZNER: But if you use
tracing tools and dump the

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:19.450
memory, you will see that you
still leak the activity

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.200
because the leaked activity
is not garbage collected.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.380
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, but if you
destroy on the Web View, will

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.530
it not release the
activity, right?

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.520
STEPHAN LINZNER: I think
it was not happening.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.620
But it's one year ago, so I
don't know if it's a bug in

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.520
the framework.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.940
But I'm just saying that I've
experienced something like

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.020
this before, where the activity
that was leaked was

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.710
not garbage collected.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.050
But we then came up with
a solution for it.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.260
CHRIS BANES: But it sounds
like you're only going to

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.775
really have problems with this
if you have multiple Web

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:54.654
Views, so try and condense
it down, I guess.

00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:55.860
NICK BUTCHER: I don't think
there's much we can do.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.880
We should move on.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.780
CHRIS BANES: Yep.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.100
So [? Avidewi ?], I hope
I pronounced it.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.140
Apology if I've pronounced
it wrong.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.010
Why was there introduced a 4,000
character limit on text

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.640
to speech item in Ice
Cream Sandwich?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.016
The text to speech service.

00:09:15.016 --> 00:09:16.720
STEPHAN LINZNER:
Where is this?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.920
CHRIS BANES: Honestly, I don't
really know, but I'm guessing

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.810
it's due to memory
constraints.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.510
So if you imagine that you have
4,000 characters, which

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.305
is quite a lot, actually--

00:09:24.305 --> 00:09:26.665
it's a good paragraph,
two paragraphs--

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:30.188
to be able to convert that text
into speech, it will take

00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:32.520
a fair bit of memory,
RAM-wise.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.860
So I'm guessing the thought
behind it was that you have to

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.230
split it up yourself and
then do it on demand.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.800
As you finish your speech,
request another 4,000

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.505
characters and go on,
go on, go on.

00:09:44.505 --> 00:09:45.610
NICK BUTCHER: Wasn't that Ice
Cream Sandwich where the

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.935
conversation thing is where we
can just keep on talking and

00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:49.185
it keeps up the constant
dictation?

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.690
Is that maybe--

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.735
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:52.735 --> 00:09:55.220
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
the API [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.730
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
keyboard.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.820
CHRIS BANES: So maybe they're
using that [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.790
STEPHAN LINZNER: [INAUDIBLE]
text to a speech.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.400
Maybe it's like you say, it's
just to prevent you from

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.420
making errors, because sometimes
you're just passing

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.884
in a string, and maybe sometimes
you don't know how

00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:11.490
long it is.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.510
MALE SPEAKER: The interesting
thing is that previously, this

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:23.440
splitting was done inside
the speech engine.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.400
I've checked the source code for
all those APIs, and on pre

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.460
[INAUDIBLE], the splitting was
done inside the speech

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.050
service, regardless
of the size.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.120
But now, it's a bit more
complicated because we'll have

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:48.090
to split the text and base
it after the first one is

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.720
completed and so on.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.740
And this actually made the work
with the speech service a

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.870
bit complicated than
it was before.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.000
NICK BUTCHER: And have you
looked at the change log on

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.180
that file where you found
the splitting?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.660
Is there any comments in the
Commit to explain why the

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.300
limit was introduced?

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.585
MALE SPEAKER: I did not see
all the Commits, I just

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.030
checked the source code.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.100
I think I also posted a
link on the question.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.240
CHRIS BANES: So my guess of
why they changed it from

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.860
splitting it in sort of
framework to make you do it

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.160
instead is so you can split it
on an end of sentence or end

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.200
of paragraph.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.450
So you're not doing text to
speech and then you have a

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.290
random word at the end,
so you can do more

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.480
contextual sort of--

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:31.980
NICK BUTCHER: That
makes sense.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.900
You know much more about the
content than we do, so you

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.510
could probably make a more
intelligent break.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.394
I imagine that's
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:38.394 --> 00:11:40.760
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, OK.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.600
NICK BUTCHER: This is just
our [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.600
But yeah, check out, if you
found the place where the

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.100
splitting goes on, if you go to
the Google code repository,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.470
which has all the Commit history
and so on, then you

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.427
should be able to see the reason
why the change was

00:11:56.427 --> 00:11:56.570
introduced.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.630
It should be in the Commit
history, hopefully.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.150
MALE SPEAKER: OK, thanks.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.261
CHRIS BANES: Thanks.

00:12:03.261 --> 00:12:06.620
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, thanks
for the question.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.020
And he's gone.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.330
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Just because
we've got quite a lot more

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.880
viewers now than we did at the
start, I'll restate the thing

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.410
I said at the start, that this
is going to be the final

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.060
Android Developer
Office Hours.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.450
We are going to stop this now
for once we get through Google

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.530
I/O, and then after Google I/O,
we're going to have a new

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.630
studio here in London.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.940
We're going to come back
with a new show.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.505
NICK BUTCHER: A vengeance.

00:12:26.505 --> 00:12:31.020
RICHARD HYNDMAN: A vengeance
and a new show.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.570
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.435
Any more live questions,
or should we crack on?

00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:37.000
Ah, there's a--

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.735
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There's Viva

00:12:37.735 --> 00:12:38.190
NICK BUTCHER: Viva.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.790
Newly tattooed Viva.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.750
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Oh
yeah, I saw that.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.370
It's the first of three
tattooing [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.170
NICK BUTCHER: Anyway,
questions for Dev.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.480
Chris?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.270
CHRIS BANES: So Giuliano from
Brazil has asked, when will

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.880
you release the new update of
Google Maps Android API

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.450
Version Two?

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.660
Why don't you open
source the API so

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.990
we can fix it ourselves?

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.370
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Well,
that's interesting.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.670
It still needs to be pushed
out to every single device

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.390
with the Google Maps API on
it, so fixing it yourself

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.146
wouldn't help too much.

00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:13.640
And we have a good team working
on it, they're just--

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.000
NICK BUTCHER: Well, it's
proprietary code.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.870
So Google Maps isn't an
open source project.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.030
Google Maps is a Google
proprietary project.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.770
So that's the reason it's
not open source.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.350
Feel free, the best way
you can contribute

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.200
is by finding bugs.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.690
Like use the Public
Bug Tracker.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.543
We do check all the
bugs there.

00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:30.330
As you see, one update's
already been

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.040
chipped for the Maps.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.330
And if there are other
bugs, hopefully we'll

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.290
get to those as well.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.210
But yeah, file bugs.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.500
So thanks.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.140
Next one?

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.380
CHRIS BANES: So Paul from
England has asked, with Web

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.520
View, how can I work with it to
know when a page does a get

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.780
or post request, and see
the headers and deal

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.600
with redirect requests?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.500
I don't think you
actually can.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.470
I looked for the API, the deep
down Web View API, and I

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.220
couldn't find a way of actually
getting to requests.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.040
It's all done deep
down into WebKit.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.755
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, you just
override the URL loading.

00:14:05.755 --> 00:14:07.750
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, and that's
as close as you can get, is

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.490
override URL, but you
can't get to the

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.740
actual physical requests.

00:14:14.137 --> 00:14:15.550
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You have to
implement your own browser.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.660
CHRIS BANES: Exactly.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.760
You have to use Apache or URL
Connection and do it yourself,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.010
which is [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:25.820
NICK BUTCHER: So you
could do that.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.500
You could override the URL
loading, right, and then at

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.830
that point, do the web requests
yourself and look at

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.660
all the headers and then decide
what you need to do,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.540
and then download the HTML
and just set it on

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.866
the Web View, right?

00:14:35.866 --> 00:14:36.310
CHRIS BANES: Exactly.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.520
NICK BUTCHER: So you'd have to
insert yourself everywhere in

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.620
the process.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.880
CHRIS BANES: And you'd lose
incremental loading

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.180
and things like that.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.360
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.040
CHRIS BANES: You can
still [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.995
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Was that you?

00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:48.780
Was Paul from England
Paul who's on the--

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.575
Paul Hanson?

00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:52.475
Or is there another Paul
in England who's

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.230
got an Android question.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.350
Maybe he's nodding behind
his avatar.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.820
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.584
He says it was him.

00:15:00.584 --> 00:15:02.432
Ah, Yossi's joined as well.

00:15:02.432 --> 00:15:03.360
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
Oh hey, Yossi.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.954
Nice [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:05.954 --> 00:15:07.010
NICK BUTCHER: Right,
next question.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.560
Let's move on.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.520
CHRIS BANES: Right, Carousel.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.780
Dear guys, as you know, Gallery
was deprecated.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.280
View Pager Item has a new
property to display free

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.695
items, but could you advise us
on a Carousel component?

00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:22.270
I've found many
[? which   were   under ?]

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.756
Gallery.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.720
So can you--

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.233
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Do the
horizontal List View?

00:15:26.233 --> 00:15:28.430
That's what we would
recommend.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.956
Whatever happened to that?

00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:31.150
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, this
is a good question.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.210
We've seen this before.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.740
So essentially, a lot of people
want Gallery-type

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.330
behavior, but with
Gallery being

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.515
deprecated, don't use it.

00:15:38.515 --> 00:15:41.490
And so the advice docs say
either to use a Horizontal

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.900
Scroll View or to use
a View Pager.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.860
So Horizontal Scroll View will
just give you the scrolling

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.840
behavior, but it's not an
adaptive view, so it's not

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.710
going to be very good for
extremely large data sets.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.320
View Pager is great.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.420
I'm not sure what you mean
by the free pages thing.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.663
I think you're talking about
set partial page widths so

00:15:59.663 --> 00:16:02.270
that you can set page width so
you can have more than one

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.040
item on the screen.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.540
But the problem with that is
that it's always left aligned,

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.175
so you're never going to get
that centering type behavior

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.760
that you get with Gallery.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.700
So if that's really what you
want, you can either use

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.230
Gallery, or you could use
View Pager and do some

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.520
modifications to it to try and
get it to center and have the

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.214
edges peeking out, whatever
the behavior you

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:20.470
might need to do.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.380
But essentially, you need
to do a bit of work.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.930
CHRIS BANES: Just because
Gallery's deprecated doesn't

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.080
mean you can't use it.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.210
And also, I've seen plenty
implementations of Gallery

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:35.050
which add view recycling,
and there's a lot

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.120
on GitHub and stuff.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.560
So just have a Google and see.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.150
STEPHAN LINZNER: There are also
some libraries that use

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.480
Horizontal Scroll View
to implement a

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.730
custom scroll view.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.400
JOHAN PELGRIM: I think the three
refers to the fact that

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.440
View Pager holds, while the
current page of course, and

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.290
the previous and the next
in cache, so that

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.285
might be the three.

00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:01.700
I don't know.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.010
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You can set the
page [INAUDIBLE] as well,

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.260
yeah, as fragile.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.750
NICK BUTCHER: Next.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.609
CHRIS BANES: Shienza has asked,
I want to refresh a Web

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:19.329
View in Line, and you bracket it
for avenue content without

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.240
the white flash.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.260
What are my options?

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.510
I'm open to faking it.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.702
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Take him with
you in the background and

00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:34.250
replace the first one?

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.831
Waste memory.

00:17:35.831 --> 00:17:40.230
We've had the white flash
question quite a bit as well.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.655
There isn't a good
answer to it.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.220
CHRIS BANES: Go Native.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.120
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that
really is the answer.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.690
It sounds flippant, but Web
View is an out of the box

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.560
component, and it has
certain limitations.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.400
And if you're butting up against
those, it might be

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.350
your only option.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.150
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And if it's
only a small amount of HTML in

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.550
there, Text View can
process some HTML.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.290
So you might do a Text
View inside it

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.210
instead of a Web View.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.346
Have a lot less overhead to use
the Text View with HTML

00:18:11.346 --> 00:18:12.790
formatting instead
of a Web View.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.610
NICK BUTCHER: Voicemail from
HTML, a very expensive call.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.060
But you could cache it.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.210
CHRIS BANES: You could always,
expose JavaScript methods and

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.200
call them through Open URL.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.082
So the JavaScripts within
the actual web

00:18:25.082 --> 00:18:27.280
page updates the page.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.490
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Just
do a lot of testing.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.910
You'll be fine.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.110
CHRIS BANES: So another
library question.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.005
Winkey Wong has asked--

00:18:34.005 --> 00:18:36.720
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, she's
in the Hangout.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.920
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.810
CHRIS BANES: Is there a library
for Android that can

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.454
make the sound effect as
page falls for IOS?

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.660
I don't know.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.436
RICHARD HYNDMAN: If there's
not, you should write one.

00:18:50.436 --> 00:18:52.032
NICK BUTCHER: I know the Google
Books application does

00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:55.730
this, and that was all written
using Render Script to make it

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.780
all look [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.440
RICHARD HYNDMAN: That Render
Script is open source, not the

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.620
Google Books one, but we do
have a page turning Render

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.425
Script that's open sourced.

00:19:01.425 --> 00:19:01.920
NICK BUTCHER: You do?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.690
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's
the flat line.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.790
It doesn't have the page corner
curling, but it has the

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.515
flat line turning.

00:19:05.515 --> 00:19:09.040
It's in the Render
Script samples.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.050
NICK BUTCHER: In the
SDK samples?

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.680
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The SDK
samples, [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:11.940
NICK BUTCHER: There we go.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.760
It's on your machine.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.750
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's not quite
as good as the Google

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.695
Books version, but it is--

00:19:15.695 --> 00:19:17.110
CHRIS BANES: It's a good
starting point.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.440
Maybe you can update it.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.100
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Of course,
using Render Scripts are well

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.020
documented.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.860
You'll be fine.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.110
CHRIS BANES: And deprecated.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.280
Their graphics is.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.040
I have a display.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.328
OK, next question.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.350
We've got some new joiners.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.670
Welcome, everyone
who's joined us.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.190
Any questions from the
live participants?

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.180
Just speak up, or you can use
the sidebar and we'll read it

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.160
out if you want to type it in
instead, if you don't have a

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.410
mic or anything.

00:19:52.406 --> 00:19:53.130
NICK BUTCHER: Take
that as a no.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.930
CHRIS BANES: Dead silence.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.000
So 2MI from Hungary
has asked--

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.700
I'm going to paraphrase
the question

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.150
because it's quite long.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.540
What's the best way of getting
a contact photo

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.550
from a contact URI?

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.766
He mentions that you can
actually use past URI to Image

00:20:09.766 --> 00:20:14.235
View, or is it best to use
open contact photo input

00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:16.360
stream, and get the input
stream and [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:16.840
from there?

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.180
And I said that the best way is
actually just using input

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.660
stream, because then, from the
input stream, you can have

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.650
close control over how the
actual bitmap is decoded.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.260
NICK BUTCHER: Because you might
want to use an in sample

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.510
size or something like
that to have a much

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.790
faster, smaller bitmap.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.870
CHRIS BANES: Exactly.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.020
So you can use Bitmap Factory
to actually decode the input

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.060
stream to how you want.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.400
That's it, really.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.740
I always go input stream with
URIs to have close control.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.970
NICK BUTCHER: And if you want
to look at using those in

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.230
sample size and so on, where
can you learn about that?

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.040
CHRIS BANES: There's a newish
bitmap training class called

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.540
Managing Bitmap Memory, which
documents all this, as well as

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.520
some techniques of caching and
that kind of stuff, all that

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.270
goodness, and that was
added last month.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.000
Have a look at it.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.980
NICK BUTCHER: So there's no
point opening a massive

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.410
contact photo, which they can
be, just to scale it down.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.282
You may as well open it scaled
using the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:12.282 --> 00:21:13.532
CHRIS BANES: Only load
what you need.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.960
Anyone else got a
good question?

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.270
MALE SPEAKER: Can I ask one?

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.314
CHRIS BANES: Please.

00:21:23.314 --> 00:21:24.564
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Go for it.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.000
Was that the question?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.803
NICK BUTCHER: Is he frozen?

00:21:30.803 --> 00:21:31.670
CHRIS BANES: He might
have done.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.730
He's actually stopped moving.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.936
RICHARD HYNDMAN: He's
holding very still.

00:21:35.936 --> 00:21:38.525
Have we frozen?

00:21:38.525 --> 00:21:39.890
CHRIS BANES: No, Yossi's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.030
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry
about that.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.280
CHRIS BANES: Oh, Hangout.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.970
MALE SPEAKER: So I was trying to
use number picker from both

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.720
Android 4 and Android 2, just
trying to have an application

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.780
working in both, and it's
a bit of a hassle.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.240
And I ended up having to copy
the entire number picker from

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.780
2 to my application and
use that one because

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.325
if you try to use--

00:22:08.325 --> 00:22:13.720
there are some methods that are
change of signatures for

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.705
Android, I think API level
11 or something.

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:22.840
Is there any strategy
that you would

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.485
recommend for such things?

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.265
CHRIS BANES: Not really.

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:31.890
I've been working on this kind
of stuff recently quite a lot,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:32.880
compatibility.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.780
And the best way is to just
drag the source into your

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:41.490
source tray, because you have
then control over it, and

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.085
there's no nice way
of doing it.

00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:44.290
Because the trouble with that
kind of stuff as well, you

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.088
have to drag in all
the styles.

00:22:46.088 --> 00:22:47.760
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.640
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, and it
becomes a big problem.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.190
But there's no easy, nice way of
doing it unless you find a

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.450
library that already
has it for you.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.370
NICK BUTCHER: I was going to
say, I assume somebody has

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.290
probably already done
this array.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.160
CHRIS BANES: But yeah, there's
no easy way unless you can

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.886
find a library which has
already done the work.

00:23:03.886 --> 00:23:05.632
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, but probably
the work would be the

00:23:05.632 --> 00:23:06.300
same [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.376
NICK BUTCHER: Exactly.

00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:10.580
So you're looking to use the
new version of the number

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.155
picker in an old wrap,
in a backwards

00:23:12.155 --> 00:23:13.906
backhaul way, you're saying?

00:23:13.906 --> 00:23:16.450
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.850
If you run your application in
Eclipse, everything is fine.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.880
And you try to run it in an
Android 2 device, it will

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.280
crash because it can't
find the class.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.200
And the class is there, but the
signature is different so

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.996
the fast loader doesn't
recognize it.

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:35.130
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I used the
number pickers in the Ultimate

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.450
Stopwatch, and I just API check
it and then use the

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.130
right ones for 2.3 and the new
ones for Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.960
So if you look at the Ultimate
Stopwatch's source code--

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.960
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, will do.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.065
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
Ulimatestopwatch

00:23:47.065 --> 00:23:50.252
.googlecode.com, it's open
source there and you can see

00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:52.065
the way I did it.

00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:55.910
I just used the two separate
chunks of code to make the two

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.510
different number pickers work.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.080
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, that's
more or less what I did.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.070
An if.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.180
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
that's what I did.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.310
I just did an If check on it.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.895
You'll find that, for Android
2 upwards, you have code for

00:24:06.895 --> 00:24:07.400
newer versions.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.780
As long as you don't execute it
in the older versions, you

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.676
can have it just API
catered in there.

00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:13.070
NICK BUTCHER: Or you could have
two different concrete

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.880
implementations and just
instantiate the right one

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.350
depending on runtime
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.240
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, but at a
certain point, you have to

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.400
have that If.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.430
Which one are you
going to use?

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.300
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.211
Well, just target Ice Cream
Sandwich and upwards.

00:24:28.211 --> 00:24:29.530
STEPHAN LINZNER: OK, thanks.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:29.820
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.390
NICK BUTCHER: Or [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.640
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
Or [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.810
NICK BUTCHER: All righty.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:36.130
CHRIS BANES: All right.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.860
We've got two--

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.720
that depends how long we--

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.730
I was going to say
two minutes left.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.190
STEPHAN LINZNER: One
more question.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.200
We have this one--

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.030
NICK BUTCHER: Oh yeah,
two minutes left.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.110
And Richard [INAUDIBLE] again.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.820
CHRIS BANES: So CM has
asked, how can we

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.390
become a Top Developer?

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.590
Our app has over 700,000
downloads and a rating of 4.4.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.060
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Awesome.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:54.885
Well, congratulations.

00:24:54.885 --> 00:24:56.872
That's pretty damn good stats.

00:24:56.872 --> 00:24:58.510
Does he say what the
application is?

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.540
CHRIS BANES: No, he doesn't.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.710
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We get
a lot of people

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.000
asking about Top Developer.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.330
We haven't issued-- or the
Player [INAUDIBLE] team

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.615
haven't issued any Top
Developer badges in--

00:25:07.615 --> 00:25:09.410
it must be over a year now
because we were talking about

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.650
it at I/O last year.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.280
The whole program's
still on hold.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.700
I guess they're trying to figure
out what to do with it.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.586
I don't have too many details on
it, but there haven't been

00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:22.940
any new Top Developers issued
in a long time.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.600
NICK BUTCHER: But even before
that, the kind of guidelines

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.260
where you had to have a string
of very good applications,

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.915
normally multiple, unless you're
a service which is only

00:25:30.915 --> 00:25:34.060
ever going to have
one application.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.330
So normally one app
isn't sufficient.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.270
You normally have to have
a string of apps.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.050
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, the
program became a bit

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:40.590
fragmented.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.330
They definitely used it for
things like banks as well,

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.870
even if the app wasn't high
quality, they used it to put

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.420
the tick next to things like a
bank so you'd think it was the

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.920
trusted application
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.740
NICK BUTCHER: Verified
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.090
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Verified.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.200
So we should have split it into
two programs, a verified

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.990
[INAUDIBLE] and a trusted
developer.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.270
So it's just kind of--

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.265
yeah.

00:25:57.265 --> 00:25:58.287
Sorry about that.

00:25:58.287 --> 00:26:01.310
NICK BUTCHER: A lot of these
programs, we're waiting on the

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.310
new Google Play Store to launch,
so now that that's

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.720
started rolling out, then I
think we're going to hopefully

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.110
be able to do more interesting
schemes like this.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.544
So hopefully, watch this space
for that kind of program.

00:26:11.544 --> 00:26:12.633
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The new Play
Store is a lot more flexible

00:26:12.633 --> 00:26:12.930
for that sort of thing.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.720
Maybe that's what they're
waiting for.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.230
OK, well in the last minute, I
will reiterate one more time

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.410
that this is the last Android
Developer Office Hours.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.620
Bye bye.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.970
We did the first Android
Developer Office Hours in

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.130
January 2012, January
11, 2012.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.480
We've been going
for 15 months.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.850
NICK BUTCHER: I think Yossi's
been here more than me.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.380
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yossi's
probably done

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.320
more than me, yeah.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.440
In the 15 months, we've only
missed a handful of weeks.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.130
And oh, Giuseppe's great.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.680
It's been a good run.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.380
In fact, the first three months
until March were just

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.950
Hangouts with up to 10 people,
because Hangouts didn't even

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.850
exist in January last year.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.030
They came in in March last year,
and that's when we went

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.974
online and started doing YouTube
live and Hangouts on

00:26:51.974 --> 00:26:53.175
air and all that stuff.

00:26:53.175 --> 00:26:57.000
I remember Sparky having to find
his way around, because

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.890
Hangouts [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.390
in Germany.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.670
He had to fly over every week to
join the Hangout, or drive

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.290
out of Germany to join
the Hangout.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.643
That's what happened, yeah.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.655
So we will be taking a break
now until after Google I/O,

00:27:10.655 --> 00:27:12.220
and after Google I/O, our new
studio here will be ready and

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.120
we will come back with a
vengeance, apparently, and

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.940
blow you away with
a brand new show.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.450
So thank you all.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.910
NICK BUTCHER: But you guys
should all just get together

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.220
every Wednesday at
2:00 PM, right?

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:22.760
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Oh
yeah, totally.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.040
If you have a Hangout,
I'll join anyway.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.080
That's fine.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.740
We'll just have a chat.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.197
NICK BUTCHER: I'll just be
furiously writing slides at

00:27:27.197 --> 00:27:28.700
the same time.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.530
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Fireside chat.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.550
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
fireside chat.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.320
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI:
I lost two times.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.610
One time, because I will miss
you team after the Google I/O,

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:44.062
and second time because I was
not able to get the ticket to

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:44.764
come there.

00:27:44.764 --> 00:27:46.960
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Aw, Giuseppe.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.600
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Made
look, Richard.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:49.980
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I know,
I'm ashamed.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.940
NICK BUTCHER: I'm sorry.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.230
Many people [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.860
But are you going to go to
an I/O Extended event?

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.940
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yes,
in my region.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.600
Yes, in Italy.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.650
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.250
NICK BUTCHER: Perfect.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.020
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: My company
will be the official sponsors

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:08.500
of the extended Google I/O, and
also, we will be there to

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.340
support all the developer.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:10.840
NICK BUTCHER: Wonderful.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.100
Sounds great.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.780
RICHARD HYNDMAN: So thanks to
everyone who joined us in the

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.730
Office Hours over the last 15
months and supported it, and

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.140
we've answered quite
a lot of questions.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.130
I wish we'd kept a
tally of how many

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.490
questions we'd answered.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.950
And that's us for today.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:24.920
So thank you all very much.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.910
We'll see you all around.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.810
We know you all anyway,
and we're on Google+.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:29.290
MALE SPEAKER: Enjoy.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.250
Bye bye.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:30.970
NICK BUTCHER: You're taking
a break from us.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.294
We'll see you soon.
