00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.110
Okay Charles what do you think?

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.540
&gt;&gt; About what?

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.040
&gt;&gt; Let's just go through these.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.620
The ones that don't have names yet
and give them names.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.570
Kind of think through what it is
that they are like and label them.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.790
&gt;&gt; Okay sure we can do that all right.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.900
If the first one is a regular MDP and
and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.970
what makes it a regular MDP is
that you're doing an expectation.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.390
Over the next best action
that will be taken, right?

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.380
&gt;&gt; Right,
the best next action I would say.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.520
&gt;&gt; Right that's the right
way of saying it.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.340
So, here the only difference
between the second one and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.340
the first one is that instead of doing
an expectation you're going to only pay

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.870
attention to the worst possible
state you could get into.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.140
&gt;&gt; Mm, okay.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.400
So we're taking out the actual
stochastic dynamics of the MDP and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.020
replacing it with something
that is minimizing.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.150
&gt;&gt; Right and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.780
so that means if we were thinking
about the function at the very top,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.580
the Q star, is not kind of the value
of taking an action in a particular

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.750
state given that you are then going to
do the best thing from that point on.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.680
But it's sort of the value you would get

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.165
is you always assumed
the worst thing could happen.

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:16.920
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.380
&gt;&gt; And if that were true everywhere,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.340
then you would be valuing things
by the worst possible outcome.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.180
So that would be a kind of, I don't know
what the right word is, maybe something

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.450
like a pessimistic MDP, or
a risk-averse MDP, something like that.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.510
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.000
Worst case MDP, maybe.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.330
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm yeah.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.390
&gt;&gt; It's also related to,
in control theory,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.190
the notion of H infinity control.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.840
That H infinity control basically says,
I don't know what's going to happen so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.670
let me assume that the worst
thing's going to happen.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.100
&gt;&gt; Okay so pessimistic sort
of describes the outlook

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.350
on the world of this equation but
is risk averse the right thing?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.088
This suggests that I will end up trying
to choose actions that put me places

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.155
where the least bad thing could happen.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.090
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean,
I wouldn't quite think of it that way.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.970
So, it's almost as if
the environment is out to get you.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.080
So, instead of just randomly
transitioning you to some state

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.710
it's always putting you in a state
that makes you the least happy of all

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.770
the states that you could go to.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.505
&gt;&gt; Oh, so grad school.

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:26.330
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,
it depends where you go to grad school.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.070
Like, Rhode Island's
a pretty good state.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.110
All right, so we're going to be
placed in a state that is worse for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.180
us, and once we get there,
then we get to choose an action.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.320
We get to choose the action
that's best for us.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.870
So it's also almost a kind of game,
where we get to make a move, and

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.990
then the environment makes a move,
and then we make a move, and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.960
then the environment makes a move.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.660
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that, I like that.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.040
But that means you would want to
choose the action that would get you

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.310
to the place where kind of
the least worst thing can happen.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.790
Right, so us, the agent,
the ones who's doing the deciding,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.490
is trying to be risk averse relative
to what the environment might do to it.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.700
&gt;&gt; Right, sure that makes perfect sense.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.660
So risk averse is not a bad description.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.420
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.250
So other answers I would accept here
include things like adversarial dynamics

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.610
or two player game, things like that.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.690
I guess you could also,
notice the way this is written here.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.010
This is the min over all next states so

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.370
this is really going to always
transition us to the worst state.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.840
Not the worst state that makes any
sense, because we didn't do something

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.420
like for all states in the set
of states that are reachable

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.620
with probability greater than zero, but
that's a little bit more constrained.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.550
We didn't constrain it, so
really it could just be MDP that makes

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.180
you sit in the worst possible place, and
just pummels you over and over again.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.240
But I don't think there's
a nice succinct name for that.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.050
&gt;&gt; I thought that was pretty succinct,
what you said.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.550
&gt;&gt; All right, good.
