Hi, I'm Ian from
getflight.com.au.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.135
We're a sale airfare search
comparison website.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.850
Basically what we do is we show
you where you can fly for

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.640
how much, and we show the
results on a map.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.920
So this is an example
of Sydney to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.670
anywhere for any price.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.800
Let's say we want to go
Sidney to New Zealand.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.270
So what we've now done is we've
zoomed in here to a

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.190
channel of flights
into New Zealand.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.080
We're using the Maps
API version 3.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.730
Some of the cool things we're
doing here-- we're using the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.680
geodesic lines to show the
[INAUDIBLE] flight path.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.830
We're also doing server-side
clustering.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.830
So for example, if I drill down
into some flights, say,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.460
here in Asia, as I zoom in,
the server's is going to--

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.040
on the back-end, it's working
at the zoom level, and then

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.430
it's rendering each label
individually.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.980
But when you zoom back out, we
start to cluster the results.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.209
One of things that I've really
focused on is ensuring that

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:09.130
the same code base works on
tablet and the mobile as on

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.690
the desktop.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.920
So here we have an iPad.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.250
So it's the same JavaScript
code that's running this.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.810
And the users can still have the
same functionality on the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.240
mobile as they can have
on the browser.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.730
I've been working with the Maps
API for the last year.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.150
What I really like about it--

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.670
I can write for multiple devices
really easily, and I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.080
know that my code will
work on mobile,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.840
tablet, and the browser.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.760
I really like that I don't
have to host the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.460
infrastructure for my Maps,
and that Google will

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.620
host that for me.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.220
And I also really like that I
can work with JavaScript, and

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.370
I can quickly and flexibly
prototype

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.210
things using my browser.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.660
And I don't have to
compile any code

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.910
to make things happen.
