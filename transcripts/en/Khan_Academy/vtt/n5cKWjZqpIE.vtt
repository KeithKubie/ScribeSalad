00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.134
You'd be amazed at the things
you can draw or construct

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:05.674
if you have a straightedge
and a compass.

00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:08.815
A straightedge is literally
just something that has a straight edge

00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:11.286
that allows you to draw straight lines,
like a ruler.

00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:13.819
A compass is something that allows you
to draw circles

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.765
centered where you want them
to be centered of different radii.

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.825
Your typical compass would be
a metal thing

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:21.657
that has a pin on one end
and is shaped like an angle

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:23.921
and you have a pencil
at the other end.

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:27.343
I don't have real physical
rulers and pencils in front of me

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.598
but I have the virtual equivalent.

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:32.742
I can say 'add a compass' 
and draw a circle.

00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:36.889
I can pick where I want to center it
and I can change the radius,

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:42.169
and I can draw a straight line segment
and move it around.

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:44.220
This is equivalent
to having a straightedge.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.057
Using these tools,

00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:52.987
I want to construct a line going through P
that is tangent to the circle.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.885
I'll draw a line that looks
something like this.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:01.447
Remember a tangent line
will touch the circle exactly at one point

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:03.430
and that point,
since it's going through b

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.571
should be point P.

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.575
Another way to think about a tangent line

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:10.195
is that it's going to be perpendicular
to the radius between that point

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.866
and the center.

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:16.502
What I just drew looks pretty good,
but it's not so precise.

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:19.316
I don't know if it's exactly
perpendicular to the radius,

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:22.727
I don't know if it's touching it
exactly at one point right there.

00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:25.802
What we're going to do is
use our virtual compass

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:30.952
and our virtual straightedge
to do a more precise drawing.

00:01:30.954 --> 00:01:33.569
Let's do that.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.050
The first thing I'm going to do is
set up P as the mid-point of a line

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.763
where the center of the circle
is one other end of the line.

00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:47.793
The way I can do that--
let me 'add a compass' here.

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:52.702
I'll construct a circle
that has the same radius

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:54.792
as my original circle.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:59.790
Now let me move it over
so now it's centered at P.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.420
Why is this useful?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.699
Now a diameter of this new circle

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.677
is going to be a segment
that is centered at P.

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:11.269
I'm going to have a segment
where P is the mid-point

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.919
and then the center of my original circle
is going to be one of the end points.

00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:17.257
Let's do that.

00:02:17.257 --> 00:02:20.489
I'm going to add a straightedge
and make that one of the end points

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.769
and I'm going to go through P

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.968
all the way to the other side
of my new circle.

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:31.738
What was the whole point
of me doing that?

00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:37.350
Now I've made P
the mid-point of a segment

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.680
so if I can construct
a perpendicular bisector

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:42.063
of the segment

00:02:42.063 --> 00:02:44.794
it will go through P
because P is the mid-point

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:49.608
and that thing is going to be
exactly perpendicular to the radius

00:02:49.608 --> 00:02:55.818
because the original radius
is part of this segment.

00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:04.645
Let's see how I can do this.

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:09.217
What I could do is--
I'm going to draw another circle.

00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:13.708
I'm going to center it
at the original circle

00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:15.623
and make it have a different radius.

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:19.620
Maybe a radius something like that.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.701
Now I'm going to construct another circle
of this larger size

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:26.315
but I'm going to center it
at this point over here.

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:29.085
I think you'll see quickly
what this will accomplish.

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:35.046
So I'll construct another circle
of that same larger radius.

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:45.405
Now I'm going to move it
over here.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.731
So what's interesting
about the intersection

00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:50.931
of these two larger circles?

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:56.957
This point over here
is equidistant to this end of the segment

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:58.765
and to this end of the segment.

00:03:58.765 --> 00:04:02.107
Remember these two larger circles
have the same radius.

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:04.517
So if I'm sitting on both of them

00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:08.586
I am that distance away from this point
and that distance away from this point.

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:13.064
So something that is equidistant
from the two end points of a segment

00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:16.105
is going to sit
on the perpendicular bisector.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:18.856
So this point is going to sit
on the perpendicular bisector

00:04:18.856 --> 00:04:22.413
and this point is going to be sitting
on the perpendicular bisector.

00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:25.024
So now we can draw
a perpendicular bisector.

00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:29.468
We can go from this point,
the intersection of our two larger circles

00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:33.863
this point that is equidistant
from the two centers of the large circle,

00:04:33.863 --> 00:04:37.212
to this point that is equidistant
to the two centers of the large circle.

00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:40.028
And once again, it is equidistant
to the two centers of the large circle,

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:43.810
but those points are also
the end points of this segment.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.749
So these two points are on
the perpendicular bisector,

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.492
you just need two points for a line.

00:04:48.492 --> 00:04:51.122
So I've just constructed
a perpendicular bisector to P

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:56.612
and it's perpendicular to the radius
from the center

00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:59.448
to P of our original circle.

00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:05.818
Now, that is going to be a tangent line
because if we go through P

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:10.605
and we are exactly perpendicular
to the radius from P to the center

00:05:10.605 --> 00:05:15.715
then this line we've just constructed
is actually tangent.

00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:18.453
So, it might seem like a lot of work
to do all of this,

00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:20.317
I could have started just eyeballing it

00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:24.727
but when we do it like this
we can feel really good

00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:26.255
that we're being precise.

00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:28.892
Imagine if you were trying to do this
on a larger scale,

00:05:28.892 --> 00:05:31.730
if you were trying to engineer
some very precise instrument,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.366
you would want to do it this way.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.540
You would want to draw
a very precise drawing,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.058
maybe an architectural drawing.

00:05:37.058 --> 00:05:39.299
This could be an interesting way
to approach it.

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:43.493
In times past before folks
had things like computers,

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:47.803
this was a thing people actually did.
