00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.500
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, that juice is--

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.000
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Slide that level down here.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.646
Let's just double-check what we did,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.896
We're looking to see if the
bubble is between the lines.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.555
&gt;&gt;Students: It is!

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.386
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Nice work, people.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.216
&gt;&gt;Barbara: They are asking
the questions.

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:19.966
They are doing the research.

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.636
It is about that hands-on
learning, and it allows teachers

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:23.976
to be able to make it all real.

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:25.976
&gt;&gt;Courtney: I don't like
that word, "Can't."

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:36.246
&gt;&gt;Courtney: We are starting a process
of really going down the STEAM road

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:40.236
of understanding how arts can
be integrated with science,

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:42.176
technology, engineering and math.

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:46.356
We push the students
to see the connections.

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:51.006
We inspire them with real-world
opportunities to make those connections.

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:54.246
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What angle
do we need to put it?

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:57.076
&gt;&gt;Barbara: Engineering helps them to
critically think and problem solve.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:00.156
Ms. Bryant teaches those
concepts through art design.

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:02.386
Which is perfect for young children.

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:05.036
&gt;&gt;Courtney: There isn't
really a state-wide curriculum

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:07.206
for elementary school,
engineering design.

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:11.036
But looking at where they need to be
in middle school and then high school,

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:13.956
I'm able to backwards design
for the elementary level.

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:17.146
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Then once this dries,
we'll flip it and get the sides.

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:20.566
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Here in the engineering
lab, we do design-and-build projects

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.846
that involve students,
surprisingly young.

00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:26.236
You wouldn't think that first and second
graders could do perspective rendering

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:28.176
and design concepts,
but they're doing it!

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:31.876
&gt;&gt;Jaron: Well, we're making
things for the Tinker Yard.

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:35.656
And we're kind of making
a house like right here.

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:41.286
&gt;&gt;Louis: We're building it so people
can think of energy when they see it,

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:43.026
and then people want to go in here.

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:43.186
&gt;&gt;Girl: To play.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.336
&gt;&gt;Louis: It's like another playground.

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:47.226
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The Tinker Yard happens

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:49.776
to be four stations that
they've come up with.

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:53.276
The first station is a Building Station.

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:56.886
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Kids love to build forts, so
we just give them an eclectic amount

00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:00.696
of materials that they can fasten
together and make structures.

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:05.086
And those structures constantly change
and shift as they take them apart,

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:06.646
put them back together
in different ways.

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:09.156
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The last station
is the Energy Station.

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:11.366
That's the piece that
we're working on now.

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:14.196
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And it's a raised platform that
will allow us to mount different kinds

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.106
of simple machines that
the kids can operate.

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:18.226
&gt;&gt;Courtney: I'm going to
start adding to our drawing.

00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:23.256
We can add parts from the bicycle,
we can also add parts from our wagon.

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:23.976
So Terrance, what should I add?

00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:27.556
&gt;&gt;Terrance: Get a chain and attach it

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:33.376
to the little gear he
made and make it roll.

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:36.376
&gt;&gt;Jeff: It's starting to happen.

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.546
&gt;&gt;Courtney: One of the things
that's neat about doing a project

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:42.546
like this is it provides an entry point,
and then a real world application.

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:47.166
So we're doing research about what
possible simple machines they could use.

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.276
&gt;&gt;Courtney: This is a
simple machine called--

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:50.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Plane, incline plane.

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:51.966
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Incline plane, very good!

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.746
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The next thing we're
talking about is idea development,

00:02:54.746 --> 00:02:57.566
where they're generating
sketches to show off their idea.

00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:00.626
It's one thing for someone to
be able to talk about an idea,

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:02.976
but to actually put it on paper makes
it a lot more concrete for a student.

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.766
&gt;&gt;Aeris: When you pull
the gear, the wheel spins.

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:10.516
&gt;&gt;Courtney: So the next step
is to synthesize designs.

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:11.976
Students sharing and
drawing on each other's work.

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:17.826
&gt;&gt;Courtney: She added a wheel, and she
added some shapes with a spring here.

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:19.936
&gt;&gt;Aeris: Brian, do you
want to work on mine?

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:22.476
&gt;&gt;Courtney: And then we'll
start to piece it together.

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:26.246
It is design-by-committee, but the
committees are second-grade students.

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:32.676
The fourth graders are working on a
Dream Cars Project-Based Learning Unit.

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:36.536
They're learning about
composition and materials and use.

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:40.316
Their project is going to
be to create a dream car

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:42.996
and design it for a particular customer.

00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:45.646
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Before we draw our vanishing
points, you're right, what do we need?

00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:45.956
Horizon line!

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:48.786
&gt;&gt;Students: Ooooh!

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:53.636
&gt;&gt;Courtney: They're at the phase now
of starting the sketching process.

00:03:54.096 --> 00:03:56.866
&gt;&gt;Courtney: One of the ways you
communicate is through your drawing.

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:01.606
This is not a drawing class, but I
want you to see that it is important

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:07.056
to learn how to do it, and do it well,
so that you can show off your idea.

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:08.716
A monster truck, you decide--

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:11.946
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The next step after that
would be actually modeling it in 3D.

00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:16.056
And they're gonna see how it's a
lot easier to model it out of clay,

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:18.196
if you have the sketch onboard.

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:20.886
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Most people don't
learn two-point perspective

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:22.256
until they're much older.

00:04:22.256 --> 00:04:23.746
I didn't learn it until high school.

00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:26.486
But I must have a lot
of confidence in you.

00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:29.086
I know that you guys have got this.

00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:30.766
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Rubrics are a big part

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:34.066
of the assessment strategy
for engineering design.

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:38.026
When you're talking about a
design process, the first thing

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:39.276
that you're given is a brief.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.416
This is what your boss--
that would be me--

00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:44.936
is looking for at the
end of the project.

00:04:45.316 --> 00:04:46.706
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Look on your rubric now,

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.016
and tell me what does
Kaleigh earn based on that.

00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:52.536
A 100, which is the equivalent
to a check-plus.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:55.546
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The students will
evaluate themselves at the end

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:56.986
to see whether they met the goals.

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:02.086
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Problem solving through design.

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:03.846
A lot of students, that's
how they learn.

00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:06.156
That kinesthetic-spatial-tactile
kind of knowing.

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.296
They get to come in here and that's part

00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:10.956
of how they understand what's
going on in engineering.

00:05:12.376 --> 00:05:15.036
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The value of
brainstorming, and not just rushing

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:17.196
without thinking all
the aspects through,

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:20.766
having success after many
failures, so persistence.

00:05:21.586 --> 00:05:23.276
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Get it in there, and
then pull the trigger again.

00:05:23.576 --> 00:05:23.926
There we go!

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:28.106
&gt;&gt;Courtney: That type of real world
experience they're going to carry

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:29.686
that with them for the
rest of their life.
