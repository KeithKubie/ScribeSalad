00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.480
 but actually I was yesterday when I looked 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.370
 Many of the groups saw them very 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.650
 misinformed and I'm honest I saw 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.120
 I did not see what you call 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.620
 Sometimes that cool substance today I see 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.550
 another theme different 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.880
 I feel that they already have concrete ideas 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.610
 they already have good elements 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.289
 grounded there are things that yes really 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.000
 they will serve us what we are 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.449
 looking for our entire ecosystem 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.010
 I think the contribution is going to be gigantic and 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.050
 I think that there is not going to be a single 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.510
 winner but I think they will have 10 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.309
 winning groups and I'm really very 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.780
 happy because I know that the results 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.780
 they are going to be giants 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.250
 really good thank you very much many 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.649
 thanks paco we were watching there 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.100
 quickly what happened with this nursery 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.910
 but 2013 we are going to go a cut like this very 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.739
 quickly because the challenge is coming 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.809
 let's complete the challenge let's 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.809
 follow of course with 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.409
 the presentation of each of the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.140
 groups and with much more money but 2013 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.500
 edition so seconds already we come back with 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.500
 much more 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.520
 Hello my name is Guillermo León 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.729
 angel business group 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.679
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.560
 because we are learning python as 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.780
 crazy and I think there are no people in the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 group simply we are all very good 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 in what we are doing and joining 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.609
 forces here to finish fast today 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 I spoke with Guillermo Gómez I am from the group 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.829
 of 7 is very count percent but 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.679
 we have the certainty changes every morning and 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.530
 we have all contributed many things 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.130
 important in the group but I rescue 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.110
 to our partner who has a lot 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.729
 knowledge and has not contributed too much 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.380
 much more thank you very much 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.079
 good afternoon no man is july 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.799
 makes the area part of the group 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.250
 recycled 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.670
 we carry an approximate 75 percent 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.010
 of the project and therefore 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.569
 we consider our genius 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.590
 It has always been our project manager 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.290
 who was he 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.810
 who originated the idea good my name 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.270
 is Ricardo Chiriboga from the group of 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.120
 agronomy 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.129
 I think 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.830
 the one that has given the most in the group 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.450
 It has been between the designer and the project 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.440
 made because they have tried to guide us 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.690
 us about the idea my friend didier 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.700
 is taking care of the front part 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.700
 end and 40% 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.659
 well good we continue in this video you 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.819

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.560
 presentation of the groups comes the 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.329
 presentation of each of the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.230
 solutions all that devotional innovation 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:11.379
 list and available for you there 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.239

 good in you good very good look let's go to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.849
 review quickly because there is grace 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.189
 number of messages now our 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.140
 social focus and we remember quickly 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.730
 we remembered payments that can not continue 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.170
 may well join the community 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.090
 developers that can follow the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.579
 plage page by supposed developers 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.720
 google put more one according to the 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.340
 circles because we have so many 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.659
 information for you talk a lot 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.180
 with us nor god 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.730
 where is the hidden camera the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.220
 developer where is the spy camera 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.689
 hidden 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.700
 we are going to look for it so attentive 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.549
 because you can also determine where 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.590
 where would you like more than this one 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.030
 camera is that I'm looking a little at 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.760
 see what is happening here in the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.739
 kitchen so we go to ccoo I know that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.569
 there are many messages in the social network to 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.380
 see what is happening many messages 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.800
 nor what not 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.830
 hector are raising passions in 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.260
 Mexico will particularly make days 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.840
 says ready to support talent 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.140
 Colombian and water for daniela del 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.140
 tram 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.250
 but there's competition gets better than 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.680
 the clear 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.390
 if he had the beltrán it is very pretty but 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.390
 that has now developed in love 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.930
 how are you these Mexicans that bars 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.880
 they are all Mexican it is true to say 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.040
 what a good barbarian while francisco 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.800
 continues analyzing the beni social network 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.180
 keep going because we have had 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.490
 speaking today, it's our turn 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.260
 talk about big query if we are 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.060
 speaking that is a bank scenario 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.160
 massive data or to analyze bank of 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.560
 massive cars that is good to consult 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.480
 yes that is not so optimal because we have 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.030
 other cloud solutions to perform 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.730
 insertions editions and different types 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.400
 of activities that the biggest advantage 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.530
 is to combine the infrastructure plus the 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.990
 platform and also use biker and you 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.510
 I say the challenge I tell you again I repeat 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.370
 you have to use the birth chart and 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.760
 that a public table that proposes 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.250
 leather and from that table tell us how many 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.140
 How many records are women in Mexico 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.480
 it was very easy in Mexico they did it in 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.320
 a second while flying you're solving 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.070
 and connected 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.020
 us on this final day of day 2 of 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.830
 back end because we had still tomorrow 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.990
 the reward more if I go looking for two 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.610
 participants yes you can earn a 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.340
 prize of course because we have 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.630
 possibilities but I will look for the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:45.030
 bottom groups if you think 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.030
 or go by if you look how it happened 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.350
 working come with me 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.330
 seeing the man over there in gray let's see 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.010

 My neck wants to put some of its 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.529

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.830
 its developers man from our developers 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.200

 the since I see them that the iata comes 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.670
 one of its developers who is encouraged 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.840
 sit down well which easy traditional sql 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.140

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.720
 something very interesting so now we're going 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.330
 to see who came from the 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.080
 group developers none what 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.370

 what we have what we have to do 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.810
 then it is to make a query and now 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.430
 we have to consult the table of 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.230
 birth rate and know how many women have 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.110

 and against the birth until the 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.470

 quick I have to tell the lord first 

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:50.829
 if we have to count how many records 

00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:53.019
 they are women of that birth chart 

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:54.729
 we quickly started counting 25 

00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:59.889
 seconds from now voices and tote for 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:08:08.469

 20 seconds because the lady is like 

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.639
 has already lost some time so 20 

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.899
 seconds let's start counting from 

00:08:53.639 --> 00:09:00.500
 here because you want to modify the code 

00:08:54.899 --> 00:09:04.470
 earlier yes so the 2010 1918 and yes 

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:06.959
 this is for a trip to silicon valley 14 

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:11.850
 which also has a combination with no 

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:18.380
 new york so 10 and 14 3 good for 

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:21.470
 go to london of course 10 98 

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:24.080
 the fault, good, thank you very much 

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:27.470
 sadly I fail 

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.050
 thank you very much the next dinner seems 

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:33.260
 that Mexico was better prepared I do not 

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:35.450
 I want to say nothing in this but good if 

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.250
 is a little bit we are going to leave the 

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.130
 question whether we take the value 

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.270
 of the social network because the people in the 

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.390
 social network 

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:47.270
 of course you can still solve the 

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.970
 question so let's wait for 

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.040
 see what our mentors say 

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.680
 virtual our mental developers 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.420
 payments if you think we are preparing 

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.820
 prepare for the presentation and ready 

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:02.240
 ready all ready all are all 

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:05.390
 ready so we took but some 

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.240
 seconds a few seconds nothing more and already 

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.770
 we come with the presentation of each one 

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.810
 of the groups where you're going to see all the 

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.730
 innovation from this nursery questions and 

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:17.830
 what seconds we heat engines and already 

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.830
 we go with much more fun 

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:41.490
 my name is guillermo lion of the group 

00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:44.670
 business angel 

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.649
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.529
 because we are learning python as 

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:50.130
 crazy and I think there are no people in the 

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:51.930
 group 

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.190
 we are all simply very good at what 

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.740
 what are we doing and joining forces 

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.480
 here to finish fast was the best 

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.279
 guillermo gómez I am from group 7 

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.459
 we are 40 percent but we have the 

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:04.620
 certainty that I am finished tomorrow and all 

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:07.470
 We have all contributed many things 

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:11.100
 important in the group but I rescue 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.899
 to our partner who has a lot 

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.550
 knowledge and no help contributed 

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:16.260
 too much much more thank you 

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.810
 good afternoon not a name is July 

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:23.130
 Cesar Arzo I am part of the group recycles 

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:26.600
 Well, we have an approximate of 75 

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.970
 percent of the project and then 

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.529
 we consider our genius 

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.529
 it has always been our project manager 

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:35.920
 who was he 

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:37.360
 that who originated the idea good my 

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.230
 name is ricardo chiriboga 

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.320
 the agronomy group 

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.450
 It seems to me that the one who has given the most 

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.700
 size in the group has been between 

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.160
 designer and the project manager have 

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.200
 tried to guide us on the 

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.820
 idea my friend 

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.450
 Didier is taking care of the part 

00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:00.570
 of the front end and the backend submits you to 

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.890
 what promises us 40 percent we 

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.660
 lack is to put the services at 

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.660
 bridge so that person from fernando 

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:25.490
 william lion of the group and the business 

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:27.499
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:31.240
 because we are learning python to the 

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:31.240
 crazy and I think that 

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.380
 well we're still in this nursery 

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.330
 probos 2000 decision bogotá reaches the 

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.770
 presentation of the applications reaches 

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.440
 the presentation of the groups paco I am 

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.660
 very excited to see the breakthrough for 

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.450
 this second day not like that is nick and ya 

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:51.150
 we have the number one team ready here 

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:54.090
 alejandro all yours we coppel to how 

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:56.460
 they are and good 

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.890
 Diana no longer asked for a loan in a 

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:02.279
 cooperative she finds out that she has to 

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.589
 leave for two months from the city 

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:08.129
 she can only pay the fees 

00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:10.499
 your credit at the place where you asked for it 

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:12.029
 just like her there are more than 5 million 

00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:15.790
 users who can present this same 

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:18.300
 problem to do before 

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.760
 that's why I do not know how 

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.059
 cooperate solution to a real problem and 

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.219
 it does not create a need 

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:28.160
 is available anywhere in the 

00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:30.920
 world you are inside or outside your city 

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.329
 In addition, the cooperatives at the 

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:36.429
 worldwide work under the same model 

00:13:34.329 --> 00:13:38.880
 the cooperative team has the 

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:40.860
 knowledge 

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.040
 facilitates the exchange of products and 

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:48.650
 services between cooperatives between 

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.650
 users and between cooperatives and users 

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.650
 So far what we have 

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.499
 worked is this is our image 

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.360
 corporate 

00:13:54.499 --> 00:13:58.670
 please the next 

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.160
 we already have an application that 

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.810
 you can see on a website and in addition to 

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.660
 we are working on our 

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.269
 web application the entire structure of 

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.500
 this application is contained in the 

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:11.690
 next way is an application 

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:16.350
 scalable is a highly application 

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:21.050
 available that is mounted on it 

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:23.120
 in the app engine uses the data store 

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.330
 is developed in the web framework 

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.589
 app written in python we use that 

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.600
 to communicate with the different 

00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:33.199
 dispositives 

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.839
 cloud points we use a framework that 

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:38.300
 it's called lungo and besides that 

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:40.959
 we use something from the client side that 

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.959
 it's called to turn 

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:47.590
 thank you very much very well loud applause 

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:49.480
 then to cooperate thank you very much 

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.540
 what barbarian paco what good presentation 

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.370
 it was a presentation and we are going to make them 

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.110
 a brief comment now from the party 

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.630
 technological some of our mentors 

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:01.030
 here they have been doing evaluation of 

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.460
 all your code we are going to give you a 

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.870
 average of what we think they have in 

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.110
 this moment so that you have an idea 

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:10.450
 know that you can improve between today and 

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:14.260
 tomorrow for you in particular they go 

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:16.540
 very well they have a 2.83 on average in 

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.520
 this scale from 1 to 5 

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.710
 then technically speaking it's a 

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.690
 solid product but can still 

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.700
 round up some details between today and 

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:27.960
 tomorrow very well thanks and congratulations 

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:30.330
 then thank you very much Alejandro 

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.579
 neither is our group the number 

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.230
 2 does not add up 

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:36.869
 let's look then here we have the 

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:39.899
 presentation quickly we are going to 

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:43.129
 looking for group number two is here 

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:43.129
 it is not true the 11 minutes 

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:49.680
 minutes ago and it's coming 

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:51.209
 ok or the nights I'm going to talk to you 

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.910
 little more than what we have already developed 

00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:55.620
 we are in 70 percent we can already 

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.420
 deploy applications in the cloud and in 

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.449
 own domain in fact if you can 

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:02.109
 happen 

00:15:59.449 --> 00:16:02.109
 let's hear 

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:09.290
 the stem that appears when from 

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.269
 our app and good and our page 

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.889
 web that we have running the 

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:14.120
 applications automatically creates a 

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.709
 instance and the first screen is what 

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.540
 they receive in the domain that we 

00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:19.639
 we provide this is what topication is 

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.829
 ready to spray is simply to throw 

00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:23.810
 the first clip and you can already have your 

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:25.610
 own as you can enter these 

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.569
 pages and see it running the 

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.759
 page as it is current of our 

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:30.529
 up is what is going to be today 

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:32.180
 at night 7 and tomorrow but already the 

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:35.829
 functioning as such is then already 

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.829
 the difficult step and it became easy 

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:41.990
 and that is practically our 

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.150
 direct competition and is hosted in 

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.100
 amazon which is the direct competition of 

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.420
 club then practically a 

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.890
 competition 

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.570
 but that has two million 

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.890
 applications running over two thousand of 

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.270
 applications then why not 

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.360
 use this in the servers of 

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.360
 Google 

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.940
 a strong applause for the group 

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:11.069
 If you want to try it tomorrow clear 

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:12.959
 that yes clear that yes to approve is to apply 

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.029
 acts to contain their valuations and 

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:16.350
 we have a valuation in reality this 

00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:17.669
 is the team that is most advanced 

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.579
 technically he is the one who has the 

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:22.079
 qualification at this time highest 

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:24.269
 3.83 which is very good we are 

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:26.220
 talking about a competition also from 

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:28.470
 see the agility of the team to 

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.690
 implement solutions then they go very 

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.759
 well you have to round up I guess that part 

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:35.970
 of the concept for the part let's say of 

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:38.039
 sale and the impact for SMEs that is 

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.350
 let's say like the subject here but very 

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:42.450
 well solid the loud applause the 

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.580
 highest technological evaluation 

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.129
 speaking really good they will have psycho 

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.470
 I'm really pleasantly surprised 

00:17:46.129 --> 00:17:50.940
 surprised because having solutions 

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.009
 awesome really so like that so 

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.220
 we continue to see the team 3 

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:57.840
 let's go with the team 3 yes hopefully the 

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.059
 presentation of team 3 that we have 

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.669
 we all remember if both in the 

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:05.359
 repositor team 3 23 minutes ago 

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:05.359
 here no bis plus 

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.240
 there we go with big blues 

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:20.820
 the previous one ok 

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:25.310
 to see if they help me see which of 

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.310
 all because 24 minutes dry 

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.290
 you tell me group three days two 

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.290
 times 

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.630
 I ask myself and I answer myself 

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:49.690
 cordial greeting our project is 

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.690
 he calls bis plus that is 

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:55.130
 and promote strategic alliances 

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.130
 among SMEs 

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:02.450
 respect how that platform works is 

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:04.820
 a responsible website is going to be able to see 

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.520
 any device and on the platform 

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:10.970
 the following scheme is handled 

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.060
 that the person enters the page can 

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:16.160
 locate SMEs that may have the 

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.230
 same product and they suddenly have 

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.320
 the flaws in different aspects 

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:23.570
 as a company can then move to a 

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.520
 part that integrates t which is where the 

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:28.040
 first can relate and negotiate 

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.560
 your products or can share the 

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:34.280
 flaws weaknesses and strengths between 

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.750
 them and projects that is finally what 

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.240
 that you are looking for a partnership to generate 

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:42.950
 projects that generate impact 

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.950
 in the sector or in the market 

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.860
 then as I said the 

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:52.640
 application is this and the website 

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:55.780
 actually the graphic design can be 

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.970
 observe that there are some specifications 

00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:03.440
 of the use of these from this application is 

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:05.990
 login with the google + login and 

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.550
 You can also take a previous look at 

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.550
 the application that actually 

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.400
 or the most striking thing about this application 

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:20.010
 is the fact that the person enters 

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.590
 this page is this page place 

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.870
 select a sector immediately 

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.520
 appears SMEs that are willing to 

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:29.480
 negotiate with them to generate a 

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.480
 strategic alliance 

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.389
 then the tools that are 

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.019
 used so that is being used 

00:20:34.389 --> 00:20:41.320
 for for this project is google + as 

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:42.789
 I was commenting on the part of 

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.240
 project management what is google 

00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:47.960
 drive what is 

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.960
 hangout 

00:20:48.509 --> 00:20:53.489
 perfect good a round of applause for the group 

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:53.489
 number 3 

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.560
 technical evaluation of technical evaluation 

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.690
 you are in the middle of the table 

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:04.740
 it is also a solid application has 

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:07.530
 a 2.33 are a little behind the 

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:10.830
 first group and a lot more behind the 

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.120
 second they go to the head but also 

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.400
 they still have very good possibilities 

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.230
 to integrate something this recommendation is 

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.080
 we do it to all the groups try 

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:22.440
 have your stake running tomorrow 

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:24.750
 it gives a great plus in your application something 

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:28.550
 that the judges can play using 

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.550
 etcetera but very well 

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.600
 perfect loud applause of course 

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.490
 again there for the group good paco h 

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.380
 we are seeing because he is here 

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.210
 we talk about football and all that and that 

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.430
 sometimes one wins half of the table 

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:43.380
 it's easy basically as he says 

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.150
 estevo says beat belgium is like 

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.190
 be in the middle of the table but good 

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:50.520
 matter do not worry about course 

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:52.050
 we are going to cut super fast if we 

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.210
 let's take a few minutes 

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.980
 seconds nothing more a few seconds and we're going 

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.370
 to go see all this innovation that 

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.830
 we're 

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.680
 the level by voice bogota edition so 

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.600
 we warm up engines we prepare arrive 

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.260
 the groups the following group the group 

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:09.360
 number 4 567 all that remain for 

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.760
 share with us the progress of this 

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.910
 second day of development and innovation 

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.500
 of adrenaline that have characters here 

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.000
 in colombia so we prepare 

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.310
 heated engines and we come back with a lot 

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.680
 more level or forgiveness 2013 Bogota edition 

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.940
 in the group we are simply all very 

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.480
 good at what we are doing and 

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:31.850
 joining forces to finish fast 

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.030
 gomez of group 7 we are 40% but 

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:37.850
 we have the surprise changes every morning and 

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:40.730
 we have all contributed many things 

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:44.330
 important in the group but I rescue 

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.890
 to our partner who has a lot 

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.960
 knowledge and has not contributed 

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.490
 too much much more thank you 

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.890
 good afternoon no name is july 

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:56.360
 Cesar aso I am part of the group I grew up 

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:59.870
 claps we take an approximate of 75 

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.210
 percent of the project and then 

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.770
 we consider our genius 

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.790
 It has always been our project manager 

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:09.460
 who was he 

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:12.010
 who originated the idea good my name 

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.460
 is Ricardo Chiriboga from the group of 

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.580
 agronomy 

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.710
 It seems to me that the one who has given the most 

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.570
 size in the group has been between 

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.159
 designer and the project manager because 

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.970
 they have tried to guide us 

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:28.850
 about the idea my friend didier is 

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:33.890
 commissioning the front end part and 

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:35.510
 the backend submitting it at 40% we are missing 

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:39.669
 is to put the services to the source for 

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.669
 that person of fernando consumes 

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:48.420
 good we continue in this developers 

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:51.540
 2013 Bogota edition as we are 

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.430
 happening payment that great we are seeing 

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.960
 great applications and the turn comes 

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.060
 of the next group then whom 

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.540
 we have prepared the team number 4 

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:02.870
 daniela please glove talkies 

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:05.280
 my name is diana them where are they going 

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.110
 who want to fulfill your wishes and 

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.170
 we are a team that wants 

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:13.260
 meet theirs well basically what 

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:15.650
 that seeks one tip is that being a 

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:19.260
 mobile application that allows you 

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:21.840
 Find the products you want 

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.810
 without you having to look for them is 

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.910
 say that the proposals reach tim 

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:30.150
 howard with gloves we have 

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:36.860
 come working some platforms 

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:36.860
 like google + analytics 

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:51.990
 and android 

00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:53.970
 and cloud platform 

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:57.990
 maybe a little bit of the ones that never 

00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:00.450
 we have had in regards to the front-end more 

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.520
 that everything here visually then then 

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:06.120
 how the idea works is that you 

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:08.669
 authentic entering by your google + if 

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.519
 you want to bid 

00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:15.359
 with that offer or if you want to look for a 

00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:17.009
 product you want to wish as regards liu 

00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:19.259
 come out then that's how the 

00:25:17.009 --> 00:25:21.600
 visualization of liu being we were doing 

00:25:19.259 --> 00:25:23.460
 some categories and you in those categories 

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.509
 you're basically going to set some parameters 

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:29.100
 as your budget the colors and the 

00:25:27.509 --> 00:25:31.859
 object in particular the product in 

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:34.350
 particular you want and the dimensions 

00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:36.149
 What do you want us to do? 

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.619
 very social and that you can share 

00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:40.169
 with your friends and they can give you 

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:42.869
 recommendations by the other side of the 

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:45.179
 click on the client then you will see 

00:25:42.869 --> 00:25:47.429
 also as a player some categories of 

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:50.519
 products and the wish lists of the 

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:53.279
 people who have asked you what you 

00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:55.710
 you offer the idea is that then that you like 

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:58.259
 company you can reach exactly is in 

00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:01.129
 that specific niche of the market that 

00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:01.129
 want what you 

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.590
 applause for the group number 42 

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:11.750
 thank you jana also value rating 

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:15.200
 super good work are tied in a 

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:17.750
 third place they have three points in the 

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.570
 scale from 1 to 5 very well and is the only 

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:21.679
 to where I have in my notes the only 

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.590
 what is an application of 

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:27.559
 native android ok extra point for by 

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:31.280
 accountants are strong applaud team 

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:33.230
 number 5 well the number 5 we will look for 

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:37.270
 your presentation that is already loaded here 

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.270
 pre-loaded day 2 no match point 

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.260
 salt at 5 

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.110
 good evening we are more today 

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.049
 what identifies is a problem the 

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:54.019
 problem we have is that there are SMEs 

00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:55.850
 who have needs and there are bidders 

00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:58.220
 who have products and services and are 

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.799
 looking for clients then the solution 

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.110
 we propose through matchpoint is 

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:05.360
 connect those needs with those 

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:08.090
 bidders then the idea of ​​the 

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.899
 platform is that you enter with that 

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.909
 you need 

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:12.860
 when you need it and how much are you 

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:14.480
 willing to pay and different 

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.909
 bidders who make their best proposal 

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.889
 is a proposal that has to be a 

00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:21.620
 balance between cost-benefit and 

00:27:18.889 --> 00:27:24.080
 for each SME, choose which one is like 

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.090
 most important point where the currency 

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.710
 I prefer price I prefer time I prefer 

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.809
 quality already depends on each of the 

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.130
 specific needs of the 

00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:33.800
 SME 

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.840
 our problem is when I eat how much 

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.159
 you need it 

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.430
 let's say our main 

00:27:37.159 --> 00:27:41.500
 Differentials is 

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:44.140
 we go into needs there are many 

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:47.020
 portals that give you offers and you apply 

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:49.720
 those offers in this case the by say 

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.940
 that the base is I need something who 

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.730
 can do what I need to whom 

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:57.100
 can not supply a need once the 

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:59.380
 satisfies let's say there's a process of 

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.660
 auction in reverse and is that you say 

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.280
 when you need it and how much are you 

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:06.730
 willing to pay and the people that you 

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:09.220
 offer something they offer you according to that offer 

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.570
 maximum that maximum price that you gave what 

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.340
 that helps the cost go away 

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.440
 reducing and in a market like those 

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.150
 SMEs where we all say that the costs 

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.640
 are so essential and the idea is that you 

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:20.920
 reduce your expenses as an auction to the 

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.730
 reverse is a huge benefit and the 

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:26.470
 scale and scalability because it serves 

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.630
 for all types of SMEs from a 

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.940
 bakery to a technology company 

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:33.010
 any type of SMEs may need 

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:35.140
 services and on this platform is going to 

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:37.900
 find someone who is willing to 

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:41.520
 meet those needs that have 

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.520
 very good loud applause 

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:49.290
 good incident with a good pitch 

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.810
 we also have this team in a great 

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:54.330
 second place technically speaking they have 

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:56.790
 done a very solid job they go very well 

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.980
 so for her we have several 

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.740
 competitors that they should put them to 

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:04.380
 everyone to think they have to climb their 

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.820
 level of applications but they go well and 

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.710
 good for not that because 

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.350
 let's imagine the vuce quoted that says 

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:13.900
 you need the 5 liters of fuel or 50 

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:16.250
 liters as we use to pay so much 

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.590
 well there could not buy much but 

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.059
 ok we could ok come on then 

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:26.020
 with group number 6 

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:28.460
 ok let's see 6 day 2 a yale business comes 

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:32.460
 or 

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:34.669
 it's very big says ok it's a problem with 

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:38.600
 group 6 

00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:40.609
 ok come on let's go with the group number 77 

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:44.720
 of course of course we make a 

00:29:40.609 --> 00:29:47.509
 change at the end day 2 arrive 

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:50.350
 working ants of group 7 a 

00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:50.350
 the ants 

00:29:53.499 --> 00:29:58.129
 is an application that allows 

00:29:56.389 --> 00:30:01.260
 first it is based on several technologies of 

00:29:58.129 --> 00:30:04.450
 concord as are the sun 

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:06.910
 autos analytics is an application in 

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.920
 base for android for web application 

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.980
 because there are several SMEs that do not 

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:14.230
 they have android also keeps it with 

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.690
 google maps and used the technology of 

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:19.080
 maine cakes that also uses google and 

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:22.630
 well the idea of ​​the general problem is 

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:25.120
 that several SMEs do not necessarily 

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:26.890
 they have contacts with the outside or with 

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.140
 merchants apart then what 

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:31.270
 we do in general is a 

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.670
 solution the solution that we generate is 

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:36.400
 a channel of dialogue that can 

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:38.230
 allow you to manage that you can 

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.180
 allow grow that you can afford 

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:43.260
 expand as well as get others 

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:46.140
 business that would not normally get 

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:48.360
 the business model itself is based on 

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:51.390
 a platform that can contain data 

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.160
 that can get that analysis of 

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.870
 market just as it can offer 

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.300
 products and distributors 

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:59.160
 and can attract other goods and others 

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.940
 products that are not available in the 

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.940
 current market 

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:07.260
 seen thank you very much payton with the 

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:10.230
 absence of phenomena 7 

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.850
 technical evaluation and technical evaluation 

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:15.030
 is that as you can see they also have 

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:17.820
 a plethora of tools and apis of 

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.930
 google are tied was the draw 

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.930
 that we have in the third place 

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:23.850
 technically speaking they go very well and 

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:25.830
 well I think the product is 

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:28.230
 relatively stable the pitch could 

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.300
 improve a little concentration doing it 

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.880
 more attractive but it seems to me that 

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.080
 Congratulations are going very well too 

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.430
 perfect perfect and we remember by 

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.200
 course we have group number 6 already 

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:38.520
 prepared but we also remember that 

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.930
 all these applications can see them 

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.270
 because they are in the public repository 

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:44.190
 permanently they are updated and 

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:47.070
 they see so we go then with the 

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:49.410
 group number 6 onwards that 

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:53.030
 comes there the business now is now 

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:53.030
 so speed voice hits 

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.320
 I'm part of the team beyond business 

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.850
 my name is christian palau and 

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.380
 basically what we have identified is 

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.990
 that SMEs have grown in a way 

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:08.270
 informal and that informality lane the an 

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:11.580
 in their organizational culture that has 

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:14.100
 subtracted competitiveness to them 

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.410
 we have to do carlos sorry that makes 

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.570
 part of an SME and he wants to improve his 

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:22.620
 project development process for 

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:25.950
 your clients what's up with that he 

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.960
 It is part of 12 thousand 650 SME companies 

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.940
 in colombia that do not use the tic's 

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.280
 precisely for the development of 

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.510
 projects as such that as I already know 

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.850
 I said before it reduces competitiveness 

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:38.190
 because the tic's today makes it faster 

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:40.200
 much the processes what is our 

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.520
 objective to potentiate three pillars 

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.000
 fundamentals within the organization 

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:48.090
 competitiveness innovation and the 

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.850
 growth of SMEs how are we going to 

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:53.190
 do we have three phases the first one is 

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:55.170
 develop through an interface that 

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:57.720
 It is didactic and easy to use 

00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:00.690
 platform that uses scrum that is for 

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:03.420
 develop projects the second phase 

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:05.550
 It is a phase that what it seeks is to improve 

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:08.580
 the process of generating innovation or 

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:11.340
 innovation within MSMEs and the 

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.440
 third phase is precisely through 

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.870
 metrics that they play and increase 

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.700
 or can have growth 

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.950
 through the metrics within the 

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.559
 organ within the platform for the 

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:24.090
 first phase we have developed the 

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:25.470
 first part that the development of 

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.090
 projects as I told you has a 

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.800
 interface that is very very easy to use 

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:31.410
 there for them that what they do is that 

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.870
 believe it and in this case Carlos has 

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:37.440
 four projects then that are going to 

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:39.720
 go managing little by little and you will go 

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.830
 showing the metrics of all of his 

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.080
 all your side from what there is 

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:44.309
 developing he's going to have there that 

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.020
 integrated air with all its 

00:33:44.309 --> 00:33:48.030
 teammates and on their smartphone 

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.850
 they will be able to see the advances of 

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:52.440
 kout as we have done it then team 

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.230
 developer that is a hard one on this 

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.820
 they have integrated four fundamental things 

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:59.760
 the application that will be available 

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:01.470
 already entered a few moments the beta phase of 

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.980
 the application is available on the play 

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.200
 store 

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:07.630
 is available on android football 

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.159
 storage we have the calendar so that 

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:11.800
 can continue to watch their progress within 

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:13.139
 of each project and we have the google to 

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.849
 pyongyang 

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:18.649
 finally our great team of 

00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:21.529
 work that seriously has been excellent 

00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:23.559
 a guard applause for Eurasia group and 

00:34:21.529 --> 00:34:26.389
 also covering technical assessment 

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:28.639
 thanks cristian let's go before doing 

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:31.129
 quickly a cut I want to tell you that 

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:32.869
 watching the presentation and what we know 

00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:35.240
 technically from you like there's no 

00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:37.789
 a match are quite more qualified 

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.109
 having 1.6 and that's because 

00:34:37.789 --> 00:34:40.669
 they are probably not raising their 

00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:42.919
 code in time to the repository and not 

00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:46.220
 are giving you an opportunity to evaluate it 

00:34:42.919 --> 00:34:48.799
 but they have everything tonight and the day of 

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:51.800
 tomorrow to put it there and show us 

00:34:48.799 --> 00:34:54.860
 all this that looks pretty good 

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.970
 perfect low excellent already well in the 

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.340
 presentation of the following groups 

00:34:55.970 --> 00:35:00.020
 but I'm not going to take a few seconds to 

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.400
 some seconds to tell you very 

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:05.120

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.480
 social approach and promote 

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.100
 other applications 

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.810
 another of the teachings this nursery but 

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.670
 bosch 2013 of course can 

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:21.620
 promote the application is all 

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.850
 latin america looking at them so many 

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.340
 thanks for staying connected like this with 

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.570
 with all the innovation that we are 

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.220
 watching here so to ccoo us 

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.680
 we took a few seconds and we're back with 

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.040
 much more free but with 2013 edition already 

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.040

 group there business 

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:55.460
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:58.280
 because we are learning python to the 

00:35:55.460 --> 00:36:00.530
 crazy and I think there are no people in the 

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.850
 group simply we are all very good

 Cesar Arzo I am part of the group 

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.970
 recycled 

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:35.170
 we carry an approximate 75 percent 

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.170
 of the project 

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:56.990
 follow the presentation group number 88 and 

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.910
 progressively they followed us on their side 

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:01.880
 we do not need a presentation 

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:03.170
 we have a live product alive and so 

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.630
 we are going to demonstrate to all Latin America 

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:07.730
 here live set for the audience 

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:10.010
 also how it works so go ahead 

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:13.160
 good night, my name is fabian 

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:15.230
 zapata and belong to the recycling group 

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.470
 as they already knew how to recycle 

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:20.930
 application that allows us to manage 

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:22.790
 all this electronic waste that does not 

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.920
 they serve us as people 

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:27.200
 natural or private companies that 

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.430
 They do not know what to do with them 

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.950
 be a solution through the 

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:33.910
 platform where you can post that 

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:36.650
 electronic element that does not serve you and 

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:39.230
 probably to another person if it serves 

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:41.930
 somewhere then is how to generate 

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:43.580
 the profiles we have advance then 

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.319
 something the landing page where there is 

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.449
 information 

00:37:45.319 --> 00:37:49.910
 in the registry we can register a 

00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:51.739
 user register a company then 

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:54.910
 in the registry of a user we are going to 

00:37:51.739 --> 00:37:54.910
 make an example mode to put 

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:05.360
 and this is an area of ​​opportunity for 

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:08.170
 google + haining 

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.660
 totally one click 

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:13.330
 click and more and ready 

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:17.140
 Exactly clear is that we need to have 

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:20.020
 data such as personal data for 

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:23.550
 identify what in people 

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.550
 they are identified 

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:27.510
 along with oops running against the 

00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:31.420
 time was not 

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:34.730
 he closed all of us all the bronze 

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:38.380
 that could close iron 

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.380
 I am a woman who has worked 

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:45.349
 but 

00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:50.689
 60 because it was awful now how are we going 

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:55.839
 to return to retake 2013 you have to recycle 

00:38:50.689 --> 00:38:55.839
 the only one is not more than the semifinal 

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.560
 you can come the horn 

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:14.320
 if I do not want to have to put me 

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:24.340
 here it can come out like the hammer blow of 

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.340
 mechanic 

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:34.910
 all because it may not be the 

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:37.010
 platform is saying we are 

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:39.140
 transmitting all the information from 

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:42.080
 the portal if from your computer 

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:44.210
 reports the pod then then 

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.339
 to register us because it identifies the 

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:49.910
 current location where are we going to 

00:39:46.339 --> 00:39:51.920
 publish the waste then in that device 

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:54.500
 electronic that is that it no longer serves us 

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.740
 then one could post any 

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.200
 thing 

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:03.119
 yes yes yes it can be something 

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:03.119
 It is also going out of fashion 

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:09.119
 good 

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.530
 they have the possibility of moving forward 

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.980
 so we give it a loud applause group 

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:21.010
 number 80 and register and have a route 

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:23.349
 where then by means of fusion tables 

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:25.990
 verify the exact ones and following the route 

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:28.660
 you are working here and you are sleeping 

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:31.119
 a group perfectly thank you very much 

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.589
 we go with the group number 9 that in 

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:34.089
 some time we are going to enter the 

00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:36.599
 presentations to see if they let me do 

00:40:34.089 --> 00:40:36.599
 a little more 

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:50.450
 ok let's go to 

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:54.000
 ok here have presentations ok 

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:55.610
 while it looks like a wonder 

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.650
 9 

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:00.790
 quickly to see that he helps me with the 

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:03.510
 group number 9 because I do not see it very like that 

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:03.510
 down down 

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:14.579
 we will see that 

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:15.960
 but well let's go forward agro 

00:41:14.579 --> 00:41:18.660
 Goodnight 

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:21.599
 It was nice she has a farm on her farm 

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.730
 she has cows and she has pigs she wants 

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:25.680
 get vaccine for your cows and 

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:28.589
 food and wants to put on sale their 

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:31.440
 pigs were usually resorts to where 

00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:33.910
 today Miguel and buy the vaccine if the 

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:36.579
 food for your backs 

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:39.460
 and use the voice to voice method to 

00:41:36.579 --> 00:41:41.799
 market your pigs when you go 

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:45.090
 back home a neighbor says juanita 

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:48.860
 you have already tried agronomy 

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:52.680
 agronomy agronomy is an interface 

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:55.770
 web and mobile that allows the user 

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.990
 in the reference inputs of what is 

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:59.680
 is trading in the livestock sector to 

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:02.950
 regional level 

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:06.220
 as we can see our three types 

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:09.099
 fundamental is to locate suppliers and 

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:12.069
 products close to us is 

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:15.609
 find according to your budget and the 

00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:18.880
 another is to establish a supplier relationship 

00:42:15.609 --> 00:42:20.050
 with the seller this with that phil yo 

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.240
 I'm looking for products of the best 

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.069
 quality and I always look for the premise cost 

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.369
 quality with this application we are 

00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:30.579
 focused on being premise in the sector 

00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:32.890
 The country is very important 

00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:34.540
 take into account this equation and to our 

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:37.119
 part technical development with which 

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:40.599
 we count on paper and we're 

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:42.609
 using at point to connect the 

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:44.800
 mobile application then with the server 

00:42:42.609 --> 00:42:47.260
 It should be clarified in the upper part 

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.720
 we have the mobile application initially 

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:52.180
 only for users and web registration 

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.579
 for suppliers this with what purpose 

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.619
 the provider will upload data and goes the 

00:42:54.579 --> 00:42:57.880
 program about contents to our 

00:42:56.619 --> 00:43:00.430
 applications that's why we developed it 

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:03.210
 emphatically web since it is then 

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:05.220
 profile as likes android location 

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:08.599
 and the pre wars that we are working 

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.599
 thank you 

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.900
 the technical relationship so that we have the 

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:19.160
 equipment for the previous team 

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:21.350
 it was extremely fast 

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.880
 we do not have a lot of misinformation either 

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:24.290
 online are very poorly qualified 

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.040
 fact they are the last team in terms 

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:29.300
 technicians because we have not really seen 

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.580
 how everything is implemented that we 

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.020
 they showed here working then 

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:35.420
 make sure we can understand what 

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.460
 what they have there for you go 

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.570
 pretty good then we say that 

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.770
 message also that we always talk 

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.820
 keep programming 

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.680
 they continue program and they are programming 

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.349
 then they say programming also good 

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.299
 we go with group number 10 then 

00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:48.369
 sorry he started the 10 for 

00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:50.559
 agronomy, you are doing quite well 

00:43:48.369 --> 00:43:53.559
 they are there in the middle of the table as in 

00:43:50.559 --> 00:43:55.829
 fourth place 267 it looks solid its 

00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:55.829
 application 

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.760
 we did the validation of the 

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.200
 application with a user he is 

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.200
 interested in investing in the platform 

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.460
 and the knowledge propose them the 

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.080
 explanations the next 30 

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.400
 interesting ok let's see then 

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.780
 let's talk a lot more on the day of 

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.190
 tomorrow with you to see what it is about 

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.780
 that story we keep working 

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:16.670
 here in this proven nursery you know 

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.450
 totally live so it has come with the 

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:21.170
 group number 10 

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:23.420
 Good evening, today 

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:25.820
 we work on three fronts 

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:28.640
 one then the first and the most important 

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.890
 the back in on the package as we are 

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:35.010
 taking advantage of everything that the 

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:37.650
 app engine and also the data storage 

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:41.019
 Additionally, we wanted to improve a 

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:42.999
 little French design 

00:44:41.019 --> 00:44:44.979
 taking into account then that we change a 

00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:48.399
 little of the logo we change also the 

00:44:44.979 --> 00:44:50.799
 pages where you're going to access let's say the 

00:44:48.399 --> 00:44:54.130
 employer when you are looking for 

00:44:50.799 --> 00:44:55.929
 initiative where we focus strongly on 

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:59.439
 today was to validate our model 

00:44:55.929 --> 00:45:01.779
 of business we did an investigation of 

00:44:59.439 --> 00:45:04.659
 market looking at what our 

00:45:01.779 --> 00:45:07.089
 possible competitors and we find therefore 

00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:09.630
 that the competition is really strong 

00:45:07.089 --> 00:45:11.739
 but we believe that we have a plus 

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:14.380
 taking into account that we what 

00:45:11.739 --> 00:45:17.499
 we want to generate is welfare to 

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.479
 teleworker we basically want 

00:45:17.499 --> 00:45:22.079
 solve three problems that is 

00:45:19.479 --> 00:45:25.269
 generate well-being by bringing the worker 

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:27.489
 generate added value to the employer 

00:45:25.269 --> 00:45:29.649
 that uses teleworking as a 

00:45:27.489 --> 00:45:32.500
 initiative so you can take advantage 

00:45:29.649 --> 00:45:36.210
 better your infrastructure resources 

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:38.830
 and generate access to different 

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:41.380
 work modalities through the 

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:44.110
 telework initiative we found 

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.280
 for example curious facts that in the 

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:47.560
 most countries at the 

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.160
 Latin American have standards that 

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.630
 encourage teleworking and regulations that 

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.970
 let's say they provide benefits for 

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:58.090
 implement these initiatives was also 

00:45:54.970 --> 00:46:00.310
 the figures that show the markets of 

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:02.500
 teleworking because they are quite attractive 

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:04.600
 for example in the case of Brazil in the 

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.450
 now we find that there are 10.8 

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:10.090
 millions of active teleworkers 

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:13.750
 and barely 10% of the population in 

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:16.090
 what could be the object of our 

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:18.870
 our project here because there are the 

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.870
 validations 

00:46:19.279 --> 00:46:22.809
 loud applause for the group 

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:28.289
 very well very well is an idea 

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:31.260
 interesting indeed there is a lot 

00:46:28.289 --> 00:46:32.700
 a lot of competition in that market 

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.880
 technically they go very well having a 

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:39.240
 233 of 5 and a little bit through the 

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:41.549
 leaders but that's a good one good 

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.010
 technical solution because I think we've already seen
