Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. My God, I mean it's, it's a mystery enough to be born a human being a tool. Yes. You know, just to be alive is a, is, is, is, is an extraordinary mystery, yes. To have the ability to love, uh, to, to, to feel emotions, um, to understand beauty, to be moved by, by, by a symphony. All of all of these things we take for granted, but actually they're deeply mysterious. We don't really know what we are or, or who we are. And which is one of the reasons I'm so fascinated by Rick Strassman's work. Are you, you presented his film, Dmt, the spirit molecule, and on my upcoming speaking to her, I'm going to be doing an event with Rick, uh, on the 14th or 15th of May in Sedona. I think it will be the first time that Rick has spoken publicly for quite a while.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Rick has a colleague called Andrew Gallimore, uh, who teaches at the University of Aachen hour, uh, in Japan. And Rick and Andrew have together developed a, uh, technology, uh, for releasing DMT into human volunteers in a very slow drip that will keep them in the DMT state if they wish for hours on end. And, and the intention, the intention is to use this technology to explore and map the DMT realm. When do I sign up? Soon as possible. It's very close. Imperial College, it looks like Imperial College London is going to deploy this technology in further research into DMT and that that research is not going to be purely and simply into the therapeutic potential of a psychedelic, which is very important research to do. It's going to be an investigation into the nature of reality using a psychedelic, the mysterious nature of reality. And it is art. And you know this from personal experience that when you get plunged into that DMT realm, it is so different from the realm of our daily daily world filled, filled with geometry, filled with these sprightly intelligences completely internally coherent. How can that be, you know, generated by the brain, or are, are we dealing with some other level of reality that we haven't encountered yet? I think that ancient cultures, and in particular my lost civilization, were deeply involved in exploring the mysterious nature of reality.
