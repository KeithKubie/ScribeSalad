I want to tell you about a really lovely

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620
I want to tell you about a really lovely
 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.610
I want to tell you about a really lovely
problem suppose you have a circle how

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
problem suppose you have a circle how
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.680
problem suppose you have a circle how
many ways can you draw it well there's

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690
many ways can you draw it well there's
 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.210
many ways can you draw it well there's
only one way I mean we could make it

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
only one way I mean we could make it
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.799
only one way I mean we could make it
bigger we could make it smaller we could

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
bigger we could make it smaller we could
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.330
bigger we could make it smaller we could
move it around the paper but there's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
move it around the paper but there's
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.740
move it around the paper but there's
only one way so the answer for one

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750
only one way so the answer for one
 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.109
only one way so the answer for one
circle is one what if you have two

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
circle is one what if you have two
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.900
circle is one what if you have two
circles they could be inside each other

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
circles they could be inside each other
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.570
circles they could be inside each other
they could cross each other well they

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
they could cross each other well they
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.420
they could cross each other well they
could be separated so for two circles

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
could be separated so for two circles
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.710
could be separated so for two circles
three ways and I better tell you what

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
three ways and I better tell you what
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.400
three ways and I better tell you what
the rules are

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
the rules are
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.040
the rules are
we don't allow this kind of thing we

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
we don't allow this kind of thing we
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139
we don't allow this kind of thing we
don't allow two circles to just kiss

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
don't allow two circles to just kiss
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.520
don't allow two circles to just kiss
they've got to make up their mind

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
they've got to make up their mind
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.810
they've got to make up their mind
they've got to overlap or they've got to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
they've got to overlap or they've got to
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090
they've got to overlap or they've got to
be separate no that's not allowed and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
be separate no that's not allowed and
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190
be separate no that's not allowed and
when we get to more circles you're not

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
when we get to more circles you're not
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.810
when we get to more circles you're not
allowed to have three going through a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
allowed to have three going through a
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850
allowed to have three going through a
point that's not allowed either and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
point that's not allowed either and
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639
point that's not allowed either and
what's more we're doing this on a piece

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
what's more we're doing this on a piece
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830
what's more we're doing this on a piece
of paper we're doing it in technically

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
of paper we're doing it in technically
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720
of paper we're doing it in technically
we're doing it in the affine plane we're

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
we're doing it in the affine plane we're
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310
we're doing it in the affine plane we're
not doing it on the projective plane if

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
not doing it on the projective plane if
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.740
not doing it on the projective plane if
we were doing projective geometry we

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
we were doing projective geometry we
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990
we were doing projective geometry we
could take a circle and move the center

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
could take a circle and move the center
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119
could take a circle and move the center
out to infinity and it would become a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
out to infinity and it would become a
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.099
out to infinity and it would become a
straight line that's not allowed

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
straight line that's not allowed
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.439
straight line that's not allowed
all you can do is move the circles

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
all you can do is move the circles
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750
all you can do is move the circles
around the radii don't matter you can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
around the radii don't matter you can
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670
around the radii don't matter you can
make in big circles little circles I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
make in big circles little circles I
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.609
make in big circles little circles I
mean obviously this is the same as that

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
mean obviously this is the same as that
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.640
mean obviously this is the same as that
or this you can move them around as long

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
or this you can move them around as long
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.800
or this you can move them around as long
as they don't cross in mirror images

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
as they don't cross in mirror images
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.780
as they don't cross in mirror images
count the same they're the same as the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
count the same they're the same as the
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910
count the same they're the same as the
original picture we know what the answer

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
original picture we know what the answer
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.100
original picture we know what the answer
is for two circles there are three what

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
is for two circles there are three what
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.850
is for two circles there are three what
about three circles the answer is 14 and

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860
about three circles the answer is 14 and
 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.969
about three circles the answer is 14 and
here they are so first of all obviously

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979
here they are so first of all obviously
 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.130
here they are so first of all obviously
we could do three in a row three circles

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
we could do three in a row three circles
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.130
we could do three in a row three circles
separate from each other or we could do

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
separate from each other or we could do
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.760
separate from each other or we could do
three that are linked or we could do a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
three that are linked or we could do a
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160
three that are linked or we could do a
nested pair and a separate one in fact

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
nested pair and a separate one in fact
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.660
nested pair and a separate one in fact
we could take any of the three that we

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
we could take any of the three that we
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.870
we could take any of the three that we
had for two circles and wrap a circle

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
had for two circles and wrap a circle
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960
had for two circles and wrap a circle
around them so we could do that one and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
around them so we could do that one and
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.660
around them so we could do that one and
put a circle around it so we'd get that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
put a circle around it so we'd get that
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580
put a circle around it so we'd get that
or I could take this one and put a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
or I could take this one and put a
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010
or I could take this one and put a
circle around it and we'd get that or I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
circle around it and we'd get that or I
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109
circle around it and we'd get that or I
could take this one and put a circle

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
could take this one and put a circle
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.080
could take this one and put a circle
around it and we'd get that and then we

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
around it and we'd get that and then we
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.710
around it and we'd get that and then we
could put

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720
could put
 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.859
could put
circle next to so now we have 7 1 2 3 4

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869
circle next to so now we have 7 1 2 3 4
 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.719
circle next to so now we have 7 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 we're halfway there

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729
5 6 7 we're halfway there
 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.510
5 6 7 we're halfway there
this one here can be modified a bit a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
this one here can be modified a bit a
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.880
this one here can be modified a bit a
Meads be meet see see could mean a and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890
Meads be meet see see could mean a and
 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.500
Meads be meet see see could mean a and
we would get something that looks like

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510
we would get something that looks like
 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.250
we would get something that looks like
this and we get a Venn diagram a B and C

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260
this and we get a Venn diagram a B and C
 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.930
this and we get a Venn diagram a B and C
and they intersect in all possible ways

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
and they intersect in all possible ways
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.270
and they intersect in all possible ways
but there's another way that could

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280
but there's another way that could
 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.370
but there's another way that could
happen we could have don't forget that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380
happen we could have don't forget that
 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.810
happen we could have don't forget that
doesn't matter how big or small the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820
doesn't matter how big or small the
 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.140
doesn't matter how big or small the
circles are I've drawn it maybe I should

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150
circles are I've drawn it maybe I should
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.730
circles are I've drawn it maybe I should
have made the overlap bigger this is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
have made the overlap bigger this is
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.680
have made the overlap bigger this is
almost the same as the Venn diagram

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690
almost the same as the Venn diagram
 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.880
almost the same as the Venn diagram
except there's no point where all three

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890
except there's no point where all three
 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.580
except there's no point where all three
meet so we're up to nine and we need

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590
meet so we're up to nine and we need
 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.070
meet so we're up to nine and we need
five more and I'll take another bit of

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080
five more and I'll take another bit of
 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.680
five more and I'll take another bit of
paper I'll start off by drawing two that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
paper I'll start off by drawing two that
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.170
paper I'll start off by drawing two that
overlap and then I could put a third one

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180
overlap and then I could put a third one
 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.320
overlap and then I could put a third one
there in inside one but not inside the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330
there in inside one but not inside the
 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.740
there in inside one but not inside the
other

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750
other
 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.860
other
I could put a third one there so it

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870
I could put a third one there so it
 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.670
I could put a third one there so it
crosses the line where this is inside

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680
crosses the line where this is inside
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.430
crosses the line where this is inside
that or I could put it inside the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
that or I could put it inside the
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.340
that or I could put it inside the
overlap or I could put it so the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350
overlap or I could put it so the
 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.130
overlap or I could put it so the
intersection looks like that and then

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140
intersection looks like that and then
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.199
intersection looks like that and then
there's one more its subtly different

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209
there's one more its subtly different
 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.530
there's one more its subtly different
from that one looks like that and you

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
from that one looks like that and you
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.240
from that one looks like that and you
can see here we had these two

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250
can see here we had these two
 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.330
can see here we had these two
overlapping this one the third circle

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
overlapping this one the third circle
 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.570
overlapping this one the third circle
was inside the points where they met

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580
was inside the points where they met
 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.910
was inside the points where they met
here it enclosed them so these two is

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920
here it enclosed them so these two is
 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.100
here it enclosed them so these two is
strictly different of course you might

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110
strictly different of course you might
 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.320
strictly different of course you might
think that I'm now gonna go and put the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330
think that I'm now gonna go and put the
 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.449
think that I'm now gonna go and put the
circle here for example but that's the

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459
circle here for example but that's the
 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.820
circle here for example but that's the
same as this so there are just five more

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830
same as this so there are just five more
 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.220
same as this so there are just five more
and the total is 14 that's pretty easy

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230
