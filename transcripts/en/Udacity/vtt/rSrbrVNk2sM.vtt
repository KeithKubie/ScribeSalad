00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.300
But the idea that I want
a test to kind of get through.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.870
And this was actually an idea proposed
by Levin et al in their paper.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.189
Which is also referenced at
the end of this lecture and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.970
will be available for you to look.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.970
Is how can you actually
create a coded aperture.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.040
So this is my conventional aperture,
right?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.219
Just the opening.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.300
I know the size and all the the amount
of light that it goes through.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.100
Can we actually create a mask?

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.070
Referred to as a code here and
the aperture plane that makes

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.020
the defocus planes different when
they actually register on the sensor.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.380
And if they're different they
might be easier to discriminate.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.880
So basically, that suggests us, we
want to actually add a coded aperture,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.580
it basically, let's in less light,
but in a known pattern like this.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.100
What's the artifact of this?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.040
Let's look at exactly,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.210
the example we looked at before
of our lens and defocus.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.160
Remember, we had looked at this before.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.140
We basically, had an object moved up.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
And, of course, it created these
patterns from a single light source.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.450
So here, of course, we have an image
of a defocused point light source.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.660
Of course, when we replace it,
this will look different.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.740
Right?
because now less light will come in.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.060
Of course, that basically says,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.910
how do we kind of build this as we
now create obstructions on the lens.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.690
Like I'm just going to show
you one simple example here.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.210
Basically, how I'm going to
represent these things are simple

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.700
obstructions shown here.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.690
So basically, this line here is eh,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.390
maybe considered to be
one of these things.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.930
And I'm going to basically say, if I put
an obstruction like this on the lens,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.070
basically means is now this part of
the light is not making it to my sensor.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.700
And, of course, that translates into a
spread function that would be different.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.200
Similarly, I would actually put
another one just to kind of see what

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.890
the effect is.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.900
And again, that also goes in there.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.940
And translation is that, of course,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.250
now I have a point spread function
that also has a different look.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.540
You know, maybe like this.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.220
This was the output based on this.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.510
Again, notice this is what
we're trying to do here.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.320
The same object far away putting simple
to obstructions, we get a newer image or

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.780
a newer output.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.980
But we can now start calibrating this.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.700
Recall again,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.920
we did this kind of same trick when we
were talking about light field cameras.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.669
Again, simple example,
further, same obstructions.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.920
I moved the object closer.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.170
Spread function is different.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.460
Of course, now I can start
calibrating for these types of things

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.280
as I move closer and closer you
can basically see the end of it.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.920
Doesn't matter what it is.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.810
If I actually move
the light source here,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.090
the spread function will come
back to what I expected for

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.340
a regular aperture, because this,
everything is in focus.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.960
Of course, the final one,
when the object is on the focal plane.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.550
Of course, the image is created here.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.940
Our spread function is there.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.935
And while there might be a small
impact of the obstructions here for

00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:45.800
full-focus thing,
you'll actually get a spread you know,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.590
the image to be much smaller,
and a point spread function, but

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.250
also be like the one we'd expected in
case where there was no obstructions.
