00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.250
Now that we have our bedroom
properties., I want to talk about

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.300
a couple more property attribute
you'll see here alongside nonatomic.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.920
The attributes strong and weak.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.020
We could have written our bedroom
properties like this, but

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.440
we didn't actually bother writing strong
because pointers are strong by default.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.400
Although there are some development
teams who always write strong

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.190
just to be extra explicit.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.830
So when should a reference to a property
be strong, and when should it be weak?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.130
Strong references are used for

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.810
properties that are the primary
responsibility of the class.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.380
In other words, owned by the class.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.470
These bedrooms are owned
by the house class.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.160
Weak references are used for

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.980
properties that are the primary
responsibility of some other class.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.510
There are two times when you should
use weak references for properties.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.380
When the property is a delegate and

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.520
when the property is
a subview of the main view.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.780
Take note, this is important
to avoid memory cycles.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.510
For more information on
what causes memory cycles,
