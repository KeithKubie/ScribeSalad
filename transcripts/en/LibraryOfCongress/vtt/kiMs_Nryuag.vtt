00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.720
&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is Steven
Winnick, I'm a folklorist here

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.080 position:56%
at the American Folklife Center at
the Library of Congress and I'm here

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.530
with Carmen Agra Deedy
and Karla Campillo-Soto

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.730
but I will let them say
their own names actually just

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.770
so we get the proper
pronunciation so.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.990
&gt;&gt; Carmen Agra Deedy.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.590
&gt;&gt; Karla Campillo-Soto.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.660
&gt;&gt; And both of these wonderful
women are storytellers

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.600
and gave us a presentation of
their stories earlier today

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.080
and we're going to
talk a little bit now

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.210
about storytelling
and their careers.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.770
So, and they have different
backgrounds,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.790
both obviously are Spanish-speaking
but Carmen is of Cuban background

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.620
and Karla is of Mexican background.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.560
So we're going to start
by asking for a little bit

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.970
of Carmen's background
and to ask the question,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.220
do you have any memories
of Cuba at all

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.790
and when did you come
to this country?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.090
How old were you?

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was three.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.010
I do have some very visceral
memories meaning the brine

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.070
in the air because we lived in
Havana so my window faced the sea

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.550
so it would you know the sea
breeze would come in at night.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.290 position:56%
And I tell a story about that memory

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.740
in particular called [foreign
language spoken] "The Peanut Man"

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.110
and he was the fellow who is
very iconic in Cuban stories

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.460
and he tells everyone as he
goes through the city he sings

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.190 position:56%
because he doesn't tell, he actually
sings [foreign language spoken].

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.340
And there are folkloric
songs about him

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.430
and that particular story I guess

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.590
for me is the strongest
memory I have of Cuba

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.030
because I suppose it's
so ethereal in a way.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.240
I mean his voice was like this
red, velvet ribbon that wound

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.100
through the city at night and then
you would hear the [clicking sound

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.960
with voice] and he and the mule
would come through and I would look

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.180
down from my window and those were
my memories, that and some memories

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.880
of my grandmother that
are very faint.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.810
&gt;&gt; And then so you came
to the United States?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.460
&gt;&gt; I came to the U.S.
when I was three.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.730 position:56%
We went via Mexico and we were there
for, we left in December of '63

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.330
and if you will remember
there was a little tension

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.280
in the world at that time.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.170 position:56%
We then came to the U.S. in February
of '64 and did not stay in Miami.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.250
We ended up in a little southern
town in Georgia, Decatur.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what was it like growing
up in Decatur as a Cuban person?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.710
&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness, well,
yeah those stories,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.020
I've been telling those for,
it took a while to tell those.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.010
They actually became a, they
became a sort of compendium

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.120
of stories called "Growing Up
Cuban in Decatur, Georgia".

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.500
Yeah, it was.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.150
Everything is new.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.080
When you're a refugee or an
immigrant because those are defined

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.730
by the reasons you
left, everything is new.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.030
I mean everything is different.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.330
Everything is strange.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.720
And those first years to me
were more about acclimation.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.020
It was cold.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.320
You know how it was, it was cold.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.130
I was a child who had
grown up in the Caribbean

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.290
and now there was something called
[foreign language spoken] winter,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.640
and so gone were sandals
year-round of course

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.410
and the peanut man didn't sing
because my father had taped

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.870
up the windows with duct
tape to keep out the cold.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.310 position:56%
Now it was actually, it was many
years before I realized there was no

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.610
peanut man.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.910
I thought it was because
we had to keep plastic

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.160
on our windows in the
winter you know.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.460
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.760
&gt;&gt; It was.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.470
It was a journey that
feels unfinished.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah and you said in your stories
that you did experience some sort

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.820
of casual racism or
xenophobia as a child.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.270
&gt;&gt; Well I mean casual
and sometimes overt but

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.540
and it's not that I play it down.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.420
I mean I tell stories that
occasionally, that includes some

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.940
of those sort of dissonant moments.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.280
But, I found so many good
people and when it was time

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.970
to tell the stories
publically I used to tell them

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.220
on "All Things Considered" on NPR.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.800
It was a conscious choice to
tell the heroic stories rather

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.480
than to immortalize the villains.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.370
Who do you wish to remember?

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.130
And you know in ancient
Egypt when they wanted

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.980
to forget a pharaoh they'd just
scrub their names right off the

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.280
stelae [phonetic].

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.960
So although I tell some of
those stories they were,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.170
they were the lessor in
frequency but they were also,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.580
and they were painful to tell.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.260
But then there are those people,
the ones who go beyond their birth

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.590
and their own prejudice
and do not think

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.580
that we did not have
our own prejudice.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.880
We did, you know.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.170 position:56%
The first time I brought an
American boy home my mother was just

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.800
horrified because it
might stick [laughter].

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.430
I like real stories as I
notice Karla [inaudible].

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's something that
we talked about a little bit too,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.860
the sort of different kinds
of stories that you might tell

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.850
as a storyteller and that
your tendency is to focus

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.470
on home stories, family stories.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.560
How did that develop?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It's so cultural for us, you
know the, everything begins at home.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.400
And the most tragic story
you could ever read, write,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.390
sing about would be about
the child that has no home.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.000
And a child that has no home in our
culture, the village takes him in.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.650
I mean you should.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.240
And so it seems like for
us all stories lead home

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.820
but if you're a refugee that loss
of home means you know, at 55,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.940
self-knowledge is excruciating.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.440
Inevitably my stories
lead back to home.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And now Karla, your background is
somewhat different because you grew

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.720
up in Mexico and then
came here as an adult?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was actually an adult and
I was recruited by a school district

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.820
to come and teach in
the United States so.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.420
But what she's talking about does
not change regardless of the age.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.330
It's still a little bit scary

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.950
because you don't know what
you're facing and at least

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.490
where you grew up it's different.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.900
It's just, it's you.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.830
It embraces you.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.870
And she was talking about
like don't fool yourself,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.500
there's still a little
bit of racism.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.220
When you leave to go to
another country your friends,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.200 position:56%
your family in Mexico they make sure

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.910
that you remember every single
time when you go back there.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.050
They joke and they don't
really mean it but it's there.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.630
And you never feel more Mexican
or more Cuban than when you're not

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.900
in Mexico, it's just the way it is.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.200
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.500
&gt;&gt; It's in you, yeah.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The straddling of two, you know
I see it in the children a lot when,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.940
we both work with children.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; They are the interpreters whether
they're among refugee children

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.850
or they are Mexican-American
children

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.910
or they're Nicaraguan, Cuban.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.210
It doesn't matter.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.510
It doesn't matter if.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.990
They're the ones who have
to interpret the world

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.020
for their family and conversely.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.680
&gt;&gt; The family to the world, yeah.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.980
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.280
&gt;&gt; It's not only the, don't
you find this amazing?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.310
It's not only the language
that they're translating.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.610
&gt;&gt; The language is the least.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.910
&gt;&gt; But they're translating also.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.210
&gt;&gt; The culture.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.540
&gt;&gt; Their understanding of this
world and how it translates

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.740
into our world, they
just [multiple speakers].

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.920
&gt;&gt; And both sides are
suspicious of the other.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.380
And there you are on
that strange [inaudible].

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.400
I've been working on this
story, I haven't told you about,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.870
but in it I talk about
meeting this boy on moving day.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.260
And we moved frequently
because of, I mean it was money.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.560
We'd stay in a place that.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.490
The next year the rent would go up,
we'd move again two blocks down.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.140
But we moved into brand new
apartments and usually we moved

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.090
into very depressing places you
know and this place was like new

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.840
and the paint was new and
there was fresh carpeting

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.260
and my mother was just
out of her skin.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.560
And she was singing.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.860
Who knew the woman could sing?

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.610
And on that day I meet a
boy and as I'm running out,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.360
tearing down the hallway,
the exterior hallway.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.940
These were not fancy
apartments but they were new.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.610
And as we'd run into one
another is this, clearly this,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.350
you know southern boy with this, I
could see these extraordinary eyes

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.860
that looked like, what's that
stuff you use in the winter,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.670
like antifreeze, you
know that pale blue.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.660
I mean look how dark
our eyes are right?

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.430
And the first thing
he asked me is where,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.940
if I'm the new, are
you the new people?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.240
Are you all Number 8?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.430
The apartment Number 8,
are you all Number 8?

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.660
And I say yes and the next thing
I say without even thinking

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.620
that this might be weird,
I say do you want to come

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.770
and watch my mother
burn the bathtub?

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.070
And of course he's a
southern kid, the first thing,

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.150
his [inaudible] response is,
oh you bet I would baby girl,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.690
you bet I would because he doesn't
have an idea what this means.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.210
But see children tend to
cross the cultural boundaries.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.810
&gt;&gt; Because when you say
something that crazy,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.110
by the way my mother
was a germaphobe.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.830
Her grandmother and sister
died of typhoid in the 30s

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.600
so she would burn the
ceramic bathtub with alcohol

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.430
and a lit match would last
30 seconds and by the way

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.500
that bathtub, fiberglass.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.800
&gt;&gt; Oh, oh.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.300
&gt;&gt; Great story, but in any event
it's that translating and the fact

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.040
that the younger children
when you're growing up,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.940 position:56%
some could be cruel but a lot of
them are outwardly open and curious.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.940
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.240
&gt;&gt; That's easier.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.520
&gt;&gt; So let's talk about when
you each sort of realized

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.140
that you had a gift
for storytelling.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.600
How did that come about?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.900
&gt;&gt; I never did [laughter].

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.200
&gt;&gt; Oh get out.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.500
&gt;&gt; I never did.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.800
I had to be told.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.100
&gt;&gt; And who was it that
told you first?

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.400
Was it?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.000
&gt;&gt; No, you had to have known.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.300
I'm sure your family
has told you things,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.600
you just didn't want to hear it.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.900
&gt;&gt; Well, they told me
I would never shut up

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.200
but that's [laughter] different.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.500
&gt;&gt; Well, see there you go.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.100
&gt;&gt; Well my.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.400
But that's because, in
most families this is not.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.830
This is not endemic to
the Latin experience.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.270
Most families, even families
who tend to be quieter,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.990
families [inaudible] don't have
as much narrative in daily life.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.290
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.030
&gt;&gt; Have occasionally one generation

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.840
or another a family
storyteller crops up.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.830
It's a person that keeps track

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.740
of the different stories
and tells them best.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.080
And during family reunions
you know it's the person

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.380
who everyone says, oh
no, no, no tell them.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.680
Tell them, no, no not you.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.980
Let him tell or let her tell.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.280
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.580
&gt;&gt; Whether Karla knew
or not when we met

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.820
in five seconds I knew this woman
was just so, such a natural.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.660
It just came out of every pore.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.600
I mean she could take the
most quotidian experience

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.140
and it would become fabulous, it
was no longer an everyday, dull,

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.220
boring you know trip
to the grocery store.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.720
&gt;&gt; And to be honest with you I'm
not the storyteller at my house.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.000
The storyteller at my house is
my mother and all I do is just,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.220
I am her, but she does
it so much better.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.640
&gt;&gt; Well, but see she's in training.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.940
My mother is gone.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.240
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.540
&gt;&gt; In her family.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.170
&gt;&gt; Right, sure and how about you?

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.620
I mean you must have realized
at some point you were?

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.340
&gt;&gt; When I first told my parents

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.320
because I was writing
children's books first

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.000
and then I started telling
stories to the children,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.300
folktales because they were easy.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.090
They were already pre-digested.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.890
You just had to figure out how
to tell them but the beginning,

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.190
middle, and end was all there.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.210
And then I started telling
a few family stories,

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.940
very cautiously putting
my toe into that sort

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.610
of pond of personal narrative.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.100
And my sister had the genius idea
of, you know to invite my parents

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.140
and my father laughed
through the whole story

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.440
at that particular event.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.850
It was the Atlanta History
Center as a matter of fact.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.600
My mother, nothing,
nothing and I walked

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.000
up to her after and I said, okay?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.300
They were [inaudible]?

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.600
They were [inaudible]?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.900
You know, what did you think?

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.200
Did you like it, do you like?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.500
It was not bad.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.160
I don't recognize any of the
people in your stories but she was

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.500
of course the main character in
the story, the main character.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.230
I would say for me the
stories started very painfully

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:14.240
because I was a listener most
of my life, not a storyteller

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.240
and I did not realize for many
years that had been the beginning.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.890
That had been the true gift.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:26.420
I was not gifted [inaudible]
with this, with a silver tongue.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:33.410 position:56%
I was given the gift of being a
sort of skittish kid that would stay

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.130
around the edges of
conversations and listen and grew

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:45.040
to so love the oral word, the
unspooling of that thread of story.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.340
I couldn't get away.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.670
I couldn't walk away if
it was in the middle.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.530
I'd rather take a beating than
have to have been interrupted.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:55.400
And when I first started
telling them I was, oh God.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.790
I remember many humiliations so bad
but my father told me when I was

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.810
about to give up, he said
why do you want to do this?

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.870
And I said oh my God,
because I love it.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.100
I could sit in a bus
station next to some old guy

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.270
and just ask him questions
and listen all day, pop.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.110
And he said why do you
want to tell stories

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.350
and I said because I love stories.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.660
I actually love telling
them but I'm not, I'm bad.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.960
I mean I don't.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.940
I get things mixed up,
their sequence and I.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.240
And he's [inaudible] I understand.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.950
I understand.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.800
And he's got the answer because
he's like Yoda and he said,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.430
you were born with a
great love for a thing

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.650
and you believed you were also
going to be born with skill.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:43.270
I thought damn and this today
is called craft and years later,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.760
fast forward like five
years ago I was reading

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.450
because [inaudible] mentioned
this somewhere "The Parliament

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.670
of Fowls" Chaucer's, oh it was a
few people or familiarize or under,

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.970
you know connect with him.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.970 position:56%
They think of the "Canterbury Tales"
and he says this beautiful line

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:04.550
and it says this for you, "The
life so short, the craft so long

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.520 position:56%
to learn" and I kept that with me
when, even now when I get frustrated

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.000
because every new story
is like starting over.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.300
&gt;&gt; Now you.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.260
&gt;&gt; I will tell you this and
I apologize for interrupting.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.000
The very first time I did a story.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.510
&gt;&gt; That was a very American, you
just apologized for interrupting.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.210
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I've
been trained well.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.880
It was hard for me,
it was hard but I did.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.800
See in my family, it's
just a competition.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.100
&gt;&gt; All of us yes.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.490
&gt;&gt; Whoever snatches the word first
but when I did my first, very,

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:42.500
very first storytelling it
was the worst thing ever.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.800
I just, I was.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.520
I wanted to quit.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.570
So of course I picked up the
phone and I called her and said,

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.500
ah, this is was horrible.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.930
And say what, she said,
well what did you expect?

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.220
You want to do it because
you like it.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.940
Did you think this
was going to be easy?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.170
And that stopped the
thing, so I kept doing it.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.600
&gt;&gt; So the wisdom went from your
father and through you and?

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.650
&gt;&gt; I love that man, [multiple
speakers] don't you love him?

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.950
I love him.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.610
&gt;&gt; But with school children
[inaudible] with them writing.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.910
It's the same thing.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.210
I thought this is a craft.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.510
Do you know what that means?

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.490
That means you go back to the forge
and the anvil and the hammer again

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.760
and again and again and you
hate what you have hammered out.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.910
And you go to bed and you're
so angry with yourself

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.290
and you hate the fire and you're
sick of the metal that cuts you

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.710
and the fire that burns you
and then one day you go back

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.320
and something happens.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.130
And you went ah, beautiful
and now you want to figure

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.630
out how you did it
so you can do again.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.930
&gt;&gt; [Multiple speakers]
I know you know.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.230 position:56%
I know you know [multiple speakers].

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.530
&gt;&gt; That is the hardest part.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.440
&gt;&gt; And to you young people who
are listening hopefully, I hope.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.850
We know that it is,
it is a discipline.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.940
Not, you know, it's
not a friendly word

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.250
to many now but it is a discipline.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.440
The discipline means that you
love it more than anything else.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah and so you mentioned that
your other discipline that kind

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.630
of preceded storytelling
was children's writing,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.030
was writing books for children.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.010
How did you get started doing that?

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.310
&gt;&gt; You know I was very fortunate.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.420
I went into a marvelous
little publishing house still

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.720
in Atlanta, wonderful.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.220
I say 'little' in that
at the time it was small,

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.770
it's a fantastic house,
Peachtree Publishers.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.760
And I told a story to
the editor over the phone

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.090
that would never work today.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.310
And she said send it in
and then I was mortified

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.040
because I didn't have
a written version.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.080 position:56%
And I struggled and struggled and
struggled because I am also dyslexic

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.240
and eventually got
it down and sent it.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.450
And it was, and it truly,
sometimes you just get a leg up.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.470
That particular editor
liked that particular story.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.540
That publishing house was
just going into picture books,

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.110
I mean really they had had one
when they first opened [inaudible]

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.250
for many, many years,
20 years they did none.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.550
It was timing.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.140
It was a lot of things.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.850
Writing, I just, just
beginning to get

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.380
and the [inaudible] editor
I'm just starting to get it.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.680
It's the same thing.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.360
&gt;&gt; Well, you've done pretty
well with it [laughter].

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.770
&gt;&gt; Some days I think
and sometimes ah.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.710
&gt;&gt; So and so I mean
the thing that kind

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.850
of brought you together
is this work for children,

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:14.860
that you as a children's
author and you as an educator.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.830
So how did you start that career?

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:18.380
&gt;&gt; I am not in the
classroom anymore,

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.950
I'm actually training teachers to
you know become better teachers.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.250
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.370
&gt;&gt; But it's funny because I,
at the beginning I didn't know

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.040
who Carmen Agra Deedy was.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.700
&gt;&gt; You and most of the world but
my mother [multiple speakers].

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My superintendent said oh my God,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.650
now that we have this grant I
will bring my favorite author

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.140
to [inaudible] who is this woman.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.710
She's a Cuban writer.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.010
You should know who she is.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.310
I said well.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.900
&gt;&gt; She is Mexican.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.460
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.760
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.880
&gt;&gt; So my superintendent put me
under assignment to make sure

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.180
that Carmen had everything she
needed during her visit so I sat

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.310
down and I brought work with
me because my plan was to sit

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:03.830
in the back of the audience and
just work while she was talking.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.270 position:56%
And I never, my work never got done.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.750
It just, it stayed there.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.830
I actually left with
her and it stayed there

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.500
because I was mesmerized
by Carmen's stories.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.800
I fell in love.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.200
I fell in love.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.650
&gt;&gt; Wow, so which books were
you presenting at that event?

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.950
Do you remember?

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.400
&gt;&gt; Well, I come as an author

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.850
but it's a shadowy business
the world of children's books.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.870
Granted literally the granting
comes often as you come

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.830
as a children's author and I
talk to children about writing

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.520
and I show a couple of my books.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.010
Who knows which one it
was at the time but I.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.300
&gt;&gt; Then, we, I still remember.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.180
You told the story of how
you fell in love with a book.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.610
&gt;&gt; Oh no, that was the story.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.910
&gt;&gt; That was the story.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.810
&gt;&gt; What I do then is I have about
45 minutes, is I talk about writing

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.350
for about five and then
I say but I'm not going

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.910
to read you a story today which
of course most of the time,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.140
still you hear ah or hee,
hee, hee or you hear I hate

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.610
that from some kid in the back.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.130
And I said I'm going
to tell you a story.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.790
And so I use the time
to tell stories.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.280
Our children are not
getting stories this way.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.580
They are not.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.990
This is not how they're
consuming stories.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.290
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.060
&gt;&gt; Karla knows this, not, well it's
been a couple of years ago yeah

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.480
that I finished a story,
it was this one.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.450
The kid, yes you do.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.850
Fourth graders, I was
telling them a scary story.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.150
&gt;&gt; Oh yes.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.740
&gt;&gt; At the end of the story,
because they love scary stories,

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.220
appropriate, age appropriate scary
stories, it was really quiet.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.060
The kid in the front row
goes, tell another one.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.490
Tell another one.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.240
And I realized this is how
they traffic in stories,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.650
it's coming from their devices.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.840
&gt;&gt; But they need carbon-based
life-force

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.430
so mostly that's what I do.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.100
&gt;&gt; But I also think that it
has to do with the fact that,

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.850
at least the children I work with,

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.330
my children from poverty
whose parents have two jobs

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.970
and in our culture when you're a
little child you get to hear all

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.780
of those stories when
they're cleaning the beans

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.760
and when they're sitting
and drinking coffee,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.080
there's no time to do that anymore.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.570
And if you add that to the fact

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.810
that these parents are coming home
exhausted and all they want is just

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.410
to sit down and have a
moment to themselves.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.330
Unfortunately that moment to
themselves skip the moments

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.120
for the children so those
children only get to hear,

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.810
you know, did you eat dinner?

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.110
Did you brush your teeth?

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.230 position:56%
Did you do your homework, go to bed?

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.800
And I think that's such a pity.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.260
[Multiple speakers] you can't
blame them, it's survival but.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.180
&gt;&gt; But then, you know then
[inaudible] it was just

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.890
under what I'm hoping Karla
will continue because she is,

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.300
cover your ears and go la, la, la.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.340
She really is just fabulous.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.600
She's fabulous and
she's so authentic

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.620
and I've been doing this enough
years that you know in five seconds

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.900
if someone has an authentic voice.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.440
And I was just, I was just.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.100
I loved her from the
first and I knew

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.280
that not only whether she wanted
to go into revivalist storytelling,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.140
if she wanted to just tell the
children, the children not just

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.500
in the Latin culture, in all our
children, need to hear our stories.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.400
And people at home, anyone
who is watching this,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.150
stories are like human
connective tissue, in the absence

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.660
of that we're going to
become more and more

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.940
like our machines and
less and less human.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:24.850
And it is that very human part of
us that creates empathy, humanity,

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.630
compassion, things that are
so necessary in order to have

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.420
and create any kind of a peaceful
village, world, office, family.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.660
And it sounds so grand but
it's, it really is true

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.540
that we need each other's stories.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.760
&gt;&gt; I think at the moment that we
stop telling stories is the moment

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.380
that we stop realizing that
we're just like each other.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.280
&gt;&gt; She has a different
name, a different accent

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.580
but we all have that aunt.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.880
We all have that cousin.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.430
We all have that crazy
[multiple speakers].

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.130
&gt;&gt; And that actually
gets me to something

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.850 position:56%
that I thought was very
interesting in hearing your stories.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.260
I mean the stories that you
told Karla were very Mexican

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.680
and rooted in the desert.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.120
&gt;&gt; And rooted in the landscape
and yet you were able to identify

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.290
where those things were that
everyone in the room was going

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.090
to relate to and say well because
you know nobody's family is

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.530
like this or my, you
had that covered.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.840
&gt;&gt; Because it's exactly the same.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so but at first
was that, was that difficult

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.770
or did you know sort

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.120
of instinctively what
would be universal?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.690
&gt;&gt; I think.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.380 position:56%
I think that when you're in this
world long enough it just takes you,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.780
it takes you some time but then
you start realizing that the color

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.100
of the eyes may be different
and the hair looks different

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.570
but inside we all have
a little bit of that.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.360
Does that make sense?

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.990
We all have a little bit of
the crazy and the compassion

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.770
and the love and I think that the
moment we become too politically

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.090
correct and we stop talking
about these things is the moment

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.510 position:56%
where we start separating each other
instead of finding common ground.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.810
So that's just [multiple speakers].

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.110
&gt;&gt; These things meaning.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.610
&gt;&gt; The things that culturally
identifies because when we came in,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:08.420
anyone listening to this particular
podcast will not know what precedes

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.240
it, that we were joking about that
we wouldn't need mics because we're

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.870
so loud and it was a
cultural asset and liability.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.780
And somebody is going
to take offense,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.030
I'm saying that because how
could you take a sweeping brush?

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:28.840
Because, there are things that
culturally tend to occur not

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.460
in every person in the culture.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.440
I have three daughters.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.110
My youngest daughter, every so
often will grab me by the throat

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.610
in a corner and just, how
am I part of this family?

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:46.780 position:56%
She is the quiet one and she doesn't
know how she fits but she fits

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.200
because we're still her people.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.390
And when we talk about,
anything about our families,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.800
how we love food, does every
Latin person love food?

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.050
No. Does every Scottish person have
this particular trait or the other?

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.350
I think we become very nervous

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.260
about including those
sort of sidebars that.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.800
We're sort of realizing
they are universal

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:11.360
because the Scottish hearth and the
Mexican [foreign language spoken]

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.860
and the and so forth, right?

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.460
&gt;&gt; They're actually,
they're the same place.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.790
They're the same place because you
were putting your finger on it.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.090
They're the moments that happen

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.250
between people that
we find universal.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.430
It's you know, the cheap aunt.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:31.810
I mean we all know her
or him or cousin but.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.110
&gt;&gt; They all have different names

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.400
but it's exactly the same
person regardless, yeah.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.010
&gt;&gt; And then I guess
the other question is

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.070
that you know it is interesting, at
first we did a little introduction

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:47.130
where we spoke about the fact
that Latin cultures are similar

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.330
in many ways but then they're
also, each culture is unique

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.130 position:56%
and the landscape will be different.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.430
&gt;&gt; The food.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.730
&gt;&gt; The interaction with.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.030
&gt;&gt; The customs.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.420
&gt;&gt; Indigenous cultures and other
immigrant groups whether there's.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.040
There were a lot of
Africans or not in that area.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.260
So, how does that affect
your doing programs together,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:12.200
the fact that there's a Mexican
side of it and a Cuban side?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.120
&gt;&gt; I think that has to do with the
fact that we both are very aware

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.560
of the human side and that
takes over completely.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.970
I mean before we came
here we barely made it

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.660
because we were too busy
laughing and comparing notes

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.770
and how do you say this in
your, you know, in Cuba?

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.210
And this is how you say it in
Mexico, but it's the same thing.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:37.030
Like my mother would not allow me
to go out after I took a shower

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.290
because I might catch, Carmen
what's it called again?

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.590
&gt;&gt; [Foreign language spoken]

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.190
&gt;&gt; [Foreign language spoken]

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.790
&gt;&gt; You might get it in the air.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.090
How do you [multiple speakers].

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.390
How do you get the air?

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.690
&gt;&gt; The vapors.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.990
&gt;&gt; [Foreign language spoken] is oh,

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.290
you have the same thing
[multiple speakers] so if you went

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.590
out [foreign language spoken]
that means what I'm going to do

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.890
and God only knew what
affliction could befall you.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.190
[Foreign language spoken] you know
my cousin Pepe he went [foreign

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.490
language spoken].

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.410
&gt;&gt; Pneumonia right.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.710
&gt;&gt; Pneumonia.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:12.620
&gt;&gt; Ma, you can't get
pneumonia in 24 hours.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.570
You are doubting your mother?

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.460
&gt;&gt; Are you calling me a liar?

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.950
&gt;&gt; Are you calling me a liar?

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:25.270
And of course you back down.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.230
You're like this is crazy talk.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.710
This is, if it was anybody?

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.430
Do other cultures do this?

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.420
Of course they do.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.720
I have a friend, very [inaudible].

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.240
Her grandmother, Russian, oh Irena
[phonetic] do not sit on marble.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.540
It freeze ovaries.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.930
&gt;&gt; We have the same thing but
I won't say it [laughter].

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.870
&gt;&gt; You won't say it,
okay [laughter].

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.010
&gt;&gt; My mom might listen
to this sometime.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.990
&gt;&gt; No, you can't bathe in the,
you can't take go into the water

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.290
if you've [multiple speakers].

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:59.570
If you've eaten you have to
wait two hours until you can get

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.030
into the water because,
yeah you could get a cramp.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.330
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:10.450
&gt;&gt; There are other
cultures that have that.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.500
My mother, a step further,
you can't take a shower.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.800
Ma [multiple speakers]
wait, no, no, no.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.970 position:56%
No, a bath maybe you could drown but
a shower, what's going to happen?

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:23.010
I mean seriously, you would just be
exceedingly clean as you lay there

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.270
with a cramp on, in your bathtub.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.360
I tried to explain this to my
mother for years and [inaudible].

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't know everything
my daughter who reads okay.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.250
There is knowledge that is older.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.550
&gt;&gt; This is.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.460
This is perverted knowledge.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.760
Okay this is not correct.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, would you not wait like until
you were starving and purple on lips

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.850
in the ocean because otherwise
you knew that the moment you came

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.620
out that was the end of the trip.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.450
&gt;&gt; They fed you and if they
fed you, two more hours.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.050
&gt;&gt; No fun at the beach.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And that was the end of the trip.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.200
&gt;&gt; That was more than
he wanted to know.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.440
Look at this poor man suffering.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.740
&gt;&gt; It's great though.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.710
Well, but I mean this is also,

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.780 position:56%
I mean you know we are the
American Folklife Center and we talk

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.670
about folklore and collect that
and these are all the variations

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.860
in the same cultural story you know

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.090
so it's exactly what
we study so it's great.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.340
&gt;&gt; And what you asked about, the
different, different cultures,

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.410
how do we feel on the stage?

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:37.380
I think it's really wonderful
because there are subtleties that,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.320
you know it's a cultural
elephant in the living room right?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.680
What we'll do, well how do
Cubans and Mexicans get along?

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.310
Because we have an image of who
Cubans are, I love these people.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:54.110
They have hearts as big as all
Havana and they are hard-working

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.740
and they are kinder than
you can imagine and what

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:02.180
about the Mexican people?

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.800
I have known them to be
generous to a fault, familial,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.750
loving and then there are
caricatures of both cultures

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.470
which is different than
finding certain things that crop

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:16.590
up in cultures that we all identify
with like we all like to eat

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.890
or we know, we have the crazy aunt.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.790
When we get on the stage I think
that what happens or should happen

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.090
up there should not be
verbal, it should be de facto.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.580
Here are these two women who
are great friends from cultures

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.880
that sometimes view
each other suspiciously.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.180
Oh you, you know guys immigrated.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.480
It wasn't just oh so legally under
the J.F.K. Cuban Refugee Act.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.780
Aren't you precious?

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.080
You know and we had to crawl
through the desert you know.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.380
What do you think of
that or we had to.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.680 position:56%
And so there is a tension that often
just doesn't get discussed and maybe

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.980
at some point when we hit the
stories when we want to do that,

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.280
right now we just like to go
up there and go [laughter].

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.580
&gt;&gt; But I think it also
has to do with trust.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.880
I would follow this woman
to the end of the world.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.180
&gt;&gt; Ditto, ditto.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.480
&gt;&gt; To the end of the world
because I know that there's never,

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.780 position:56%
that would be unkind that would come

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.080
out of her mouth neither
to my culture or myself.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.380
And you have to know
that if you're going

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.680
to stand up and open yourself up.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.980
And you have to trust that
the same way she's trusting

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.280
that the audience is going
to listen, is going to listen

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.580
without judgement and
it's not really

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.880
that it's listening
without judgement.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.180
It's judgement but it's
not judgement towards you.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.480
It's judgement towards how they see
that story relating to themselves

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.780
and most of the times that's
a really positive thing.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.080
And at some point you have to
remember that you're doing it

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.380
because you love to do it.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.680
&gt;&gt; And if you get on a
stage with somebody you have

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.980
to trust the person you're with.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.280
I think you put a finger on it
because I feel equally with Karla.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.580
She knows.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.880
She's come to my home.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.180
She knows my parents.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.480
You know she knows my children and
not a lot of people know how I look

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.780
like when I wake up in the morning.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.080
She's one of the privileged
ones, yes, yes.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.380
&gt;&gt; She's looks [inaudible].

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.680
&gt;&gt; So, yeah and you know one
of the things that really comes

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.980
out in your performances or the
one that we just had is you know,

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.380
you had mentioned before
that in your family

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.340 position:56%
or around the table sometimes it's a
competition for who is going to talk

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.300
but between the two of you each
one of you is promoting the other.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.760
You're not promoting
yourself you know

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.840
and that's really very endearing
about your performances.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.310
&gt;&gt; Well, that's what
happens when you're in love.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.770
&gt;&gt; Well, there are all
kinds of love in the world.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.310
&gt;&gt; Think of it this way okay,

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:39.500
I think that to me there's no
better complement to my craft

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.120
that the fact that I'm with her.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.270
&gt;&gt; Oh ditto, I loved
being with Karla today.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.120
It was so, it was interesting.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.560
You know I'm completely
so loving doing this.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.010
It's like 25 years of, and
it feels so comfortable

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.090
because this has never happened.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.290
I'm speaking on a stage
with someone who knows

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.620
where my stories come from.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.870
It doesn't matter that she's not
from Cuba, she knows the people

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.160
and she knows the taboos.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.460
She knows there are certain things

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.760
like she said, there's
a trust manual.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.690
There are certain things
she will never say

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.090 position:56%
or I would never say even as a joke.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.480
&gt;&gt; Culturally about the other
because we know what a tender place

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.840
or a wounding place that could be.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.580
And we both like to be irreverent.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.620
We love being irreverent, it's
what makes stories really powerful

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.970
because it's that irreverence
and it's the laughter that opens

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.510
up the solar plexus
so that truth gets in.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.240
That's why some of the greats,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.400
to me the most wonderful
storytellers are the ones I truly

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.340
love note just how much humor
to use so that people relax

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.640
and then you can come

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.160
in with something that's a
little more profound maybe

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.690
but not necessarily
from you but a truth

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.250
that you learned the hard
way that you can share.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.550
Does that make sense?

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:55.160
&gt;&gt; But I think it also has
to do with the fact that,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.640
and I'm making an assumption
here, we both have.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.650
We both come from cultures
that have faced a lot of pain

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.590
and that has understood from
the longest time that it has

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:06.290
to be dealt with laughter.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.010
&gt;&gt; We had this conversation
didn't we?

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.880
&gt;&gt; That both of us have cultures

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.110
that for different reasons
have suffered a great deal,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.590
at least culturally that's how.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:22.120
It's the message that's sent down
and that the only way to deal

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:28.650
with this place you're in, you
know, a citizen, non-citizen,

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.870
a refugee with some
standing but with often scorn

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.200
because people don't understand
the history of the people that went

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.460
through this and actually how
many of them were so democratic

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.410
in their views and kind
but, and so we laugh.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:43.710
We laugh. We laugh.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:49.950 position:56%
We laugh. One of my favorite stories
I can't share today but it was

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:56.200
from a relative, someone
we knew on the outskirts

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.350
of our life had passed away,
a very unpleasant person.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:04.420
And everyone was saying all these
lovely things as you do and one

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.440
of my aunts [inaudible]
and goes, you know,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.450
there are some people
you just cannot

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.750
like until they're dead [laughter].

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.600 position:56%
[Inaudible] and I, so who's laughing

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.690
in the funeral home
right, not her, me and I'm.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:24.210
But it's that moment of
wickedness and laughter

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.070
and we call it [foreign
language spoken]

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.370
which is spark and that is based.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.670
&gt;&gt; You have to have it.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:29.970
&gt;&gt; Well, it's the comedy/tragedy
mask.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.870
&gt;&gt; It's very much based
in and sometimes

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:37.600
in a certain amount
of generational pain.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.920
&gt;&gt; And you have, you have to have
it because what's the alternative?

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.250
&gt;&gt; [Foreign language spoken] oh I'm
sorry, in Cuba we say [inaudible]

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:54.860
that we laugh until we cry
and we cry until we laugh.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.390
It's beautiful, there you go.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah I notice Karla
your stories all kind

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.990
of push the boundaries with the.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.290
&gt;&gt; I was extremely nervous.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.600
&gt;&gt; The funeral that
wasn't a funeral.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.650
&gt;&gt; There wasn't really a funeral.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.910
&gt;&gt; And the, and the, yeah and
the, you know the pyromaniac.

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:12.090
&gt;&gt; The pyromaniac mother that
wasn't really a pyromaniac.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what reactions have
you gotten to those stories?

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.190
I mean really they are very funny
but also pushing those boundaries.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:22.080
&gt;&gt; This is why I make Carmen well,
give the disclaimer because I know.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.280
I mean we're talking
about a woman who is ready

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.170 position:56%
to burn a house down you know, it's.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.910
I don't know how I haven't been,

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:32.460
I don't know if that's the proper
expression, but haven't been burned

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.730
at the stake before, the
stake, the stake, just burned.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.760
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.660
You know my family has such
finesse when telling the stories

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.120
because there are kids around.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.620
They just, it just happens you
know and it has to do with the fact

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.980
that 'in for a penny,
in for a pound'.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.280
Either you do it or you
don't and you have to trust

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.590
that the people will have the
same sense of humor that you do.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.390
Maybe that's the reason
why they're there

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.900
and you just have to
lay it out there.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.550
Just, it's you open.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.850
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.150
&gt;&gt; And then it happens.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.250
&gt;&gt; Well I mean that detail
about moving the geraniums

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.590
or they will get burned
is just so precious and.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.890
&gt;&gt; Really right?

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.190
&gt;&gt; And solely.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.650
&gt;&gt; And to me that's
who my grandmother was.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.570
It's like, you know you pay
attention to love and to embracing

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:19.190
and for this woman to be
this angry that she was ready

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:24.090
to burn this most sacred
place for somebody,

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.540
that's how much in pain she was.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.840
I'm happy she didn't.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.140
&gt;&gt; If she intended
to do it ever at all.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.440
&gt;&gt; I don't think she ever did.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.740
I think she just.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.040
I think it was a great
sweeping gesture.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:39.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, again yeah so I
mean I think that that really,

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.300
it's impressive that the
story walks that fine line

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.400
between what would really disturb
people and yet it just comes

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.030
out being funny like you say.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.660
&gt;&gt; I certainly hope nobody came
out of there thinking, you know,

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.190
oh my God that was horrible.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.490
What was this woman thinking?

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.790
&gt;&gt; It was wonderful.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.620
&gt;&gt; No, I think it was
great, yeah, yeah, so.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.530
&gt;&gt; And sometimes a
disclaimer is what you need.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.130
&gt;&gt; The story sometimes
needs a little paving

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.100
and whether someone does it or
you do it for yourself because all

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.010
of us, you know, the best stories
do push the boundaries a little

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.090
but you have to look
at your audience.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.440
You may come in with a story
that you are ready to tell

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.790
and then you look at
the demographics

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.060
or you look at what's happening.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.520
There's been a 30-minute delay,
people are tired, whatever

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.030
and you have to make an
assessment at that moment

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.350
and be absolutely willing
to kill your darling,

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.650
just like when you're writing.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.130
&gt;&gt; And say I can't do this
today or say I'm going for it

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.140
but letting the audience know,

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.990
just so you know this
story will end well.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:42.330
Remember that before we begin right
and that thing where we both talked

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:46.530 position:56%
to the audience to me is very much a
part of the old traditional telling

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.120
that has survived with
a lot of the best of us

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.030
that tell the stories now
publicly that we only told at home.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.330
And I love that.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.820
I love including the audience.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think it's impossible to tell a
story without including the audience

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.610
because it's our story now.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.100
&gt;&gt; But they don't know
how to respond anymore

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.810
because once they did and now.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.110
&gt;&gt; Once it was more common yeah.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.410
&gt;&gt; It was more common.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.200
&gt;&gt; Now the people have been trained
to observe whether it's a screen

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.660
or even in a theater production
or an opera, you are not.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.400
You don't [inaudible]
that fourth wall.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:23.540
And story is the wicked
child in the family.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.300
&gt;&gt; So what about your
story about your father?

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.630
That also had that moment
when you thought, okay,

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.950
he's going to throw rocks at
this man and you know [laughter]

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.250
and there's [multiple
speakers] assault.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.080
&gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't tell you the
one about my father pissing

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.050
in the woods, that's
another one but now.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:41.410
&gt;&gt; And yet it, you know, the
unexpected happens in that story

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.700
and brings about this
transformation.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.150
&gt;&gt; That was a true story so
part of it was a true story

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.110
but even a true story takes
craft because we all know

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.370
that we could all be at the
same place at the same time,

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.990
have something happen
and everyone is going

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.990
to put a slightly different
narrative.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.010
But how do you get a narrative
that's cohesive, one that works?

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:03.640
And that takes time, craft
and multiple tellings.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.500
In this case it was my father's
story and it took going back

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.510
to him several times and to say,
you know, what about this moment?

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:15.100
And I, you know, this is
not in the story but I said,

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.180
so were you really going
to pelt [inaudible]?

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.880
I had every intention of pelting
that man with rocks because he was

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.310
so hurt and angry and I said, and?

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.610
He said [inaudible].

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.450 position:56%
It was divine intervention which is,

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.380
you know I'd like to think
it was divine intervention

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:36.760
because my father learning to read
meant that my sister and I grew

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:42.890
up in a home filled with books
and periodicals and magazines and,

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.390
which meant our children were part
of the weekly reader book club

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.110
which meant my grandchildren
are growing

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.690
up book-drunk and look at that.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.550
Look at that, one totally
ill-tempered man,

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.980
a one and you know I'd would an
irascible man, an unpleasant man

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:06.670
that has no surname in our family,
San Antonio, changed generations

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.980
and generations by
teaching my father to read.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But I think it was also you know,

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.580
it could have been
divine intervention

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.350
but there was also the
intervention of your father's heart

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:19.440
because you could throw a rock at
a man who was awake so the fact

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.780
that it woke him up didn't
really stop [laughter].

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.240
&gt;&gt; No, it threw him off and Antonio
so quickly coming in with it.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.540
What are you doing here?

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.840
Why can't you read?

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.290
And you know, in the story
and I talked to my dad

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.480
because of course I have to create,
you have to create a certain amount

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.040
of dialogue even in memory,

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.170
my father cannot have a
perfect memory of what happened.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:39.380
Even him, in that sort of "Road to
Damascus" moment was not something

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.420
that he could tell you, oh I
remember the entire the narrative.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.930
He's 92 today, you know like
not today but at this moment

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.930
but he can tell me the meat
of it and certain things will,

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.230
are very clear in his mind.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.530
He doesn't remember being asked

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.830
but he remembers those
two words [inaudible].

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:56.500
Oh in Spanish it's one word.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.100
&gt;&gt; Which is 'teach me'

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.700
&gt;&gt; To me that's the.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.680
&gt;&gt; But don't you find that one
of the hardest things to do

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.620
when you're telling a story is
telling somebody else's story

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.110 position:56%
especially when they're your family,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.370
especially when you
want to honor it?

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:15.100
Because it's, if it's your story
you can make it however you want to

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.100
but if it's somebody else's story
and it's that important to them

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.170
that they told it to you
and you're going to tell it

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.500
to an audience, it's just.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.830
You want to tell the story
because it's funny but you want

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.850
to tell the story because
it's important too

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:30.260 position:56%
and to honor the way it meant to be.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.560
It's hard.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.860
It's hard.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.160
&gt;&gt; This one is unusual.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.490
I tell lots of stories
about my family

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:39.360
but in nearly every story I
am present so that it's part.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.360
It's mostly memory
and then interviews

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.920
and then created the story.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.030
With this one of course
I was not present,

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.030 position:56%
not even the glint in my papa's eye.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:53.050
So it was a, I didn't
tell this until about two,

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.840
three years ago because it was.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.180
It was a hard story.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.950
It was a story I wasn't sure
he was ready to have me tell.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.530
And there are certain
stories you do ask permission.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:06.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:10.330
&gt;&gt; Before you tell publicly because
you chose to be a public person

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.880
but not everyone in
your life chose that.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.850 position:56%
And then other stories, you know, I,

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:17.940
depending on them mostly
I would tell the family,

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.870
right you remember this story
about you know how mommy

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.170
or the [inaudible] did this?

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:25.110 position:56%
I'm working on that story so if you
have any memories you want to share?

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.380
And of course one of
the aunts will call.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.030
Do not listen to Hilda
[assumed spelling].

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.390
She never only remembers
things right but I was there.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.840
&gt;&gt; I am your [inaudible].

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's not how it happened.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.540
&gt;&gt; [Foreign language
spoken] you don't remember.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.840
That's true.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.450
&gt;&gt; So you get that in your
family as well [inaudible]?

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm the one that talks the least.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.620
My mom always said,
you sit and you listen.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.750
And then I just open.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:52.800
There's a story I'm still working
on about an elephant that was left

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.710
in my grandfather's [inaudible].

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.550
What is an elephant doing in
the middle of the district?

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:57.850
I don't know.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.150
I'm still working on it.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.630
But it's a story that was told and
all I have to do is to put food

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:06.390
on the table or beans to be cleaned
and put coffee and I seat my tias

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:10.800 position:56%
around and I just grab a notebook
and listen, that's all I have to do.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.220
Because I know they're
not going to let me talk.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.170
I'm not going to get it right

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.420
so they start interrupting
each other, yeah.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.740
&gt;&gt; And that's when
we get great stories.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.470
&gt;&gt; But that generation
is disappearing.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.070
&gt;&gt; We look at.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.510
We're the ones collecting now
these stories from our families

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.570
and those people are still talking.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.090
We'll likely still be talking

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.400
but even our own children,
it's already changing.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.540
Although my girls you know
tell wonderful stories

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.330
but they've been steeped in them.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:41.400
But most young people are not.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.670
See the reason listening
is so important is

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:51.220
because it's how you learn tempo,
tone, rhythm, the important pause,

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.770
there's such a thing as,
there's not just the wrong word.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.290
There is not just 'the' word.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.220
There is the 'right' word.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:03.090
The right word makes
all the difference.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:06.020
And that is only learned
by listening and listening

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.100
and listening to the people
you love to hear tell stories.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.570
Slowly you start to see patterns,
see patterns in how they crescendo,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.220
how they slow a story
down or how they say,

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.470
and once again he said no I won't.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.460 position:56%
And then he comes again, once again,
and now the audience starts to say,

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.830
no I won't, so that there's a
call, a natural call and response,

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:29.890
all that happens, yeah and but
what's going to happen in 15,

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.180
20, 30,40 years you know?

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.810
The stories are changing certainly.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you think
technology is part of that?

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.770
&gt;&gt; You're going to have time
for this conversation, okay.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.290
I didn't say [inaudible] recently.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Oh, so I was wondering what your
[multiple speakers] was about, yeah.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.030
&gt;&gt; That was the, well
the first one was.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:51.740
It was just a story but
the "TED" talk from 2005.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.320
But the TEDx talk was about
how important it would,

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.630
you know stories.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:57.930
Do they matter?

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.230
Will they still be around?

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.340
And I do believe they
will be but the,

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.280
I guess to me the most
important issue was,

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.680
will we know how to
listen any longer?

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.780
Or will we be so inattentive
to another human being

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.020
because it requires
frontal lobe concentration

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:22.650
and that's just primal
[inaudible] that we will be able

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.910
to follow narrative in
the traditional sense.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:29.830
I mean I don't know the answer
but I think it'll only happen

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:33.460
if what began as a revival some 40
or 50 years ago in storytelling,

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.970
in revivalist North
American storytelling.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.430 position:56%
And it sort of spread throughout the
world in little pockets continuously

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:45.160
but this is not storytelling
the way it happened organically.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:50.560
It's still something created, like
a perfect reproduction of you know,

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.510
a consul from you know
the 16th century,

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:54.930
whatever [foreign language
spoken] and it's just.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:45:00.350
It's going to be really close but
close [inaudible] still talking.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:01.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.900
&gt;&gt; And we are doing
our part or trying.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.650
&gt;&gt; And so I had one other sort
of specific question for you.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:12.320
You had mentioned that some of
your family stories or your stories

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.920
about growing up were
collected after you were on NPR

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.360
for quite a while doing stories
about [multiple speakers].

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.610
&gt;&gt; Weekend edition of "All
Things Considered" yeah.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.500
&gt;&gt; How did that come about?

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.910
&gt;&gt; Oh my God, because
life is so weird.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:32.330
I was hit head on at a light
and my car was totalled

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.410
and my knee was shattered.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:38.210
This is actually part of the answer
which is a very short answer.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.210
And it took me some time to recover

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:44.130
and I was very anxious
about driving.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:48.730
I have a really good learning
curve when it comes to pain.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.430
So whew and I had a phone
call from my then manager,

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.380
Robin DeFoe [phonetic]
this wonderful woman,

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.150
and she said this radio
station called NPR, NRP, NPR.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:58.890
I said, NPR, NPR?

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:06.280
This was like, I don't know
this had to be like 1991,

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.130
92, 93 something like that.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.430
I don't remember.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.540
Right in there and she
said they want you to come

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.060
and tell some stories because
they heard you tell something

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.220
on you know Peach Radio,
Atlanta radio.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.630
Georgia, it was Georgia public
television, ah Georgia radio.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:27.150
And I had to drive to do it
and that's how it happened.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:34.030
I almost cancelled because I
was so terrified and I just,

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.400
this is going to sound crazy.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.160
But it used to make me insane,
my mother would say, I did not

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.580
and your father did
not leave our country,

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.500
our beloved country and come here.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.710
We did not leave Communist Cuba
so that you would be too afraid

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.290
to take one step after the other
because I was a timid girl.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:57.980
I could hear her nagging in my head
and I got in the car and I drove

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.360
down to the little studio
in Georgia and I went

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.770
like an old woman [inaudible]
down the road, got there

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:08.520 position:56%
and taped the first of what became,
I don't know, several dozen stories.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.440
And 12 of them ended
up on a collection

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.610
but it was, that's how it happened.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:18.230
It was just sort of a.
It was a sweet time.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that was kind of
early in your career right?

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.860
&gt;&gt; Yes, it was.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.870
It was. And it was trial
by fire, it really was.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:29.970
I had no idea, as everything in
life, no idea what I was doing.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.930
&gt;&gt; So I guess, you know,
Carmen your stories

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:40.160 position:56%
and writing are what you've been
doing professionally for a long time

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.680
but for Karla it, you know,
you have another profession.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.980
&gt;&gt; Very new, yeah.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.540
&gt;&gt; And it's new to you, so what
are your plans for the future

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:49.840
as far as these stories go?

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.790
&gt;&gt; Oh gosh, this is
something I love.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.090
I like teaching.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.390
I love my children.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.050
I love my colleagues.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:01.690 position:56%
I've been teaching for 16, 20 years.

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.100
I refuse to give the exact amount

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.410
because then I'm going
to have to date myself.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:11.600
This is, that is my life
and this is my passion.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.560
So as long as I can continue
to do it and there's a public

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.810
that allows me to open my mouth
in front of them I'll do it.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.330
How is it going to happen?

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:20.630
I don't know.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:21.930
I don't know.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.230
&gt;&gt; It's happening already.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.120
Yeah, I think she's going to be
a very important, my prediction,

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:31.370
a very important voice in the
Mexican/American community of story

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.930
and of narrative and outside
of that into the greater sort

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.910
of American storytelling community.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:41.580
She has. She's the real thing.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.990
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we can say
you're both the real thing

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.300
and you're both going to
be very important voices

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.930
and you both are very
important voices

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.780
so we thank you very
much for this interview.

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.080
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] thank you.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.680
&gt;&gt; And for our program
earlier today.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.980
Thank you so much.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.840

of the Library of Congress.
