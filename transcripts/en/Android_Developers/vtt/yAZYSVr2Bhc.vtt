00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
&gt;&gt; We are pleased to announce Android 2.2.
There are four areas we'd like to highlight

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.759
in this video. We're working to continue improving
overall speed and performance on Android.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.790
In Android 2.2, the newly introduced Dalvik
JIT Compiler delivers a two to five X performance

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.870
boost to CPU-bound code compared to Android
2.1. In this demo version of the game Replica

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.960
Island, the screen turns red when the CPU
is unable to keep the game simulation thread

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.890
above 30 frames per second. Here, the Android
2.2 device with JIT maintains a game simulation

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.390
frame rate above 35, while the 2.1 device
quickly goes below 30. Developers can use

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.530
Android Cloud to Device Messaging to easily
enable alerts, send to phone, and two-way

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.380
sync functionality for their Apps. With this
API, an App server can send authenticated

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.829
messages to the Google server, which would
push the message to the App on a user's device.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.500
In this example, a developer has used Android
Cloud to Device Messaging to enable a URL

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.750
send to phone extension from the desktop browser
that automatically opens the push page with

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:23.340
the appropriate App here at Google Maps. The
App Backup API enables any App to have its

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.980
data backed up and then restored when installed
on a new device. The feature is controlled

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.159
by users via the automatic restore setting
on their device. With Android 2.2, developers

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.950
can specify whether they want their App installed
on a device's SD card. For Apps residing on

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.520
the SD card, users can move the App from the
SD card to internal storage and back from

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.409
the manage application settings. Android 2.2
introduces the ability to use ones phone as

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.659
a portable hotspot. Users can activate portable
hotspot on their phone then connect their

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:09.429
computer to the portable hotspot to get internet
access. We're continuing to make the browser

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.260
better and faster. Android 2.2 introduces
the V8 JavaScript engine which provides a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.740
two to three X improvement in JavaScript rendering
times compared to Android 2.1. You can see

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.810
the difference in the side-by-side visualizations
of the respective SunSpider JavaScript benchmarking

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.349
test results.
We're introducing several new features to

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.150
Android market. Users can choose to let an
App auto-update as long as permissions remain

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:57.940
unchanged. Users can also update all Apps
with unchanged permissions with a single click.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.330
Application Error Reports will provide to
developers App crash and freeze reports submitted

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.850
by users. These reports will be available
to developers through their Android Market

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:16.500
publisher account. To learn more about Android
2.2, please go to our website, developer.android.com.
