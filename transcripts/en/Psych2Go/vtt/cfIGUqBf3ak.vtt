[intro]

00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:14.399
Hi there, my name is Tina, also known as Teanayy at youtube.com/iswallflower and I'm here with

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:19.137
Psych2Go today to talk about antisocial behavior versus asocial behavior. I'll be referring to

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:23.470
information from the Psych2Go's article, "An Antisocial is Someone Who Doesn’t Care and Violates Others while

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.463
an Asocial is Someone Who Doesn’t Like to Socialize."

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:31.334
So, growing up, I actually had a lot of experiences being called antisocial. I was called antisocial

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:36.251
in the sense that I was too introverted and hermit-like to talk to people. I was very nervous and

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:40.799
scared. That's actually not what an antisocial is at all. Antisocial behavior is actually when you lack

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.482
the conscience of your wrongful actions.

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:46.996
Basically, it's when you do something wrong or bad, and you know that it's bad but you just

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:51.761
don't feel bad for it. Antisocial behavior, also known as ASPD, doesn't actually have an exact

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:56.157
cause, but there are a few indicators as to what would increase your chances of having it. Which

00:00:56.157 --> 00:01:00.325
would include being male, having been abused as a child, growing up with parents that have

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.731
ASPD or having parents that are alcoholic.

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:06.639
As you grow older, there are some behavioral signs that could indicate whether or not you have

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:11.085
antisocial behavior. Which would include cruelty toward animals, resistance to authority,

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:17.410
bullying and lying. What people generally think antisocial is is that they don't want to talk to

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.891
people, they don't want to socialize and stuff. That's actually not antisocial behavior but actually

00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:23.348
'asocial behavior'.

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:26.848
Asocial behavior is actually when you don't want to socialize with people. What people

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:31.532
generally think is antisocial. Asocial behavior is often found in people that have other disorders,

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:36.007
including personality disorders, mood disorders, autism or schizophrenia.

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.349
So, now that you know the difference between asocial and antisocial, what do you guys think?

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.096
Were you someone that used to mix up antisocial and asocial behavior before? Or were you

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:46.678
someone that use to be called antisocial when others actually meant asocial?

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:50.597
