00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.630
&gt;&gt;Pr. Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke of the Nigerian
Stock Exchange

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.590
Hi YouTube this is Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke. I'm
the Chief Executive of the Nigerian Stock

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.280
Exchange. I also worked at the New York Stock
Exchange before I came over ot the Nigerian

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.520
Stock Exchange. I think one thing that can
be done by companies and countries of the

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.700
world and even individuals to make the world
a better place for our loved ones is to care

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.770
for one another. If you take somebody along,
there's now way one person can solve the problems

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.070
of the world, but you should make it a point
or duty to pull up somebody from the line

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.590
up, if you help them reduce the level of poverty.
I do not believe in poverty elevation, I believe

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.430
in wealth creation. So by pulling up another
human being, not necessarily somebody from

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.420
your family, maybe an old school friend, or
somebody that just needs your help. You try

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.580
to help that person by getting them a job,
or getting them education, you are helping

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.799
the world. On this endeavor, a place like
Davos. We sit down at the roundtable and say

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.700
special things about special countries undeveloped
countries of the world need your help. But

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.289
for us as an individual, we make it a point
to pull up another human being to make him,

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.509
bring him up to middle class level, from poverty
to middle class. I'm positive when you teach

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:40.240
him how to fish, teach him a trade you ????? then
maybe you become the world leader of tomorrow.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.979
So we have to start as individuals. Then as
companies you have to ensure that your human

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.649
resource allocation is taking care of every
facet of life. There are many corporations

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.889
who make it a point of doing nothing and play
with it especially women of child bearing

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:07.680
age. I think that that is unfair because it's
not their fault that they were born a woman.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.140
It's really through that stage of life the
world will develop by having women reproduce.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.230
So you can not penalize them in the workplace
because they are reproducing the way God wants

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.241
it. So you have to make allowances for women
of child bearing age. Not to discourage their

00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:32.790
career because they are meant to have babies.
Let there be flexible work hours, let them

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.070
have maternity leave that is paid for no more
than three months. I think that's fair enough.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.230
That should keep the person from lose their
position because they are reproducing for

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.260
the world. So women should be empowered. And
somebody like me who has struggled to get

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.660
up there, I'm not at the highest level but
as far as I've gotten up, I've tried to help

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:04.650
a lot of other women get into the stock market,
to become stockbrokers, to ???, to even own

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.200
their own brokerage firms. Get them license
to own their own brokerage firm. So these

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.250
other women who have managed to break through
would pull up another woman, pull up the second

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.970
woman, pull up the third woman then we not
have ??? anywhere because even in the board

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:30.950
room where there are maybe 12 people and maybe
four are people are women it would help a

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:39.100
lot. As opposed to you, being the only woman
on that board. Already you talk about issues,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.590
the men tell them, tell you that they're not
 ???? but if four people are talking about

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.910
the same issues, the men will begin to listen.
You can do something as an individual and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.060
as a head of a corporation. Even if you're
not a Chief Executive, you are management,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.500
you can help to pull up other women, because
when you empower a woman, you empower the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:09.790
whole world. Men tend to be a little selfish,
but women have the big heart. They help everybody,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.110
the ???, their children, friends of their
children. So when you empower a woman, you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:23.160
empower the whole world. Lastly are the countries
themselves. Well I don't believe in poverty

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.900
elevation so I don't ask people to go hand
in hand to the Western World. They've given

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:41.060
us that they give us donations. What I'd rather
do is to have the developed world mentor,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.760
mentor, provide opportunities to mentor people
from the less developed countries so that

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.720
they will learn. People like us have been
exposed to Davos. We've learned a lot to rule

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:03.390
the world also help up people so I don't believe
people should hand in hand and give us that.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:11.020
We must pay for the poor people. We've learned
a lot from this Davos on four occassions.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:18.760
Of the four people I was priviledged to listen
to, Bill Gates, who has singled handedly helped

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:26.510
do a lot of work in creating wealth through
technology, all over the developed countries

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:36.940
of the world. So if a lot of other people
like Bill Gates were ??? that would do that

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.130
it would help the world a lot. So wherever
you are don't go hand in hand begging for

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.020
a plan because it won't last two or three
days. What you should do is get people, people

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.910
like me, to help you in technical ways where
you can help yourself create wealth for yourself

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.180
and also it will trickle down to others. So
it's a simple world that we have to live in,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:08.380
so we have to help one another. Because if
your not good by yourself and you have all

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.790
that money, you will actually imprison yourself.
You really can't enjoy the money when everyone

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.790
around you is poor. So you have to pull up
people for you to be able to enjoy the money.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.410
I'm not saying everybody in the world is to
meant to be equally rich, but want a comfortable

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.340
world where the rich and the not so rich will
exist. We don't want too rich or too poor

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:37.240
so must try to level up and it's only in a
place like Davos where the world leaders assemble

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.360
every year, that's a place you can for ???. I
believe that as time goes on you will begin

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.520
to see the benefits of this assembly in Davos.
Thank you very much.
