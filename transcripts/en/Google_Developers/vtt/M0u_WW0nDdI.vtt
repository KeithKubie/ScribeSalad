[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.117 --> 00:00:07.950
BROOKE BASINGER: My
name is Brooke Basinger.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.890
I'm the technical lead of
a medical device project

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.170
at Verily Life Sciences.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.060
And you might wonder
why I'm starting off

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.580
my talk that sounds like it
should be about medical devices

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.077
with a picture of
a roller coaster.

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:22.410
And it's because I've been a
little bit of a risk taker,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.580
since I was very little.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.790
I remember when I was a
little bit older than what

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.010
you see in this
picture, I would go

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.230
to this amusement park
in Denver with my family

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.670
called Elitch Gardens.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.140
We went every year for a while.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.460
And I wanted so badly to
ride this big, historic

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.190
wooden roller coaster.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.010
I looked at it longingly
every year that we went.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.340
And finally, one day, I
was tall enough to ride it.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.290
And the attendant
let me in the line.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.730
I was so excited about this.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.320
I'm sure I was really little.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.340
And as I got closer and closer
to the front of the line,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.740
this thing started to
look bigger, and taller,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.260
and scarier than it really was.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.349
And it started to
sound even scarier.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.210
You could hear this
rattling and rumbling

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.010
from the roller coaster.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.150
I would never have
admitted it at the time,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.170
but I think I was
kind of terrified.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.990
But I had set my sights
on this big thing.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.480
I had convinced everybody
to let me do it.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.390
So I couldn't really
back out at that point.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.060
So I just decided to
set aside my nerves.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.050
I decided to ignore them, put
them aside, distract myself

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.810
until I got to the
front of the line.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.310
And I sat down in my
seat next to my dad.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.015
And I pulled that lap
bar down on top of me.

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:36.390
And at that point,
I was not just

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.860
mentally committed
to this thing,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.680
but I was physically strapped
in, literally strapped in.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.390
I could not get out.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.682
So at that point, you
might as well get on board,

00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:46.640
and just roll with whatever
is going to happen,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.590
and enjoy the adventure
that is coming.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.680
So I've used that a lot
through my career as well.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.410
I grew up to be a
mechanical engineer.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.510
I went to a place called
Harvey Mudd College.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.110
It's a pretty awesome place that
deserves an extra shout out.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.800
It is actually one
of those places

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.270
that [? Marion ?]
talked about is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.900
getting to be half and half with
female engineers and computer

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.430
scientists.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.979
But when I was graduating
from Harvey Mudd,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.550
I should have gotten a
professional, responsible adult

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.030
engineering job like all
of my classmates did.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.930
But no.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.840
I had applied for something
called a Thomas J. Watson

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.520
Fellowship.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.770
And this Thomas J.
Watson Fellowship,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.440
the intent of this fellowship
is to take students

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.100
who are really good at
meeting expectations

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.890
and give them the opportunity--
basically pay them--

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.850
to run around the world
studying some independent study

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.610
project that they make up,
that might be kind of wacky

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.320
and off the wall.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.600
And I, of course,
proposed that I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.690
should study international
influences in roller coaster

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.550
design.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.490
Because aside from
being a fan, I now

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.390
had an engineer's appreciation
for the design challenges

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.190
of a roller coaster.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.900
In particular, I
was, and I still

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.960
am, really fascinated by the
interaction between the body

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.820
and the machine.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.120
How do your design rules change
when you're no longer working

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.650
with just metal and plastic?

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.210
But now, you actually
have to design

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.740
for and around the human
body that grows, and moves,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.060
and changes, and feels,
and breathes, and thinks.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.650
How do you do that?

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.720
When you add that human
being into the equation,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.410
it changes everything.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.750
It changes the whole picture.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860
So maybe it was my nostalgic
stories about Elitch Gardens.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.010
But I somehow convinced
this fellowship committee

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.199
to pay me money to travel
around the world riding

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.865
roller coasters.

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:41.145
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:43.050
That sounds like a
pretty sweet deal.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.330
I realize that that
sounds outrageously cool.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.110
And it was.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.317
Trust me.

00:03:47.317 --> 00:03:48.900
But it was another
one of these things

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.700
that got even more terrifying
as I got closer to it.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.050
Not only was I going to be
outside of the United States

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.700
traveling by myself for a whole
year with basically no support;

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.190
but on top of that, they
take all these students who

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.920
are good at meeting expectations
and pitch them into an area

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.380
where there are no expectations.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.530
And that was as scary
to me as the travel was.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.530
But again, I had set my
sights on this big thing.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.050
I had talked somebody
into letting me do it.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.480
So you can't really
back out at that point.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.190
So I got on the plane.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.870
I strapped myself in.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.130
And I ran off around the world
to study roller coaster design.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.990
Mostly, that meant
that I was traveling

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990
for a year with a
backpack and dreadlocks.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.430
But by the end of this year, I
had circumnavigated the globe.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.200
I had ridden a lot
of roller coasters,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.720
despite what you
see in the pictures.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.140
I had built up this confidence
that you could drop me

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.050
basically anywhere in the
world, in any situation,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.040
and I might not know the answer.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.250
In fact, I probably
wouldn't know the answer.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.460
But I had the confidence
that I would be fine

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.780
because I would figure it out.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.510
I trust my own ability
to adapt and sort out

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.460
whatever it is that I land in.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.770
I also had realized by
the end of this year

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.160
that the only expectations
of me that matter are mine.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.970
And that's an important one.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.050
I didn't need somebody else
to define for me what it

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.030
looked like to do a good job.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.200
I can do that for myself.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.260
And I should do that for myself.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.120
Also by the end of this
year, I had actually

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.328
realized that I didn't want
to go into roller coaster

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:25.140
design as a career.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.840
But I was still fascinated
by the interaction

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.490
between the body
and the machine.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.280
So instead of putting
the body in the machine,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.930
let's flip that on
its head and put

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.750
the machine inside of the body.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.520
So I ended up going
back to grad school.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.570
I got a PhD in biomedical
engineering from USC.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.220
And as part of my
dissertation work,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.130
I worked on this retinal
prosthesis device.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.997
This takes an image from
the patient's eyeglasses.

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:53.580
And it sends it through a couple
of different processing steps

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.000
and eventually applies it as a
spatially distributed pattern

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.790
of electrical stimulation
directly on the patient's

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.220
retina, the back of the eye.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.470
That gives these patients
artificial vision

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.820
for people who have
certain types of blindness.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.382
So that's a pretty
amazing thing.

00:06:08.382 --> 00:06:09.840
This was a huge
team that did this.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.940
And this is a huge
feat of engineering.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.620
But the pieces that
really hit home for me

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.090
were the stories
that our subjects

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.110
would tell about how this
impacted their daily lives--

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.260
to be able to see something
again, anything again--

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.840
how much this meant
to their lives.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.430
There is one patient
in particular

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.340
who I remember talking about
how his granddaughter had

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.530
been born after he went blind.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.440
And of course, he had talked
to her and interacted with her.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.060
And he could hug her.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.070
But he had never seen her.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.100
And this amazing
feat of engineering,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.470
when he was able to take
it home for the first time,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.230
he was able to take the
glasses portion of it home.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.090
He was able to see
his granddaughter's

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.830
face for the first time ever.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.830
So that's pretty cool.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.940
Again, you add that human
being into the equation,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.300
and it changes everything.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.670
Now, I did eventually
grow up and get

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.700
a real, professional,
adult engineering job.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.680
I actually did a
couple of jobs in a row

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.840
where I was working on
different medical devices

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.860
and different types--

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.330
different parts of the body.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.180
But I ended up running
product development

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.630
at this small company that was
making cannulas, and catheters,

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.850
and really complex
medical tubing

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.350
that goes into different
types of surgeries.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.710
So this particular cannula
is a really good example

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.470
of the types of things
that we worked on.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.500
This cannula takes
deoxygenated blood

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.170
from the inferior and
superior vena cava.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.420
Those are the two big veins
that take all of the blood

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.910
from your body and pump
it back into your heart.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.300
So it takes that deoxygenated
blood and pumps it out.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.570
And then simultaneously,
through the same tube

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.540
and the same incision, pumps
back in oxygenated blood

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.991
and spits that back
out into your heart.

00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.740
That, again, is a
pretty complicated thing

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.860
to figure out how to do.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.070
And it's a super complicated
thing to manufacture.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.020
We ran a manufacturing
plant that made this.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.080
And there were plenty
of challenges with that.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.920
But this allows hospitals to
take patients whose lungs don't

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.000
work anymore and keep them
alive, for weeks on end

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.620
sometimes, while they figure
out how to fix their lungs.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.380
So I was at this company
when what was then

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.650
a division of Google X, and
is now Verily Life Sciences,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.200
came calling and
wanted to talk to me.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.360
And to be perfectly honest,
I wasn't actually sure

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.230
that I wanted to take the job.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.130
I really enjoyed my life
in southern California.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.930
I was living in Long Beach.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.059
I also was on this very
traditional med device career

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:34.559
path.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.510
I knew exactly where
my career was going.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.330
I knew exactly what
promotion I would get next.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.210
I wasn't sure that I wanted
to flip that all on its head.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.570
And also, I didn't have any
idea that any division of Google

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.080
was doing anything remotely
related to medical devices.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.970
To be perfectly honest,
this is kind of all

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.930
that I knew about
Silicon Valley.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.070
But true to form, I
decided to get on the ride.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.770
And I am so glad that I did.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.560
I've been at Verily
now for two years.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.200
Our mission is to really
take the world's health

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.950
organization, and organize
it, and make it accessible so

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.740
that we can use that to help
improve patients' lives.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.760
That's a pretty big, lofty goal.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.120
It's a little hard to
understand, hard to visualize,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.567
what that might look like.

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:21.150
But in the near term,
that means we've

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.180
got a lot of concrete
hardware projects

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.200
and science and clinical
projects, as well.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.740
We've got lot of
concrete projects

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.360
that are moving that
are going to help

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.540
us build either
investigational tools

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.000
or help us interact
in some patient's

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.820
life in a positive
way, maybe in some more

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.010
specific targeted way.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.402
And this glucose
monitoring contact lens

00:09:43.402 --> 00:09:45.360
is a really good example
of the types of things

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.890
that we work on.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.220
If you imagine how
this thing is built,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.610
we take a little
microelectronics ring that

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.620
might have an antenna on it.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.510
It would have some
sort of energy storage,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.000
whether that's a
capacitor or a battery--

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.020
definitely a custom
designed chip.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.970
And then you sandwich
that between layers

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.179
to make it into a
functional contact lens.

00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:11.220
Now, I want you to think
about the team of people

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.900
that it takes to do
something like this.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.940
You might need an
electrical engineer.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.630
You might need a chip
designer, an antenna engineer.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.180
You definitely need a
mechanical engineer, probably

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.620
a polymer chemist.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.517
You might need a biochemist.

00:10:24.517 --> 00:10:26.100
You definitely need
a couple of people

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.290
working on the glucose sensor.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.840
You might need a process
engineer to scale it up.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.700
You might need a quality team.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.800
You probably need a
regulatory specialist

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.530
who can help talk to the FDA.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.020
There are a lot of
functions that go into this.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.180
And I'll let you in
on a little secret.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.510
I am not an expert in
all of those things.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.310
Nobody could be.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.980
But as the technical
lead, it's my job

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.010
to not only bring all those
functions to the table,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.600
but make sure that we're
talking to each other,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.020
make sure that we're
speaking the same language,

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.060
that we're all pulling
in the same direction

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.630
and working together
towards a common end goal.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.430
So that requires of
each of us, myself

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.000
included, that we are not
only confident and competent

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.580
in the areas that we
own, but that we're not

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.410
afraid to say we don't know
certain areas of the project.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.641
I have to get into
areas of the project

00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:20.640
all the time that are
things that I don't really

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.360
know that well.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.100
But I have to learn, and
I have to adapt as I go.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.440
All of us need to
be willing to be

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.930
the beginner in the
room on these topics

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.740
that we're not familiar with.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.380
So this picture is a really
good example of that.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.200
This is some of my team
from about six weeks ago.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.430
And what you see in this
picture is an antenna engineer,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.520
a materials scientist,
a mechanical engineer,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.070
and an applied
physicist, all learning

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.750
to do eye surgery
for the first time.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.570
I ask my team to stretch
like this every day.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.260
And I also continue to
take risks and put myself

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.900
in situations that are
outside of my comfort

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.150
zone, outside of
my core competency,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.810
perhaps, things that are a
little nerve wracking, maybe

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.340
even a little scary.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.710
But I continue to do that
because I think that that's

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.840
how great things happen.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.110
Now, I am wholeheartedly
on board with wherever

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.270
this ride is taking me.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.910
And I am definitely
committed to continuing

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.930
to take risks and do things that
I find to be scary all the way

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.300
until I'm old and gray.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.470
But I wanted to encourage all of
you guys to do the same thing.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.580
Take risks.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.430
Set your sights
on something big.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.100
Talk somebody into
letting you do it.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.830
And then strap yourself in
so that you can't get out.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.590
And at that point, you
have to just be on board

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.220
and enjoy the adventure
and see where it takes you.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:46.790
Thank you.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.540
