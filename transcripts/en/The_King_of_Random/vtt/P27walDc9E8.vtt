00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey guys, welcome back! Thanks for joining us today on the King of Random.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.640
We recently showed you how to make three different types of invisible ink

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.000
for sending secret messages.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.520
Well today, we're going to try to make regular visible ink using walnuts.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.990
The walnuts we'll be using today don't look quite like the walnuts

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.100
you're used to seeing. The ones you buy in a store have already had the outer husk

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.960
removed and so you just have the shell with the nut inside.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.359
While they're growing on trees, walnuts

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.119
have a fruit section that grow around the nut. This is called the husk.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.720
I have here a bowl of walnuts that I've collected from a tree in my yard with all of the husks still attached.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.700
While they're still growing on the tree, the husk is green smooth and firm

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.869
but these walnuts have aged quite a bit and the husks have started to degrade and turn brown

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.400
Normally the first step in making this walnut ink

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.740
is to take a bunch of walnuts, put them in a pot, add water and boil it for 8 hours.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.218
We're still going to follow that same basic recipe but instead of a pot on the stove,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.239
we're going to be using a slow cooker.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.720
There are several advantages to using a slow cooker instead

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.800
of just boiling it in a pot on the stove. The slow cooker only heats up to barely above the boiling temperature.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.180
So you're less likely to have all the water burn off. If you don't have any slow cooker at all, that's fine.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.129
You can still do this with a pot on the stove.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.640
You just want to make sure that you have it set on low heat

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.039
and check it about every half hour to make sure your

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.489
water isn't boiling off too much. If it is boiled off and the water is getting too

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.189
low, just add a little bit more. You can see that the walnuts

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.960
I have are all these old and decayed ones

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800
which is actually what we want because the color comes from the old husk.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.940
If you want to try this yourself, your best bet is to find someone who has a walnut tree and see if they'll let you

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.060
take some of their old ones that have fallen onto the ground.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.820
I'm gonna start off by adding about 10 walnuts to the slow cooker.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
Now lets add enough water that it should cover them completely except

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.619
they'll probably float a little bit, so they won't be submerged 100%

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.909
Right after adding water. Just by stirring it for a couple seconds,

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.740
you can already see that the water has started to turn brown. With the walnuts and the water in the pot,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.900
It's time to put on the lid, plug it in and set it on high for eight hours.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.990
I like to check on them after about four hours

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.840
just to make sure that too much water hasn't managed to escape and if it has I just add a little bit more to bring

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.400
it back up to the level it started at.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.930
Now you probably noticed this video is 9 hours long,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440
So now we're just going to sit and watch this in real time for 8 hours.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
Ahh kidding. I'm not gonna do that. That would be terrible for everyone.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.560
All right, now we have walnuts that have been cooking in our slow cooker for eight hours.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.260
So what we're gonna do is open it up, pour off the liquid

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.450
and then we're going to remove the husk from the shells and then let it sit for another 16 hours.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.559
You can see how much darker the liquid is at this point. You can't see through it anymore before it was sort of a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.459
A light tea colored and now it's more like a dark coffee.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.519
Just how much it leaves residue on the side of the container here. Let's pour this off into a bowl.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.700
Let's look at the difference between one of these walnuts

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.470
that's been cooking for eight hours, and one that hasn't. Before you start cooking, the husks is pretty rigid.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.589
It's a little bit brittle in thin spots for the most part.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.259
It kind of just looks like dried bark. And then one that's been cooking for eight hours. It's you know it's very soft,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.160
It's spongy when you squeeze it a lot of that juice comes out of it.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.709
So what we're going to do now is we're going to peel off the husk from all ten of our walnuts

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.980
After cooking for eight hours, It's pretty soft

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.500
and you can usually just get it off with your fingers. If you want, you can get a tool to help you scrape it.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.960
All right, and there you have it a bowl full of

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.760
walnuts and the water that they cooked in

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.660
And at this point, the next step is very simple it just takes a while

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.139
We need to let it sit for another fifteen or sixteen hours. Just to make sure all of the color and juices are

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.020
soaked out of those husks.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.269
There we go, our water and husks have now been sitting for 18 hours. And we have a very dark liquid in here.

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.141
That's just full of walnut pieces.

00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:45.340
At this point, let's take out the walnut husks,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.360
squeeze them pretty hard to try and get any remaining liquid out of them

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.640
and then we can throw them away.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.780
We'll then run the liquids through a strainer and then

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.740
put it on a pot on the stove and boil it to get rid of some of the excess water.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.349
It really recommend wearing gloves while I do this or it could probably stain your skin.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.020
Just a little bit.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.540
I think that's most of the husk pieces removed from our water.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.740
So now let's pour it through a strainer into a pot.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.440
The strainer will help remove any small pieces of husk that I wasn't able get out with my hands.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.240
Mmm. Gross. Walnut pumice. Oh, it's nasty.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.299
Now we're just gonna add some heat and let it boil for a little while to reduce the amount of water in it.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.980
This will help concentrate the ink and make it a little bit darker and thicker.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.720
And there we have it. Our liquid has now boiled down to a much more concentrated form.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.140
It's a little bit thicker and quite a bit darker

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.360
At this point, I'm just gonna pour it into this other jar and that can be our inkwell.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.460
You can see how even when it's very thin on the sides of the glass it stains it fairly dark.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.060
I have here a little souvenir metal nib pen and I'm gonna use this to test out our ink.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.600
It's a good color. It's not a black ink but it's a very dark brown.All right that worked pretty well.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.460
I'm not very good at writing with this metal nib pen and it was actually a pretty cheap souvenir.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.100
So if you had a higher quality one, I'm sure it would write more smoothly.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.570
But the ink is working pretty well. It writes. It goes on pretty smoothly, and it's a very nice rich dark brown color.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.050
I'm pretty happy with our ink.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.640
If you're going to be making yourself some ink, it makes sense that you would make yourself a pen as well.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.519
So I picked up this pack of feathers at Hobby Lobby for just a couple bucks

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.453
and I'm going to see if I can carve the feather into a good old-fashioned quill.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.080
With our feather, the first step is figuring out

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.160
what direction we're gonna want to hold it when we're writing.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.090
This position feels pretty natural to me to hold it, so I want this part to be the top of the feather.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.500
Our goal is basically to cut the feather, so it's the same shape as the metal nib that I was using.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.420
To begin we want to use a very sharp razor blade to cut through the feather

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.880
right where we want the tip of our writing point to be.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.400
I've found that it often helps to cut a little bit higher up on the feather

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.900
as the bottom parts tend to be more fragile and break when you try and cut them.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.820
If you move up the feather and it still breaks when you cut it,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.240
try soaking it in cold water for at least an hour.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.400
For the initial cut, we'll want to cut from the bottom

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.510
and use one smooth motion to cut up at an angle through the feather.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.730
I got most of it in one cut. I'm just gonna clean up and finish cutting off the edge.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.260
It wasn't perfect but that's the general taper that we're looking for.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.140
You may notice that the inside of the feather has this sort of

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.240
skeletal structure and we do want to remove that. We now have a hollow feather with a tapered point on it.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.420
I'm now going to squeeze the size of the feather and try and get it to crack in a line that lines up with our point.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.000
There we go.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.100
If the feather doesn't crack just by squeezing the sides,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.709
you can score it gently with a razor blade on the inside and try again.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.509
There we go. It's not perfectly lined up with our point

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.568
but we'll carve the tip of our feather to line up better with the crack.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.250
There should be two different angles of cuts. One that will be a longer,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.509
farther back cut and one shallower cut that leads right up to the point.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.139
I'm going to extend our opening to form those two different shapes.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.820
Let's start right here and give it a little bit steeper of a cut that goes down to a point.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.260
Just using the razor blade to shape the tip a little bit more to make it match the look of our metal nib.

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:44.780
All right, I think we've got a fairly good point here.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.840
So now I'm just going to press it down on the table

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:53.720
and use the razor blade to cut off the very, very tip. I still want a point. That's maybe a millimeter wide at the top.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.080
Well we have our feather quill and we have our ink. Now let's see if they work well together

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.560
hmm not bad

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.009
The ink stays stuck to the feather all the way around where there's a split in the feather,

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:31.498
it works as a sort of channel to guide the ink down to the nib. When you press down, the feather splits apart

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.780
just slightly and that helps draw the ink down to the bottom of the tip.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.800
There you have it. Now you know how to take walnuts and make your very own ink

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.500
and how to make a functional quill out of a feather.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.120
These are tools that have been around for thousands of years and they work pretty well.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.500
I'm not very practiced at using a quill yet. My hand is still used to the motions from a ballpoint pen

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.820
which allows a little bit more variety in which direction your hand is traveling. But with some practice,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.400
I'm pretty sure I could get quite good with this feather quill.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.680
Whether you're a fan of old fashioned writing, living like a Harry Potter character,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.280
or just learning how to make a new cool stuff. This is a great project.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.180
It does take some time for your walnuts to cook and turn into ink but it's not very difficult

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.759
and it's pretty fun to use. With just a little bit of practice,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.120
you'll probably be able to carve your own feather quill in just about a minute's time.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.600
Today was actually my first time ever making a pen out of a feather. This has been a lot of fun.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.880
Thanks for joining us today for this video and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.940
It exploded. There we go, these pieces of the walnut

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.900
Tastes like a walnut.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.530
Okay. A few random factoids for you,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.740
My favorite color is red. My favorite movies are Matrix and Iron Man.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.660
And making videos for the last 7 years have been one of the most challenging

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.720
but most rewarding things I've ever done with my life.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.300
There are a lot of ups and downs in a Youtuber journey,

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.389
but YOU! You've stuck with me through them all. That's why you're the best.
