STUDENT: So my
perspectives about language

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.740
have changed significantly
over the course of this class.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.640
I think in awakening
me and making

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.390
me acknowledge biases and
perceptions that I had

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:27.500
and trying to recognize that
all languages are equal.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.110
You know, and thinking about
other aspects of my life

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.680
where, you know, wanting as
a minority woman of color,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.150
thinking of equality
in that terms

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.120
that I never thought to
apply it to language.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.130
I never really considered
how important language

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.370
is as far as identity.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.100
You know, we learned a lot
about how, in this class,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.670
language is not just--

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.545
there are political, social,
and economic implications.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:54.920
And so, I feel like this class
has changed my perspective

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.080
in making me aware
of those things

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.690
and realizing that language
is important and that, yeah,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.530
that all languages are equal.
