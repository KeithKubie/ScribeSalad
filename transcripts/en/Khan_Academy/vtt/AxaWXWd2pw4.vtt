00:00:00.021 --> 00:00:02.084
- We're now going to talk about something

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:03.917
called eutrophication.

00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:07.712
Eutrophication.

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:09.642
And it comes from, or it's derived from,

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.990
the Greek for well nourished.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.887
Eu referring to well and
then trophic or trophia,

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:19.508
referring to nourished, or nourishment.

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:22.167
And so you might think
that this is a good thing

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.271
but as we'll see over
the course of this video,

00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:26.261
this is really about over-nourishment,

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:28.048
and over-nourishment to the point

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.256
that it's actually causing very bad things

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:33.263
to happen in our biosphere.

00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:34.909
So the general idea, we've already talked

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.051
about things like nitrogen and especially

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.306
phosphorous being a rate-limiting factor

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:40.920
for how fast plants can grow.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.130
We talked about that in the nitrogen

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.316
and the phosphorous cycle videos.

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:48.013
And because of that, we humans have added

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:50.512
a lot of nitrogen and
especially phosphates

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:53.174
to plants in order to grow them better,

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:54.901
because we need the plants to live,

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.432
to have more food.

00:00:56.432 --> 00:00:57.978
So what has happened is,

00:00:57.978 --> 00:01:02.284
so let's say that this right
over here is some land.

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:04.459
And this is, let's say that's a farm,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.762
right over there on the land
where we're growing our crops.

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:11.174
So these are all the
crops that we're growing.

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:14.341
In order to ensure that the crops grow

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:18.437
as much as they can, we add fertilizer

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:20.408
to it, and a lot of
that fertilizer might be

00:01:20.408 --> 00:01:22.643
nitrogen, it might be
phosphorous in the form

00:01:22.643 --> 00:01:25.643
of phosphates, so we add fertilizer.

00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:35.577
And the biggest culprit
here tends to be phosphates,

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:37.493
the phosphorous in them,
and that helps the plants

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:38.956
grow more.

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.509
That helps the plants grow more,

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.969
which seems like a good thing,

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.830
but there's another side effect

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.618
that happens because of this.

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:50.896
As the water, either due
to rain or irrigation

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:55.182
for the crops, as the water
flows from those crops

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:57.426
into local streams and
rivers, it'll eventually

00:01:57.426 --> 00:02:00.973
find its way into local
streams and rivers.

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:05.289
those streams and rivers
and lakes are going to have

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.428
an excess of those
fertilizers, in particular

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.264
maybe those phosphates.

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:13.173
So you have more phosphates in this,

00:02:13.173 --> 00:02:15.103
let's say this is a lake of some kind,

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:16.403
so I'll make it big.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.757
Let's say this is a lake
of it and we already know

00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:21.217
that things like phosphates
are the rate-limiting

00:02:21.217 --> 00:02:22.800
factors for plants.

00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:26.663
And so, you could have
photosynthetic organisms

00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:30.320
like algae in this lake
and if it didn't have

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.734
the fertilizer you
might just have a little

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:33.258
bit of the algae.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:35.989
But now since they're getting
all of these phosphates,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.081
the algae can go crazy.

00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:40.531
The algae can go crazy and grow all over

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.019
the surface of the lake.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.031
And so this is where that algae is getting

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.098
over-nourished.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:47.875
It's getting way more
phosphates than would have

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:51.306
typically happened just if
there wasn't fertilizer,

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.027
if there wasn't this runoff happening.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.370
And it's not just fertilizers,
even some detergents

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.090
in the past, they have,
you have sodium phosphates,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.189
which once again, can
cause this eutrophication.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.400
And you might say okay,
well why is this bad?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.014
It could just make the
surface of the water

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:09.118
a little bit less clear,
a little bit green,

00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:11.657
but hey, there's living things here.

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:14.755
Well the issue is what
happens once this algae dies.

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:17.518
Once this algae dies, and it starts

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:21.268
to float down, that can
be food for bacteria.

00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:25.865
That could be food for bacteria, and

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:29.200
as the bacteria consume it, they also use

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.135
oxygen.

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:32.553
We've already talked
about the role of oxygen

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:34.219
in respiration.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.584
The bacteria will
consume all of the oxygen

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.973
in the water.

00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:41.931
Now a lot of times when
we think of ocean animals,

00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:42.764
so when we think of,

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.515
I'll just draw a little fish here,

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.848
and so that's a little fish,

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:50.900
we don't often think
about the necessity of

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.895
oxygen in the water.

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:54.900
But ocean animals need
oxygen just like we do,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.620
and they get that oxygen,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.981
waves can crash and as the
waves crash it brings in

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.898
oxygen from the surface

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.373
that ocean animals can
use in order to live,

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:09.123
in order to do their respiration.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.334
But now all of a sudden,
if this bacteria, because

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:15.524
they're able to decompose all this algae

00:04:15.524 --> 00:04:17.811
that is dying, if they're
consuming all of the

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:22.006
oxygen, well it depletes
the oxygen from the water

00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:24.870
so that the ocean animals
can't live there anymore.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.121
And so the irony here is,
by having this fertilizer

00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.937
runoff, by having these extra phosphates,

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.033
this eutrophication, by
allowing one thing to grow

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.605
far more than it would have otherwise,

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:39.246
it actually ends up depleting the oxygen

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.989
that keeps other things from growing.

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:45.217
And it actually creates
what we call dead zones.

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:48.316
So this fish is going
to die and other animals

00:04:48.316 --> 00:04:49.754
like it aren't going to
live because there's not

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:52.030
gonna be enough oxygen in that water.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.104
And then we have a Dead Zone.

00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:56.479
And this is a serious problem.

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.585
We have some pictures here.

00:04:57.585 --> 00:05:01.668
This is potential
eutrophication in this picture.

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.859
Let me show you some more.

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.951
This is another one, and
you've probably seen this,

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:09.929
especially in places that
might have sewage runoff.

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.240
It's really happening because
there's extra nutrients

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.618
that are allowing these
algal blooms or aldral algo,

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:21.519
I don't know, to go out
of control and when they

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:24.700
decompose the bacteria is
sopping up all the oxygen,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.537
nothing else can live.

00:05:26.537 --> 00:05:29.036
And this is happening on a macro scale.

00:05:29.036 --> 00:05:33.555
So right over here is
kind of a global picture

00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:37.297
of dead zones that we
have and you see them

00:05:37.297 --> 00:05:38.565
all through the world.

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:40.352
And you see they are
typically concentrated

00:05:40.352 --> 00:05:43.452
where we have more industrialized nations,

00:05:43.452 --> 00:05:47.435
where we have either more
agriculture happening,

00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:50.483
more industrial agriculture, where they

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.031
might be using more
fertilizer and also where

00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:54.779
you might have more runoff
from cities that will

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.183
have nutrients like the
phosphates, that will cause

00:05:58.183 --> 00:06:00.569
this eutrophication to happen.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.477
And if you were to zoom
in, let's say on the

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:05.193
Caspian Sea, you can
see this in more detail,

00:06:05.193 --> 00:06:07.447
you can visually see this.

00:06:07.447 --> 00:06:10.423
So, right over here is a satellite image

00:06:10.423 --> 00:06:13.654
of the Caspian Sea and you
can see the eutrophication.

00:06:13.654 --> 00:06:17.821
You can see the algeal, algal
blooms throughout this area.

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.516
It's making the water less clear.

00:06:21.516 --> 00:06:23.975
So this is a serious
ecological thing that we

00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:25.092
have to think about.

00:06:25.092 --> 00:06:28.152
On one level, phosphates
and fertilizers, nitrates

00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:29.980
seem like a good thing,
it's helping us grow

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.960
more crops, but we have to be very careful

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.543
with where it actually ends up.
