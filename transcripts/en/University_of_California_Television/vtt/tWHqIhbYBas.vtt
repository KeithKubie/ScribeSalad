00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.650
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.900
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.030
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.700
Our guest today is Samuel Scheffler

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.700
who is university professor

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.220
and professor of philosophy
and law at New York University.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.850
He is the 2012 Tanner Lecturer

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.130
at the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.300
Sam, welcome back to Berkeley.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.760
- Thank you very much.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.250
I spent many happy years here,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.993
and it's wonderful to be back.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.870
- What can philosophy
contribute to public discourse?

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040
I know that in your work
you focus on public issues.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.640
What contribution do you
think philosophy makes

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.683
in that regard?

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.980
- It's always a very hard question

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.410
to answer about philosophy,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.290
what kind of contribution it makes.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.570
And I find that it generally works best

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.390
if you don't worry too much about it.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.740
Philosophy to me is in part
sort of a way of wondering

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.130
about the world, the way of
being curious about the world.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.290
And issues of public concern,
which have interested me,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.300
though they've not been
my exclusive interests,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.990
raise questions that
are deep and fascinating

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.650
and elicit sort of natural
philosophical curiosity.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.320
And so when philosophers
turn their attention

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.970
to issues of public concern,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.440
they contribute something,
a way of reflecting

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.580
to public discourse.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.230
And there's no telling what
effects it will have or when,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.160
and I think that the demand
that philosophy delivers

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.820
some specifiable results in the short term

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.670
is probably misplaced and unrealistic.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.870
I like to think that it enriches
the public conversation,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.193
but its effects are
gonna be unpredictable.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.120
- And part of what this is about

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.410
is really clarifying the issues,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.410
sort of mapping the terrain
to help people think?

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.970
- That's right.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.970
Philosophers are sensitive
to conceptual distinctions,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.340
to structures of argument as a matter

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.460
of sort of professional disposition.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.074
These are sorts of things that we

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:07.570
worry about and are attuned to.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.270
And I think in the modern age

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.980
now more than ever with sound bites

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.730
and media, food fights and a level

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.730
of public discourse that
is often not very edifying

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.867
it's especially useful to have someone

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:28.550
or some group of people
who wanna take the time

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.400
to contribute conceptual clarification

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.030
and demand some rigger
in the way arguments

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.080
are presented and so on,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.990
though that's, of course,
not all that philosophers do.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.910
- And central to this is
really about framing issues.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.530
Let's take a problem and look at it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.530
and see what the dimensions
of a problem are.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.110
- That's right.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.110
Often public issues in
particular someone will,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.910
a politician or some media figure

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.580
will frame an issue for
purposes of public debate

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.600
in a certain way.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.250
And a lot is driven by the
way it's initially framed.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.840
And if the way it's initially framed

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.410
is not especially helpful or illuminating

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.290
or it's possibly even
misleading in certain respects

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.930
that can exert an unfortunate influence

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.820
on the way the subsequent
conversation goes.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.820
- And what are the difficulties
of this process of framing?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.993
If you have an issue
that is controversial,

00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:44.147
what is the process like in laying out

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.134
the discourse in a way that reflects

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:53.203
the kinda insights of philosophy?

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.670
- Well, I think that a central
fact to be reckoned with

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:03.380
both in philosophy and in public life

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.930
is that the issues are
often extremely complicated.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.631
Philosophers, in their
professional conversations

00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.730
with one another, have
the luxury of taking

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.940
that complexity seriously.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.890
And so philosophical
debates amongst philosophers

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.890
often strike outsiders
as being extremely dense

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.623
and complicated and so on
and inaccessible often.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.800
When it comes to issues
of public concern, though,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.690
there's in a way the opposite problem;

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.770
that is, the issues are just as complex,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.850
what to do about problems
of climate change

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.770
or about the economic problems, so on.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.943
The issues are extremely complicated,

00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:53.883
but our public culture
demands simple formulations.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.200
And politicians or other
people who have a stake

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.560
in some policy orientation will often rush

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.700
to frame the issue in
a way that they think

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.610
will be to their advantage.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.890
Inevitably, they both
oversimplify the issues

00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:17.280
and often conceal the
interests that lie behind

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.240
that particular way of
oversimplifying the issues.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.430
So occasionally it can be useful for

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.610
I don't wanna oversell
the virtues of philosophy.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.950
Occasionally it can be useful
to have someone come along,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.400
it doesn't have to be a philosopher.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.650
It could be any thoughtful person really.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.000
And simply call attention to the fact

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.600
that the issues are being oversimplified,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.470
to the ways they are being oversimplified,

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.240
and to try to persuade
people to see things

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.500
in a slightly different way.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.010
- I like to ask my guests

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.060
what skills they think are involved

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.853
in the work that they do.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.570
So what is ideal training for somebody

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.420
who wants to do philosophy
and has to develop

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.693
a set of skills and what are those skills?

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.763
- Well, some of the skills are
fairly readily identifiable.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.350
Philosophy is a discipline that
demands a certain competence

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.350
in argument, in sensitivity
to structures of reasoning,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.900
in understanding what
counts as a reasoning

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.550
and what counts as a valid
argument and what doesn't.

00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:34.390
So an ability to engage in
critical thought more generally

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.390
and analytic thought is certainly
central to philosophical

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:42.610
training in all its forms.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.440
There's also philosophy is
a subject with a history,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.730
a very long history.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.143
And many of its problems have histories.

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:59.570
And it's important for
people who want to come

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.540
to understand philosophy
or to study it deeply

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.343
to learn something of its history.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.620
Questions can be framed for
the first time in the presence

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.700
but often they're
illuminated by understanding

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.990
the ways they've emerged and
the traditions of thought

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.040
that have grown up around them over time.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.840
So that's another important dimension

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.230
of philosophical thought.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.920
There's also a role,
though it's somewhat less

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.260
frequently commented upon,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.473
for the imagination in philosophy.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.240
Sometimes being a good philosopher

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.870
requires seeing things in different ways.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.540
And it's not just a matter
of analyzing an argument

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.740
or finding, detecting a
fallacy or remembering

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.537
what some great philosopher said

00:08:42.537 --> 00:08:45.087
and thinking about what he
or she might have meant.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.030
But it's a matter of
inviting people to see things

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.863
in a different way,

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.020
and that requires certain
kinds of imaginative skills,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.470
which are less easily taught.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.163
- So in philosophy is creativity,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.980
are there some features of
creativity in philosophy

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.100
that are distinctive or
is it the general problem

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.960
of creativity in all fields?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.120
- Well, it's a certain kind of creativity.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.190
It's not the kind of creativity

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.820
that a painter displays or a musician.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.270
But it certainly is creativity.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.560
And it's very difficult
to teach creativity.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.150
So some of the problems
or questions that arise

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.270
about the creative process certainly apply

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.620
to the best work in philosophy,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.560
the most original work,
which often involves

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.470
insight and imagination,
creating formulations

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.330
and ideas in ways of seeing things

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.420
that haven't occurred to others before.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.473
- What about a temperament?

00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:44.500
Are there qualities to the temperament

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.893
of a philosopher that are very important?

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.800
- Philosophers have as much variation

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.500
with respect to their temperaments

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.050
as any other group of people.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.920
There are some who are cool and reflective

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.523
and there are some who are sort of

00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:05.330
much more impetuous and intuitive.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.550
I think all philosophers have some respect

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.460
for the complexity of the issues
that they're dealing with.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.430
And if there's a common temperament really

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.590
it's a temperament, it's the
trait of being fascinated by

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.000
and responsive to the complexity
of philosophical issues.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.810
And a willingness to tolerate the fact

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.730
that philosophical questions
don't get answered decisively

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.710
on the whole, the deepest questions don't,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.110
in the way that a question in the natural

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.883
or social sciences might do.

00:10:41.688 --> 00:10:44.720
- So it sounds like there can
be a great deal of frustration

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.640
in the process of unraveling
philosophical puzzles?

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.880
- Absolutely.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.720
And certainly philosophy
is not a field for people

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.650
who want quick answers and
to make quick progress.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.680
Philosophers are still
arguing about things

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.680
that the Greeks were arguing
about thousands of years ago.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.910
- Talk a little about what
leads a philosopher like you

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.773
to particular problems.

00:11:13.675 --> 00:11:15.920
Is it your education,
your background, or what

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.920
that leads you to focus on some subset

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.060
of problems in philosophy?

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.360
- Well, that's an
interesting question, Harry.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.220
In a way, this is one
of the hardest things

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.620
that one has to learn as one goes on

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.960
and becomes an academic
probably in any field,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.780
but certainly in philosophy.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.260
When you first encounter
a subject like philosophy

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.540
as a student at the university typically

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.560
your teachers tell you
what the questions are.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.730
They give you assignments.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.470
They tell you paper topics
or set you exam questions.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.990
And so you don't have to worry about

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.690
what the questions or topics
are or what's interesting.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.930
Somebody tells you what's interesting.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.920
And then one day you get a
PhD and you're turned loose

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.260
on the world as a professional philosopher

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.520
if you're fortunate
enough to find employment.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.760
And then suddenly there's
nobody telling you

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.170
what the questions are anymore.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.860
You have to decide for
yourself what's interesting

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.700
and what's worth thinking about.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.700
Sometimes the ongoing discourse
among philosophers itself

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.770
will simply generate
questions that naturally exert

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.030
a fascination for you, given the things

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.960
you've been interested as a student,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.723
been interested as a student and so on.

00:12:32.723 --> 00:12:33.590
So there's a kind of
momentum that develops.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.200
One thing leads to another and so on.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.283
But increasingly as you go on,

00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:44.639
it's always a question,
what the next new topic

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.320
is going to be for you.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.400
You get tired of thinking about exactly

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.280
the same things all the time.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.360
And it's not a field like science

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.032
in which the field itself

00:12:55.032 --> 00:12:58.370
or at least this is a
non-scientist's perspective,

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.620
the field itself exerts
sufficient momentum

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.690
that's pretty clear to
people what the next

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.690
set of issues might be in a given field

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.410
that you want to explore.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.460
Philosophers, again, there's an element

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.330
of serendipity to it.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.560
Sometimes something
just pops into your head

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.990
as something that seems
curious or interesting

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.640
or fascinating and worth pursuing.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.570
And philosophers then have the luxury

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.010
of being able to follow their
ideas wherever they may lead.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.177
So it's a mix, I think,
of professional agendas

00:13:28.278 --> 00:13:31.010
that exert their own weight

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.575
and an element of
imaginative and serendipitous

00:13:35.575 --> 00:13:40.575
circumstance that leads one to
select a particular question.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.560
And then sometimes there are
issues in the wider culture

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.255
that simply suggest questions

00:13:46.255 --> 00:13:49.910
that haven't loomed as salient before

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.890
and philosophers or some
philosophers will take those up.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.260
- One of the topics that you have focused

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.780
on and that emerges in some
of the pieces that I read

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.780
your Tanner lectures and some
of the essays in your book

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.423
Equality and Tradition
is the notion of valuing.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.830
Just out of curiosity,
how does that example

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.380
fit in to what you describe
as to how you wound up-

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.380
how did you wind up focusing
on that particular problem?

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.090
- Well, over the years it seemed to me

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.680
that questions about the nature of value,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.170
but also questions about
what it is for a person

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.220
to value something kept cropping up

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.200
as I was thinking about other things.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.240
I was thinking, for example, about issues

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.890
to do with the kinds of obligations

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.140
that are generated by participation

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.663
in a personal relationship.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.330
On the one hand, most of us think that we

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.430
should treat all people decently

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.730
and that moral norms apply to

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.290
our treatment of people in general,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.850
strangers especially, was
well as people we know.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.683
But on the other hand,

00:15:03.683 --> 00:15:05.590
we feel we have special responsibilities

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.100
to close family members,
friends, and so on.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.940
And so there's a kind of a tension

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.577
between the norms that tell
us how to treat all people

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.541
and the norms that tell us we have special

00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:21.860
things we should do for
people we're close to.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.950
And this tension manifests
itself in our personal lives

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.190
and it also manifests itself politically.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.140
Tension between more
universalist and cosmopolitan

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.420
strands and political
thought on the one hand,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.090
and then more identity
based and community based

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.740
and nation based ways of
thinking on the other hand.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.880
And the more I thought about
those sorts of questions,

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.960
which I did for a number of years,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.680
the more I was led to ask

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.840
to think that a lot of
what seems to be the source

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.900
of our special responsibilities

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.510
toward family members
and friends and so on

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.980
seem to have to do with
the kind of significance

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.147
those relationships had for us

00:16:03.147 --> 00:16:05.190
and the ways in which we valued then

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.000
and what it meant to value
those personal relationships.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.820
So I began to wonder, and
that's just one example,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.970
but several different problems led me

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.830
in a similar sort of way to wonder a bit

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.560
about what exactly it
was to value something.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.240
I think in our culture now
there's a certain amount

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.050
of skepticism about valuing.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.450
People are skeptical about values.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.880
They're suspicious of values.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.400
People are more comfortable talking

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.140
about just desires and wants and so on.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.600
It's a discourse that our culture

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.810
seems more comfortable with.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.360
But I think valuing is very
central human attitude.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.230
I think we would be very different

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.220
and unrecognizable creatures
if we didn't value things

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.070
in addition to just wanting things.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.160
- In the essay that I read,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.160
you said about clarifying
the importance of this

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.797
by identifying the features
of what one values.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.560
Talk a little about that.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.500
Because you're telling us that

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.570
there are several features

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.769
and in understanding them
you can really understand

00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:15.300
better this problem of valuing.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.133
- Yeah.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.430
It's hard to clarify
the notion of valuing.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.770
And there's a tendency,

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.190
one natural thought is to
think that to value something

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.040
is just to want it a lot,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.830
to have a very strong desire for it

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.460
or to have a desire of
a certain kind for it.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.210
But that didn't seem to me quite right.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.290
Sometimes we strongly desire something

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.113
that we don't especially value.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.100
Another thought is that,
well, maybe valuing something

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.020
is just thinking it's a valuable thing.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.330
So if you think like some
painting is very valuable,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.880
maybe that means you value it.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.370
But that didn't seem quite right either

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.900
because it seemed possible to recognize

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.440
that something is valuable

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.440
without, in another sense,
valuing it yourself.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.400
So I was, in the end, led to the idea

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.870
that valuing is actually a kind

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.250
of complex syndrome of attitudes.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.830
It partly involves the belief

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.120
that whatever it is you value is valuable.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.022
But it also partly involves

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:13.900
being somehow emotionally
invested in the thing,

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.640
such that if something bad
happens to it you're upset

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.303
or if it flourishes you
are pleased and so on.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.310
The emotions in question will vary,

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.200
depending on what it is that you value,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.390
whether it's an institution
or a relationship

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.463
with a particular person
or an artifact and so on.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.700
Also the things we value generate reasons

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.210
for us to act in certain ways.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.980
If I claim to value, say,
my friendship with you

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.660
but I'm never led to do
anything on that basis,

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.770
if you call me up and say
you need help with something,

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.910
I said, well, sorry, not interested,

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.227
and if I keep doing that over time

00:18:53.227 --> 00:18:56.130
you would begin to think
that I wasn't being honest

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.790
or very self-aware if I claim
to value the friendship.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.800
If you value something,
then it gives you reasons

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.210
to act in a certain way.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.330
So I take valuing to be a
complex set of attitudes

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:12.320
involving beliefs about the
items, that it's valuable

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.263
or worthy or worthwhile.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.840
Dispositions to feel certain emotions

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.890
depending on how things
go with the valued item,

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.630
and also a tendency to see the valued item

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.330
as a source of reasons for
me to act in a certain way.

00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:29.298
- And this syndrome,

00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.230
these features, together really clarify,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.120
as you just said, everything
from your relations

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.470
to your colleagues to
your family, to a cause

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.490
that you might find very important.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.770
And I guess that in a modern society

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.930
the complexity of what we value

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.780
really multiplies.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.940
- Yes, absolutely.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.940
And the first step toward
making some progress

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.113
in this area is to recognize
that we do value things.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.130
The language of economics and
the language of the market

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.360
and the language of
marketing sometimes lead us

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.760
to believe that everything's
just another want

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.853
to which you can attach a price tag.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.537
And it's important to remember
and to recover our sense

00:20:23.537 --> 00:20:27.950
that certain things in life
are not things we just want,

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.360
they're things that matter to us,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.600
that are important to us,

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.290
that we value or care deeply about.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.330
And understanding that we
have a stake in some things

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.960
as opposed to others.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.190
And once you have that insight,

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.560
then you begin to see that
our values are actually

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.330
quite complicated and they
pull us in different directions

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.130
and that they need to be understood.

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:53.790
- As I thought about your essay on this

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.840
and what you're saying
in some of the essays

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.320
we'll discuss in a minute,

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.320
I was struck by really
one of the characteristics

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.900
of political conflict
today is there's so much

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.270
disagreement about what
different groups value.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.460
In other words, they value
things very strongly,

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.460
but as a political society
we're having difficulty

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.930
reconciling the different
groups to each other

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.960
with regard to what they value.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.793
- Absolutely.

00:21:27.793 --> 00:21:30.310
For a liberal society in particular

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:35.310
in a way the central
contemporary predicament

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.930
is the fact that such societies
are always pluralistic

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.310
with respect to values.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.760
People differ with respect
to their evaluative ideas

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.430
and commitments, their
moral, their philosophical,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.990
their religious outlooks and values.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.900
And that kind of disagreement
is not gonna go away

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.970
in a free society.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.531
The only way it can go
away or seem to go away

00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:03.531
is through the autocratic
use of state power.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.340
John Rawls, great late 20th
Century political philosopher,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.320
said that what he called the
fact of reasonable pluralism

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.850
was the fundamental fact
that liberal thinkers

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.640
had to come to terms
with in thinking about

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.330
how social institutions
should be structured.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.860
And it's obvious just from
five minutes' attention

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.710
to the newspaper that conflicts of value

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.660
and differences of value are a central

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.430
and enduring feature of our society.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.047
And if we wanna have a flourishing society

00:22:33.047 --> 00:22:35.407
we somehow have to figure out

00:22:35.407 --> 00:22:39.590
how to go on and how to function together

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.890
despite those enduring disagreements.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.930
And the further complication, of course,

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.410
is that any decision about
how we're gonna go on

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.630
is itself gonna have to
be based in some values.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.060
But since we disagree about values

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.720
it's quite difficult
to see how we can forge

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.300
a unified basis for
structuring our disagreements

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.190
and allowing one another
to pursue and respect

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.820
the different values that we have.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.390
- And that's really what
toleration is all about.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.390
- [Samuel] Indeed it is.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.080
- Learning to respect
the values of others.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.840
- Yes, toleration is itself a rich concept

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.900
and it's sometimes understood
exclusively as it were

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.293
as a kind of remedial value.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.900
We've got two warring sects

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.070
and after a few hundred
years of doing battle

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.980
and killing each other

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.450
they finally decide that
it's just too costly

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.050
and they might as well live and let live.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:37.010
And sort of better to get
along and to stop shooting

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.980
than to keep fighting forever.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.500
And so we tolerate one another
in a thin or a minimal sense

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.893
just when we decide not to fight.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.300
But toleration can also be
understood as a richer value,

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.240
a value which sees some affirmative worth

00:23:53.526 --> 00:23:55.410
to constructing a society on the basis

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.550
that we're going to actually accommodate

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.960
and encourage people to
lead lives in accordance

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.110
with the values and norms
that seem authoritative

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.780
to them so far as it's possible

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.430
to accommodate them all jointly

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.760
and that it's actually a
good way of living together

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.930
and not just a way of catching our breaths

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.420
in between battles.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.420
- It's interesting because I was reading

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.770
in this morning's paper
about the Koran burning

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:25.146
in Afghanistan, and that is a case where

00:24:25.146 --> 00:24:28.410
two different peoples
are coming at each other

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:33.410
with different traditions
and find it very difficult

00:24:33.944 --> 00:24:36.228
to comprehend the values of the other.

00:24:36.228 --> 00:24:38.910
And there seems to be
no organizing structure

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.310
to create the kind of
tolerance we're talking about

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.310
as you might have in a place

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.350
like the United States itself.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.856
- Right, and certainly
the context of a war

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:55.340
a war involving countries and groups

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.870
from very different religious and national

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.530
and cultural backgrounds is
not a very promising breeding

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.830
ground for breeding
structures of toleration,

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.170
which generally take a
very long time to emerge

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.600
and are somewhat precarious even under

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.460
the best of circumstances.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.630
But it's also interesting
in those kind of cases

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.050
those kind of cases,
unfortunate as they are,

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:19.050
remind us how important
values are in people's lives.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.280
You might think that what
people would get most

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.370
inflamed about were
conflicts over territory

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.050
or resources or something.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.130
But the things that really seem to provoke

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:34.310
the greatest fury and be
the hardest to control

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.030
or to manage or to get beyond

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.970
are things that outrage the values

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.070
and sensibilities that
offend against things

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.330
that a particular group holds dearest.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.410
- And interestingly enough,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.570
in thinking about the Koran burning,

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.130
as I did after I had read your essay,

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.520
that really all the
elements come into play,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.200
namely something is valuable

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.757
because of the tradition.

00:25:57.757 --> 00:26:01.650
There are strong emotions.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.470
And then people act on it in ways

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.680
that the other might feel is unreasonable

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.830
but those people feel
that it's very reasonable.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.663
- Sure.

00:26:13.418 --> 00:26:18.418
And people who commit
outrages like Koran burning

00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:26.000
give tacit testimony or recognition

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.510
to the importance of values

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.060
because they know that the way

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.710
to really insult and
offend and outrage someone

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.623
is to attack what they value most deeply.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.660
And so they don't just thwart

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.870
a significant desire that people have,

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.470
they attack the things that
really matter to people.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.760
- I read two of your essays,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.900
one on immigration and one on terrorism.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.150
It really struck me when
I put them in the context

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.540
of your lectures and this
discussion of valuing

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.730
that both were at heart really about that,

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.290
different context, so that for you

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:11.000
in this essay immigration really is about

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.810
learning to adjust what you value,

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.610
give it a new context.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.440
And here we're talking
about national identity

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.640
and the identity of the immigrant.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.960
Talk a little about that

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.950
because it's coming to terms with that,

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.460
which is very important politically

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.450
in the discussions that we're having now.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.470
- Yes, questions about
immigration are controversial

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.570
for many different reasons.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.210
But one of the reasons
they are controversial

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:45.080
is that depending on the
particular kind of immigration

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.100
that we're talking about
where people are coming from

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.380
and where they're heading,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.500
they often appear to involve

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.740
bringing into close proximity

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.920
people who previously
weren't in close proximity

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.780
and who have very different traditions,

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.743
values, attitudes, customs,
ways of life, and so on.

00:28:09.266 --> 00:28:13.130
And they do that under circumstances

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.413
where there's a lot of
often economic pressure.

00:28:20.114 --> 00:28:23.620
And so the stakes are
high, tensions are raised,

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.953
and what looks to be
happening is that you get a

00:28:25.953 --> 00:28:29.730
conflict between different cultures,

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.390
the culture of the host county,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.950
the culture of the
immigrant groups and so on.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.710
And those kinds of conflicts can

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.850
be very difficult and
dangerous to negotiate.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.690
One of the aims in the
essay that you referred to

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:47.690
was to enter a dissenting
note about the way

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.910
in which these issues
are sometimes framed.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.160
This is a case in which,

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.770
to go back to the issue you
raised at the very beginning,

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.220
it seemed to me that some of the ways

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.350
in which the discourse about immigration

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.813
and conflicts about
immigration have been framed

00:28:58.813 --> 00:29:00.893
have not been especially helpful.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.250
- And in a way it's the
interest groups on both sides,

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.070
that is the people in the homeland

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.333
and then the people who have come here.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:14.780
They fix on aspects of the problem

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.910
that really intensify the conflict.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.730
So for example you have in that essay

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.770
a very interesting discussion
of the multiple identities

00:29:24.928 --> 00:29:27.260
of a Jewish person from Eastern Europe

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.960
who came to the United States

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.960
and really his identity
is much more complex

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:40.730
as a result of who he was
back in his home country,

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.170
what he becomes as a
result of immigrating,

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.300
and what he becomes as
a result of settling

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.590
in the United States.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.760
- Yeah, one of the things
that seems to me misleading

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.620
about a lot of the
discourse about immigration

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.670
on all on all sides of the issue,

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.190
is that people frame it as a conflict

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.830
between the culture of the immigrants

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.890
and the culture of the host society

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.710
in a way that suggests that
everybody has a culture.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.100
You've got your culture,
I've got my culture.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.130
And then if I migrate from
my country to your country

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.861
we've got a problem
because I've got my culture

00:30:15.861 --> 00:30:18.067
but I'm in your county
and you've to your culture

00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:19.603
and what are we gonna do now?

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.750
You're used to just having
your culture in your country.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.740
And this whole way of talking and thinking

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.430
seems very natural.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.230
But it overlooks the fact that culture

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.960
is a kind of protean notion.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.170
People belong to many different groups

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.870
and have many different
kinds of allegiances,

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:40.870
regional, geographic, racial,
sexual, ethnic, professional,

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.783
identifications based on
their interests and so on.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.730
And different of these identifications

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.360
and different forms of group
affiliation are salient

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.253
for people in different contexts.

00:30:56.999 --> 00:30:59.240
If one person is from Mississippi

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.330
and another person is from New York

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.610
and they visit their respective states,

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.940
each may feel sort of culturally alien

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.730
in the other person's state.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:12.100
But if the two of them
meet in India or in Africa

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.923
they may feel like
they're cultural brothers.

00:31:17.195 --> 00:31:20.800
And that's just a way of saying
which culture you belong to

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.840
isn't a question that always
has a unique privileged answer.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.070
And that the recognition of that fact

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:32.170
is crucial to, I think,
seeing how we might solve

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.910
not only problems of
immigration or some of them,

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.460
but also other problems of
living in a diverse society.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.260
It's important to
remember that human beings

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.330
are socially extremely sophisticated

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.550
and we lead extremely complicated lives.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.087
We move in many different
circles and many different things

00:31:48.087 --> 00:31:50.180
and many different kinds
of people are important

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.750
to us in different contexts.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.980
We don't just have fixed cultures

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.870
that we acquire like a set
of luggage at a certain age

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.820
and then carry with us through life.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.820
We're always moving
around the social world

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.840
acquiring new affiliations,

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.530
and some of them are more salient

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.970
in some contexts than in others.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.970
- And really as you explicate
this problem in this way

00:32:18.387 --> 00:32:23.387
when the reader sees really
the dangers of politicization

00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:27.240
of these issues because

00:32:29.817 --> 00:32:34.460
the political discourse
often wants to fixate on

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.653
and make block and cement, so to speak,

00:32:39.656 --> 00:32:42.510
the one identity as opposed to the--

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.430
But really what it's all about

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:49.430
is learning to adjust your
values in these new contexts.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.370
- That's exactly right.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.400
That is the difficulty with the discourse

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.410
that I was alluding to
is that once you insist

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.600
on labeling people as belonging

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.283
to a certain culture and
that's their culture,

00:33:08.734 --> 00:33:12.640
then it locks them and
you into certain fixed

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.700
sorts of relationships.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.700
Whereas it's essential to being
a member of a free society

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.930
that one of the things you do is that you

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.840
acquire new identifications,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.650
and some you deepen and
some you perhaps shed

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.933
as you go through life.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.940
In circumstances of immigration

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.890
where people are uprooted from one place

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.570
and put down in another place

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:40.400
it's gonna have effects on everybody.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.320
Nobody's culture is
gonna remain unchanged.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.810
It's a new experience for
the person who's migrating

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.773
and it's a new experience for the person

00:33:48.773 --> 00:33:51.590
in the host society that
receives the migrant.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.143
Each now is going to have to come to terms

00:33:54.143 --> 00:33:56.680
with a new situation.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.580
And that doesn't mean on the one hand

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.710
that either side has to completely abandon

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.290
all of its previous
values, customs, and so on.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.780
That's preposterous.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.360
On the other hand, it does mean

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.210
that each of them is gonna
have to make some adjustments.

00:34:12.965 --> 00:34:16.300
And no sensible solution
to problems of immigration

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.840
can proceed on the basis which
denies those fairly obvious

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.400
and banal observations.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.790
And yet a lot of the discourse
would suggest otherwise.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.210
It would suggest that what we
have is some group of others

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.780
who come with their culture

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.640
and we've got our culture,
as if we were all the same

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.693
and belong to the same culture suddenly.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.970
Never mind that before the immigrants came

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:41.370
we were locked in a culture
war within our own country.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.750
So there's a vast oversimplification,

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.873
and its effects are almost
exclusively pernicious.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.670
- Another essay that I read,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.900
and again, what I'm trying to
do is just walk the audience

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.860
through just a few of the essays

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.540
of the many publications that you have

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:05.400
in order to reveal your way of thinking

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.429
and a philosopher's way of thinking.

00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:12.380
And I was interested in
your article on terrorism

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.070
because really in the end
that was identifying a goal

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:22.070
of terrorists that in
essence is about undermining

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:27.180
and destabilizing what we value basically.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.400
So in a way it's the same kind of problem.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.920
So what are terrorists up to

00:35:36.155 --> 00:35:40.010
and what are the implications
of that for society

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.430
and the social support for what we value?

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.900
- Well, this is another case in which

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.340
the framing discourse, it seems to me,

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.056
oversimplifies the issues in ways

00:35:53.056 --> 00:35:57.963
that obscure rather than
illuminate what's at stake.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.710
The very definition of
terrorism is itself now

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.383
a politically contested issue.

00:36:09.222 --> 00:36:11.352
Some people, the governments and states

00:36:11.352 --> 00:36:16.352
that are subject to
attack by insurgent groups

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.740
of one kind or another often
want to define terrorism

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.800
in such a way that it
applies to those groups

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.110
and only those groups
and others like them.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.310
On the other hand,
advocates for those groups

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.026
sometimes wanna say
that no, the terrorists

00:36:32.026 --> 00:36:34.360
are the governments that
they're fighting against.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.150
And so pretty soon the term "terrorism"

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.810
just becomes a political football

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.720
and we lose any sense of what might

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.993
be distinctive about terrorism.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.240
It struck me that when people

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.710
respond with horror and
outrage to terrorism

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.420
or to what they call terrorism

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.731
there is a certain kind
of central class of cases

00:36:59.731 --> 00:37:02.790
at any rate at which something,

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.690
there is something morally
distinctive going on

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.410
that so-called terrorist
activity is different

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:14.410
from other forms of even
quite horrible violence.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.700
Terrorist acts have
something special about them,

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.460
at least certain kinds of terrorist acts.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.110
So without trying to
enter into the questions

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.780
of what the best way
to define terrorism is

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.880
or to decide who
ultimately terrorists are,

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.760
I wanted to try to unearth this phenomenon

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.660
that we often, if not
uniformly, label with the term.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:40.090
And what seemed to me to be peculiar

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.670
to at least this class of
cases of terrorist activity

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.090
was that they tend to involve the use

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.963
of violence against civilians

00:37:55.157 --> 00:38:00.157
with the aim of causing fear
in lots of other people.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.130
The secondary targets, if you like.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.420
The primary targets might be
the victims of the violence,

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.923
the bomb attack or the
shooting or whatever it is.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.300
The secondary victims are
all the rest of the people

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.600
in the surrounding society
who become frightened

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.293
or alarmed by the terrorism.

00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:20.920
And a further aim of the terrorist is

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.100
that that fear should itself serve

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.000
to destabilize or to erode
the stability or security

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.860
of the society itself in
ways that will make it harder

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.940
for people to live the
lives that they wanna lead,

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.890
to erode their capacity
to lead valuable lives

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.161
or to pursue the things that they value

00:38:43.161 --> 00:38:45.140
in a secure situation.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.320
So there's this moral cascade

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.833
in these kinds of cases, which
I call the standard cases.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.880
The terrorist uses violence
against one set of people

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.090
to create fear in another set of people

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.920
with the aim of eroding or destabilizing

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.313
the structures of society more broadly.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.200
- Two things about this essay,

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.860
well, three things struck me.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.664
One is the clarity of laying
out this very controversial

00:39:12.664 --> 00:39:17.664
problem which had been,
discourse had really been

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.290
corrupted by the way the
Bush administration tried

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.853
to frame the issues.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.940
But one was the reference to Thomas Hobbes

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.850
and the philosophical tradition.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:34.850
And you quote from him about the eroding

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.420
destabilizing effect of fear.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.660
And I had forgotten the Leviathan

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.550
and it really was an amazing-

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:49.550
So this is a case where
going back to the philosophy

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:55.050
discipline and its leading
writers from the past

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.320
really explicates the problem.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.734
- That's right.

00:40:01.734 --> 00:40:04.210
Hobbes was, of all the great
writers of the tradition,

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:08.910
he's the one who most clearly emphasized

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:12.670
the potentially destabilizing
character of fear

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:17.670
and its capacity to unravel
an individual's personality

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.320
and to unravel the social order.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.530
And in a way, Hobbes made
the desire to avoid fear

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.510
central to his whole political philosophy.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.690
And it seemed to me that in that sense,

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.770
terrorists of the kind I'm talking about,

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.270
at any rate, are Hobbesians.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.647
That is to say, they, too,
appreciate the power of fear

00:40:36.647 --> 00:40:40.510
and they try to turn
it to their advantage.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.920
Incidentally, it's not only
terrorists who do that.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.920
Totalitarian governments also try

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.460
to exploit the power of fear.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.270
But they have, in a way, the
opposite purpose in mind.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:53.160
They wanna stabilize a kind
of corrupted social order.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.950
They want people to be afraid

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.483
so that they won't step out of line.

00:40:59.932 --> 00:41:02.583
And so fear is a very
potent political weapon.

00:41:05.683 --> 00:41:07.680
And it's used in different ways,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.730
both to destabilize certain
kinds of social orders

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.920
and to try to stabilize them.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.170
- And that was my other point,

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.140
which is that from the essay

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.730
emerges a very clear
picture of the difference

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.060
between terrorism and state terrorism.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.890
And in the public discourse

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.250
these terms are used very loosely.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.790
So one side says to the other,

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:35.090
oh, no, the state is using terrorism

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.250
and the state of course,
but this sort of clarifies

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.600
what the differences are.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.600
One is trying to undermine the order,

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.310
whereas the state is trying
to preserve the order.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.670
- Yeah, that's right, with
one small qualification.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.100
I don't want to deny that states, too,

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.130
can engage in terrorism in my sense.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.210
They may foment terrorist
activity in other countries,

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.840
for example, particularly cynical

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.250
and machiavellian government

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.160
might actually sponsor
terrorism in its own society

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.510
as a way of inviting, in a way of creating

00:42:12.675 --> 00:42:15.090
a demand for them to crack down.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.220
But the distinction I drew was between

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.440
what I call terrorism and state terror

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.620
as a different phenomenon.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.550
The phenomenon of using fear,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.780
which states can also do,

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.973
to try to stabilize the
order that they control.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.423
- Let's talk briefly about
your Tanner lectures.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.800
It's a very provocative, insightful

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.160
cut into the problem of valuing actually.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.740
What in your lectures do you
mean by the afterlife, please?

00:42:51.633 --> 00:42:53.500
- Well, the title of the
lectures is The Afterlife.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.330
But that's, of course, a bit of a tease.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.630
Because I'm not really
talking about the afterlife

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:59.060
as people traditionally think of it.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.600
I'm not talking about the idea

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:05.050
that you or I might survive
our own deaths in some form.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.510
That idea's, of course,
central to many religious

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.880
and philosophical traditions.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.890
But I was interested in a different idea

00:43:14.693 --> 00:43:16.300
and I chose the term "afterlife"

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.210
partly just to be provocative

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:20.060
but partly also to try to explore

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.020
the relative significance to us

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.757
of the traditional notion of the afterlife

00:43:23.757 --> 00:43:25.440
and this other idea of mine.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.230
The idea of the afterlife
I was concerned with

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.873
is the idea that other people
will live on after I die.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.909
So even if I don't
believe that I personally

00:43:34.909 --> 00:43:37.730
am going to heaven after life,

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:39.550
I do normally take it for granted

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.670
that other people are
gonna live on after I die.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.080
I rarely reflect seriously about it.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.680
It's not something that it occurs to me

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.760
to question very often.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.350
I just, of course, take it for granted

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.230
that others will live on.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.240
The lecture, however,

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.440
the lectures that I've
been giving this week

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.810
invite us to reflect a little bit

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.090
on the significance of
this assumption we make

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.597
that other people will
live on after we die,

00:44:06.597 --> 00:44:08.350
but that there will be what I call

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.900
a collective afterlife in that sense.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.100
Because I believe that it's
actually quite important to us

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.000
surprisingly perhaps, it
plays a very significant role

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.210
in our lives even though
we don't recognize it

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.240
or reflect about it very often.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.300
That if we didn't think
anyone was gonna live on

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.492
after we lived it would have great effects

00:44:27.492 --> 00:44:30.950
on how we live now, and in particular,

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.130
it would make us lose confidence

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.300
in the value of many of the activities

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.220
whose value we now take for granted.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.410
So in some sense, it's
extremely important to us

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.682
that life should go
on, the lives of others

00:44:42.682 --> 00:44:45.490
should go on after we die

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.129
if we are to lead lives of value now.

00:44:48.129 --> 00:44:50.700
Or at any rate, that's
the aim of the lecture

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.350
is to try to persuade
the audience of that.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:56.460
- And what I found fascinating is

00:44:59.214 --> 00:45:03.620
the lectures, in addition
to offering insight

00:45:04.682 --> 00:45:06.790
about the basis for what we value,

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:11.790
is also indicative of a line of inquiry

00:45:13.546 --> 00:45:15.590
in philosophical thinking.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:20.250
So that in posing this
counter-factual hopefully,

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.210
is it counter-factual?

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.083
- For now.

00:45:24.294 --> 00:45:26.460
- One, you really promote thinking

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:31.260
about the broader context
of which we value things.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.093
- That's right.

00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:39.250
I must say that one of the
central counter-factuals

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.090
that I organized the lectures around

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:44.360
is not original to me.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.190
It was taken from this
wonderful novel by P.D. James

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:48.270
called "Children of Men."

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.340
Some people might've read
the novel or seen the film

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.550
that was made in 2006 based on the novel,

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.150
though it's rather
different from the novel.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.749
But James asks us to imagine a world

00:45:59.749 --> 00:46:04.390
in which human beings
suddenly become infertile

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.270
or by the time the novel begins

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:08.240
they've been infertile for 25 years.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.773
So the thought is,

00:46:12.074 --> 00:46:16.880
although without giving any plot spoilers

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.370
I won't say more, but eventually
things change in the novel.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:21.500
But the expectation at
the beginning of the novel

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.030
is people are gonna die out.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.420
There are no new people being born.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.223
None have been born in 25 years.

00:46:28.996 --> 00:46:31.596
And the question is how
does that affect people now?

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.890
And although she doesn't
put it in quite this way

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.700
her speculation seemed to be

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.970
that it had a demoralizing
effect on people.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.460
That people just found it difficult

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:47.930
to be enthusiastic about
doing many of the things

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.010
that they've previously
valued most deeply.

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.630
Many of the activities that seemed to them

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.510
most important, most worthwhile

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.010
now seemed somehow pointless,

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.850
so they just lost confidence
in the value of pursuing them.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.333
And that seemed to me an
extremely striking idea.

00:47:05.858 --> 00:47:07.530
And I wanted to pursue it a little further

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:11.210
and to try to think about, first of all,

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:14.210
how far reaching those effects might be.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:15.730
And second of all, what does that say

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.070
about us and our values?

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.970
Isn't it an interesting
fact, if it is a fact,

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.940
that we would lose confidence in the value

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.480
of things we're now doing in our lives

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.690
if we thought that they weren't going

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.733
to be any people in the future?

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.300
One thing that's interesting about that,

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.810
a couple of things are
quite striking about it.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.500
One is that we don't
seem to lose confidence

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.030
in the value of our
activities just because

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.660
we know that we're gonna die.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.650
People know that they're gonna die

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.855
but they mind dying
partly because they have

00:47:44.855 --> 00:47:46.730
so many things that they value doing

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.200
and they wanna keep doing them.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.000
They don't think, gee, I'm
gonna die so nothing matters.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.690
They think, oh, how terrible
it is I'm gonna die,

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.650
among other reasons, because
there are all these things

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.770
that matter to me that
I'd like to be able to do

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.650
or to see through to completion or so on.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.290
So it's interesting to think

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:08.200
that the prospect that
human beings might die out

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.373
even after one died oneself,

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.570
could have a demoralizing
effect on one's capacity

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.950
to pursue one's values in this life.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:20.350
The other thing that's
interesting about this is

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.930
that these effects are produced on us

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.310
not because of our personal attachment

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:31.190
to any of these as yet unborn people.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:32.023
They're unborn.

00:48:32.023 --> 00:48:32.856
We don't know who they are.

00:48:32.856 --> 00:48:33.970
They have no identities.

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:37.900
And yet the fact that they
might not come into existence

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.580
seems to have a more profound effect on us

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.120
and our values than does the fact that we

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.820
ourselves are gonna die or even the people

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:49.160
we care most deeply about, the
fact that they're gonna die.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.350
None of those things seem to prevent us

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:55.440
from maintaining our
confidence in the value

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.730
of the activities that
seem valuable to us.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.220
But the thought that
unborn people in the future

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.740
might never come into existence,

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.920
that would strike us as
devastating and catastrophic.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.740
That seemed to me quite
an interesting insight.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.530
- And it's fascinating because
generally we think about,

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:14.700
if we're addressing the
problem of climate change,

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.310
for example, we say, oh, we wanna

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:22.730
the future generations
are dependent on us,

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:25.680
and therefore we wanna do
something about climate change.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.330
But the insight that you discover

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:33.264
is that in a way we are dependent on them,

00:49:33.264 --> 00:49:36.970
which is the reverse of
what we normally think.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.803
- That's right.

00:49:37.803 --> 00:49:41.870
The prevailing discourse
certainly within philosophy,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.127
but I think also in the wider culture

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:49.410
when it comes to thinking
about future generations

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:52.580
and the effects on future
generations of our behavior now,

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.720
whether it's with
respect to global warming

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.940
or having other destructive
effects on the environment

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.750
the prevailing discourse
is to think roughly

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.350
there's this class of people

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:05.050
who are gonna exist in the future.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.670
They have no power to
speak for themselves,

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.400
but they're very vulnerable to us.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.000
If we do stuff, we're gonna
make their lives miserable.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.640
We really ought to pay more
attention to that fact,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.800
that somehow we have an
obligation to protect

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.440
this vulnerable class of people,

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.560
the as yet nonexistent
people who will come

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.010
into existence in the future.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:33.353
And that makes it seem as if
this is a moral burden on us.

00:50:33.353 --> 00:50:35.510
It's something we should do, as it were,

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.380
one more set of moral obligations.

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.850
And it's sort of kind of like

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.636
we've got to eat our spinach and do right

00:50:43.636 --> 00:50:45.960
by future generations,

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.830
which doesn't seem very
successful, by the way,

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.980
in motivating most
people most of the time.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:54.320
But it seemed to me that
that discourse really

00:50:55.540 --> 00:51:00.470
obscured in some ways
the most salient feature

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.250
of our relations to future generations.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.270
Of course, they are dependent on us

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.380
in certain obvious ways,
causally dependent.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.610
If we pollute the water,
they'll have to deal with it.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:12.700
If we make the environment toxic,

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.700
that will have terrible effects on them.

00:51:18.846 --> 00:51:20.320
But a relation at least as important

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.670
or more important that runs
in the opposite direction.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:24.173
If they don't exist,

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:29.610
then what we're doing now
doesn't seem worthwhile.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.000
And so in a way we depend on them.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.050
And that's a very different kind of reason

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.400
for wanting to protect
them and their interests.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.660
Our capacity now to lead lives

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.530
that we see as valuable
depends on our confidence

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:47.760
that there will be people in the future.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.321
And so if we act in ways

00:51:50.321 --> 00:51:54.720
that give us reason to
lose that confidence,

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.810
then among other things

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:58.280
we're undermining our own ability to lead

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.330
valuable lives now.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:02.990
- Now superficially one might think

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:07.990
that what I value is related
to my property, for example,

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:14.720
and so therefore it's
a very individualistic,

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.850
egoistic kind of thing.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.130
But you're saying really
that what we value

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:25.130
really depends around not
only the people around us

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.500
but the people in the future.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:32.500
And so at the base of
valuing is recognizing

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.810
that what we value is
part of an ongoing history

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:40.660
which then allows us to value that thing.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:44.400
So it's not selfish and egoistic in a way.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.470
- Well, I think in a
way that this is a place

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:51.110
where the language of egoism and altruism

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.970
doesn't help us very much.

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.460
It's one of those dichotomies that tends

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.103
to oversimplify a complex reality.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.450
In terms of the content
of their current values,

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:03.536
people differ considerably.

00:53:03.536 --> 00:53:06.300
Some people have values that are

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.260
in one recognizable
sense sort of egoistic.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.720
They're focused on themselves

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.880
and their own satisfactions
and gratification.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.561
Other people have values that are

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:20.370
in the similar sense more social

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:21.540
or they're more oriented toward

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.280
helping people or helping society.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.230
So human beings vary in these respects.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:27.730
But what's interesting is that

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:33.730
what I take what I call
the afterlife conjecture

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.100
to suggest the fact that people would lose

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.939
confidence in their values
under those circumstances

00:53:38.939 --> 00:53:41.410
to suggest that even people whose values

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:44.200
strike us as in one sense fairly egoistic

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.150
would suddenly find if they thought

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:47.980
that human beings were about to die out,

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:50.750
that a lot of stuff that seemed to them

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:54.653
obviously worth doing no
longer seemed as worth doing.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:00.480
Would you really want to
build a real estate empire

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.625
as people were gradually fading out?

00:54:03.625 --> 00:54:05.010
(chuckle)

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:09.510
Would venture capitalists, entrepreneurs,

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.250
would they continue to feel as motivated

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.242
to do what they were doing

00:54:14.242 --> 00:54:19.242
if they thought that human life were going

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.740
to about to come to an end, for example?

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.409
So there are lots of different kinds

00:54:24.409 --> 00:54:27.760
of projects and activities that seem to me

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.000
to be threatened in the sense

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.180
that they would no longer
seem to make as much sense.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:37.750
I discuss everything
from a scientist trying

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:40.140
to cure cancer, people trying to work

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.343
to improve seismic safety in the Bay area,

00:54:46.162 --> 00:54:49.299
to creative artists or novelists

00:54:49.299 --> 00:54:51.830
who are writing, to the
work of philosophers.

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.500
Would I really feel
motivated to get up and write

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.440
my next article if I
thought that human beings

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.440
were about to disappear from the planet?

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.500
Not at all clear that I would.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.140
So that it's not just altruists

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.390
in one sense of the term,

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.250
but people across a broad array of values

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:12.650
who suddenly find that the things

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.910
that mattered most to
them no longer seemed

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.310
quite as significant.

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:18.863
And that suggests that even though

00:55:18.863 --> 00:55:22.330
some of us are more and
some of us are less egoistic

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.600
in one sense, we're all
rather less egoistic

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.700
than we might have
thought in another sense;

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.280
namely that we're much more dependent on

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.740
and vulnerable to
catastrophe befalling others

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.584
or befalling humanity as a whole

00:55:35.584 --> 00:55:37.960
than we are even to
our own personal debts.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.328
Because again, none of
the people in question

00:55:39.328 --> 00:55:40.810
would lose confidence in the value

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:41.920
of what they're doing
just because they know

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:42.753
that their mortal.

00:55:42.753 --> 00:55:43.690
We all know that we're mortal,

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.486
but we think it's important
to do what we're doing.

00:55:45.486 --> 00:55:47.640
But if we thought that the human race

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.940
were about to die out,

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:51.930
then even the egoists among us might find

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.610
that they no longer saw much point

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:54.900
in what they were doing.

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.020
And to the extent that that's true,

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.270
it suggests that they, too,

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.819
are more vulnerable
and dependent on others

00:56:01.819 --> 00:56:03.890
than we might have thought.

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:05.408
And one thing I take away from that

00:56:05.408 --> 00:56:08.910
is that the language
of egoism and altruism

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:11.022
doesn't describe very well the nature

00:56:11.022 --> 00:56:12.870
of the ways that human beings

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:14.520
are intertwined with one another.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.277
- One final question,

00:56:18.277 --> 00:56:21.040
and that relates to students

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.200
who might be watching the program.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.943
Do you have any suggestions or advice

00:56:24.943 --> 00:56:28.370
about how they should
prepare for the future

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:32.440
if they wanna follow a similar

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.776
or a comparable intellectual journey

00:56:34.776 --> 00:56:39.503
and engage in philosophical inquiring?

00:56:42.511 --> 00:56:46.460
- Well, I don't think that
I have any very original

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.840
or novel advice.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.770
It think for someone
who's entering the subject

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:57.660
the best thing to do is simply to follow

00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.173
the time-honored path of trying

00:57:00.173 --> 00:57:02.880
to learn about the
philosophical tradition,

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.303
to study its great works,

00:57:04.303 --> 00:57:08.820
to familiarize oneself
with the habits of thought

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:10.910
and to try to enter into
those habits of thought

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:14.080
as best one can with an
eye toward eventually

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.990
being able to pursue the
philosophical questions

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:19.330
that matter most to one.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.561
The one thing I would say

00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:23.620
and any philosopher would say this

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.130
is that philosophical education
can't be just passive.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:30.040
The description I just gave
might've made it sound that way.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.963
Go read the great philosophers,
study the great works.

00:57:36.347 --> 00:57:41.300
But from the earliest phase
of philosophical study,

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.460
philosophical education has to be active.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.740
You have to be reading these
things and learning about them,

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.260
but part of the way you learn about them

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.710
is by thinking about them,

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:50.560
by talking about them with other people,

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.451
by trying yourself to address
the philosophical questions

00:57:54.451 --> 00:57:56.910
to use your own intellectual resources

00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:58.970
as best you can to try to work out

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:00.630
what you think about certain questions.

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:02.220
And of course over time your answers

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.500
will become more
sophisticated and refined.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.070
It's not that on your first day

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.670
you're gonna produce a
publishable piece of work,

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:11.620
but rather, that really
the way to appreciate

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.050
philosophical issues and their complexity

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:18.690
is not only to read what
others have said about them

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:21.070
or to familiarize yourself
with the tradition,

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:23.680
but it's also a matter of yourself trying

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.770
to work it out so that
you run into the dead ends

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:28.670
and you see the difficulties that have led

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:30.400
the great philosophers to go this way

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.233
rather than that way

00:58:31.233 --> 00:58:32.830
or you see how the choice points

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:34.580
that have divided great philosophers

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:38.240
loom up and why people have
divided over certain issues.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.140
That's really crucial
to eventually becoming

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:43.530
an independent philosopher yourself.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:45.867
- Well, on that note,
Sam, thank you very much

00:58:45.867 --> 00:58:49.380
for coming back to Berkeley,
delivering the Tanner lectures,

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.390
and being a guest on our program.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.380
This was a very insightful

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.280
and revealing interview, thank you.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.080
- Thank you very much,
Harry, it's been a pleasure.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.240
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.413
for this Conversation with History.

00:59:03.629 --> 00:59:06.212
(upbeat music)
