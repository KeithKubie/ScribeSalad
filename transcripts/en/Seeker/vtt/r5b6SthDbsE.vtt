00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.600
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Toyota’s Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, Leave

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
your mark.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.180
Toyota, let’s go places.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.080
It's 2015, Hollywood prophecy says we should
have flying cars, and though we don't have

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:22.220
those… how about hydrogen cars?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.530
Fueling your car with hydrogen is weird.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.490
Hydrogen, number 1 on the periodic table.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.759
It's a powerful combustible element, it blew
up the Hindenburg after all!

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.610
But it's also part of water, and carbohydrates,
and so many other things in nature.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.430
The thing is… hydrogen is a lot of things,
and IN a lot of things, because it's a super

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.620
simple element; one proton, one electron and
it makes up SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT of the universe.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.390
Yeah, three quarters of everything is hydrogen.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.730
Hydrogen is used for food processing, petroleum
refining and in a variety of industrial applications.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.820
The U.S. already creates more than 9 million
metric tons of hydrogen annually!

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.470
So I say again, fueling your car with hydrogen
is weird, but not THAT weird.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.970
You've probably heard of hydrogen fuel cells,
they've been around for a while.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.540
They were first invented in 1839.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.800
They use oxygen and hydrogen to power a car
with no moving parts, and only emit clean

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.510
water vapor when burned.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.330
And according to many car companies, 2015
might be the year the rubber meets the road

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.110
for hydrogen as a fuel.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.530
When you think of creating hydrogen, you probably
think of this[a] but 95 percent of America's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.420
hydrogen is produced using natural gas steam
reformation.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.770
Factories use high temperatures and pressures
to break the natural gas into hydrogen (YAY!)

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.480
and carbon oxides (BOO!).

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.300
You can also make it using electrolysis -- essentially
running electricity through water to split

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.790
the hydrogen from the oxygen!

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.220
Two great things!

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.570
But something has to GENERATE that electricity,
and in the U.S., that's usually coal power.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.770
But if we used wind, or solar -- then we'd
be onto something.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.110
Once it's made, it has to be cooled and stored,
which uses MORE fossil fuel energy; and then

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.720
you have to ship it to pumping stations using
trucks and trains… you get it.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.910
The HYDROGEN is great, but we suck at making
it and moving it around.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.470
For now we're stuck making hydrogen using
fossil fuels, which might not be ideal, but

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.560
that could all change once hydrogen vehicles
get on the roads!

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.040
Why buy a hydrogen car if there's nowhere
to fill it up!

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.569
The government and private companies are partnering
to get fuel stations out there…

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.970
California has a goal in place to have more
than 15 percent of all cars in the state be

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.460
zero-emissions vehicles by 2025 -- and to
hit that goal they've pledged 200 million

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.310
dollars to build 100 more fueling stations
before then.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.840
There are already 10, though I don't imagine
they're very busy since there aren't too many

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.820
cars on the road yet, but that'll change soon
too.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.640
In tandem with this momentum, a bunch of auto
companies have pledged to release hydrogen

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.500
fuel cell cars this year, and with 100 more
stations coming too, filling them up should

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.670
be a cinch!

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.290
According to research from the University
of California Davis, those 100 stations should

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.240
be able to make fuel cell vehicles cost-competitive
with gasoline!

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.670
We'd like to take a second and give a shout
out to Toyota for supporting DNews.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.000
They were at CES this week and released their
patents for new fuel-cell technology, and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.320
revealed THEIR fuel cell car to the world,
the Mirai.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.870
They’re hoping these royalty-free patents
will spurn a hydrogen-fuel-based future and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.910
spent the last decade reducing the cost of
fuel cell production 95 percent.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.730
Have you ever seen a hydrogen fuel station?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:41.129
Would you want a 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.910
hydrogen car?
