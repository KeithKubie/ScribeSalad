1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,550
Okay Moron.
Addition to key ins in particular.

2
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:08,810
Today we're talking about Cyclo addition,
addition to make rings.

3
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:13,760
So we'll talk some more about epoxides
then owes analysis and how asset towels

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,300
play a role in ozone analysis.
And then we'll get on,

5
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:22,010
I hope to transition metal catalin
assists hydrogenation and polymers

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,090
polymerization.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,530
So we're talking and remember
it reaction without canes,

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,220
the reagents are called electrophilic,
but their nuclear fillic as well.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,150
And we've talked about these and at
the end last time we were talking about

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,153
epoxidation,

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,290
which we'll continue with now and then
about ozone analysis and about things

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,820
attached to metals, hydrogen attached to
metals and Al groups attached to metals.

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,080
Okay. So this is where we
were last time to remember.

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,520
There were a whole bunch of arrows we
drew happening all at the same time,

15
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:57,350
although not in perfect synchrony.

16
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:01,700
Some were a little more established at
the transition state than others. Now,

17
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,520
after class, uh, I was asked,

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,990
wouldn't it have been simpler to
abbreviate arrows is in textbooks.

19
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:12,800
So you don't draw quite as many
arrows. Uh, I didn't point this out,

20
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:15,170
but there was a reason
I drew so many arrows.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,360
You might imagine that you
could abbreviate it this
way, right? Which shows,

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,910
uh,
the electrons here forming a bond,

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,790
the electrons here going to
here to make a double bond.

24
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,280
This double bond coming down
here to make a single bond.

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,360
And this bond coming over here,
that accounts for all the electron pairs,

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,910
but it doesn't account for them properly.

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,100
And the reason it doesn't is some of
them are pie and some of them are sigma.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,520
So it can't be the same electron pair
that's being both pie in the plane of the

29
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:50,510
ring and sigma or sigma in the plane of
the ring and pie out of the plane of the

30
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:54,600
ring. So I accounted for the electrons
differently and drawing those, uh,

31
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,480
in drawing those arrows as to
which kind was doing what. Okay.

32
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:02,660
So at the very end, last time we
were talking about ethylene oxide,

33
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,340
how it was a big item of commerce,

34
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:09,341
20 million tons a year and $20 billion
because of the importance of ethylene

35
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,484
glycol.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,690
And then we were going to see
how you get ethylene glycol from,

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,190
from either base or acid.
Catallo assists with water, uh,

38
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,390
on ethylene oxide.
So let's start with base catallo assists.

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,260
Where's it going to attack Bowie?
What do you say?

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,660
Where will ooh minus
attack, uh, ethylene oxide.

41
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:34,160
What kind of reaction is going to happen?

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,193
Okay.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,590
Okay, so you want to take
off a proton, is that right?

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,133
Huh?

45
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,350
To attack a hydrogen so as
to remove a proton attack.

46
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,950
Sigma Star C h does that with the idea.
Now,

47
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:55,951
the problem with that is that the ANA
and you get is not at all a good an ion,

48
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,510
right? It's a carbon and iron. The

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,000
makes it better than most carbon and ions,
but not that much better.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,350
My guess is it's PKA is
someplace in the forties, right?

51
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:13,330
Whereas the PKA of o h minus
is, is, or of a water to give.

52
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,950
O h minus is, is, uh, is
16, right? 15 and a half.

53
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,160
So that there's a, a, whatever that is,

54
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,650
that 25 powers of 10 different.

55
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:27,490
So it's going to be very hard to pull
off a proton. Even though hydroxide,

56
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,770
you're right. Is A, is a strong base,

57
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,670
better as a base than what you'd
expect for its nuclear Felicity.

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,590
So how about another possibility if
it's not going to be ch Sigma Star,

59
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,490
what will at attack?

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,780
Oh, of course. Ethylene
oxide is an ether, right?

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,380
And ethers don't usually
undergo displacement because
it's a bad leaving group.

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,290
Right? Oh, minus is not a great
leaving group. Aurel minus.

63
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,590
But this is a special case.
Can you see why

64
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,460
anybody else got an idea? Yeah. Orphaned

65
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,530
high strain, right? We'll,
we'll make that bod week.

66
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,110
So in fact it is a backside attack,

67
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:18,060
an sn two reaction on the CEO Sigma Star,
right?

68
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,820
Which opens the ring
because of the ring strain

69
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,150
to give that. And now that of
course picks up a proton from water.

70
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,950
The PKS are essentially the same for an
alcohol and water and generates ethylene

71
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:35,130
glycol. The item of commerce
we were interested in making.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,360
Now suppose we're going to do it with
h plus Ketalysis who's got an idea for

73
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:43,570
that one?
Rahul,

74
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,100
you've got an idea how,
how's h plus

75
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,600
[inaudible]?

76
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,290
What about

77
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,123
the oxygen,

78
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,540
right? The lone pair on the
oxygen. Okay, so it'll come down,

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,790
tack the lone pair on
the oxygen to get this.

80
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,150
And now what do you expect for
the reactivity of this thing?

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,170
Rahul will keep us going,

82
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,211
right?

83
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,750
There's still ringing strain and you've
got a much better leaving group now. Oh.

84
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:18,530
Plus rather than, oh going
to become oh minus. Right?

85
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,490
So now even water can do,
it doesn't have to be hydroxide.

86
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,050
So we've got a great leaving group. Water
comes in and does the trick and again,

87
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,960
we get it. So either acid or
base catallo assists with water.

88
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,890
We'll convert a ethylene
oxide into ethylene glycol.

89
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,540
But there's another possibility for
a nucleophile in this system, right?

90
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,700
Which is this old minus,

91
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,323
right?

92
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,060
So you could imagine it coming down
there and doing the trick and now you get

93
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:52,260
another o minus that can attack again,
another o minus that could attack again.

94
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,180
So you can get a whole bunch of these ch
two ch, two o ch, two ch two o's strung.

95
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,040
So you can get up poly ether,
there can be, you know,

96
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,010
as few as three to call it poly.
Uh,

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,040
although often you'd call
that Alango meaning a few,

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,290
but up to 20,000 units or more
can be strung together that way.

99
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,970
And these things are big items in
commerce as solvents among other things.

100
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:21,971
There are also used in toothpaste and
in a paint ball and lots of different

101
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,630
applications. Okay. And
here's another application.

102
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:30,740
So you can take the trimmer, right? That's
three of the ch two O is put together.

103
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,930
Okay. And it's been treated with
potassium hydroxide to make the salt.

104
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,700
Right. And you could treat another
one of the alcohols with uh,

105
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,460
one of the agents to convert Oah
and to cl like thigh and chloride.

106
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,600
Right. And get a dichloride.
Can you see what I'm after here?

107
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,260
What kind of reactions I want to do Alan,

108
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,520
right. Sn Two. It's a Williamson
ethers synthesis, right?

109
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,540
R O minus reacting with RCL
to make a cc by or Osi bond.

110
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,840
And what's the product going to be? Right.
That's how he teen crown six has made.

111
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,130
And in fact,
this is what's called an org sin crap.

112
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,240
Org Sin is organic syntheses there.
Uh,

113
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,940
every year they put out
one of these volumes,

114
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,770
I'll pass around so you can look at them,

115
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,190
which have various interesting
preparations that have been,

116
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:34,370
uh, tested by, um,

117
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,670
by, uh, Kemp proposed by competent
chemists and tested by them,

118
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,980
right? To make sure they work
right. Here's another thing,

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,510
send it back the other way.
Okay.

120
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,280
So you can see each of these
has the order of 20 really good,

121
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,900
uh,
uh,

122
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,050
careful descriptions with lots of
information about exactly how you do it,

123
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:02,180
where you get the, where you get the, uh,

124
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,480
starting materials and
lots and lots of footnotes.

125
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,470
So textbooks don't have
time to do this, right? And,

126
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,090
and original publications in the paper
often haven't been carefully checked,

127
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,840
but if you want to see how our
reaction is really carried out,

128
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,790
this is a very good source and it tells
you exactly what faithful yields are,

129
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:27,410
not ones that have been exaggerated.
Okay. So then one of the orgs didn't,

130
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:29,840
perhaps is of a 18 crown six.

131
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,780
It's interesting and you
might think about that,

132
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,750
that they used the potassium salt,
right?

133
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:40,751
The potassium hydroxide was the
one they made the dye and ion with.

134
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,340
You might think why that
might be. Oh, actually,
incidentally, here I have the, uh,

135
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,460
if you click on that,
you will get a, this, uh,

136
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,030
which is the description
of how to make 18 crown six

137
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,190
on the web from org sin.
Okay? So that's how,

138
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:03,920
that's how we open
ethylene glycol. Now, uh,

139
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,300
notice that if the,

140
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,280
if the epoxide is unsymmetrical
substituted on one side and not the other,

141
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,720
then there are two different
ways of attacking. For
example, in the textbook, uh,

142
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,070
it shows that you could attack the less
substituted or the more substituted and

143
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:21,240
it says it acid,

144
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:25,320
the nucleophile generally becomes
attached to the more substituted carbon in

145
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:29,490
base. The nucleophile generally becomes
attached to the less substituted carbon.

146
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,750
So this is obviously a generality and
one would be interested in seeing precise

147
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:39,720
data to see just how selective it is.
All right,

148
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:44,700
so here's an example from the book
where they used a sodium amid.

149
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,300
So in three minuses,

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,320
the nucleophile and indeed here with the
anti and attacking it attacks the less

151
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:56,421
substituted as you would expect that
an sn two and gives a 41% yield of the

152
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,660
product from attacking the
less substituted carbon.

153
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,390
Now do you find that then
convincing in terms of uh,

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,480
what in acid you attack one and then base
you attack the other? No. What he say,

155
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,100
why?
Yeah.

156
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,780
Now of course you've been in lab and I
wouldn't be surprised if from time to

157
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,380
time you've been happy with a 41% yield,
right?

158
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,720
So if you really do get 41%,

159
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:30,960
remember we've talked about one
synthesis where 5% was plenty.

160
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,970
So from a point of view of preparative
being able to make this stuff 41% sounds

161
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:37,860
pretty good,
but if you're interested,

162
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:42,570
does it really support that generalization
that with base Catalin sis that is

163
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:46,440
anti and attacking you attack the less
substituted when you'd want to know what

164
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:51,210
the other 59% is, if the other 59%
were attacking the other carbon,

165
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,040
that would be bad news for this
generalization. Right? So, uh,

166
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,780
so one has to be careful in reading
textbooks because often references aren't

167
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:05,460
given right about that 41% so here's,

168
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,180
here's a, a generalization. It
says that, here's, here's the,

169
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,510
the other example with
acid catalin [inaudible].

170
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,780
So it says that when you attack with acid,

171
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:19,710
indeed the chloride goes more
on the more substituted carbon.

172
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:23,100
That's what the generalization was.
But notice that the,

173
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:27,030
that the product ratio is 55% to 45%.

174
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,550
It's not 99 to one.
Right?

175
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,330
And then explains it by saying charge
is the charges on the more substituted

176
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:38,700
carbon. That is when
you protonate the, Oh,

177
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,980
that bridge is unsymmetrical.

178
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:45,420
We've talked about that with more
charge on the more substituted carbon.

179
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:49,230
So that's the one that gets attacked.
That's where the nucleophile ads is.

180
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:54,160
It says, but notice that this is a
tough thing to generalize or not a very,

181
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:59,161
a reliable example to generalize with
the 55 to 45 because that ratio is 10 to

182
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,980
the 0.09.
Right?

183
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,780
Which means that the difference
in activation energy for
going one way and going

184
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,640
the other is,
uh,

185
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,470
at room temperature is
0.12 kilocalories per mole.

186
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,450
And you're a sophisticated enough by now
to know that that's nothing, you know,

187
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,280
that's, that's only what, uh, uh,

188
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,840
25th as big as a hydrogen bond.
Right?

189
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,740
So it's true that it gives more of the
more substituted one in this particular

190
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:33,820
case, but you wouldn't feel very
confident in, in interpreting that.

191
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:34,961
Okay.

192
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:39,961
So you might do a calculation to see
what the minimum energy geometry is for

193
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,900
such a protonated at Parkside.

194
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,910
This is not a really high quality a
calculation and it's in the gas phase.

195
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,890
And of course we're solving is,

196
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:54,880
could make a lot more difference
than 0.12 kilocalories per mole.

197
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:55,961
But anyhow,

198
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:59,680
you could look and see where positive
things would like to be or negative things

199
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:03,070
would like to be on the Vanderwall
surface of this molecule.

200
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,800
So if you look up here at the top,
remarkably enough,

201
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,150
if when you drew this structure,
you'd draw it. Oh, plus, right?

202
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:11,590
It's a trivalent oxygen.

203
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,500
It's been the o of the three
member during has been protonated.

204
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,300
So you'd draw Oh plus,

205
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,570
but notice that this is the energy of
Proton would have on the surface of that,

206
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,420
right?
It's high near the oxygen,

207
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,310
but it's 120 kilocalories
higher near the hydrogen.

208
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,980
That's the worst place
to put a positive charge.

209
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:37,180
So it's not what you would draw if you
just put a plus charge on the oxygen.

210
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:37,841
Right?

211
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:41,890
So that's the worst place for hope for
h plus it would be the best place for a

212
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,690
negatively charged nucleophile.

213
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,280
So the best thing would be to pull
the proton back off again. Right?

214
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,590
On the other hand,
you could,

215
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,430
if you turn the molecule upside down
from the top right and look at the bottom

216
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:59,050
of it, you see the two carbons that
could be attacked and at that place,

217
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:02,830
the energy for the Proton
would be plus 140 there.

218
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,180
It would be plus 141.5
so it doesn't really,

219
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:11,950
it's true that it's a little bit more
positive near the central part near the

220
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,920
more substituted carbon,
but not very much.

221
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,900
And of course it's
sterically hindered there.

222
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,490
So it seems to be very touchy
to try to interpret this.

223
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,750
But still there are many examples
where it is more dramatic than that.

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,750
Uh, here for example, uh, is our,

225
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,790
our cases were from the
textbook where the, uh, uh,

226
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,470
carbon nucleophile does the attack.
Now you notice that when the fennel,

227
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,740
uh, attached to copper attacks, so that,

228
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,360
so the polarization is such as the
fennel is mostly plus a, pardon me,

229
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,260
mostly minus.

230
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,530
So it's the nucleophile although it's
really more complicated cause the coppers

231
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:54,110
around at the same time,
but notice it,

232
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,640
it attacks backside and
it gives a 98% yield.

233
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,930
So that's the kind of thing when you see
it in the book that you can say, Aha,

234
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,670
that's really something 55 45 is not
the basis for confident interpretation.

235
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,370
98% is more like it.
Okay.

236
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:15,371
Or in this other example where it's
85 to eight attack at one comp at one

237
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:20,810
position versus the other with base
Catalin [inaudible] attacking is the

238
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:25,730
generalization had said at the more sub
at the less substituted carpet to give

239
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,290
the 85% product.

240
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,920
So there are plenty of examples
that support this generalization,

241
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:35,900
but it's not always reliable and it's
important to be critical in looking at the

242
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,760
evidence that people provide to
support their generalizations. Okay.

243
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,100
So that one shows stereo specificity.

244
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,200
The other one shows Riggio
specif specificity and much
more impressive than that.

245
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:51,470
55, 45 example, 85 to eight,

246
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,330
much more practical for synthesis
purposes and much more convincing for

247
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,750
interpretation purposes. Okay. So that,

248
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:04,490
that much for the epoxides uh,
now on to Ozu analysis,

249
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:08,510
which takes us into other examples of,
of Cyclo audition.

250
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,080
Of course, forming the UPPP oxide
is a three member of drinks.

251
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,570
So it is a cyclo audition
at forums a ring.

252
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,130
But ozone is more interesting
because it's three atoms, right?

253
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,850
So we can imagine this
shift of electron payers,

254
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,490
right?

255
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,390
Perhaps happening all at the same
time to make a five membered ring.

256
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,120
Right.
And on the left is the train,

257
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,210
the arrangement of those atoms in the
transition state as calculated by quantum

258
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,374
mechanics.

259
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,603
All right,

260
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,530
so we could look at the, at the, uh, uh,

261
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,530
at the motion along the reaction.
Coordinate both face on here.

262
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,350
Uh,
the side view as I said,

263
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,570
and also the end view and noticed that
the o three is bent so that the central

264
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,990
oxygen is not as near the,

265
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:03,030
at carbon's being attacked as
the terminal oxygens are. Okay.

266
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:06,510
So now watch and we'll watch it move.
So the oxygen's moved down,

267
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,760
the carbons move up and formed the bond.

268
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,250
We'll reverse it and go back
and forth several times.

269
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,700
So you can see it's another one of these
cases where it looks like the attacking

270
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,960
group is rotating down toward the
carbon is the carbon moves up.

271
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,150
Yeah.

272
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,270
Okay. So notice everything is
happening at the same time.

273
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:26,910
It's not that you form one
bond and then the other bond.

274
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,120
Yeah.

275
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,511
Okay.

276
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:33,500
So let's look at the orbitals that are
involved in making two new bonds at the

277
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,580
same time. So there must be two
electron pairs that are involved. Okay,

278
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:42,581
so there we have the Lumo
on o three and the Homo on,

279
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,290
uh, on ethylene. And you see,

280
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,890
remember that that central
carbon decentral oxygen up
on top is getting into the

281
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:52,020
act.
It's back behind the screen.

282
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,100
So you'll see the two reds of the lube
oil on top or in position to make good

283
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,860
overlap. And then give this, this, uh,

284
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,950
orbital at the transition stage,
which is the homo,

285
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,340
those overlapping with one
another to form, to be bonding.

286
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:08,280
That's one electron pair.
So that would account for one bond.

287
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,840
But by the same token, you have the Lumo
of the owl keyed on the bottom right,

288
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,750
interacting with the Homo
of o three up on top,

289
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,410
and those overlap well and give a,
the homo minus one.

290
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,410
So another pair of electrons get
stabilized as these atoms come together.

291
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,400
So two electron pairs get stabilized
to bonds are formed. Okay,

292
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,970
now this is psycholo edition of our
Lilly one three dipole to alkenes.

293
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,920
There are other examples besides ozone.

294
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,760
Now a one three dipole
is the thing like ozone.

295
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,680
You may remember that
in the third lecture,

296
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,450
way back at the beginning of the fall,

297
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,930
we talked about drawing
valence structures for ozone.

298
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,910
And the fact that it's not the lowest
energy structure is not a three membered

299
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,140
ring, but an open form, right? And
the interesting thing about this,

300
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,710
when you draw a Lewis structures,

301
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,980
you can't draw a structure that doesn't
have charges or free radicals on the

302
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:09,210
Adams, right? So those examples are shown
there. So these things are called one,

303
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,410
three dipoles,

304
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:15,060
there three atoms that row and all of the
structures you can draw or dive polar.

305
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,490
But those,
that's not the only example.

306
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,150
And here on the exam
from several years ago,

307
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,330
I asked a question saying heavy learned
that the elderly Pi system of o three

308
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:31,410
remember Al Lilies means three P orbitals
overlapping in a row. That's Ella, Lily.

309
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
And that's obviously the case with ozone.

310
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,450
So having learned that Al Lilly Pi System
of ozone forms to bonds at wants to,

311
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,820
an alkene has shown bottom right,
left there.

312
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,140
One might think to try the same thing
with the apparently analogous Boron

313
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,650
compound. I've not actually
confidence at that molecule exists,

314
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,680
but it might explain in terms of the
orbitals involved why this might not work.

315
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,070
It looks like the same thing.

316
00:19:56,071 --> 00:20:01,071
You have a one three dipole on the right
and we draw air curved arrows to make

317
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:02,040
the two new bonds.

318
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:06,600
We have one three dipole on the left and
we draw curved arrows to make the new

319
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:10,350
bonds. But why wouldn't the
one on the right work? Okay,

320
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:13,080
let's try to do a
theoretical analysis of that.

321
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,550
So here's ozone viewed from the top.
Now if we rotate it,

322
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,430
the central carbon at the central oxygen
at the top back to look to see the p

323
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:28,290
orbitals, we see that there are
three p orbitals in a row, right?

324
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,220
An Aloe Lake system, uh, so,

325
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,800
and the lowest energy Pi orbital.

326
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:38,070
Then we'll have them all overlapping
favorably with one another.

327
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,670
That will be psy one the
lowest energy Pi orbital.

328
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It has no anti-bonding node and the
middle atomic orbital will be largest it.

329
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,910
We can choose the size of the P
orbitals. On this of the three, right?

330
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,280
There's an advantage to making the one
that the sum of their squares has to be

331
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:00,550
one. Why do you call that
condition? I remember

332
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,260
that's normalization, right? That the PR,

333
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,960
the electron has to be somewhere with a
probability. Total probability of one.

334
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,300
So the sum of the squares has to be one,
but they don't have to be the same size.

335
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,040
Cemetery would suggest that the two
ends should be the same size. Right?

336
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,500
But the one in the middle
could be smaller or bigger.

337
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,840
And I say that it's a little bit bigger.
Why should it be bigger? Why should you,

338
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,750
why do you get advantage by
having the one in the middle?

339
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:33,520
Big compared to the ones at the end. If
there some, some of their squares is,

340
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,980
his lip is fixed.

341
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,880
What you want to get is bonding overlap,
right?

342
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,550
So the bigger the orbitals,
the more overlap.

343
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,940
What's special about the one in the
middle? Why do you want to make it bigger,

344
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,020
Lauren?
It's overlaps twice,

345
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,910
right? Good. Okay,

346
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,410
so then the next one has a node in
the middle that doesn't surprise you.

347
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,710
And the highest one has two nodes.

348
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,280
Now I'm confused by this because

349
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,161
it may,

350
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:16,600
in starting with three atomic orbitals
and making three molecular orbitals,

351
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,880
you have to use up to three
atomic orbitals. So they have to,

352
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,520
if you have more in one place,
there has to be less than someplace else.

353
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,410
Obviously there's none on
the middle oxygen in the,
in the one that has no node,

354
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,550
that means that the others have to have
more of that and less of what's on the

355
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:36,640
end. It doesn't appear
that way in this picture.

356
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,440
It doesn't appear that the central
one is big, but in fact it has to be,

357
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,750
and I think this is a,
this is some,

358
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:48,751
a artifact of the particular
contour that's been chosen and I,

359
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,820
I can't really explain it,
but in general,

360
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,400
the bonding one is as the
favorable inside one is,

361
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:59,800
is favorable as it can be big
in the middle. The, the, uh,

362
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,890
the second one with a node in
the middle is obviously 50,

363
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:07,891
50 on the two ends and the top one
will be big in the middle to be as anti

364
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:12,520
bonding as it can be. It's a, you know,
when they were good, they were very,

365
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:16,360
very good. And when they were
bad, they were horrid. Okay?

366
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,570
That's the way it works out.
Okay?

367
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:23,680
So those are the three or molecular
herbals we're going to be dealing with,

368
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,600
okay? Now if you take another ally
league system, like C H Two B, h,

369
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:33,580
c h to the one we were,
uh, talking about, right?

370
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,271
We can look at,

371
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:39,271
it's a p orbitals and there's
psy one and there's side too.

372
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,950
And there's cy three. And this one
does indeed show biggest in the middle.

373
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,300
So that's satisfying.
Of course,

374
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,440
Boron is less electronegative than carbon,
right?

375
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:52,700
Less nuclear charge.

376
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,920
So you'd expect the lowest orbital not
to have so much of it and the highest

377
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:02,210
orbital to have a lot of the
less favorable orbital. Okay?

378
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,490
And now if we look at a third example,
carbon eel oxide,

379
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,900
which you notice is, is uh,
uh, carbon eel compound,

380
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:15,890
h two CEO Formaldehyde
with an extra oxygen on it.

381
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,330
And that turns out also to be a one
three dipole to be bent in the structure

382
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:23,900
shown.
And now it's not symmetrical end to end.

383
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,120
So we see the same orbitals but
they're distorted. This one, uh,

384
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,830
this one looks mostly like
the c double bond o Pie,

385
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,390
but a little bit of the, of the,
uh, oxygen on the end, right?

386
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,840
That one has a node in it and that one
is mostly the anti-bonding Pi Star of

387
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:49,930
carbon steel with a little bit of
the oxygen on the end. Now, uh,

388
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,500
why should it be that way?

389
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,030
We'll notice that the carbon is much
closer to the central oxygen than the

390
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:59,510
central oxygen is to the terminal oxygen,
right?

391
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,560
So the big interaction will be
between carbon in the central oxygen.

392
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,053
So we could,

393
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,920
we could first look at the interaction
between carbon in the central oxygen and

394
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:14,840
then look at the interaction
of that whatever we get
from that with the terminal

395
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:15,830
oxygen,
because the,

396
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,400
we'll look at the strongest interaction
first and then at the weaker one.

397
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,010
So when we, uh, uh,

398
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,280
that says what I just said and it will
make a Pi and Pi star out of that.

399
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,550
And now we're going to mix p o the,

400
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:34,790
the terminal oxygen with Pi and Pi Star.
Okay.

401
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,160
And we see it's closer to CW
to the Pi than to the Pi Star.

402
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:43,760
So we'll get three new ones
that look like that. Okay.

403
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,380
There's less mixing at the
top, more mixing at the
bottom, a better energy match.

404
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,650
But cy one still looks mostly like
the lower energy would Pi CEO,

405
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,640
the Pi Star looks mostly like Pi,
star of CEO,

406
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,390
and this one looks mostly like
the terminal oxygen. Okay.

407
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:04,670
That's just to show that
the orbitals are reasonable.

408
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,350
So that's big on Pi and a little
bit of the terminal oxygen.

409
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,450
That's that one. Then you have one
that's mostly the terminal oxygen,

410
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,840
and then you have one
that's mostly Pi Star.

411
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,393
Good.

412
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,720
Now let's look at how many Pi
electrons we put in to these systems.

413
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,620
So we have to count electrons.
So here we have three oxygens there,

414
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,810
sigma bonds,

415
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,110
but also unpaired electrons that are
sigma in the plane of the three o's.

416
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,620
Right?

417
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,250
And there are also then if we count
up electrons on the terminal oxygen's,

418
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:48,600
there's one more electron on each of the
terminal oxygens and two on the central

419
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:53,340
oxygen. So they're four
electrons in the PI system,

420
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,320
right? So in these Pi orbitals,
we have to put in four electrons.

421
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,390
Okay? So that's two payers and they go
into the lowest two orbitals of course.

422
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,530
Okay. And the, so the homo
is the middle orbital,

423
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,450
the one with the node,
and the Lumo is the one with two nodes.

424
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,100
Okay.

425
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,510
Now suppose we're going to take
ozone and react it with an alkene.

426
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,303
Okay?

427
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,540
So we bring an alkene up and remember
it touches the two oxygens on the end.

428
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:27,060
The ones in front,
not the one that's behind the screen.

429
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,210
So that'll make a nice bond,
right? Nice bonding interaction.

430
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,570
So the,

431
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:38,571
the symmetry matches and we get
stabilization of one pair of electrons.

432
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,660
But if we take the
homo, uh, of the Alkene,

433
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,750
it mixes with the Lumo of the ozone.

434
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,960
So another pair of electrons
get stabilized that we
make to bonds at the same

435
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:54,030
time and make the five membered ring.
So that's fine.

436
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,310
And it's, and as I said here, don't
worry about the oxygen in the center.

437
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:03,980
It doesn't overlap because it's
behind the screen. Now let's look, um,

438
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,880
let's go over to look at the carbon
eel oxide and count its electron.

439
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:13,230
So that's the sigma electrons.
And in the pie there's one from carbon,

440
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,270
uh, one from oxygen and two from
the terminal oxygen. So again,

441
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:23,220
there are four electrons,
which means we're going to
occupy those two. And again,

442
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,060
uh, the homo is going to be the
one with one node and the Lumo,

443
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:30,240
the one with two nodes.
And when we bring the alkene up,

444
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,170
it's going to do it's trick. Okay?
So that's fine too. That'll form.

445
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,830
That'll form a five membered ring.
Now let's look at the other one.

446
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:42,060
The one that has boron in the center.
Okay, so that one made two bonds,

447
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,970
okay? Now the one with Boron in the
center has just those two Pi electrons.

448
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:51,300
The Boron is not contributing anything,
okay?

449
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,070
So we have only two Pi electrons and we
occupy only the lowest of these orbitals.

450
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,430
So it's the homo and the
middle one is the Lumo.

451
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,820
And now you see when you bring alkene in,

452
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:08,030
it doesn't do the same thing because
the homo of the alkene looks just like

453
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,740
this.
And they're repulsive with one another,

454
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,920
and the Lubo of the alkene
looks pretty much like this.

455
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:18,450
So it's homo with Homo Lumo with
Lumo to give overlap and nothing gets

456
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:23,160
stabilized. It's repulsive. Okay,
so that one won't do the trick,

457
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:23,791
right?

458
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:28,791
There is no alkene homo match with that
Lumo and no alkene Lumo match with that

459
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,040
Homo.
So the ones on the end,

460
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,710
we'll do cyclo auditions and
give a five membered ring,

461
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,240
but that one with Boron in the middle
won't because of how many Pi electrons it

462
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:40,074
has.

463
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,910
So you can't make two bond simultaneously
for Cyclo addition to the Alkene of

464
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,500
that hypothetical compound.

465
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,630
Are there any questions about
that? Let's see. Monitor ugly,

466
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,690
complicated,
then review it.

467
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,820
Okay, so let's look at what happens
then in the process of Ozu analysis.

468
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,440
Incidentally,
that name,

469
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,550
the license part means a
loosening or a breaking apart.

470
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,820
It seems a funny name, doesn't
it? For a Cyclo edition,

471
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:19,980
which is clearly bringing things together,

472
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,960
but you'll see in a second what
happens. It's pretty neat. Okay,

473
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:28,950
so we bring an alkene in and and make
those two new bonds by shifting the

474
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:33,690
orbitals as waste as we just
were describing. So we get
this five membered ring,

475
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,060
but this isn't so stable. Why
is it not stable? Boy Tech,

476
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:43,080
you've got an idea.
Yeah,

477
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,890
those oxygen,
two oxygen in a row of peroxide is bad.

478
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,950
Three oxygens in a row must be even worse.
What?

479
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:54,450
Remember what makes two oxygens in a
row bad hello in pairs repelling it.

480
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:59,100
In this case we've got this compound
is called a Moloz denied if you have to

481
00:30:59,101 --> 00:30:59,934
give it a name,

482
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,990
but it's unstable because of the
mixing of these homos with one another.

483
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:07,590
The unshared pairs, so that's
really bad. So it breaks apart.

484
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,920
Of course it could break
apart just the way it formed,

485
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,300
but in fact it breaks
apart a different way. It,

486
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,630
it draws these curved arrows,
right?

487
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,090
Which is the same kind of
thing we formed it with,

488
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,300
but we're breaking different
bonds from the one we formed.

489
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,690
We formed this bond and this bond and
now we're breaking this bond and this

490
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:32,564
bond.

491
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:33,910
Okay.

492
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,630
So it undergoes a reverse of the
previous process assess to give that.

493
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,530
So that's an Aldehyde plus this Carbonell
oxide that we saw in just the previous

494
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:46,090
slide,
a one three dipole.

495
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,650
But the carbon oxide could do a cycle
of addition so it could reverse this,

496
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,380
but it wouldn't because the
product would be unstable.

497
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,370
Do you see how to reverse it and make
the product more stable where you don't

498
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:58,990
have three oxygens in a row?

499
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,820
Anybody got an idea?

500
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,410
How did you make the Cyclo audition?

501
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:13,411
Go of the one three dipole to the double
bond and not have three oxygens in a

502
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:14,734
row.

503
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,553
Elisa

504
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,900
[inaudible],

505
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,490
uh, use what you just formed
instead of the three hours.

506
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,550
I'm not quite sure what you mean.

507
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,960
Do reacts the Ch two, Huh? We to see

508
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,830
h two with, oh, in other words,

509
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,220
you could turn that molecule over and now
do the Cyclo audition and you get this

510
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:52,540
for which only has two oxygens in a row.
And that's what,

511
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:57,430
that's the product that you actually
get by reacting. Uh, oh three with,

512
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,750
with the, uh, alkene
right now, this, this, uh,

513
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,640
[inaudible] denied as it's called.

514
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,450
Remember that first one with three options
in a row was called a mole was and I,

515
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:11,500
this one's called an ohs. Denied.
That's not so fantastically important,

516
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:14,590
but it's what they call them.
This is called this.

517
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:18,370
I call here a double asset towel.
Now,

518
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,330
an asset towel is a carbon
that has two oxygens on it,

519
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,900
right to ether oxygens.
So you've got that one,

520
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,930
but you also have that one. So
it's a double asset towel, right?

521
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,180
And as you can hydro hydrolyze
asset towels with acid.

522
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,230
So we're going to go through and figure
out the mechanism of that as another

523
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,090
practice in using curved arrows.

524
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,350
So Natalie, I want you to start
us with its acid catalyzed.

525
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,140
So what's going to be the very first step?

526
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,943
Okay,

527
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,140
Proton will attack and unshared
pair on the oxygen. Good. Okay.

528
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,630
Now what's our goal?
You know,

529
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,780
there'll be lots of different
things we can do as we go along,

530
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,390
but as we try to formulate a mechanism,

531
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,750
it's important to remember what
kind of thing we're trying to do.

532
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,670
And the kind of thing we're aiming toward
is to remove Aro and replace it with

533
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:30,970
Aho.
That's the goal of the first step.

534
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,780
So you've got to start it.
Well, we've take a proton,

535
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,550
come down and attack the
unshared pair and we got that.

536
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,490
Now what's the next step?
Not only can you help us some more

537
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,320
positive change.

538
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,240
Now the positive charge,
remember,

539
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,290
makes a homo makes
orbitals be high in energy,

540
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,480
but the positive charge is not, uh, is
not an orbital. It's just the charge.

541
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,850
What's the, what the, what
particular electrons would be or,

542
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,800
or what particular vacant orbital would
that be? We want a low vacant orbital.

543
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:17,210
The plus charge will lower
orbitals. What's the low
orbital that we're going for?

544
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,130
Yeah,

545
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,890
there is any Pi electrons in this?
No double bonds.

546
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,560
Sigma Star. So the Coo Sigma Star. Okay.

547
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,230
Right. So we can do this. Have you
ever seen a reaction like that before

548
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,220
where a leaving group leaves,
leaves a cad ion?

549
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,420
Anybody seen a reaction like
that, Alex? That's right.

550
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,800
That's right.

551
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,590
Sn One reaction right where
the leaving group leaves.

552
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:51,740
We made it a good leaving group by
putting the positive charge on there.

553
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,140
Now, uh, uh,

554
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,130
that's a primary cad ion,
right?

555
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:03,150
That doesn't look like a very
good candidate for sn one. Alex,

556
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:06,600
do you see any reason why sn one
might be feasible? Why that cat eye?

557
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,250
It might be better than you would imagine.

558
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,410
I could tell you a reason why it's bad.
Oxygen is electron withdrawing,

559
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,840
right? High nuclear charge. So
it tends not to let cat I form.

560
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,480
It pulls electrons. Right?
Why is that a good cat?

561
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,320
Anybody else got a suggestion?

562
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,290
Helen Jones or the Ade or
part? Debbie. The electrons.

563
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,093
The electrons.

564
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,570
The adjacent oxygen gets stabilized,
right?

565
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:43,420
The unshared pair on the
oxygen get stabilized.

566
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:47,500
We can draw that resident structure.
So it is an unusually stable cad ion.

567
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,630
Not because c plus a stable,

568
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:54,631
but because that low vacant orbital
stabilizes the oxygen electrons next door.

569
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,400
Okay, so we have, we got that cat on
and now we have it's hydrolysis, right?

570
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:05,401
So water is going to get into the act
form a new bond and we have this and we've

571
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:11,380
done what we wanted to do here. We're move
aro and replace it with oil. With with,

572
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:14,920
Ooh, of course we replaced it with
h two o but that's no problem.

573
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:18,910
We can lose the Proton to some,
uh, to another water molecule.

574
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,200
So we've done the first step here.
Hey,

575
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,370
we have what's called a half asset
towel, a hemi acid towel. Remember,

576
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:31,150
an asset towel had to our own
groups attached to ch two.

577
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,630
Now we only have one. The
other is Ohi, Hemi acid towel.

578
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,550
Now what do we call what?
This whole process here, if
you had to give it a name,

579
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,620
a mechanistic name, what
would you call it, Alex?

580
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,743
Sn One.

581
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,450
Okay,
so that's an sn one reaction.

582
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,780
And now the second goal is
to remove the second aro,

583
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:58,050
then a proton from o h and then we're
going to generate a double bond here.

584
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,480
We're going to get CEO double bond.

585
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,763
Okay,

586
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,570
so again, we have acid ketalysis. Where
are we going to attack for this purpose,

587
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:13,790
Roy? Right? Attack

588
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,320
we, that's the one we want to lose. So
we protonate there, right? Next step,

589
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:20,154
Roy,

590
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,500
right?

591
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,000
Lucasarts and other sn one kind of
thing, right? Where we make the cad ion.

592
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,770
And now what's the last step?

593
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,400
If we want to lose a pro
marijuana lose age too

594
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,640
from here, we just do it. Right.

595
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,693
Okay.

596
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,390
And what would you call that process?
The one that went from here to here,

597
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,960
if you had to give it a mechanistic name,
Roy.

598
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,753
That's evil,

599
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,620
right? Fort Formation of the cat.
So the process is he won. Okay,

600
00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:58,940
so that did it.
What we've done,

601
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:03,941
the overall transformation is to take
water plus and asset towel acid ketalysis

602
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,870
and get a carbon eel plus to our ohs,
right?

603
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:11,150
The one here and the one up there.

604
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:16,450
So we started with the asset towel and
water and the water comes across and we

605
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:19,970
get to alcohols and the Carbon Eel,
right?

606
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:24,260
Just by the sn one and
[inaudible] mechanisms that
we just worked through. Okay.

607
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,320
So that's how he,
that's how you hydrolyze an asset towel.

608
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,730
And here's an asset towel,
right? Ch Two has two o's in it,

609
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,260
so we can hydrolyze it or
we can hydrolyze that one.

610
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,470
We can hydrolyze both the one on the
right and the one on the left and you see

611
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:47,450
then what we've done. Now you see
the license part, the breaking apart.

612
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,000
What, what was the starting
material? What, where,

613
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:52,310
where were these carbons
in the starting material?

614
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,620
The very early before we added ozone,

615
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,840
the CC an Alkene,
the CC double bond.

616
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,790
What we've done is break the CC double
bond and make two c o double bonds.

617
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,780
So that's the license part. The
breaking apart. We change a CC,

618
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,180
double bonded to two c o double bonds.

619
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,470
But notice that a biproduct is
one of the byproducts is water.

620
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,070
The other one is hydrogen peroxide,

621
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,870
which is an oxidizing agent,
right?

622
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:26,740
So it gives two carbon EEOC
compounds and hydrogen peroxide.

623
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,070
But it turns out that hydrogen peroxide
oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids,

624
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,020
right?
So this is a problem.

625
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,580
So you don't just get
the two carbon heals.

626
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,930
You also have something that can react
with the Aldehyde the carbon eel.

627
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,090
So now as the book points out,
you can add any of your books.

628
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:52,640
We'll give this, uh, what
they're there to post.

629
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,820
Two ways you can cope with this problem.

630
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,970
One is if you want to make the Aldehyde,

631
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:03,340
put something else in that will react
with the hydrogen peroxide to get rid of

632
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:03,820
it.

633
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,200
So you use a reducing agent and we'll
talk shortly about oxidizing and reducing

634
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:12,520
agents, but things like uh,
dimethyl sulfide or zinc,

635
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,150
which destroys the hoh.

636
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,790
So the book now gives examples where
you see you could do this first,

637
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:21,850
treat it with ozone to get the Ozo died,

638
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,190
then treat it with water,

639
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,850
but with zinc to there in order
to reduce the hydrogen peroxide.

640
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,410
And now you've got the Aldehyde in 93%
that's the kind of yield that's really

641
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:34,940
convincing. Right? Okay.

642
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:39,440
Or here's another example where this one
is first Ozen ISED and then when it's

643
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:43,610
hydrolyzed is treated with the sulfur to
get rid of the hydrogen peroxide and it

644
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:47,470
gives us 75% yield of this
Aldehyde and also the,

645
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:51,770
the other one ch, two o from the
other side of the double bond. Okay.

646
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,050
The other possibility is just go with
the flow. If it's going to oxidize,

647
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:59,930
fine, put in more oxidizing agent. Right?

648
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,730
So there we use the dive methyl sulfide
and their zinc as reducing agents.

649
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,090
But if you add more of more
hydrogen peroxide as has done here,

650
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,960
then you can make the carboxylic acid
and reasonably good yield. Like this one,

651
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:19,430
for example, 85% yield.
Okay? So that's uh, uh,

652
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,520
that, those are the two
possibilities. With those analysis,

653
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:24,110
you break the CC double bond,

654
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,180
but the carbons can become either
carbon steels or carboxylic acids.

655
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,560
Now how does that happen?

656
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:38,770
How does the Aldehyde react with hydrogen
peroxide to give a carboxylic acid?

657
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,410
So let's try another mechanism here.
Derrick, you're going to start us in.

658
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,970
What's going to react with what here?
What's the home?

659
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,290
What's the little minus on the
ozone homo, the minus on the, Oh,

660
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,470
the homo and what's well this via
double like a two at the same time.

661
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,890
Uh, let's suppose we
aren't that sophisticated.

662
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,020
All right then c double bond.
O was the Lumo c double bond o Pi Stars.

663
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:13,530
A good example. Where would it
attack? Uh, see you, the uh,

664
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,950
take the seat TAC. Let's
see. Okay, so there we go.

665
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:24,900
That's going to give this. Now, can
you think of a second reaction, Matt?

666
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,010
Let's go to you. Gosh. All right,

667
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,900
well where do we have a homeowner? You
know, hold on. The had apparently. Oh,

668
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,220
okay. So here's the
homo. Where's the Lumo?

669
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,780
Lumo would be the o six sigma star.
Oh.

670
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:45,770
So we could do an sn two kinds
of reaction, right? Like that.

671
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,260
That's what you had in mind. Okay. And
it's going to form a three membered ring,

672
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,710
right? With two oxygens next to one
another. That's bad. That's not so great,

673
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,191
right?

674
00:43:57,191 --> 00:44:00,350
Cause the oxygen oxygen's a lot of strong
bond and the three member during is

675
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:02,900
going to be strained.
So that was a reasonable idea.

676
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:07,730
That's why I wrote it that way. But if
I had written it a different way, uh,

677
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,060
you know, this week, okay? And the
three, remember green is even worse.

678
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,390
So forget that.
So I'll write a different confirmation.

679
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,240
And now this is a neat reaction. Again,
we're going to use sigma star. Oh,

680
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,060
with Oah Levy group. It's a
weak bond. Oh, whoa. Right?

681
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,160
But now we're doing something else.

682
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,060
We're taking the electrons from
ch to be the attacking group.

683
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,240
So it's a,
it's a hydride shift.

684
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,030
And what pushes the hydride away,

685
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,120
what allows it to do that
is the fact that this,

686
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:43,320
these electrons can go in and form a
very strong CEO double bond at the same

687
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:47,040
time. Okay? And this will remind
you, if you think about it,

688
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,630
a little bit of another reaction.

689
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:53,631
We looked at this hydride shift
reminds you of this alcaide shift here.

690
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,070
Remember when you had B minus,

691
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,660
it was possible for these electrons
to displace the O in that.

692
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:05,460
Remember that's the second step of the
hydro bore ration oxidation process.

693
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,410
Okay? So it's the same
kind of reaction. Okay?

694
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,180
So it's a rearrangement and that
gives the the carboxylic acid.

695
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,680
But of course it also generates hydroxide,
which reacts with the carboxylic acid.

696
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,500
So that's the stable product
is the carboxylase and I.

697
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,970
Okay? So that's, that's why when you add,
when you have hydrogen peroxide there,

698
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,940
the Aldehyde becomes a carboxylic acid.

699
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,260
Now here's the problem for you to work on.
Uh,

700
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:41,040
try doing the same thing here.
We used base Catallo Isas.

701
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,230
Suppose it were acidic conditions and
you had to do it with the Siddiq Cadalli

702
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:49,290
basis. Could you draw a mechanism
that gets to the same place?

703
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:53,340
Of course it would be protonated if
it's a city of rather than basic.

704
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,480
But see if you can put
together a mechanism that's
acid catalyzed that does the

705
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:58,314
same thing.

706
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,233
Okay.

707
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,520
Now we've been talking about electrify
electrophilic additions to carbon carbon

708
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:09,114
double bonds.

709
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,860
We talked already last semester about
nuclear Philly condition to see o double

710
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:17,160
bonds, right? So nucleophile
versus electro file.

711
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,460
But remember that that the addition to
the carbon carbon double bond was both

712
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,700
electrophilic and nuclear Philly.

713
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,040
So it wouldn't be surprising if the
addition to the co double bond is both

714
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:32,850
nuclear fillic and electrophilic.
So let's just compare it.

715
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,770
Uh, so the nuclear family condition
of methyl lithium carbon eel group,

716
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,130
and we'll discuss this more when we
talking about the chemistry of carbon eel

717
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:45,840
groups is formally quite different
because you had electro files to alkenes.

718
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,430
But this cs shows you that there's really
quite a similarity. So here on top,

719
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,370
this is the transition state for
the addition of methyl lithium.

720
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:58,371
So the yellow or orange thing is lithium
and the ch three of course is methyl.

721
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,260
So that's it coming down on
top of Formaldehyde, right?

722
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,670
And that's the transition state.

723
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,200
So what's happening is we're changing
partners here with these electron payers,

724
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,830
right?
Going toward that product,

725
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:21,350
right? So we start with this methyl
lithium and the car and the carbon eel.

726
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,780
And there we have a homo,
which is the lithium carbon bond,

727
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,060
mostly won't carbon.
That doesn't surprise,

728
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,670
but notice that it's well
set up to interact with the
Pi Star of the carbon eel.

729
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,450
And by the same token,
here's Lumo plus one,

730
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:40,930
a p orbital on the lithium,
a vacant orbital,

731
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:45,400
which is well set up to overlap with
the red part of the homo. So again,

732
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:49,630
there are two electrons that do the
trick homo with Lumo Lumo with Homo,

733
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,080
and you get both things happening at once.

734
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,390
And we'll come back and
talk about that more.

735
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,690
But I just wanted to show you that it's
not a completely different thing from

736
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:02,620
the addition to alkenes.
Uh,

737
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,060
and now we're ready to
talk about, uh, metals. Uh,

738
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,350
let me just do a little bit
at the beginning and then
we'll go on next time to

739
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,280
talk about more.

740
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,640
So Osmium tetroxide or per manganese is
osmium or manganese minus in the center

741
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:24,340
of four oxygens. Right? And
notice that that looks like this,

742
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:29,020
like ozone, these three atoms in a
row above the two of the [inaudible].

743
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,150
So you could,

744
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,810
there's it's homo and it's well set
up to interact with the outcome,

745
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:38,560
uh, uh, Lumo and there's, it's Lumo,

746
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,330
which is well set up to act with
that Alkene Homo, although I've,

747
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,090
I seem to have messed up
the animation a little bit.

748
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,570
So here we can see it happening,
right?

749
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,550
It gives this osmotic Esther right now
notice it forums to bonds at the same

750
00:48:57,731 --> 00:48:58,091
time.

751
00:48:58,091 --> 00:49:03,091
It's like this one three dipole are cyclo
audition and that's the osmium analog

752
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:06,370
of that sick lake asset towel
that we looked at before.

753
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:11,730
So we can imagine water coming in and
breaking it apart to give a double bond to

754
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:13,720
o h groups.

755
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,750
So the product then from that Osmania
Ester of hydrolysis is the dial.

756
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,840
So you can make a carbon carbon double
bond break this Pi bond and put two o h

757
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:26,284
is on.

758
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:31,410
So Osmium tetroxide is a very good a
reagent for giving that in high yield.

759
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,500
In other respects,
it's not such a great reagent.

760
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,510
And we'll talk about that next time.
