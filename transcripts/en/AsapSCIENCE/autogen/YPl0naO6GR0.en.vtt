00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.799
 There are ... many famous food systems, so we thought we could make a simple video 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.339
 In which we investigate which is scientifically appropriate and already bear fruit. 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.760
 If we look at the issue from the outside, it will look like a simple equation: it determines your weight by balancing between 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.920
 The number of calories you enter for your body, and those that burn. By changing you to what you eat or 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.840
 If you change your activity rate, you can lead that equation towards weight gain or loss, 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240
 Which in turn leads us to the first class of those diets: 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.740
 Calorie compliance system. Some companies like Wet Watchers claim that you can eat whatever you like, 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.660
 As long as you do not exceed your limit of calories per day. Even getting all your calories from fast food is allowed, 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.000
 But in terms of health, it is important to keep in mind the nutritional value of foods as well. 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.400
 If you do not consider this, you are at risk of heart problems, lack of nutrients and other chronic health problems. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.280
 The reduction of calorie restriction systems with optimal nutrition or CRON diet in general calorie intake by about 20% 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.780
 While you continue to take daily nutritional requirements. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.740
 For example, instead of eating a full apple, the person who follows this system will only eat crusts. Which contain most nutrients. 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.180
 If used properly and overly, the limit system can be considered a safe and effective way to lose weight. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.800
 Next, a carbohydrate reduction system. Many diets suggest South Beach, Atkins, or Zone Diet 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.120
 Carbohydrates are the bitter enemy of that lean body that has long dreamed of. 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.540
 The idea lies behind the belief that when you analyze more carbohydrates and not burn the whole amount, the liver turns them into fat. 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.960
 But for most healthy and fairly active people, carbohydrates break down and are converted into glucosomal cells to provide them with energy, 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.180
 Very little of it is what converts to fat. 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.700
 In response to the excessive amount of glucose, the body uses an insulin to convert glucose into glycogen, which stores in the liver and muscle. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.380
 This glycogen can be used later in times of low glucose, to nourish the body. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.460
 But the type of carbohydrate you eat is really important - you get it from simple sugars like honey, fruit or sugar 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.340
 Easily converted to triglycerides or fat rather than converted to complex carbohydrates such as cereals and vegetables in general. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.320
 If you keep eating too much, and most calories are simple carbohydrates, they will turn into fat. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.650
 Carbohydrate reduction systems impose stringent controls at the beginning, so there are no carbohydrates such as bread or pasta, 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.900
 Nor sugars of fruit, or even of alcohol. 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.880
 This may lead to some obvious side effects that include constipation, dryness in the mouth, same unpleasant smell, fatigue, dizziness and nausea. 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.380
 Studies show that the followers of carbohydrate reduction systems tend to lose weight faster, in the early periods, compared 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.400
 With those who follow calorie restriction systems, but this is due to loss of water, 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.600
 Which later comes back in the late stages when you are supposed to eat normally. 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.960
 In addition, the Atkins diet, for example, encourages the intake of calories from high-fat sources and protein-rich sources, 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.400
 Which means meat, cheese, cream, butter and ... weight loss? 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.859
 Sounds great, does not it? But many doctors are worried about taking too much saturated fat - 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.400
 Those that lead to a 'bad' cholesterol and thus lead to an increased risk of heart disease. 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.220
 Others claim that these types of diets are dangerous and unhealthy, based on the fact that they support limiting foods 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.200
 Such as carrots, sweet potatoes, or apples, which in turn provide the body with micronutrients and vitamins. 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.440
 In contrast, people are required to take supplements, which the body can not absorb as efficiently as vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients in foods in general. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.780
 After that, there are also concentrated protein fevers. 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.460
 The basic principle is that protein-rich foods require more energy to digest, and are not broken by the body as easily as high-carbohydrate foods. 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.130
 This means you will not feel hungry quickly, and will be more portable 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.810
 To create a difference in calories (the number of calories burned greater than the number of calories used), compared to the same amount of calories from carbohydrates 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.140
 The Paleo diet as an example, tells us that 10 thousand years ago, agriculture appeared 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.300
 The human diet changes from systems that rely on fishing, meat eating, wild fruit, vegetables and walnuts to systems that contain more grains. 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.020
 As a result, some believe that the human body is not designed to digest such processed foods as grain, dairy, and bread. 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.560
 Some believe that pills lead to health problems associated with tumors, 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.840
 But this is far from the truth except in cases of digestive disorders. 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.100
 Because of the direct method of this system, you may find it easier to follow it, it encourages the absorption of more nutrients. 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.080
 However, because the Paleo system prevents all grains and legumes, we lose an important dietary fiber source to make our intestines work more gently. 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.200
 Needless to say, the concentrated protein leads to the production of nitrogen, which means foul gases! 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.560
 Add to that constipation, which allows digested substances to remain longer in the large intestine to remain decomposed and ... 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920
 Yeah. More harmful gases. 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.800
 Now there is another type of diet that we can call "just stop eating" 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.740
 Those looking for the phrase "get a sporty body fast" may be tempted to eat cabbage soup only for 7 days, 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.600
 Or follow the "comprehensive cleansing diet" that allows only to drink salt water in the morning and a mixture of water, maple extract, lemon and red pepper throughout the day, 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 And slimming tea in the evening. 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.020
 - But all these systems are very unhealthy. Not only because most of what you lose weight is the weight of water in your body, 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.340
 But because there are many side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, dryness and nausea. 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.160
 "Comprehensive Cleansing Diet" can lead to the phenomenon of white tongue, which some claim is the result of toxins leaving for your body, 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.360
 But in fact, the phenomenon is due to dry throat. 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.640
 After you go through all this, you will probably gain the weight you lose when you stop following the system. 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.820
 Then there are of course many crazy systems. 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.340
 Such as eating cotton balls soaked in soup or juice to give yourself a sense of satiety, which in turn does not provide any nutrients 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.400
 It can cause intestinal obstruction which may require surgical intervention. 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.040
 Or what about the beautiful sleeping system where you just sleep ... sleep? You can not eat if you're always asleep! 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.520
 In fact, most systems that rely on fast and dramatic results have the effect of "yo-yo" 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.240
 It burns the weight initially but also lowers your metabolism, so your body starts burning fewer calories. 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.920
 And when you go back to eating again ... you have your former weight to win again and even more! 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:40.140
 After pursuing the "Biggest Loser" program for six years - some of whom lost hundreds of Bonnets in 7 months - scientists have noticed something exciting. 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.720
 Not only did most of the study participants gain weight, 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:52.320
 But their rates of change have also changed. One of them is now burning less than the average of a person of 800 calories! 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.360
 After six years of leaving the program, this shows how those cruel methods of weight loss - despite their success at the time they follow - 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.100
 Carry a long-term effect on your metabolic rate, 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.540
 Making it difficult for you to control your weight in the future. 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:13.460
 The hard truth is that even with the use of organized diets, 97% of people regain everything they lost and more in 3 years. 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.580
 If you want to lose weight, it is important to find a system that works with you and keeps you enthusiastic, with simple, successive changes. 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.300
 Of course, the number on the balance does not determine the health of the person, 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:30.269
 Although there is much conflict over this perception. If you or someone you know has trouble eating or losing weight
