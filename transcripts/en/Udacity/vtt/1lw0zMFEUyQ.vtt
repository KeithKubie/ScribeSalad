00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.508
So, are IQ tests valid? That is, do they measure intelligence, or do they

00:00:04.508 --> 00:00:07.388
measure something else, such as a type of education you received, or how

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:12.362
wealthy your parents are? In fact, it's the question of validity that's

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:17.207
generated so much controversy regarding IQ tests. There are different types of

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:20.168
validity, but it all boils down to, does a test measure what it's supposed to

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:24.575
measure And also, does it predict the outcome it's supposed to predict?

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:28.610
&gt;&gt; Now, the key here is not to overstretch what you think an IQ test can tell you.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.640
Now, an IQ test does have pretty good predictive validity in some areas such as

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.934
academic success. So, it's good at telling you how good you'll do in different

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:40.300
academic domains but not general life success.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.130
&gt;&gt; That's right. So IQ tests are good at predicting school achievement. Or even

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.840
the type of college that one gets into. In fact, that's why Binet developed

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.981
intelligence testing back in the early 1900's. Interestingly, IQ tests can

00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:56.332
predict the general type of career one goes into. Whether that's law

00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:01.298
enforcement, accounting, or even construction. And it's also interesting to

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:04.958
note that IQ is related to longevity. With people with higher IQs living

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:05.700
longer.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.116
&gt;&gt; Now, when people use an IQ test to try to tell you different important life

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:12.476
outcomes like, being emotionally stable, generally happy, or having a

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:18.380
successful marriage, you don't see a relationship between IQ and these domains.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.389
So it's really important to limit what you think an IQ test is going to tell

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:22.379
you.
