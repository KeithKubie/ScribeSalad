00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:02.669
ROSS: So Ryan and I were

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.421
because we got a
really interesting lead

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.756
on a 1969 Cadillac Eldorato.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.425
Now this ain't just
any Eldorado, man.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.677
the seller claims that this
car was once customized

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.929
by famous customizer,
George Barris

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.931
of the Bat mobile customizing.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.933
I'm hoping that this thing
turns out to be true.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.768
Albert, nice to see you, man.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.270
Albert, Ryan.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.062
RYAN: Nice to meet you.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:22.021
So this is her.

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:22.814
This is her.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.232
ROSS: 69 Eldorado.

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.943
ALBERT: 69 Eldorado, El clasico.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:30.196
My understanding, it was owned
by the great George Barris,

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.115
the creator of the Bat mobile
and the Monsters mobile

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.325
and a whole bunch of other cars.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.453
RYAN: This is nuts.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.664
ROSS: George Barris is the
original king of customizers.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.542
His beautiful creations can be
seen in dozens of television

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.170
shows and movies, but
his most famous creation

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.047
is the Bat mobile,
a 1955 Lincoln

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:52.051
Futura that he transformed into
the Cape Crusaders cruiser.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.471
And his rides are still
sought after today.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.307
That's why if this is
truly a Barris creation,

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.893
I'll definitely be in
a buying state of mind.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.812
You know, obviously,
it's a significant vehicle.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:05.231
But she needs to
be completely done.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.816
And that's a big project.
ALBERT: Oh yeah, she's a beauty.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.067
That's a big--

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.861
That's definitely
a big undertaking.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.488
RYAN: Look at all these
handmade moldings.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:12.697
ROSS: Yeah.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:13.865
These are not coach
worked moldings.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.533
Someone hand made these.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.869
Here, all around the
back here, as well.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.204
This is all--

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.497
RYAN: That's all one piece.
ROSS: Yeah.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.415
You've got to love
the hood ornament.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.210
ALBERT: We call her the lady.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.711
ROSS: It's beautiful.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.380
The custom pieces that
were 100% George Barris,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.340
they're all here.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.049
ALBERT: They're complete.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:31.925
They're here.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:32.884
And it runs and drives?

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.093
Yeah, it runs and drives.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.178
Can we fire it
up and back it out?

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:35.970
ALBERT: Sure, go for it.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.888
ROSS: I love it.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.306
I love it.
All right.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.015
Here we go.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.892
[music playing]

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:58.701
Yeah, floor issues.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:01:59.702
Hand went right through it?

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:00.745
Yup.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.622
We got rust issues.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:06.292
It's an Eldorado that we
would normally run the hills.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.961
So right now the only
thing it has going

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.672
for it is it's George Barris.
- Right.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.714
RYAN: It's history.

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.299
It definitely is.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.634
It definitely is.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.815
ROSS: Now, what are
you asking on this car?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.233
45.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.152
ROSS: $4,500 bucks for a
beat up, rusted out, old

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.654
69 Cadillac Eldorado.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:35.822
Man, I wouldn't
even have to think

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.657
twice about passing on that.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.033
But I can tell you this, man.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:42.537
The markings and the
designs are 100% George

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.414
Barris design on this car.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.374
The guy who built
the Bat mobile, man.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:47.167
I'm torn.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.501
I really am.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.420
Is that your bottom
number on this car?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.463
Yeah.

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:55.133
RYAN: I was hoping it
was in better condition.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.342
Yeah.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.886
It's got its
pluses and minuses.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:58.761
It needs everything.

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.179
It's got to be redone.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.015
The pluses is all the
custom stuff is here.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.559
That's what makes it valuable.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.020
That's what makes it worth it.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.521
RYAN: Ross, this
one is all on you.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.735
I don't know, man.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.236
This is a decision I would not
want to make if I were you.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.952
Being a car guy, I
think you're being fair.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.330
And if you're being fair, then
I think the least I can do

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.956
is be fair right back.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:27.957
OK.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.500
I'll give you $4,500 for it.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.752
You just bought
yourself a Cadillac.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:31.836
ROSS: Done deal.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.129
Thank you very much.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.339
ALBERT: Thank you.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.798
We've got our
work cut out for us.

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.008
But it's going to be
worth it in the long run.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.135
You rock.
Thank you very, very much.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.637
ALBERT: A pleasure and an honor.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.555
ROSS: Later on today,
they're coming to get her.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.098
We're going to go back
and we're going to tell

00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:45.683
everybody what we've done.

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:46.643
What we've done?

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.685
ROSS: What we've done.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:49.062
I'm going to blame it on you.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.271
You're the one that
brought it to me today.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.606
I'm going to blame it on you.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.857
RYAN: Man, you're
killing the messenger.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.400
Catch you later, brother.
Let's go.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.401
Hit the dusty trail.
