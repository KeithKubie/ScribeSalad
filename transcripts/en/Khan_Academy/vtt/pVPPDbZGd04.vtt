00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.910
- [Instructor] Kylie
suspected that when people

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.890
exercise longer, their
body temperatures change.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.230
She randomly assigned
people to exercise for

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.540
30 or 60 minutes, then
measured their temperatures.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.340
The 18 people who exercised for 30 minutes

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.720
had a mean temperature,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.670
so this is the sample mean
for that sample of 18 folks,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.840
of 38.3 degrees Celsius,
with a standard deviation,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.180
this is a sample standard
deviation for those 18 folks,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.950
of 0.27 degrees Celsius.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.820
The 24 people who exercised 60 minutes

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.700
had a mean temperature
of 38.9 degrees Celsius,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.350
with a standard deviation,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.090
this is, once again, these
are both sample means

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.410
and sample standard deviations,
of 0.29 degrees Celsius.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.010
Assume that the conditions
for inference have been met,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.310
and that Kylie will use the
conservative degrees of freedom

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.490
from the smaller sample size.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.270
Which of the following is
a 90% confidence interval

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.130
for the difference in
mean body temperature

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.960
after exercising for
the two amounts of time?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.660
So pause this video, and see
if you can figure it out.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.250
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.620
So, in previous videos, we talked about

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.020
the general form of our
confidence interval,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.650
our t interval which we're going to use,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.390
because we're dealing with means,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.210
and we're dealing with
the differences in means.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.170
And so our t interval is
going to have the form:

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410
our difference between our sample means,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.740
so it could be the sample
mean for the 60 minute group

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.030
minus the sample mean
for the 30 minute group.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.010
Plus or minus our critical t value,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.050
times our estimate of
the sampling distribution

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.350
of the difference of the sample means.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.000
And that is going to be,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.840
I think I have enough space here to do it,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.340
that is going to be the
sample standard deviation

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.300
of the 60 minute group squared

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.940
over the sample size
of the 60 minute group,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.670
plus the sample standard deviation

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.930
of the 30 minute group squared

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.330
divided by the sample size
of the 30 minute group.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.460
And so, we can actually figure
out all of these things.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.900
So this is going to be equal to

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.840
the sample mean for the
60 minute group is 38.9,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.840
so it's 38.9 minus the sample
mean for the 30 minute group,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.790
which is 38.3.

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:18.518
38.3.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.500
Plus or minus our critical t value.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.190
Now how do we figure that out?

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.300
Well, we can use our 90% confidence level

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.867
that we care about, this
90% confidence interval,

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.410
but if we're looking
up things on a t table,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.520
we also need to know
our degrees of freedom.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.960
And it says here that Kylie will use

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.650
the conservative degrees of freedom.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.390
And that means that she will
look at each of those samples,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.320
so one has a sample size of 18,
one has a sample size of 24.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.410
Whichever is lower, she
will use one less than that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.480
as her degrees of freedom.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.230
18 is clearly lower than 24,
so the degrees of freedom

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.110
in this situation is
18, or are 18 minus one,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.290
so 17.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.910
And so using that and that,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.653
we can now look this up on a t table.

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:08.710
So our confidence level, 90%,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.540
and then our degrees of freedom,
17, so that is that row.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.573
The 90% confidence level is this column,

00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:21.303
and so that gives us our
critical t value of 1.74.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.320
So going back here, this is
going to be plus or minus 1.74

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.470
times the square root,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.650
times the square root.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.690
What's our sample standard deviation

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.980
for the 60 minute group?

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.963
Well, they give it right over here, 0.29,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.720
and we're gonna have to square that,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.520
divided by the sample size
for the 60 minute group,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.290
so let's see, the 24 people
who exercised for 60 minutes,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.610
so divided by 24.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.993
Plus the sample standard
deviation for the 30 minute group,

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.028
so that's 0.27,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.170
0.27 squared,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.940
divided by the sample size
for the 30 minute group,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.650
divided by 18.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.140
And we're done, and we can
look down at the choices.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.150
Let's see, they all got
the first part the same,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.623
'cause that's maybe the
most straightforward part.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.680
38.9 minus 38.3.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.450
Plus or minus 1.74, so both
of these are looking good,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.290
we can rule out these two 'cause they have

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.580
a different critical t value.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.770
Now let's see, we have
0.29 squared divided by 24

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.140
plus .027 squared divided by
18, this one is looking good.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.580
Over here, let's see, they mixed up...

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.370
they put the 30 minute sample size

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.470
with the sample standard
deviation of the 60 minute group,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.850
so that won't work.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.663
And so we like choice A.
