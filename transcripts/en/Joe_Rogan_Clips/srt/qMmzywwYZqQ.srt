1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,640
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,450
and I'm getting less.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,670
He carried a deer's out every
time I see that now be thinking,

4
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:06,600
how do you carry the deer,

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,681
nick?
If he did,

6
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:12,360
he'd never tell anybody he would have
Lyme disease and just run 150 miles and

7
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:16,500
still alive disease died out.
You man, he's a psycho II. You,

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,610
there's discipline and then this is what
that guy has. And this guy too though.

9
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:23,400
Y'all Goggins he's another one man.
He's another one.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,290
It's like these guys that like,
they,

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,460
they exhibit this next level toughness
that makes you reexamine what you're

12
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,210
doing.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,270
Like you think you tough and then you
find out what Goggins what do we say?

14
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:37,350
He'd ran like 28 100
fucking mile runs in a row.

15
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,740
Something insane like that.
More than once. A lot. Why?

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,870
Because when you run over two miles,

17
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:47,550
I'll look like why I get a text message
from Goggins say stay hard, motherfucker.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,050
This is, I'm checking in on
you right now. Can you see,

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,940
you see [inaudible] you hear them yelling
in the texts. Have you seen the, um,

20
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,990
can we go, uh, Netflix losers? No, I
haven't. Oh look it up. It's one on there.

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,920
Uh, the guy called lost in the desert.
It's a guy who runs, that's a desert ruin.

22
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,860
They do carry on what country? But he'd
go out there and he was just so mad,

23
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,700
so obsessed with winning like thousands
of people running through the desert.

24
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:12,190
But it's, of course they have
to follow when the wind get bad.

25
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:15,130
They got checking ins and whatnot they
supposed to follow and he said he was so

26
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:16,300
obsessed,
like he wasn't checking.

27
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:19,180
He was like trying to take shortcuts
and like if I go this way, I'll find it.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,200
He ended up going off the course and when
it cleared up, he was way off course.

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,390
But he was so obsessed.
I still gotta finish.

30
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,480
He was out there for like five or
something. Five or six days. Yeah.

31
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,400
And that's talking about how they
announced to his family, told his family,

32
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,850
your husband's dead. We
can't find you. Find them.

33
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:35,530
They had helicopters
going all over the place.

34
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,650
He went to the point where he
starts drinking his own piss.

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,480
He found his cave was full of
Battlestar [inaudible] ripping his off,

36
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,410
mixing them up the trigger
to survive, drinking the Batu
strategies, mixing it up,

37
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,660
and he like, at one point I
heard the helicopter coming over.

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,230
He took all his clothes, all his
geared, dug a hole and set it on fire,

39
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:52,300
hoping they would see
him at the fire one up.

40
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:55,720
The wind blew it out so he didn't get
sick. So he out there with no gear,

41
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:58,240
no nothing in the middle of nowhere.
He's a vile.

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,170
He ended up getting back in his mind.
He's everybody left.

43
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,700
He said when he got there,
the checkpoint was gone,

44
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:07,530
but his friend had flew back to find them
and sure enough his friend was there,

45
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,960
found them in a desert. Yeah, it's called.

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,370
Those are the documents
called losers here.

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,330
Losers in the episode is lost in
the desert. The whole show is good.

48
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,360
All the little things on it was good,
but that lost in the desert.

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,800
He ended up divorcing.

50
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:24,820
His wife was wife left him because
after that he still went back.

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,060
He came home and she was like, you're not
going back. And like, I'm doing it again.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,540
I have to finish and now he still does.
He divorced his wife.

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,660
His wife left when his wife left
him because you've got a family.

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,000
When she left and he left, she was
mad like, what about your family?

55
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,180
People die on this. What
happened? He's like, don't worry.
This is miss. I love this.

56
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,340
I have to do it.
When he came back and his wife was like,

57
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:45,550
we're not doing it again. He was like,
yes, I am like you. Just as on like,

58
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,590
he was pretty much dead.
They put him in the hospital.

59
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:51,910
They found them and everything. She
ended up doing again. Mauro prosperity.

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,710
Wow.

61
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,260
The survival story of moral
Prospera disoriented after a turns.

62
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,470
Sahara desert does.

63
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:04,030
Italian ultra marathon runner
walk nearly 200 miles to safety,

64
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,480
but he's Italian. He's probably
going to get divorced anyway. Hey,

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,480
what am I gonna go?

66
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,020
Well was it was fucking guys
are animals. Yeah. You see it.

67
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:18,840
You're going to be like, I have to. I want
you to direct DME after you watched it.

68
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,120
I'll see it. When he ate the badges, I was
like that. I was just kill myself there.

69
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,170
I'm not like, he was really biting their
heads off. Just any dark, no light.

70
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,500
He could. He was feeling phone.
He can see the odd, he gra

71
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,240
he was survive. Kate, what kind
of diarrhea did that guy have? Oh,

72
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,710
kill drinking. Dot. Even killed. He
tried to kill this stuff actually,

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,420
but he was so dehydrated.

74
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,870
He cut his wrist because they had the
last thing he cut his wrists with and went

75
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,690
to bed hoping he's going to wait,
like not wake up debt and he woke up.

76
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,160
He was like, what in the world? He said,

77
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,750
and that was my sign that
I wasn't supposed to die.

78
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,700
He said when he got the house,
when he saw his Bris,

79
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:56,900
they said you were to die dehydrated
to believe. So he didn't have anything.

80
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,830
He couldn't believe he's healed Jesus
Christ. That was it. He was, while he's,

81
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,950
I felt myself fainting. I
just kept telling myself,
I'm here. I have to make it.

82
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,540
I have to make it and I have to make it,

83
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,880
and he said he finally like he see like
some girl walking out in the desert.

84
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,050
He started walking away. She was
going and then the army, whatever,

85
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,410
wherever they was at the army had to
come get him and they got guns and shit.

86
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:17,660
You think he's going to die? Ended up
taking him to the house. When he woke up,

87
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:20,120
he had ivs and everything and they were
covering him and took him back to his

88
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:23,300
family. It's a crazy story.
I mean all of them was good,

89
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:25,820
but that was my brother calling
me. Like, watch that Bro.

90
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,570
You got a mentality like that.
You ought to fucking man washed

91
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,430
that two days and he stumbled into an
abandoned Muslim shrine where he noticed

92
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,050
some bats huddled together.
Prosperity, grabbed a handful of them,

93
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:42,470
cut off their heads with a knife and
then sucked out their insides to drink

94
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:43,880
their blood and quenching thirst.

95
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,980
Eventually he did his Vampire Act on 20
bats when another three days pass with

96
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:52,220
no signs of rescue.
He slit his wrists and waited to die,

97
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:56,090
but his blood thick and due to
dehydration so it wouldn't drain out.

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,310
Fuck man.

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,920
Like that's some Goggins and county to
get together and do a podcast and talking

100
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,490
about that,
like that was,

101
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,980
they wouldn't have cut their wrist

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,140
[inaudible] killed himself.

103
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,910
It would have just kept going.
I think those,

104
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,570
those kinds of people is ultra
marathon people. It's a different,

105
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,440
different breed of human. You know,
they, it's like everything has,

106
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,510
there's levels right to everything.
There's levels you, you've,

107
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:28,200
you've experienced it in your
own life where you tough adopt,

108
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,910
it became a stronger person, a harder
person. And then there's levels past that.

109
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:32,870
And then there's levels past that.

110
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:35,570
And especially for people
that have one solitary thing,

111
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:40,130
they do like ultra marathons there, all
the skinny dudes who can just keep going,

112
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,500
keep going. It's just, it's,
it's the, the pulling it off the,

113
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:49,550
crossing the line and knowing that
you did something that seemed almost

114
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:52,670
impossible. So, so titanic, Lee,

115
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,740
epically difficult to do that. So few
people can ever do it. When they do,

116
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,180
they're talking about running a 500 mile
race now cause they did the Moab to 30

117
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:05,540
and they had the big foot 200 they'll all
these people that are putting on these

118
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,500
races, they were like, okay,

119
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,890
we could do to 40 let's see if we can do
500 so now they're talking about doing

120
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,420
a 500 mile race.

121
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,310
It's next level.

122
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,060
It was hard for me to run a five K I
hearing when you're a big fellow too.

123
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,900
I mean I could do it,

124
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,500
but I did in college and I've never ran
like nothing calculated like you had to

125
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:26,310
pay do again. It was like a charity we
had to do for college. Nope. Never again.

126
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
Have you ever thought about
doing something like that?

127
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:30,450
Like I'm gonna go around from
five k I ain't going to pay.

128
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,330
It's like going Scott,

129
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,650
I want my jump out of a perfectly
good plane to go on the ground play,

130
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,930
pay to run a five k like
what did the organizing it?

131
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,740
I guess most of them I go to foundations
and stuff like that. But even then,

132
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:47,570
like you heard about the foundation that
taking money and what you do hear about

133
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,700
paying no punting something books
to go run 13.1 miles. Right. Cool.

134
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,850
People, it's more the fact that I can say
I did it. I can see I did it on my own.

135
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,230
I run 13.1 miles and not check my
phone. 13 miles. We're good. Yeah,

136
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm home.
