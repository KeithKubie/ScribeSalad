from the past forward but the need to
keep going what is that arc like that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840
keep going what is that arc like that
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.710
keep going what is that arc like that
trajectory why do we all have a sense

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
trajectory why do we all have a sense
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.930
trajectory why do we all have a sense
that the whole thing is being pulled

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940
that the whole thing is being pulled
 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.210
that the whole thing is being pulled
forward not quickly enough we probably

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
forward not quickly enough we probably
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.140
forward not quickly enough we probably
