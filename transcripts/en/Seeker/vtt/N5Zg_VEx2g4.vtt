00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.029
Taxpayers around the world are giving fossil
fuel producers 5 TRILLION dollars in free

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.029
money…

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.029
every.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.029
Year.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.020
That’s as much as the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars put together.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.090
This is based on a new study by the International
Monetary Fund, that estimated the amount of

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.980
the subsidies to fossil fuel companies.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.110
And five trillion is a lot of money.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.030
The reason they think it’s so much, is because
fossil fuel producers don’t pay to clean

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.220
up the air or water.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.510
They don’t have to deal with the medical
costs of air pollutants.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.580
And the researchers bunch all this into subsidies.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.960
Effectively making taxpayers foot the bill
to clean up and pay, just to keep using fossil

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960
fuels.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.320
For example, if a company wants to drill a
well that may not hit oil, the cost is 100-percent

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.430
tax deductible; it’s a direct taxpayer subsidy.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.970
But the paper also included the more intangible
costs like climate change effects, the cost

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.360
to supply oil vs what consumers pay, and even
deaths from air pollution!

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.260
Again, this added up to: Five.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Trillion.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Dollars!

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.579
There is a pile of research saying carbon
and particulate-emitting fossil fuels cost

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.750
more than you think.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.610
For example, gas in the U.S. is currently
two dollars and forty cents a gallon.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.610
A 2015 study says the true cost, when we add
in the cost of the air pollution from burning

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.280
it, is six-twenty a gallon.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.590
Diesel would be even more!

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.670
And coal power would add a quarter for every
kilowatt hour.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.110
Calculating these hidden subsidies is not
new; it’s been studied (controversially)

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.110
many times.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.890
But it’s important to bring up because,
it doesn’t have to be this way! 139 countries

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.210
could be 100% powered by wind, water, and
solar by 2050, says another new study!

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.680
The study lead said, “Every country that
we examined has sufficient resources to power

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.680
itself.”

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680
Just imagine!

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.260
139 countries with 100-percent clean, renewables…
no carbon emissions -- including the US and

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.260
China!?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.260
That’s incredible!

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.020
Not to mention, we wouldn’t have to pay
pollution subsidies.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.579
So I have to ask, why do we pay all this money
to keep using non-renewable coal and oil?

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.810
Do you think we should fund renewables or
stick to what we know with fossil fuels?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.380
