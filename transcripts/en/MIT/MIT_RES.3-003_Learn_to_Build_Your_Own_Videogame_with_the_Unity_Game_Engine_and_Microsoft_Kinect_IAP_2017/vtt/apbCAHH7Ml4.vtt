00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.170
MAY: Hi, guys.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.600
I'm May.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.100
This is Alvin, Jimmy, and Tyler.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.500
So our group, we wanted
to do [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.110
And it's kind of like--

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.590
our plan was to make
it more arcade style.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.595
So you have levels and you
go from one game to another.

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:36.200
But because of time
constraints, we

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.956
ended up making four
separate games here.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.330
And we will show
you the first ones--

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.630
ALVIN: And [INAUDIBLE] games.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.240
So we decided to
try out [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.202
MAY: So the games are made
with [INAUDIBLE] of putting it

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:52.090
into the Kinect.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.470
[INAUDIBLE] chance
with the Kinect.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.970
So [INAUDIBLE] go
on the keyboard.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.330
ALVIN: [? So ?] this
game, "Chicken Run."

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.880
You have to make it across
obstacles [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.890
in between the obstacles
like arrows and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.100
So yeah.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.117
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:19.502
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:20.870
MAY: [INAUDIBLE] are--

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.689
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.916
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:37.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.500
ALVIN: [INAUDIBLE] please.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.905
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.336
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:48.767
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.629
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:54.030
MAY: So far, this game.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.560
It was [INAUDIBLE] that had
to be the waiter bringing food

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.860
to the customer.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.750
We couldn't find a
way faster [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.220
that's like flying chickens.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.212
Oh no.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.920
So our games surround
[INAUDIBLE] restaurant team.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.380
So for "Catch Catch," this has
no special graphics because we

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.860
didn't really have time.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.160
And this also turned out to be
like a burger stacking game.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.410
And the idea is that, if
while you're playing--

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.730
So the idea is the two
players are fighting for--

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.310
What happens is, if one
player has a higher one,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.980
the other player has a higher
chance to get the burger.

00:02:48.763 --> 00:02:52.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.120
And then there's "Chef Dash."

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.240
JIMMY: This is "Chef Dash."

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.700
You control two different chefs,
one in white and one in black.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.500
So you have certain
orders in the top left

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.541
and you have to fulfill
those through the window.

00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:10.810
So if I want to make pizza,
I take the pizza over here

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.650
and start cooking
it in the oven.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.630
But I need to put a
plate on the window.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.790
And then once the
pizza is done, you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.973
should hear a beep beep beep.

00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:20.680
[BEEPING]

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.180
Like that.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.148
[CROWD OOH]

00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:23.116
[BEEPING]

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:25.140
And so then you can take
that out of the oven

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.000
and then put it in the window.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.570
And it removes it
from the order.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.850
You also get tips.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.380
So we have steak and
pizza and then also soda.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.920
The soda, you
don't have to cook.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.546
So you get more--

00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:42.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.642
You have to put the--

00:03:43.642 --> 00:03:45.370
[BEEPING]

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.770
So then there's some [INAUDIBLE]
black for the Chef Black, white

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.450
for the Chef White.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.140
And you get five tips
for soda since you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.280
don't have to cook it.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.190
And then steak and
pizza you get 10.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.930
So like--

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.221
ALVIN: First to 100 tips wins.

00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:03.720
JIMMY: Yeah.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.280
First to 100 tips wins.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.950
It can get really
hectic if you're

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.130
putting a whole bunch of things
in and trying to get orders.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.490
Like I was playing earlier
and me and my friend

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.439
both tried to put an
order in at the same time

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.230
for the same thing.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.884
Like there was one soda order.

00:04:17.884 --> 00:04:19.300
And I barely put
it in before him.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.480
So he didn't get the tips and
they just sat there in limbo.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.350
It was just fun.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.850
Yes.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.250
The first one to 100 tips wins.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.598
It would take a while to finish
but we can go to the next game.

00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:34.520
MAY: OK.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.442
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.402
I think this game will be
really more fun on the Kinect.

00:04:44.402 --> 00:04:45.585
JIMMY: Yeah.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.062
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:47.062 --> 00:04:48.603
ALVIN: [INAUDIBLE]
control the knife.

00:04:48.603 --> 00:04:49.589
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.068
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:51.068 --> 00:04:53.533
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:56.519
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.477
It sort of gets harder.

00:04:57.477 --> 00:04:59.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.090
There's sort of a [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.567
[INAUDIBLE] chopped [INAUDIBLE]
within the food itself,

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:05.192
it won't count.

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:07.147
So for example, you
see this broccoli.

00:05:07.147 --> 00:05:07.647
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:10.593
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:19.922 --> 00:05:23.359
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.490
MAY: That's the
idea of the game.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.900
So our [INAUDIBLE] wanted
to [INAUDIBLE] arena

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.835
and then you could do a
whole telling out at the end.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:35.460
But yeah.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.017
For now, it's like just
four mini-games separated.

00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:40.600
Any questions?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.325
Any

00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:42.700
JIMMY: Do you have
any questions?

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.800
All right.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.450
[APPLAUSE]
