00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.530
Since we're on the subject
of focus management,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.390
let me show you another
really useful technique.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.930
On most websites the main content is
usually not the first thing in the DOM,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.810
instead we often begin with navigation,
sublists,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.380
side bars, hamburger menus, and
other bits of page scaffolding.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.820
This means that keyboard and screen
reader users must first navigate through

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.280
all of this content before they can
get at the actual heart of the page.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.540
For users with motor impairments
this is especially frustrating.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.340
A user who's unable to move
their arms might be navigating

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.250
the page with a switch device, which
they activate by tapping their head.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.580
This user is going to have to tap
over and over again to get through

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.470
all of these elements before they can
get to our content, and that's not cool.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.890
Thankfully, there's an easy to
implement solution to this problem.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.590
Let's create a hidden link
that allows keyboard and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.370
switch device users the ability to
jump straight to our page content.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.680
These links are often
referred to as skip links.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.209
Let me show you an example.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.480
So here we are on the Funion news site,
and I have some navigation up here which

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.870
normally the keyboard user
would have to tab through.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.140
Instead, when I press tab,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.160
the first thing I'm presented with is
this little option up here in the top

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.849
of the corner, which is asking if I'd
like to skip down to the main content.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.990
Pressing Enter will then move focus
down to the main content area,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.480
bypassing all of our navigation.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.330
Implementing a skip link
is actually really easy.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.538
I'll start by creating a named anchor.

00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:37.970
So the href of this anchor

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.100
refers to the ID of another element
that I'll have on the page.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.980
I'm also going to give this
element a class of skip-link so

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.690
I can refer to it in CSS later.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.140
I want the skip link to
appear early in the DOM, so

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.910
I'm going to put it
before my navigation.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.190
To connect my skip-link to my main
content, I'll give my main element

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.850
an ID of maincontent,
which matches the href value up here.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.010
So these two are now connected.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.810
In newer versions of Chrome and Firefox
just doing this right here will allow

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.900
you to move focus down to the main
element when the skip-link is pressed.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.920
But for older browsers which don't move
focus when named anchors are clicked,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.700
I'm also going to want to
add a tabindex -1.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.790
Over in my CSS, I'll make sure that the
skip-link has an absolute position, so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.948
it can appear in the top
left corner of the screen.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:32.720
But I'm going to make it
initially positioned off screen

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.930
by setting the top value to -40 pixels.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.990
Then I can use the focus pseudo class
to move the element back on screen.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:46.200
We'll talk more about the focus
pseudo class in a later lesson, but

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.760
the short explanation is that
this pseudo class matches

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.580
any time the corresponding
element gains focus.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.190
With these simple techniques, we've
removed the road blocks from the path of

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.940
our keyboard users and
greatly improve their experience.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.360
If you're interested to learn
more about other techniques for

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.150
creating skip-links, I'll leave a link
down in the instructor notes to a WebAIM

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.970
article, which covers
them in more detail.
