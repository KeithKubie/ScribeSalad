00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.030
A fundamental belief of the modern world,
which explains a lot of our anxiety around

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:13.900
failure, is that we are what we earn. When
we say this, we mean something very particular:

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.240
not just that it’s nice to have a lot of
money but that our income is the source of

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.951
information, crucial, decisive information,
about our character, our intelligence, our

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:33.000
moral fibre: in short, money is the key indicator
of our worth in human and not just financial

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.730
terms. The more money we make, the more we
deserve to exist. By extension, it feels impossible

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.400
to imagine ourselves as good, decent – and
still poor. But can this really be true? Must

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.649
we hate and deem ourselves despicable beings
because our salary is not elevated? For an

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.700
answer, we must look to economics and in particular,
to the way that salary is determined. Here

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.729
we find something striking: wages are not
decided by the extent of someone’s human

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.670
worth or social contribution per se. Wages
are simply the result of the intensity with

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.020
which certain people want a job done relative
to the number of people who happen to be able

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.119
to do it. If many people can complete a task,
however humanly important it might be (holding

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.240
a hand on a cancer ward), little money will
be offered for it. And if there are very few

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.130
people able to do it, however trivial it might
be (kicking a ball 60 metres into a goal),

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.250
if there’s intense demand, salaries will
be elevated. Money is in fact no accurate

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.770
measure of the human worth of the work in
question; the determinant of wages is just

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.469
the strength of demand in relation to supply.
We may not be able easily to change how much

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.939
people earn, but we can change how we judge
earnings. This isn’t an issue of politics;

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:13.121
it’s an issue of appreciation. We can change
how we assess what a modest wage means. We

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:19.100
can use our imaginations to remember and hold
in mind all that is not quantified in a salary

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.750
– in our lives and in those of others; all
the degrees of intelligence, care, dedication,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.010
empathy and creativity that may be present,
undetected by the blunt aggregated marker

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.010
of a wage. However tempting it might be to
settle the question of the value of humans

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.319
in stark financial terms, the truth remains
beautifully and redemptively more complicated

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.830
– as we must realise as soon as we’ve
spent some time around a person at work and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.420
got to know what sides of their character
their labours will call on through an average

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.360
day. We’ll then have no option but to reach
a dauntingly complex conclusion: we are not

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.000
what 
we earn.
