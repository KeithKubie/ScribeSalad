00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.520
So the first thing we'll do, is add all the links

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.320
that we find on the page that we're crawling, that's the

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.880
value of page, to to crawl. The best way to do

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.970
that is to use the union procedure, that we defined in an

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.370
earlier quiz this unit, that will avoid having duplication in to

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.375
crawl. If you didn't use union, you could still get the stork.

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.940
It's okay if there's duplication because we're doing this test to

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.440
not crawl the same page twice. So I'll do it using union.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.910
We're going to union into to crawl. The results of

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.160
finding all the links on the page that we found, and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.150
we need to use get page passing in page to

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.060
get the actual contents of that page. And the get all

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.820
links procedure that we defined earlier returns a list of

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.090
all the links on that page. The next thing we need

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.920
to do, is to keep track of the pages that we've

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.600
crawled, we can do that by using append. So that adds

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.450
this page to the list of pages we've crawled, and

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.390
now we're done. We've got a working web crawler, for any

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.420
seed page, it will find all the pages that can

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.370
be reached from that page, and return them in a list.
