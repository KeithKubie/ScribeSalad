thing is indexable so web pages show you

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729
thing is indexable so web pages show you
 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:26.900
thing is indexable so web pages show you
all of their text

all of their text
by default you don't necessarily have to

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470
by default you don't necessarily have to
 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.900
by default you don't necessarily have to
write it that way but the easiest way to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910
write it that way but the easiest way to
 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.000
write it that way but the easiest way to
write a webpage makes it indexable and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010
write a webpage makes it indexable and
 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.580
write a webpage makes it indexable and
so this allows search engines to appear

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590
so this allows search engines to appear
 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.020
so this allows search engines to appear
and even though search engines didn't

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030
and even though search engines didn't
 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.280

the web the fact that the web had this
 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.420
the web the fact that the web had this
property allowed it to scale to this

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430
property allowed it to scale to this
 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.130
property allowed it to scale to this
massive size with all of these different

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140
massive size with all of these different
 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.050
massive size with all of these different
pages and yet you can still find things

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060
pages and yet you can still find things
 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.820
pages and yet you can still find things
and you don't have to go manually

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830
and you don't have to go manually
 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.410
and you don't have to go manually
organize them into directories and

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420
organize them into directories and
 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.320
organize them into directories and
things like that

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330
things like that
 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.320
things like that
the next thing composability was not at

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330
the next thing composability was not at
 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.000
the next thing composability was not at
the beginning of the web but not long

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010
the beginning of the web but not long
 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.400

after that iframes were invented and it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410
after that iframes were invented and it
 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.430
after that iframes were invented and it
made it possible to take multiple sites

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440
made it possible to take multiple sites
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.230
made it possible to take multiple sites
and mash them up into one web page and

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
and mash them up into one web page and
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.000
and mash them up into one web page and
so this allowed you to do things like

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010
so this allowed you to do things like
 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.220
so this allowed you to do things like
embed YouTube videos in a page or put a

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230
embed YouTube videos in a page or put a
 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.950
embed YouTube videos in a page or put a
map in a page or you know very

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960

importantly for many publications to be

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520
importantly for many publications to be
 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.610
importantly for many publications to be
able to put an ad in a page and the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620
able to put an ad in a page and the
 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.770
able to put an ad in a page and the
composability also had some very

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780
composability also had some very
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.710
composability also had some very
important properties that the the page

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720
important properties that the the page
 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.470
important properties that the the page
containing the other page couldn't muck

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480
containing the other page couldn't muck
 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.510
containing the other page couldn't muck
with what's inside it and the thing

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520
with what's inside it and the thing
 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.220
with what's inside it and the thing
inside of it couldn't muck with the the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230
inside of it couldn't muck with the the
 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.080
inside of it couldn't muck with the the
outer containing page and so this

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090
outer containing page and so this
 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.360
outer containing page and so this
allowed it to very safely be able to

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370
allowed it to very safely be able to
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.250
allowed it to very safely be able to
aggregate content from lots of different

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260
aggregate content from lots of different
 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.170
aggregate content from lots of different
places and make much richer applications

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180
places and make much richer applications
 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.640
places and make much richer applications

they rioted the game developers like we

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640
they rioted the game developers like we
 

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.100
they rioted the game developers like we
need Lua and they're like I need to

need Lua and they're like I need to
 

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.790
need Lua and they're like I need to
write C++ GL games and so so even Apple

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800
write C++ GL games and so so even Apple
 

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.320
write C++ GL games and so so even Apple
had to back off there so the importance

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:51.330
had to back off there so the importance
 

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.630
had to back off there so the importance
of being able for developers to use what

applications excel and these are all
places where we really need to close

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:08.790
places where we really need to close
 

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.699
places where we really need to close
that gap on the web so you can do all of

00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:10.709
that gap on the web so you can do all of
 

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:12.680
that gap on the web so you can do all of
these things on the web so you retain

one of our goals on the chrome team is
 

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.370
one of our goals on the chrome team is
to really close that gap so the first

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380
to really close that gap so the first
 

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.930

performance so I mentioned before the

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:26.579
performance so I mentioned before the
 

00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:28.160
performance so I mentioned before the
expectations around mobile devices now

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.170
expectations around mobile devices now
 

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.319

are everything's is 60 frames a second

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:30.329
are everything's is 60 frames a second
 

00:09:30.329 --> 00:09:32.690
are everything's is 60 frames a second
and so you know when the web was

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700
and so you know when the web was
 

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.519

really weren't thinking about how to do

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:35.730
really weren't thinking about how to do

really weren't thinking about how to do
rendering using GPUs how to make it so

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:38.730
rendering using GPUs how to make it so
 

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.960
rendering using GPUs how to make it so
that you don't have stutters and frame

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:41.970
that you don't have stutters and frame
 

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.230
that you don't have stutters and frame
rates and all of these kind of things so

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240
rates and all of these kind of things so
 

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.340
rates and all of these kind of things so
there's a bunch of projects we have

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:46.350
there's a bunch of projects we have
 

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.130
there's a bunch of projects we have
underway and chrome to do this some of

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140
underway and chrome to do this some of
 

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.650
underway and chrome to do this some of
which involve new web standards like web

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660
which involve new web standards like web
 

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.960
which involve new web standards like web
animations so that you can specify

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:53.970
animations so that you can specify
 

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.120
animations so that you can specify
declaratively what animation or

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.130
declaratively what animation or
 

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.500
declaratively what animation or
transition you want to have happen and

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:57.510
transition you want to have happen and
 

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.280
transition you want to have happen and
then chrome or the browser can then

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.290
then chrome or the browser can then
 

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.689
then chrome or the browser can then
automatically make that happen for you

00:10:02.689 --> 00:10:02.699
automatically make that happen for you
 

00:10:02.699 --> 00:10:04.040
automatically make that happen for you
so that you don't have to write code

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.050
so that you don't have to write code
 

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.990
so that you don't have to write code
don't handle every single frame of the

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000
don't handle every single frame of the
 

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.880
don't handle every single frame of the
animation and that allows the system as

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:07.890
animation and that allows the system as
 

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.160
animation and that allows the system as
a whole the scheduled activity to

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.170
a whole the scheduled activity to
 

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.569
a whole the scheduled activity to
maintain that frame rate so that you

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:11.579
maintain that frame rate so that you
 

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:13.939
maintain that frame rate so that you
don't get glitches other things we're

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:13.949
don't get glitches other things we're
 

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:16.460
don't get glitches other things we're
doing are things like reducing garbage

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:16.470
doing are things like reducing garbage
 

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.410
doing are things like reducing garbage
collection pause time so if you have to

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420
collection pause time so if you have to
 

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.170
collection pause time so if you have to
do work to produce a frame you want to

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180
do work to produce a frame you want to
 

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.370
do work to produce a frame you want to
make sure that you can maintain that

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380
make sure that you can maintain that
 

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.620
make sure that you can maintain that
constant frame rate it really sucks if

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:24.630
constant frame rate it really sucks if
 

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.000
constant frame rate it really sucks if
you're trying to produce a frame and a

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.010
you're trying to produce a frame and a
 

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.180
you're trying to produce a frame and a
GC comes and you go away for 60

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.190
GC comes and you go away for 60
 

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.730
GC comes and you go away for 60
milliseconds and you drop four frames

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740
milliseconds and you drop four frames
 

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.579
milliseconds and you drop four frames
and so we're working very hard to both

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:34.589
and so we're working very hard to both
 

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:37.130
and so we're working very hard to both
measure and improve garbage collection

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140
measure and improve garbage collection
 

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.079
measure and improve garbage collection
and other VM Layton sees that exists

because in complex VMs like v8 they do
 

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.759

clever things like oh I notice you're
running this function a lot let me

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:44.850
running this function a lot let me
 

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.389
running this function a lot let me
optimize it for you and even the process

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399
optimize it for you and even the process
 

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.680
optimize it for you and even the process
of doing that that could cause you to

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:48.690
of doing that that could cause you to
 

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.780
of doing that that could cause you to
miss an animation frame and so we're

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:50.790
miss an animation frame and so we're
 

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.100
miss an animation frame and so we're
working very hard to make sure that

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.110
working very hard to make sure that
 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.990
working very hard to make sure that
never happens and there's a there's a

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000
never happens and there's a there's a
 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.550
never happens and there's a there's a
bunch of work underway to do that and

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560
bunch of work underway to do that and
 

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.829
bunch of work underway to do that and
it's particularly tricky both for

00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839
it's particularly tricky both for
 

00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:58.880
it's particularly tricky both for
garbage collection as well as

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:58.890
garbage collection as well as
 

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.860
garbage collection as well as
compilation pauses and things like that

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:00.870
compilation pauses and things like that
 

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.620
compilation pauses and things like that
because even if you have multi-core and

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:03.630
because even if you have multi-core and
 

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.939
because even if you have multi-core and
we work hard to take advantage of all

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:04.949
we work hard to take advantage of all
 

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:06.910
we work hard to take advantage of all
the different multi-core processors your

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920
the different multi-core processors your
 

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.199
the different multi-core processors your
location might also be competing for

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:08.209
location might also be competing for
 

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.790
location might also be competing for
Kors or even if you're not competing for

Kors or even if you're not competing for
 

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.650
Kors or even if you're not competing for
Kors very often you may be competing

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:11.660
Kors very often you may be competing

with the garbage collector or the

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680
with the garbage collector or the

pressure things like that so it's a very

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:17.540
pressure things like that so it's a very
 

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.410
pressure things like that so it's a very
challenging problem but we've made a lot

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:20.420
challenging problem but we've made a lot
 

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.980
challenging problem but we've made a lot
of progress on that so here's some

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:23.990
of progress on that so here's some
 

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.040
of progress on that so here's some
examples of the improvements we've made

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.050
examples of the improvements we've made
 

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.930
examples of the improvements we've made
so this was one of our performance

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:28.940
so this was one of our performance
 

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.540
so this was one of our performance
dashboards that tracks Jay s game bench

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:31.550
dashboards that tracks Jay s game bench
 

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.550
dashboards that tracks Jay s game bench
and you see some changes were made that

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560
and you see some changes were made that
 

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.910
and you see some changes were made that
dramatically improved performance now

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920
dramatically improved performance now
 

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.530
dramatically improved performance now
we also look for performance regressions

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:38.540
we also look for performance regressions
 

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.980
we also look for performance regressions
and we have a lot of performance

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:41.990
and we have a lot of performance
 

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.660
and we have a lot of performance
dashboards if any of you've crawled

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:43.670
dashboards if any of you've crawled
 

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.310
dashboards if any of you've crawled
around the chromium site and tried to

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320
around the chromium site and tried to
 

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.569
around the chromium site and tried to
look at all of the performance

00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:46.579
look at all of the performance
 

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:48.040
look at all of the performance
dashboards I think there are so many of

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.050
dashboards I think there are so many of
 

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.600
dashboards I think there are so many of
them know that no human can keep track

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:49.610
them know that no human can keep track
 

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.269
them know that no human can keep track
of them all and in fact about a year and

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279
of them all and in fact about a year and
 

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.160
of them all and in fact about a year and
a half and ago we had a massive

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.170
a half and ago we had a massive
 

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.259
a half and ago we had a massive
regression on one of them and nobody

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:56.269
regression on one of them and nobody
 

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:59.470
regression on one of them and nobody
noticed because it there was just too

00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480
noticed because it there was just too
 

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.840
noticed because it there was just too
many for people to keep track of and and

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:01.850
many for people to keep track of and and
 

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.329
many for people to keep track of and and
so that spurred the team to think like

00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:04.339
so that spurred the team to think like
 

00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:05.680
so that spurred the team to think like
how do we solve this problem and so

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:05.690
how do we solve this problem and so
 

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.360
how do we solve this problem and so
since the thing we know how to do is

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.370
since the thing we know how to do is
 

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.100
since the thing we know how to do is
build software we actually built

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.110
build software we actually built
 

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.569
build software we actually built
software to watch all over the

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:10.579
software to watch all over the

performance dashboards for us there's

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:12.890
performance dashboards for us there's
 

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.250
performance dashboards for us there's
they actually found this really cool

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.260
they actually found this really cool
 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.840
they actually found this really cool
anomaly detection framework that was

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:16.850
anomaly detection framework that was
 

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.430
anomaly detection framework that was
developed elsewhere in Google and

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440
developed elsewhere in Google and
 

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.990
developed elsewhere in Google and
trained it to look at the performance

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000
trained it to look at the performance
 

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.060
trained it to look at the performance
dashboards because as you know sometimes

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.070
dashboards because as you know sometimes
 

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.790
dashboards because as you know sometimes
it's hard to tell is it slowly getting

it's hard to tell is it slowly getting
 

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.699
it's hard to tell is it slowly getting
slower or was their temporary regression

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:27.709
slower or was their temporary regression

you know I get email alerts when
performance regressions and regresses in

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.310
performance regressions and regresses in
 

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.590
performance regressions and regresses in
any of these areas and we have a team of

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600
any of these areas and we have a team of
 

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.189
any of these areas and we have a team of
sheriffs that go and look at the results

00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199
sheriffs that go and look at the results
 

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:43.780
sheriffs that go and look at the results
from all of this and then go figure out

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:43.790
from all of this and then go figure out
 

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.699
from all of this and then go figure out
what change caused the regression and go

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:45.709
what change caused the regression and go
 

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:47.740
what change caused the regression and go
nag the developer who does that - you

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:47.750
nag the developer who does that - you
 

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.809
nag the developer who does that - you
know revert the change or make a fix so

00:12:49.809 --> 00:12:49.819
know revert the change or make a fix so
 

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:51.850
know revert the change or make a fix so
that we get the performance back and so

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:51.860
that we get the performance back and so
 

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.889
that we get the performance back and so
now even though we continue to add

00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:53.899
now even though we continue to add
 

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:56.410
now even though we continue to add
capabilities to Chrome and the code

almost every area that we can measure
 

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.889
almost every area that we can measure

because of this continual measurement of
 

00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:08.199
because of this continual measurement of
everything basically four places we

failed to measure and then when we find

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720
failed to measure and then when we find
 

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.180
failed to measure and then when we find
them we add a new measurement for it and

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.190
them we add a new measurement for it and
 

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.180
them we add a new measurement for it and
we work hard to never regress on them

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.190
we work hard to never regress on them
 

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.069
we work hard to never regress on them
we're not perfect but we're getting

another area we've improved a lot is

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:21.670
another area we've improved a lot is
 

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.579
another area we've improved a lot is
JavaScript performance we've improved on

00:13:25.579 --> 00:13:25.589
JavaScript performance we've improved on
 

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:32.480
JavaScript performance we've improved on
mobile about 50% in last year or so and

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:32.490
mobile about 50% in last year or so and
 

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.480
mobile about 50% in last year or so and
and this is an area that is is is of

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:36.490
and this is an area that is is is of
 

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.860
and this is an area that is is is of
course very important to us because most

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:37.870
course very important to us because most
 

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.210
course very important to us because most
of the code that you run is all written

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:39.220
of the code that you run is all written
 

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.370
of the code that you run is all written
in JavaScript and so this goes directly

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:41.380
in JavaScript and so this goes directly
 

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.150
in JavaScript and so this goes directly

to how fast your applications can be in
addition we launched a new version of

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:46.750
addition we launched a new version of
 

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.500
addition we launched a new version of
the octane benchmark so octane is the

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:49.510
the octane benchmark so octane is the
 

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.610
the octane benchmark so octane is the
the benchmark we use to tune v8 against

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620
the benchmark we use to tune v8 against
 

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.960
the benchmark we use to tune v8 against
because we basically try to put things

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:54.970
because we basically try to put things
 

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.550
because we basically try to put things
in octane that we think are important to

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560
in octane that we think are important to
 

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.740
in octane that we think are important to
make go fast and then we work really

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:58.750
make go fast and then we work really
 

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.440
make go fast and then we work really
hard to make it go fast in an octane 2.0

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:01.450
hard to make it go fast in an octane 2.0
 

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.680
hard to make it go fast in an octane 2.0
the changes we made there were primarily

the changes we made there were primarily
 

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.590
the changes we made there were primarily
around latency for the first time we

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600
around latency for the first time we
 

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.910
around latency for the first time we
have a JavaScript benchmark that

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920
have a JavaScript benchmark that
 

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.160
have a JavaScript benchmark that
actually measures latency so that if you

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.170
actually measures latency so that if you
 

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.530
actually measures latency so that if you
have long GC pauses or frequent GC

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:13.540
have long GC pauses or frequent GC
 

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.090
have long GC pauses or frequent GC
pauses or things like that you'll score

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.100

poorly on the benchmark we also brought
 

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.860
poorly on the benchmark we also brought
in a bunch of code from inscripted so

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:22.870
in a bunch of code from inscripted so
 

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.140
in a bunch of code from inscripted so
basically we have a zero

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.150
basically we have a zero
 

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.820

in the benchmark as well now we don't

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720
in the benchmark as well now we don't
 

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.740
in the benchmark as well now we don't
implement a special compiler or anything

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:37.750
implement a special compiler or anything
 

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.300

like that but we're just trying to make

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.310
like that but we're just trying to make
 

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.000

of in scripting and and then we also

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880
of in scripting and and then we also
 

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.440
of in scripting and and then we also
added some other large programs in there

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:52.450
added some other large programs in there
 

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.949
added some other large programs in there
to really test parse time compilation

00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959
to really test parse time compilation
 

00:14:55.959 --> 00:14:57.600
to really test parse time compilation
time and latency and things like that so

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:57.610
time and latency and things like that so
 

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.880
time and latency and things like that so
large code bases of JavaScript so that

00:14:59.880 --> 00:14:59.890
large code bases of JavaScript so that
 

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.470
large code bases of JavaScript so that
those things get benchmarked and tested

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480
those things get benchmarked and tested
 

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.100
those things get benchmarked and tested
as well

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.110
 

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.890
so another area I talked about working

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:07.900
so another area I talked about working
 

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.360

data compression proxy and it gives you

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:19.149
data compression proxy and it gives you
 

00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:21.710
data compression proxy and it gives you
a 50% savings on the data transmitted

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720
a 50% savings on the data transmitted
 

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.230
a 50% savings on the data transmitted
right now we're really focused mostly on

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240
right now we're really focused mostly on
 

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.600

by paying for the bits that
 

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.110
by paying for the bits that
get over-the-air and so we're really

get over-the-air and so we're really
 

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.410
get over-the-air and so we're really
focused on on shipping fewer bits to

focused on on shipping fewer bits to
 

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.240
focused on on shipping fewer bits to
them but also there's opportunities to

going to revolutionize communications

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:15.190
going to revolutionize communications
 

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.670
going to revolutionize communications
because now you can really anything

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:17.680
because now you can really anything
 

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.660
because now you can really anything
about it web is really about

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:18.670
about it web is really about
 

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.170
about it web is really about
communicating with people and it's a

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:22.180
communicating with people and it's a
 

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.610
communicating with people and it's a
shame that we've gone all this time

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:23.620
shame that we've gone all this time
 

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.440
shame that we've gone all this time
without you actually being able to

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:25.450
without you actually being able to
 

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.640
without you actually being able to
communicate with people and and WebRTC

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:29.650
communicate with people and and WebRTC
 

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.930
communicate with people and and WebRTC
is going to enable this for the first

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:30.940
is going to enable this for the first
 

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.990
is going to enable this for the first
time it's it's very cool I talked about

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000
time it's it's very cool I talked about
 

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.320
time it's it's very cool I talked about
some of the api's that have come in

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:37.330
some of the api's that have come in
 

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:42.840
some of the api's that have come in
recently the other thing that mobile

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:42.850
recently the other thing that mobile
 

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.280
recently the other thing that mobile
applications have gotten to take

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.290
applications have gotten to take
 

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.660
applications have gotten to take
advantage of is new UI toolkits and new

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:48.670
advantage of is new UI toolkits and new
 

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.040
advantage of is new UI toolkits and new
UI paradigms so we're working on a

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.050
UI paradigms so we're working on a
 

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.840
UI paradigms so we're working on a
number of things here to make it much

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:54.850
number of things here to make it much
 

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.030
number of things here to make it much
easier to build really beautiful user

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.040
easier to build really beautiful user
 

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.180
easier to build really beautiful user
interfaces and to make them work well in

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:00.190
interfaces and to make them work well in
 

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.890
interfaces and to make them work well in
touch environments and in different

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:01.900
touch environments and in different
 

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.350
touch environments and in different
screen sizes so one of the things that's

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360
screen sizes so one of the things that's
 

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.270
screen sizes so one of the things that's
obvious about mobile is typing is a lot

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280
obvious about mobile is typing is a lot
 

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.240
obvious about mobile is typing is a lot
harder and so we've recently introduced

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.250
harder and so we've recently introduced
 

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.310
harder and so we've recently introduced
something called requestautocomplete

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320
something called requestautocomplete
 

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.220
something called requestautocomplete
and what this does is it allows the

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.230
and what this does is it allows the
 

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.370
and what this does is it allows the
browser to

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:18.380
browser to
 

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.980
browser to
member assets of information the most

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:20.990
member assets of information the most
 

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.110
member assets of information the most
important which is payment because if

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120
important which is payment because if
 

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.400
important which is payment because if
you want to buy something on the web

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:24.410
you want to buy something on the web
 

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.620
you want to buy something on the web
having to type in credit card numbers

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:26.630
having to type in credit card numbers
 

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.420
having to type in credit card numbers
shipping address mailing address all of

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:28.430
shipping address mailing address all of
 

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.240
shipping address mailing address all of
those kinds of things it's a real pain

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:31.250
those kinds of things it's a real pain
 

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.400
those kinds of things it's a real pain
and so this allows you to do that once

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:33.410
and so this allows you to do that once
 

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.260
and so this allows you to do that once
either on a mobile device from a desktop

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:35.270
either on a mobile device from a desktop
 

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.030

simple checkout flows to mobile devices

00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960
simple checkout flows to mobile devices
 

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.720
simple checkout flows to mobile devices
and there's a some other things we have

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:01.730
and there's a some other things we have
 

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.400

polymer how many people here have heard

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:08.210
polymer how many people here have heard
 

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:13.150
polymer how many people here have heard
of polymer okay it's really exciting on

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.160
of polymer okay it's really exciting on
 

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.680
of polymer okay it's really exciting on
two levels one this may seem obvious but

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:17.690
two levels one this may seem obvious but
 

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.710
two levels one this may seem obvious but
in most programming environments you can

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720
in most programming environments you can
 

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.360
in most programming environments you can
write a function in terms of other

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:22.370
write a function in terms of other
 

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.080
write a function in terms of other
functions with web components that

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:26.090
functions with web components that
 

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.700
functions with web components that
polymers built on top of for the first

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:27.710
polymers built on top of for the first
 

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.130
polymers built on top of for the first
time on the web you can actually write

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:30.140
time on the web you can actually write
 

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.280
time on the web you can actually write
HTML tags in terms of other HTML tags

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:33.290
HTML tags in terms of other HTML tags
 

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.890
HTML tags in terms of other HTML tags
and bundle the appropriate CSS and

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:35.900
and bundle the appropriate CSS and
 

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.210
and bundle the appropriate CSS and
JavaScript within things as well so you

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:37.220
JavaScript within things as well so you
 

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.760
JavaScript within things as well so you
can build real first-class components

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:39.770
can build real first-class components
 

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.110
can build real first-class components
and have structured programming on the

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120
and have structured programming on the
 

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.760
and have structured programming on the
web and not just cut and paste

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:42.770
web and not just cut and paste
 

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.930
web and not just cut and paste
programming and so this is huge and

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:45.940
programming and so this is huge and
 

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.910
programming and so this is huge and
polymer is a tool kit that was designed

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:48.920
polymer is a tool kit that was designed
 

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.310
polymer is a tool kit that was designed
from the beginning to live on top of web

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320
from the beginning to live on top of web
 

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.790
from the beginning to live on top of web
components and it brings both the

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:54.800
components and it brings both the
 

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.440
components and it brings both the
structure of the application to make it

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:56.450
structure of the application to make it
 

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.290
structure of the application to make it
much easier to build your app as well as

00:20:59.290 --> 00:20:59.300
much easier to build your app as well as
 

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.350
much easier to build your app as well as
a user interface layer so you can have

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360
a user interface layer so you can have
 

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.630
a user interface layer so you can have
really beautiful 60-hertz animations and

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640
really beautiful 60-hertz animations and
 

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.100
really beautiful 60-hertz animations and
transitions it knows what all the fast

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.110
transitions it knows what all the fast
 

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.750
transitions it knows what all the fast
paths are on the browser and tries to

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760
paths are on the browser and tries to
 

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.370
paths are on the browser and tries to
stay on them in fact by definition

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:09.380
stay on them in fact by definition
 

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.350
stay on them in fact by definition
there's this constant feedback loop

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360
there's this constant feedback loop
 

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.090
there's this constant feedback loop
going between the polymer team and the

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.100
going between the polymer team and the
 

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.800
going between the polymer team and the
blink team so that every time the

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:14.810
blink team so that every time the
 

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.000
blink team so that every time the
polymer team needs to make something

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.010
polymer team needs to make something
 

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.590
polymer team needs to make something
fast the blink team goes and makes that

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600
fast the blink team goes and makes that
 

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600
fast the blink team goes and makes that
fast and so by using this tool kit it's

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:19.610
fast and so by using this tool kit it's
 

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.610
fast and so by using this tool kit it's
one of the easiest ways to stay on all

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:21.620
one of the easiest ways to stay on all
 

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.560
one of the easiest ways to stay on all
of the fast paths inside of chrome and

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:23.570
of the fast paths inside of chrome and
 

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.960
of the fast paths inside of chrome and
it's also got polyfills for all of the

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:25.970
it's also got polyfills for all of the
 

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.580
it's also got polyfills for all of the
other modern browsers as well so you can

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:27.590
other modern browsers as well so you can
 

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.900
other modern browsers as well so you can
write your application once and deploy

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:28.910
write your application once and deploy
 

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:35.130
write your application once and deploy
it across all the different browsers

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:35.140
 

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.980
so what else is this one I forgot what's

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:38.990
so what else is this one I forgot what's
 

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:43.930
so what else is this one I forgot what's
on this slide this is what add to

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:43.940
on this slide this is what add to
 

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.500
on this slide this is what add to

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120
Android so something really simple but
 

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.330
Android so something really simple but
makes it a lot easier for people to go

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:01.340
makes it a lot easier for people to go
 

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.050
makes it a lot easier for people to go
go back and get their websites again and

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:05.060
go back and get their websites again and
 

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.240
go back and get their websites again and
of course we're working on making

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.250
of course we're working on making
 

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:15.610
of course we're working on making
handling the the source set or what's

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:15.620
handling the the source set or what's
 

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.790
handling the the source set or what's
the other one called set in source end

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:18.800
the other one called set in source end
 

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.830
the other one called set in source end
yes so that you can handle multiple

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840
yes so that you can handle multiple
 

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.990
yes so that you can handle multiple
image resolutions as well as handling

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000
image resolutions as well as handling
 

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.690
image resolutions as well as handling
composition and and art direction and

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:25.700
composition and and art direction and
 

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.320
composition and and art direction and
things like that

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:26.330
things like that
 

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.910
things like that
which is really important being able to

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:27.920
which is really important being able to
 

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.230
which is really important being able to
work across lots of different screens

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240
work across lots of different screens
 

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.610
work across lots of different screens
and and also very importantly we care a

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:33.620
and and also very importantly we care a
 

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.170
and and also very importantly we care a
lot about developer productivity so

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:35.180
lot about developer productivity so
 

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.880
lot about developer productivity so
we've invested a lot in Chrome's dev

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:36.890
we've invested a lot in Chrome's dev
 

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.470
we've invested a lot in Chrome's dev
tools how many people here have used

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480
tools how many people here have used
 

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.690
tools how many people here have used
them everyone okay so you're familiar

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:40.700
them everyone okay so you're familiar
 

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:46.290
them everyone okay so you're familiar
with them so you know if you can't

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:46.300
with them so you know if you can't
 

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.900
with them so you know if you can't
easily develop debug applications you're

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:49.910
easily develop debug applications you're
 

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.700
easily develop debug applications you're
not going to be very productive and so

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:51.710
not going to be very productive and so
 

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.620
not going to be very productive and so
we really want to make this this better

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:53.630
we really want to make this this better
 

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.270
we really want to make this this better
and better so a lot of things have

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280
and better so a lot of things have
 

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.300
and better so a lot of things have
shipped recently and when we take a look

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:58.310
shipped recently and when we take a look
 

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:06.970
shipped recently and when we take a look
here see if I remember all of them we we

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:06.980
here see if I remember all of them we we
 

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.750
here see if I remember all of them we we
have let's see there's projecting

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760
have let's see there's projecting
 

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.030
have let's see there's projecting
there's remote debugging to mobile and I

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.040
there's remote debugging to mobile and I
 

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.380
there's remote debugging to mobile and I
think there's also almost the other ones

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:17.390
think there's also almost the other ones
 

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.100
think there's also almost the other ones
screencasting the layers panel yes and

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.110
screencasting the layers panel yes and
 

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.020
screencasting the layers panel yes and
so and in addition to that there's a

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.030
so and in addition to that there's a
 

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.250
so and in addition to that there's a
whole bunch of tools we've developed for

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:24.260
whole bunch of tools we've developed for
 

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.370
whole bunch of tools we've developed for
debugging GPU performance because it's

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:27.380
debugging GPU performance because it's
 

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.650
debugging GPU performance because it's
very hard sometimes when you're writing

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:29.660
very hard sometimes when you're writing
 

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.790

exactly like ah this bit of code was

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000
exactly like ah this bit of code was
 

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.100
exactly like ah this bit of code was
running right here and that's why I

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.110
running right here and that's why I
 

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.320
running right here and that's why I
dropped those frames

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:42.330
 

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.610
we also want to make it possible for
