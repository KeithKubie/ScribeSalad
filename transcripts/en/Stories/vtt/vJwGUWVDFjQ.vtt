00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:06.594
GLITCH: How you appear really
defines a lot how you act.

00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:09.460
in a fursuit, the way I can
perform and the way can act

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.842
wouldn't really work
not in a fursuit.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.830
You can't just run around
and act like a fool

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.610
if you're not a
giant dog, you know?

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.740
This con is my
personal favorite.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.366
I mean, if I would put a
favorite, it would be this con.

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.782
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.280
In the '70s or
'80s, furry meetups

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.350
started happening at
science fiction conventions.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.910
But it's definitely
exploded since the internet,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.340
The internet is like the primary
social forum for furries.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.570
The textbook definition
is "an animal

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.150
with human characteristics".

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.763
But personally, I like
to think of it as more

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.080
just a bunch of monster people.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.980
It's really hard to
pin down one thing,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.090
because there's so many
different types of people.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.630
A lot of people assume that
every furry has a fursuit,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.790
but I would say that not
even half have fursuits.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.434
[CHEERING]

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:15.350
VERIDIAN LUPINE: To me,
fursona is some people

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.960
will take a combination
of whatever animals

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.820
that they feel
closest to, feel favor

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.047
to, or just general
like-- try and combine

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:24.630
the best traits of that and then
the best traits of themselves

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.650
into something new,
something great.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.156
The best of both worlds
created into one.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.530
I pretty much had to make my
family because my family was

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.551
broken apart early on in life.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.856
So I made my own.

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:38.821
And I found it easier
through the fandom.

00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.660
GLITCH: Yeah, I felt
like when I found

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.905
this place that I came home.

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:44.280
That's kind of
what it felt like,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.240
because it was just
this big culture that

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.500
was so loving and open.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.780
When I meet someone
who's not a furry,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.200
I definitely don't tell
them that I am a furry.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.950
I feel like there's a
bad conception of us

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.400
that kind of creates a
wall between our culture

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.890
and mainstream culture.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.282
Hey, sex sells, you know?

00:02:03.282 --> 00:02:04.990
That's what people
want to hear so that's

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.990
what they're gonna hear.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.406
VERIDIAN LUPINE:
Yeah, sometimes I

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:09.637
feel like I do gotta hide
this, because there's

00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:10.720
a lot of stigma behind it.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.130
A lot of us will try and say,
oh, we're not all like that.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.921
No, we're not this.

00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:14.890
We're not like that.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.140
No, not a lot of us are like
that, but something we do

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.250
gotta accept is that
does exist there.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.510
Yeah it seems really weird
to people-- grown men,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.426
people older than me in
those weirdass suits.

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:24.550
Really, it is just for fun.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.044
You know, it's
just for community.

00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:27.538
It's just for connections.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:31.273
GLITCH: What does your family
think about the whole furry

00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:32.020
thing?

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.030
POISON: [LAUGHS] I've
been weird since,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.760
like, I don't know how long.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.882
They got used to me
being gay, and then they

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:41.050
got used to me doing this and
doing that and now the furries.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.560
And so they're not even fazed.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.160
It is a lot of work
to walk in a suit.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.190
It is.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.270
You need somebody to
help you move around.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.270
She tells me when
there's kids around,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.840
because I can't see
anywhere down here.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.095
When I need water, she
puts it in there somehow.

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:01.120
She figures it out.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.388
She's always-- she's
got my back. [GIGGLES]

JANA HILLSTROM: I was introduced
to the furry community

00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:20.440
through my son, who's a furry.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.824
I, myself, am a
husky-- a white husky.

00:03:22.824 --> 00:03:26.282
This is my first convention,
and it's fantastic.

00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:27.480
It's wonderful.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.550
And the people, I can say I've
never met a furry I don't love.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.400
Our family's very open.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.900
We talk.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.400
We listen.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.000
We laugh.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.190
We make fun of.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.512
We do all that stuff.

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:38.440
That's what life
is-- to understand.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.296
And at least if you
don't understand,

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:45.050
then find out why
you don't understand.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.482
Be part of it.

00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:48.690
VERIDIAN LUPINE: Sometimes
I feel-- go to these cons,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.750
they can just kind of escape
their real world for a few days

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.960
and just enjoy just that
animalistic closeness, just

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.370
that otherworldly nature,
just another person,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.360
another identity--
something else completely,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.511
just for a little while.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.010
And as long as those
people remember

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.975
that they gotta come back,
then they're going to be fine.

ADRIANA BORDEA: When
I really hug someone,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.850
I feel very vulnerable.
