00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.800
In this lesson, you'll learn
how to create a stellar resume.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.380
We'll start with how to make
a comprehensive spreadsheet of

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.480
all your professional experiences.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.930
This is what we call a master resume.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.770
Next, we'll learn how to best summarize
your professional experiences.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.930
We'll detail how to craft compelling
bullet points that prove your unique

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.580
strengths and skills.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.290
Since resumes are meant
to be targeted and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.650
not show everything you've ever done,
you'll also create a targeted resume.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.750
Using your new master resume,
you'll research a job of interest and

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.200
compose a resume for this position.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.590
To top off all of your hard work, you'll
make sure the style and format of your

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.400
resume is up to snuff by completing a
personal review of our resume checklist.
