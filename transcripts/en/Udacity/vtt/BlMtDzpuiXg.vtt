The first part is our little note to ourselves. This is a function value.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Note that there's little repetition between the abstract syntax tree marker

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for this is a function element and also this is a function value.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We could have made them different. It's our choice when we're writing the interpreter.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The next thing to pass in is the parameters, the next thing is the body,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the last thing is the environment in which the function was defined.

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And we're done. This is how we do a function definition.
