00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.810
happiness is typically defined by asking

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
happiness is typically defined by asking
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.850
happiness is typically defined by asking
people about whether they're happy and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860
people about whether they're happy and
 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.289
people about whether they're happy and
whether they're satisfied with their

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
whether they're satisfied with their
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.700
whether they're satisfied with their
life sometimes it's called subjective

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
life sometimes it's called subjective
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.060
life sometimes it's called subjective
well-being and sometimes it's called

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
well-being and sometimes it's called
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.679
well-being and sometimes it's called
life satisfaction sometimes it's called

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
life satisfaction sometimes it's called
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.240
life satisfaction sometimes it's called
happiness and that's because all three

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
happiness and that's because all three
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.849
happiness and that's because all three
of those aspects are in the items that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
of those aspects are in the items that
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.689
of those aspects are in the items that
constitute that question and what the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
constitute that question and what the
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.690
constitute that question and what the
research on happiness tends to show is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
research on happiness tends to show is
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.510
research on happiness tends to show is
that a meaningful life and a connected

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
that a meaningful life and a connected
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.479
that a meaningful life and a connected
life are critically important if you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
life are critically important if you
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.690
life are critically important if you
have no money if you're destitute that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
have no money if you're destitute that
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.250
have no money if you're destitute that
that makes you unhappy if you're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
that makes you unhappy if you're
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.529
that makes you unhappy if you're
diseased that makes you unhappy but

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
diseased that makes you unhappy but
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.029
diseased that makes you unhappy but
above those minimum requirements having

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
above those minimum requirements having
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.610
above those minimum requirements having
a meaningful life that also is connected

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
a meaningful life that also is connected
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.500
a meaningful life that also is connected
to others turns out to be fairly

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
to others turns out to be fairly
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.950
to others turns out to be fairly
critical and when you think about it at

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
critical and when you think about it at
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.270
critical and when you think about it at
the moment of your death it doesn't

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
the moment of your death it doesn't
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220
the moment of your death it doesn't
really matter how much material stuff

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
really matter how much material stuff
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.130
really matter how much material stuff
you leave behind when I was young I was

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
you leave behind when I was young I was
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.700
you leave behind when I was young I was
in a very bad to automobiles it and I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
in a very bad to automobiles it and I
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160
in a very bad to automobiles it and I
had that moment where I thought about my

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
had that moment where I thought about my
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.600
had that moment where I thought about my
life to that point and I can tell you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
life to that point and I can tell you
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609
life to that point and I can tell you
that all the achievements all the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
that all the achievements all the
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.600
that all the achievements all the
material items meant absolutely nothing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
material items meant absolutely nothing
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190
material items meant absolutely nothing
that thing that I thought lasts about

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
that thing that I thought lasts about
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800
that thing that I thought lasts about
were the individuals who I loved and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
were the individuals who I loved and
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.460
were the individuals who I loved and
that was a small number and and my only

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
that was a small number and and my only
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.170
that was a small number and and my only
concern at that point was really just

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
concern at that point was really just
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719
concern at that point was really just
with with them and that's something I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
with with them and that's something I
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120
with with them and that's something I
think most people if not everyone goes

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
think most people if not everyone goes
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130
think most people if not everyone goes
through at the end and it's you know in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
through at the end and it's you know in
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.240
through at the end and it's you know in
some ways it was a gift from me to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
some ways it was a gift from me to
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.280
some ways it was a gift from me to
realized that when I still had a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
realized that when I still had a
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.710
realized that when I still had a
lifetime with them and I think if we can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
lifetime with them and I think if we can
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.539
lifetime with them and I think if we can
realize that then that contributes to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
realize that then that contributes to
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.280
realize that then that contributes to
greater happiness as well

human nature is defined variously by

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520
human nature is defined variously by
 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.240
human nature is defined variously by
different authors and scientists so it's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250
different authors and scientists so it's
 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.250
different authors and scientists so it's
worth trying to define what I mean by it

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260
worth trying to define what I mean by it
 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.040
worth trying to define what I mean by it
some describe human nature I think what

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050
some describe human nature I think what
 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.410
some describe human nature I think what
you mean by human nature as the genetics

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420
you mean by human nature as the genetics
 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.740
you mean by human nature as the genetics
as what's biologically determined and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750
as what's biologically determined and
 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.160
as what's biologically determined and
that is not how I'm using the term human

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170
that is not how I'm using the term human
 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.820
that is not how I'm using the term human
nature to me is why what is our nature

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
nature to me is why what is our nature
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.650
nature to me is why what is our nature
as humans as simple as that

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660
as humans as simple as that

asked whether nature or nurture genes or

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700
asked whether nature or nurture genes or
 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.100
asked whether nature or nurture genes or
environment were more important to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110
environment were more important to
 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.770

behavior said that's a little bit like

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780
behavior said that's a little bit like
 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.920
behavior said that's a little bit like
asking whether the length or the width

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930
asking whether the length or the width
 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.410
asking whether the length or the width
of a rectangle contributes more to the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420
of a rectangle contributes more to the
 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.240
of a rectangle contributes more to the
area of the rectangle it's boats so we

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
area of the rectangle it's boats so we
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.940
area of the rectangle it's boats so we
are genetic machines but those genes

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950
are genetic machines but those genes
 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.600
are genetic machines but those genes
have been selected by environments by

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610
have been selected by environments by
 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.890
have been selected by environments by
cultures they promote adaptive behavior

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900
cultures they promote adaptive behavior
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.560
cultures they promote adaptive behavior
and environments and in cultures they're

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570
and environments and in cultures they're
 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.590

deeply interactive when it comes to mind

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600
deeply interactive when it comes to mind

deeply interactive when it comes to mind
and behavior with the environment and

and behavior with the environment and
 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.539
and behavior with the environment and
with culture and so I think about human

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549
with culture and so I think about human
 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.530

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.770
machinery we have what can we do
socially and culturally and how do those

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780
socially and culturally and how do those
 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.600
socially and culturally and how do those
combine to create the mind and behavior

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610
combine to create the mind and behavior
 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.730
combine to create the mind and behavior
that we see in everyday life

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740
that we see in everyday life

I wrote the book for two reasons and I

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070
I wrote the book for two reasons and I
 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.500
I wrote the book for two reasons and I
wrote the book with bill Patrick Liu is

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
wrote the book with bill Patrick Liu is
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.930
wrote the book with bill Patrick Liu is
a wonderful wonderful friend and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940
a wonderful wonderful friend and
 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.620
a wonderful wonderful friend and
colleague now and so I'll say we wrote

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630
colleague now and so I'll say we wrote
 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.860
colleague now and so I'll say we wrote
the book for two reasons one reason was

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
the book for two reasons one reason was
 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.550
the book for two reasons one reason was
because I think loneliness is babby

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560
because I think loneliness is babby
 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.920
because I think loneliness is babby
misunderstood and that's to the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930
misunderstood and that's to the
 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.750
misunderstood and that's to the
detriment of 60 million people in

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760
detriment of 60 million people in
 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.600
detriment of 60 million people in
America it's about 20 percent of the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610
America it's about 20 percent of the
 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.880
America it's about 20 percent of the
individuals filled only to any one point

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890
individuals filled only to any one point
 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.830
individuals filled only to any one point
in time and that's a lot of people to

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840
in time and that's a lot of people to
 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.700
in time and that's a lot of people to
have miserable for perhaps unnecessary

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710
have miserable for perhaps unnecessary
 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.970
have miserable for perhaps unnecessary
reasons and I thought the science was at

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980
reasons and I thought the science was at
 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.270
reasons and I thought the science was at
a point where we could perhaps with an

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280
a point where we could perhaps with an
 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.980
a point where we could perhaps with an
intelligent book help them but there was

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990
intelligent book help them but there was
 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.370
intelligent book help them but there was
a deeper reason and that is that it's a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380
a deeper reason and that is that it's a
 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.170
a deeper reason and that is that it's a
book about social neuroscience it's a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180
book about social neuroscience it's a
 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.290
book about social neuroscience it's a
book about who are we as humans and I

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300
book about who are we as humans and I
 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.420
book about who are we as humans and I
think the focus on the solitary

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430
think the focus on the solitary
 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.410
think the focus on the solitary
individual and about us as cognitive

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420
individual and about us as cognitive
 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.750
individual and about us as cognitive
machines as solitary computers is wrong

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760
machines as solitary computers is wrong
 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.400
machines as solitary computers is wrong
I mean fundamentally I think it's the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410
I mean fundamentally I think it's the
 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.820
I mean fundamentally I think it's the
wrong idea we are not solitary computers

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830
wrong idea we are not solitary computers
 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.020
wrong idea we are not solitary computers
we are information processing devices

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030
we are information processing devices
 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.850
we are information processing devices
but we're much more like the Internet

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860
but we're much more like the Internet
 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.850
but we're much more like the Internet
and that the capacity comes from our

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860
and that the capacity comes from our
 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.430
and that the capacity comes from our
ability to connect with other similar

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440
ability to connect with other similar
 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.110
ability to connect with other similar
devices out there and to reconfigure

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120
devices out there and to reconfigure
 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.060
devices out there and to reconfigure
that's where the real power of computing

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070
that's where the real power of computing
 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.400
that's where the real power of computing
is today including human computing but

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410
is today including human computing but
 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.170
is today including human computing but
that's a very very different depiction

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180
that's a very very different depiction
 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.670
that's a very very different depiction
and so I thought it was worth raising

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680
and so I thought it was worth raising
 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.190
and so I thought it was worth raising
that point of discussion for a broad

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200
that point of discussion for a broad
 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.580
that point of discussion for a broad
audience and I hope the book does
