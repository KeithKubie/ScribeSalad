00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:11.366
The human brain is one of the most
sophisticated organs in the world,

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.157
a supercomputer made of billions
of neurons

00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:19.463
that processes and controls all
of our senses, thoughts, and actions.

00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:23.587
But there was something Charles Darwin
found even more impressive:

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:25.963
the brain of an ant,

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:30.792
which he called one of the most
marvelous atoms of matter in the world.

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:35.006
If you find it hard to believe that
something so tiny

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:36.556
could have a complex brain,

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:37.969
you're not alone.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.897
In his project to classify and describe
all living things,

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:47.825
Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus
assumed insects had no brains at all.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.299
He was wrong, but understandably so.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.459
Insect brains are not only miniscule,

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:57.778
but in many respects, 
they function differently than our own.

00:00:57.778 --> 00:00:59.675
One of the most noticeable differences

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:04.072
is that an insect that loses its head
can still walk,

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:05.173
scratch itself,

00:01:05.173 --> 00:01:06.037
breathe,

00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:08.065
and even fly.

00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:11.544
This is because while our nervous system
works like a monarchy,

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:13.314
with the brain calling the shots,

00:01:13.314 --> 00:01:18.019
the insect nervous system works
more like a decentralized federation.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.813
Many insect activities,
like walking or breathing,

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:26.135
are coordinated by clusters of neurons,
also known as ganglia,

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:28.153
along their bodies.

00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:33.176
Together with the brain, these local 
ganglia form the insect nervous system.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:37.248
While an insect can do a lot with just
its local ganglia,

00:01:37.248 --> 00:01:39.886
the brain is still crucial 
for its survival.

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:43.403
An insect's brain lets it perceive
the world through sight and smell.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.467
It also chooses suitable mates,

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:48.745
remembers locations of food sources
and hives,

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.412
regulates communication,

00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:54.408
and even coordinates navigation
over huge distances.

00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:57.276
And this vast diversity of behaviors

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:01.589
is controlled by an organ 
the size of the head of a pin,

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:03.458
with less than one million neurons,

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:06.698
compared to our 86 billion.

00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:10.913
But even though the insect brain
is organized very differently from ours,

00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:13.143
there are some striking similarities.

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:17.683
For example, most insects have
smell detectors on their antennae,

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:20.443
similar to those found in human noses.

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:25.726
And our primary olfactory brain regions
look and function rather similarly,

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:30.494
with clusters of neurons activated
and deactivated in precise timing

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:33.322
to code for specific scents.

00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:36.349
Scientists have been astonished
by these similarities

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.055
because insects and humans are not
very closely related.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:44.335
In fact, our last common ancestor
was a simple worm-like creature

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:47.715
that lived more than 500 million
years ago.

00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:50.576
So how did we end up
with such similar brain structures

00:02:50.576 --> 00:02:54.768
when our evolution took almost
entirely different paths?

00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:58.275
Scientists call this phenomenon
convergent evolution.

00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:04.417
It's the same principle behind birds,
bats, and bees separately evolving wings.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.740
Similar selective pressures can cause
natural selection

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.661
to favor the same evolutionary strategy

00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.435
in species with vastly different 
evolutionary pasts.

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:18.618
By studying the comparison between
insect and human brains,

00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:23.538
scientists can thus understand which of
our brain functions are unique,

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:27.956
and which are general solutions 
to evolutionary problems.

00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:32.587
But this is not the only reason scientists
are fascinated by insect brains.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.286
Their small size and simplicity makes it 
easier to understand

00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:40.056
exactly how neurons work together 
in the brain.

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:41.947
This is also valuable for engineers,

00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:46.197
who study the insect brain to help design
control systems

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:52.348
for everything from self-flying airplanes
to tiny search-and-rescue roach bots.

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:56.245
So, size and complexity are not always
the most impressive things.

00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:58.657
The next time you try to swat a fly,

00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:03.449
take a moment to marvel at the efficiency
of its tiny nervous system

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.629
as it outsmarts your fancy brain.
