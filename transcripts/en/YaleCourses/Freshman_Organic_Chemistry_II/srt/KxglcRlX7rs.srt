1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,850
Okay. So we're talking about nuclear
filling, substitution reaction.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,370
Uh, and today we're going to talk in the
next lecture as well about mechanistic

3
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:14,250
tools,
how you find out what the mechanism is.

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,750
You can talk about a plausible mechanism,
but whether that's really it or not,

5
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,770
and almost always there are several,
uh, requires experimentation.

6
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:24,780
So we're going to look at tools,
uh,

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,550
experimental tools you can use to decide
what the mechanism of the reaction is.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,590
So last time we saw a whole
bunch of examples of nuclear
affiliates substitution

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:39,591
reactions where a nucleophile approaches
a compound that has a low Lumo the

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,910
substrate, uh, it, uh,

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,040
reacts in a particular solvent to give
the product in which the nucleophile has

12
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,260
replaced the leaving group.
Okay.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,580
So now we're interested in what
the mechanism of that is. Now,

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,650
we talked last semester
about the possibility of
attacking on the sigma star on

15
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,700
the carbon and the sigma star and
the leaving group leaving with, uh,

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,540
with the electrons that were formerly in
the RL bond. That's certainly plausible.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,660
The question is whether
it's true because it's,

18
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,930
you'll see there are other
possibilities as well. Uh,

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,680
so there are many different mechanisms.
In fact, they're not all the same,

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,050
but they, but many of them fall in,
in the same two classes as you'll see.

21
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,070
And the one we're going to talk
about first is called nuclear fillic

22
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:29,070
substitution es en substitution,

23
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,760
nuclear fillic to means
second order and kinetics.

24
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:36,540
And you'll see what that means.
So sn two nuclear affiliate substitution.

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,130
And we're interested,

26
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:43,131
as I said in the pragmatic logic of
proving a mechanism with experiment in

27
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:47,460
theory. Now this kind of logic isn't
like the logic they teach you in,

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,250
in a philosophy or mathematics.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,780
Things are rarely a hundred
percent proven, but there's,

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,890
but there is a practical use to know how
these things work because it can help

31
00:01:58,891 --> 00:01:59,940
you in design new,

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,470
in designing new reactions or changing
the conditions to make a reaction work

33
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:08,530
better. So you'll see what it
means to prove a mechanism in,

34
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,050
in organic chemistry.

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,380
And actually mostly it involves
disproving all the alternative mechanisms,

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,700
right? You remember Sherlock Holmes in
the adventure of the barrel, coronet said,

37
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:24,480
it's an old maxim of mine that when
you have excluded the impossible,

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,050
whatever remains,
however improbable must be the truth.

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,670
That's generally the logic of how
you prove things and in a chemistry.

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,140
So it,

41
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,290
but the problem is you have to disprove
all of the alternative mechanisms,

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,550
which means you have to imagine all the
alternative mechanisms and disprove.

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,610
And of course it's always a possibility
that there's one you haven't thought of.

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,990
That's the real McCoy.
Okay?

45
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:55,890
Now let's just look at what has to happen.
You have to break the RL bond.

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,400
The leaving group has to leave
and you have to the new bonds.

47
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,000
So there has to be a dissociation
and there has to be an association,

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,420
and you could classify the possible
mechanisms in the sequence that's involved

49
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,620
in these two processes.

50
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,490
You could first have dissociation
and then association,

51
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,170
and we'll see that that actually happens.
That's called the sn one reaction.

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,640
You can have association
followed by dissociation,

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,210
which happens, but not with carbon. Okay?

54
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,780
And you'll see also the possibility of a
simultaneous or a concerted reaction as

55
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,511
you call it,

56
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:38,470
where you make the new bond at the same
time you break the old ones so that they

57
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:43,390
come at the same time. Okay? So that
seems to be pretty much the cover,

58
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,510
the territory of how you can do it.
Okay.

59
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:50,110
So you can have concerted where they both
happened at the same time association,

60
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:53,980
dissociation or dissociation,
followed by association.

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,050
And we can imagine reaction, coordinate
diagrams for these and geometries.

62
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,430
So in the concerted,

63
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:04,120
the nucleophile is coming in and
attacking the carbon at the same time the

64
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:07,420
leaving group is leaving,
and that's a transition state.

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,290
You can have a pentavalent
carbon intermediate.

66
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,850
So you first make the new bond and only
subsequently do you break the old bond.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,800
Or you could break the old bond and get
a tribe Vaillant intermediate and then

68
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,650
subsequently make the new bond.
All right.

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,050
So if we look at the
reaction coordinate diagram,

70
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:30,610
the first one just has a transition state,
but the other two have intermediates,

71
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,960
right?

72
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Either a pentavalent
intermediate of pentavalent
carbon or a try Vaillant carbon

73
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:41,020
intermediate right now
as I've drawn it there,

74
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,850
the first step is rate limiting.

75
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,590
We talked about in a complicated complex
reaction of two steps where either the

76
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,780
first or the second step
could be rate limiting.

77
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,190
It would be possible to imagine the
second step to be rate limiting as well.

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
However,
that might not be so common.

79
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,500
We will ask what's normally
the case in a reaction? Uh,

80
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,080
these ones where the second step is,

81
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,260
has a higher barrier are not so common
if you have an exothermic process because

82
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:15,340
it's against, uh, it's against
the Hammonds postulate.

83
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,830
Not that it couldn't be because see,

84
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:21,130
you have the intermediate
and you can go either to the,

85
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:24,280
to the product or back to
the starting material, right?

86
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,720
But if the second step is right liberty
and imply it implies that you have a

87
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:33,250
higher barrier going to the lower
energy product, which could be,

88
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,810
but it's not so likely.

89
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,890
So it's much more likely to have these
up at the top in a reaction that's

90
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:39,760
exothermic.

91
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Of course the same reaction run
backwards would retrace the same path and

92
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,580
running this backwards would have
the second step rate limiting.

93
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,850
But generally we're going to talk about
cases where the first step is rate

94
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,330
limiting cause we're interested in
reactions that go to give a product,

95
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,000
not the ones that come back from the
product to the starting material so much.

96
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,680
Now if you have, uh,
three different others,

97
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,940
substituents on the carbon that's being
attacked other than the leaving group

98
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:12,530
that's leaving, then you have
the possibility of [inaudible].

99
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,550
Right?
So the,

100
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,000
the first transition state and the
pentavalent intermediate or Chiral,

101
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,650
but the tribe aelant intermediate,
since it's, if it's plainer,

102
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,860
is a chiral and that means that you're,

103
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:29,861
there are stereo chemical implications
because in the first two cases,

104
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,700
the nucleophile comes on on the opposite
face from where the leaving group is

105
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:38,930
leaving. But in the third case, when
you have the travail and intermediate,

106
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,680
it could do that, but it could
also come in from the other side.

107
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,320
So you would get two enantiomers.

108
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,300
So the stereo chemical consequences,
the stereochemistry of the product,

109
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,470
whether it's inverted from the
starting material or whether it's uh,

110
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,470
received make you tacked both sides will
tell you something about the mechanism.

111
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,910
I suppose if we want to be a
complete in our thinking about this,

112
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,750
we could also imagine that there
would be a front side attack where the

113
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:12,970
nucleophile would come in on the
same face that the, that the uh,

114
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,340
leaving group is leaving either in a
concerted process or in a process with the

115
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:23,810
pentavalent intermediate where nucleophile
and leaving group are on the same

116
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,600
side. That's a possibility
which isn't shown here,

117
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,060
but whichever it is,

118
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,450
it's [inaudible] whether it's the
same side or the opposite side,

119
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,900
the first two cases are going to give a
single keyer [inaudible] of the product

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,580
where the tribe and intermediate
will give both. Okay.

121
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:45,581
Now there are tools for testing that
is for excluding mechanisms and they

122
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,410
involve stereochemistry rate,

123
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:53,411
law rate constant and structure a
ex-ray work and quantum mechanics.

124
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,510
And a, in the particular book that you
might be using the, the uh, Jones book,

125
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,290
these are in the sections indicated. They
are now indicate those as we go along,

126
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,870
but these things will be
covered in all the texts, so,

127
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,770
so you'll see a good treatment
almost anywhere. Okay.

128
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:13,220
We're first going to look
at Stereo Chemistry, what
we were just talking about.

129
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,660
So when you have nuclear Felix
substitution where the nucleophile, uh,

130
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,340
comes in place of the leaving group,
he could either do exactly that.

131
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,900
It could replace the leaving group.

132
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:31,490
So the nucleophile is on the right and
the product the same way that the leaving

133
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,710
group was on the right
and the starting material.

134
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,800
So they just changed positions or
it could be a displacement where the

135
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:45,281
nucleophile comes in on the opposite side
and the things that make it chiral are

136
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:50,120
inverted. Right. You could imagine
either way. Which do you think,

137
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,730
if you were naive and in the 19th century,

138
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,360
which do you think you would think more
likely that would actually replace the

139
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:01,200
thing it took? That it was,
uh, it was exchanging with,

140
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,200
or that it would come in
and invert everything.

141
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,450
Which do you think you would
have thought was more likely?

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,560
How many would think it more likely than
if you're going to replace something,

143
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,550
you replace it,
how many things it would displace it.

144
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,810
That's exactly what they thought in
the 19th century that it should be

145
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,580
replacement,
not displacement.

146
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,930
So when it was found in 1898 that
there was an example where it,

147
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,140
where it inverted the configuration.
Emile Fisher,

148
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,260
the guy who invented the Fischer
projection after all, uh,

149
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:38,370
who was a big experience
expert on stereochemistry
at the turn of the century,

150
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,610
said this was the most out astounding
discovery and stereochemistry since the

151
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:48,540
groundbreaking work of Vance Hoff, which
was a quarter century earlier, right?

152
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,220
So he was really astounding to these
people that it could invert the

153
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:57,900
stereochemistry and they thought this
weird tastes that showed that was that

154
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:02,490
just that a weird case. But the normal
case must be replacement, right? So the,

155
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,210
the goal then was to find
out which one was normal.

156
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,460
And that's the first really
good evidence on this.

157
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:15,720
And a beautiful experiment was done in
England by Kenyon and Phillips in night

158
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,750
in 1923 edit involved this
alcohol and they resolved it.

159
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,860
And got a single Nancy
murder, which rotated light
33 degrees plus to the right.

160
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,420
Okay. Now they want to do
a substitution reaction,

161
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,930
replaced the Oah by something else.
Right?

162
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,730
And see whether the configuration is
the same or whether it's been inverted.

163
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,550
Notice incidentally, that if
you do, if in doing the process,

164
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:48,390
you do two steps,
you'll get the same ultimate product,

165
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:53,130
whether it's to inversions or
two retentions of configuration,

166
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,830
they'll both give the same product,
okay?

167
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,340
So you have to have just one step that
involves the nuclear fillic substitution

168
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:06,390
reaction. So now in the first place, Oh, H
minus, as we'll see later in the lecture,

169
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,270
is a crummy leaving group.
You can't undergo that,

170
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,870
the replacement reaction
easily with, Ooh, okay.

171
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,730
So what they did first was to react
it with this chloro. So phonic acid,

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,320
right? And this is indeed a nuclear
fillic substitution where, oh,

173
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:25,920
attacks sulfur this
time, not carbon, right?

174
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,900
And then chloride leaves.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,000
So now you have a product where the group
attached to the chiral carbon is not,

176
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,680
Ooh, but oh with sulfur on it.
Right? Notice incidentally,

177
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,670
this, nothing happened to the
chiral carbon at this stage.

178
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:43,290
The reaction was that the oxygen,

179
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,010
so whatever configuration to the carbon
you had in the starting material you

180
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:51,840
have in the product, this is
not an interesting reaction
Stereo chemically, right?

181
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,020
It's just a way to there get there to
be a group that'll leave and notice that

182
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,950
this is,
this mechanism is ady.

183
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,070
It's first association attack the
sulfur and then dissociation lose the

184
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,414
chloride.

185
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,050
And the reason you can do that is that
there's a vacant Dior but alon sulfur.

186
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:15,520
So there's a way to that. You can form
a new bond without breaking the old one.

187
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:19,600
You don't have to attack sigma star.
And once you have this product,

188
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,490
that now is a good leaving group because
if you break the bond to carbon between

189
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:28,780
carbon and oxygen,
now the anti and you get as not o h minus,

190
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,100
but an anti analogous to the
anti in of sulfuric acid,

191
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,370
o s o two, right? Okay.

192
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:41,371
Now that has a rotation of plus 31 degrees
and the starting material was plus 33

193
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,800
degrees.
So that confirms what we were saying,

194
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:49,390
that the configuration hasn't changed
right? At the chiral carbon, am I right?

195
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,160
Is that a good inference

196
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,560
that it's plus in the product and
plus in the starting material,

197
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,320
does that prove that the
carbon didn't turn inside out?

198
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,650
How things approved it
or at least supported it?

199
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,340
How many think it had
nothing to do with it? Right?

200
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,000
Because they're different
compounds and who,

201
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,340
who knows how they're going
to rotate light so that
doesn't prove anything. Okay.

202
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:18,280
Now we're going to do the nuclear
Phillips substitution reaction.

203
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:21,640
Where the an eye on is acetate.
Okay,

204
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,720
and it's going to attack the carbon
and break the bond from carbon.

205
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,300
So the nucleophile attacks,
the leaving group leaves.

206
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,280
This is the reaction we're interested in,

207
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:34,570
whether it inverts the configuration
and we find out that we get that product

208
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,840
and that's the nuclear
Phillips substitution.

209
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:42,790
It's saturated carbon and the rotation
to that product is minus seven degrees.

210
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,740
So it was an inversion,
right?

211
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,150
It shows that the carbon turned inside
out because it's opposite the starting

212
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:50,500
material.
Right.

213
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,720
I hear you say wrong,
right?

214
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,000
Because it has nothing to do with it.
The same as the first step.

215
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,300
So we don't really know.
That proves nothing in.

216
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,930
The only way we're going
to prove is to get a star,

217
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:09,310
a product that's exactly the
same as the starting material,

218
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,980
except for the possibility
of configuration.

219
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,570
Then we'll know if it's the mirror image,
but we can't use any derivative. Okay?

220
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,940
So what we need to do is change
that. Oh, coc h three into,

221
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,850
Ooh, okay. And you can do that.

222
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,150
You can bring in hydroxide
attack at the carbon eel carbon,

223
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,800
which generates this
intermediate, right? And then

224
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,850
that can do this reaction,

225
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,390
breaking the CEO bond and
generate that an eye on.

226
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,730
Now there's another product.
Of course,

227
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:47,050
the top right of the molecule is this,
right?

228
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,950
You see it's got o, h, c, c h three,
and then that becomes a double bond.

229
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,670
So it's a CD acid, right? Incidentally,

230
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:58,280
notice this is a substitution
reaction is to the,

231
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,860
the reaction across the
top was a substitution.

232
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,470
The reaction coming down was a
substitution. The reaction going back, uh,

233
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,250
at the bottom is a substitution,
but the top was a substitution at sulfur.

234
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,720
The coming down was the one we're
interested in substitution at a saturated

235
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,460
carbon. The one going across is
substitution at a carbonyl carbon,

236
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,900
right?
That one.

237
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,820
So o h minus comes in and
this anti and comes off.

238
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:26,991
But again,

239
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:31,991
it's possible to do that by association
first and then dissociation,

240
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,530
because there's that vacant
Pi Star orbital that you
can go in without breaking

241
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:38,450
anything away.
Okay?

242
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,960
So we're not interested in the one on
the top and the one on the bottom or

243
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:45,770
interested in that one that comes
down the side. That's the reaction.

244
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:49,490
We're interested in nuclear physics
substitution at saturated carbon.

245
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,110
Okay? Now notice the,
uh, the product here.

246
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,110
Remember that was an acid and
this was an an ion. But of course,

247
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,160
this is a stronger acid than hydroxides
of the proton will be transferred in

248
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:01,994
this direction.

249
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,040
And now we have a product which is the
same as the starting material except

250
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,460
possibly for its configuration,
right?

251
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,150
So the question is,
is it the same as the starting material?

252
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:17,450
Is the normal course of the reaction,

253
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,410
a replacement or a displacement,
right?

254
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,750
And the rotation is minus 32 where
of plus 33 before. There's just,

255
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:31,400
that's experimental error, the
difference. So it's a displacement, right?

256
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,530
Inverted the configuration. And so we
know that in this kind of reaction,

257
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,540
backside attack on the carbon,
the kind we anticipated, uh,

258
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,840
although nobody could have thought about
it in 1923 on the basis of a sigma star

259
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:50,150
orbital being attacked where it's big,
okay.

260
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,850
So backside attack in nuclear
Phillips substitution,

261
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:55,700
that saturated carbon
and noticing this scheme,

262
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,210
that's the only case where you
broke a bond to that carbon.

263
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,430
That's the beauty and
the design of the scheme.

264
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,640
Now there's another nice feature
in the design of the scheme.

265
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,090
It looks a little clunky actually,
to have to do all those things.

266
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,460
And you might wonder why not avoid all
that stuff going around the bottom by

267
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:18,461
just doing hydroxide attacking
this a sulfonate Esther,

268
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,520
right? Cause if you brought
hydroxide in there and this left,

269
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,050
you'd get this product right? And you
do it without all of this stuff, right?

270
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,460
But there was a reason in the experimental
design they did that because if you

271
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:36,050
use hydroxide have much
stronger base than Acetate is,

272
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,270
then it turns out it attacks that
hydrogen and pulls it off when the leaving

273
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:45,170
group leaves. So you generate
a double bond there, right?

274
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,790
So you don't get the product and you,

275
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,000
and of course that stuff is a
chiral not you really cared. Okay.

276
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,410
But you don't do the reaction if you use
hydroxide. So they had to use acetate.

277
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,820
So this was a very clever experimental
design and proved that the,

278
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,230
that inversion is the normal course
backside attack on the carbon.

279
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,910
Okay, so inversion, right.

280
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,430
So the tribal and intermediate,

281
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:14,750
remember could have been attacked
from either face and would have given,

282
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,870
given receiving product.
So we can be confident than in this case.

283
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,250
That's not the mechanism.

284
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,970
That doesn't mean there couldn't
be a case where it's the mechanism,

285
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,660
but it's not the mechanism in this kind
of case and things that are related to

286
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,490
it.
Okay.

287
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,270
So Stereo chemistry is a good
tool and it shows inversion,

288
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,000
which means that it's not
front side attack. Right.

289
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,520
A concerted front side attack,

290
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,930
not a pentavalent intermediate where
the nucleophile came in on the same side

291
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:48,190
that the leaving group was leaving.

292
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,880
And it also means that you can't have
had the travail and intermediate.

293
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,690
Now let's look at the rate law,
what it can tell us,

294
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:57,880
how the rate depends on concentration.

295
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,300
So this reaction I'm showing here is f
oxide and iron attacking ethyl bromide.

296
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:06,640
So the f oxide replaces bromide,

297
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:10,300
is the leaving group and we're looking
at the rate of forming the product or

298
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:15,301
losing the starting material as a function
of how much the concentration of f

299
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:19,840
oxide is. And we're going to fix
the concentration of ethyl bromide.

300
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,850
It's assumed that ethyl bromide,

301
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:25,690
which is the subject of this whole thing
that rate's going to be proportional to

302
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:29,440
it. The question is, is the
rate proportional to f oxide?

303
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,150
So you plot the rate as a function of f
oxide and you get a line that looks like

304
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:37,120
that.
So it's a second order rate law.

305
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,660
It's proportional to how much ethyl
bromide you have and it's proportional to

306
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,310
how much f oxide you have.

307
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,270
So both of those things must be in
the rate determining transition state,

308
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,970
both the f oxide and the ethyl bromide.

309
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,800
Now there's something funny about this,
this plot.

310
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:54,850
Do you see what it is?

311
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,780
It's nice and linear.
So it's first order in f oxide,

312
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,950
but what else?
Asia.

313
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,810
It doesn't start at zero.
If you don't have any f oxide,

314
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,590
you get the reaction.
How can that be?

315
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,420
It's because although it's second order,

316
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,540
uh, wait a second, what just happened?
Did I press the wrong button? Oh, I,

317
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,030
this was just to say that the,
about the second order, sorry,

318
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,680
I got out of whack here.

319
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,600
So the initial rate limiting dissociation
in the Di dissociation to association

320
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,930
would give a rate independent
of nucleophile. This one,

321
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:43,880
because the first step doesn't involve
the nuclear file only the second step.

322
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,180
So if the rate limiting step depends
on file, it can't be this mechanism.

323
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:53,060
So we could exclude it on this basis
as well as on the Stereo Chemistry.

324
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,850
But, uh, back to this,

325
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,370
we have the problem that
I should have brought up.

326
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,120
How can you get the product
if there's no ethics side?

327
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,360
Right? So there must be a be a
reaction that's going on all the time,

328
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:12,100
whether you have a thought side or not.

329
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,020
And then another reaction that depends
on f oxide. What's that first reaction?

330
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,240
It's for, it doesn't depend on
the concentration of f oxide.

331
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,310
So it seems to be a first order
process. It's constant, right?

332
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,630
How can you get,

333
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,650
well first order could be
dissociation followed by association,

334
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,370
so there could be some of
that going on all the time.

335
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,320
And then a little bit of this where the
f oxide attacks getting more and more as

336
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:45,340
you have a higher concentration of
ethoughts side, but that's not what it is.

337
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,120
Right?
This is done in ethanol solvent,

338
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,580
so the unshared pair on the oxygen of
the solvent can attack the same way the

339
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,710
unshared pair on f oxide can.

340
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,240
Of course the solve the f oxide has a
much higher homo because of its negative

341
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,670
charge. So we'll, we'll react faster.

342
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,090
But there's a lot of the ethanol
there compared to how much f oxide,

343
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,620
especially here at the beginning when
you don't have any [inaudible] at all.

344
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,180
Okay.

345
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,180
So that actually that second process
is a pseudo first order reaction.

346
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,300
It depends on the concentration
of ethanol, but ethanol,

347
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:26,820
solvent's concentration
is constant, right? So it,

348
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,960
it appears to be first order,
it's,

349
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,110
but it's actually some pseudo first order
a process where the first order rate

350
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:39,760
constant is k pseudo times
the concentration of ethanol,

351
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,120
which is not changing.
Okay,

352
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:45,640
so now we have these
two possible reactions.

353
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:50,641
F oxide or ethanol unshared pair
attacking the sigma star of Ethyl Bromide.

354
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,773
Right?

355
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,360
Now we can tell by how much
of this at this point here,

356
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:01,570
say when it's half and half, half the
mechanism is the pseudo first order,

357
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:03,760
half the rate is the second order.

358
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,040
Then we know that that whatever the
difference in these rate constant is,

359
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,160
is made up by the difference
in concentration so that
they have the same rate.

360
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,360
Okay? That is there's enough f
oxide, a small amount of f oxide,

361
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,410
but with a much higher rate constant.

362
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:25,660
So it has the same overall rate as the
pseudo first order rate constant does.

363
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,910
And from that you can figure out that
the second order rate constant is 20,000

364
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:34,120
times faster than the
first order rate constant.

365
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,340
So this is 20,000 times faster than
that now. Does that make sense to you?

366
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,510
Yeah, it does. Because you'd expect the,

367
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,540
the much higher homo of of the
and I n to attack more rapidly.

368
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,720
How much more rapidly do you have any
way of measuring how reactive these two

369
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:56,720
things should be?
These two homos,

370
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,950
any way of measuring how high the
relative height of those two homos

371
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,260
and their ability to form a bond.

372
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,760
It's what we talked about
in the last lecture.

373
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,530
[inaudible] PKA.

374
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:19,170
How different are they in
attacking approach? Okay,

375
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,530
so the analogy to that is attacking
protons and that's an equilibrium that's

376
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:30,320
easy to measure by the
way we did last time.

377
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:34,850
And we find out that their pks differ by,
uh,

378
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,721
by what,

379
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:40,721
17 and a half powers of 10 right here
or are they differ by only a little more

380
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:46,250
than four powers of 10 so you
might expect it to be even bigger,

381
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,150
right? The difference. Right. But in fact,

382
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,730
this has measured at equilibrium when
you've completely formed the bond.

383
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,160
Whereas in the nuclear
Phillips substitution, we're
only at a transition state.

384
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,620
We haven't completely formed a bond,
right?

385
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,380
So you don't expect it to be as as big
a difference by the Hammond postulate

386
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,050
kind of thing. You're only a part of the
way across. Not all the way. So it's not,

387
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,610
maybe not surprising that this is,

388
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,670
this seems a plausible rate rate
ratio in that rate constant ratio.

389
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,530
Okay,
so that makes sense.

390
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,680
So the rate law then shows that it
can't be dissociation first because that

391
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:31,370
wouldn't depend on how much
a nucleophile you have there,

392
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,620
nor can it be front side attack,

393
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,780
either concerted or
pentavalent intermediate and
then lose the leaving group.

394
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:43,340
It has to be from the uh,
from the backside. Okay.

395
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,140
Now another thing you can test is not
just how it depends on concentration,

396
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,770
but what the rate constant is.
In fact,

397
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:55,910
we just looked in the last
slide at whether these rate
constants were plausible

398
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,290
for a higher homo and a lower homo,
right?

399
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,740
So the rate constant will depend certainly
on what the nucleophile is hydro f

400
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:10,130
oxide versus ethanol, but will
also depend on what are, is,

401
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:13,850
what the leaving group is,
what the solvent is, right?

402
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,660
It also may be on the nature
of the product, for example,

403
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,810
whether the product is charged or not.
Right?

404
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,100
So all of these things will do,
will influence the rate constant.

405
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:29,780
And we're going to look at at the whole
set of them one of the time and see

406
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:34,430
whether these, tell us something about
the mechanism of the reaction. First,

407
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,590
let's look at the
substrate. The, our group.

408
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,040
So here are different
ours and the relative rate
constant for how fast they get

409
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:48,390
attacked by iodide,
uh,

410
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,820
uh, in, in acetone,

411
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,540
solvent at room temperature when
bromide is the leaving group.

412
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,580
So this is how,
how the relative rates as we change our,

413
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,110
we'll call Ethel one.
Okay.

414
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,990
Then methyl is much faster.

415
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,733
Okay.

416
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,690
But propyl is about the same rate.

417
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:15,830
Okay.

418
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,650
I saw propyl is ever so much slower.

419
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,120
Yeah.

420
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,780
The, the ISO butyl is faster. Again,

421
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,300
t butyl is very slow.
In fact,

422
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,920
you don't know how slow it is.

423
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:36,570
It's gotta be slower than that because
something else happens other than the

424
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,980
reaction we're talking about.

425
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:41,760
So all you know is that it can't
be any faster than that, right?

426
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,380
And neopentyl is really,
really slow.

427
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,820
Hey, now do these make sense? Uh,

428
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,330
let's look at it in two ways.
First,

429
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,600
we can have the substituents
on the Alpha carbon,

430
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,090
the carbon that has the levy group
on it. And notice here we add, uh,

431
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,170
one methyl group to that carbon.

432
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,360
Here we've added two methyl
groups to that carbon.

433
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,580
Here we've added three
methyl groups to that carbon.

434
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,590
So we can have alpha substitution,
but we can also have Beta substitution.

435
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,390
We can add methyls to this carbon.

436
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,650
Here we put one methyl on that carbon
here we've put two methyls on that second

437
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:22,830
carbon here, we've put three
methyls on that second carbon.

438
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,810
So we can try to classify it as we put
extra methyls on a particular carbon.

439
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,830
So those are the Beta substituents.
For example, one, two,

440
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:36,180
or three methyl groups on
that Beta carbon. Okay?

441
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Now notice that is we put a
methyl group on the Alpha carbon,

442
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,310
right?
The first carbon,

443
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:49,230
we add a methyl group to it in place of
hydrogen that increases their d that,

444
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:53,730
uh, as we add, it decreases
the rate by 145 times.

445
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,820
So there's a higher activation energy,

446
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,810
enough to slow it by 145 fold.
Okay,

447
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,940
now let's put a second one
on that slows it down by 128.

448
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,330
Another factor of 128 about the same.

449
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,770
So the influence of the first methyl
group is about, as in slowing it down,

450
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,100
it's about the same as the influence
of the method. The second methyl group.

451
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,190
How about the third methyl group?
Do you see what it does?

452
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,480
Oh,
incident.

453
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,480
So that means that it's raising the
activation energy by about the same amount

454
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:29,750
each time you do that.

455
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,800
So you might think that the third
one would do it by that amount. Uh,

456
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,910
but in fact it's,
it's all you know,

457
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:42,430
is that it's that it's greater than
15 times. Can't really measure it,

458
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,460
right? Because something
else happens. Okay.

459
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:48,460
Now let's look at the same thing
with respect to the Beta hydrogen.

460
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,880
The first one slows it down.
Almost not at all. What?

461
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,580
From one to 0.82 only by a factor
of 1.2 the second one flows.

462
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:01,810
It slows it down by a factor of
23 but how about the third one

463
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,800
slows it by 3000 fold.

464
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,530
Why does the third one makes so much
difference where the first two don't make

465
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:15,970
much difference of adding those
methyl groups? Okay, well here's the,

466
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,560
here's the case in methyl with bromide
ready to leave and we have to attack the

467
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,710
backside, or let us suppose
we're attacking the backside,

468
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:28,450
which seems plausible on the basis of the
stereochemistry and the rate constant.

469
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,290
Okay, that means we're
attacking that Lumo. Okay,

470
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,150
now let's look at that same thing. In the
case of the, of the Alpha substitution,

471
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,930
there's that between the red and the
and the second blue as the anti-bonding

472
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,240
node that's going to break. Okay,
here's the surface potential,

473
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,800
right? And that's the blue area is
the good place to put an an eye on,

474
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,390
so that makes sense now,
so we have methyl ethyl,

475
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,690
I saw propyl and t butyl,
right?

476
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:03,430
Let's look at the total
electron densities. Notice
methyl, the Arrow gets there.

477
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,740
Okay, Ethel, it gets there. Okay.

478
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,710
Although it's bumping into this
thing at the back a little bit,

479
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:11,950
but it could lean forward for
just a little bit to avoid that.

480
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,340
Here it's getting in trouble,
right?

481
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,850
That slows it down by
a factor of 23 right?

482
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,850
But let's say I've got the wrong one.

483
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,050
This was a hundred that's another hunt
factor of a hundred but this one is a

484
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,860
much bigger factor because,
because you just can't get there.

485
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,490
Now when you have three,
so the third one is what really stops it,

486
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,460
and this is called steric hindrance.
The space gets in the way, right?

487
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,290
So that's the effect of Alpha methylation.
Let's look at the Lumo.

488
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,170
It looks pretty complicated,
but let's,

489
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,480
but the reason I've put it
up is not to look at that,

490
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:54,460
but to look at that one orbital in the
context of the total electron density.

491
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,730
So there it is at 0.06 contour,

492
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,080
and now I'll put the total electron
density there and look through that to see

493
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:06,250
how much we can see of that. Lumo
that we need to attack. So you see,

494
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:07,690
you can really see it here.

495
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,270
You can see it a little bit
here and a little bit here,

496
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:13,840
but you can't see it at all
from the backside here, right?

497
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,910
So this one is going to be shut down,
okay?

498
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,570
And there's the surface potential and
you see the surface potentially even the

499
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:26,860
surface potential isn't as good here as
it is in the other ones for the anti and

500
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,910
to come in and attack.

501
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,750
Now let's look at the Beta methylate
methylation where we have this car,

502
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,440
but then we start putting one,

503
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,970
a t one two or three on that one,

504
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:41,930
right?

505
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,930
And here are the rates mirror 1.8 2.036
and then 0.012 why is the third one so

506
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,540
bad? Right? Well,

507
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:57,110
you'll see this one can get in there.
That one can get in there just as well,

508
00:32:57,111 --> 00:33:00,470
because this methyl group,
the substituent is out of the way.

509
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,930
You can put two of them out of the way.

510
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,320
But the third one you can't get out
of the way. Once you have three,

511
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:09,560
there is no way to avoid it.
So that one gets slowed way down.

512
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,140
No way to avoid the third Beta methyl
group. And there you can see the,

513
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,910
that you can't get any place near
the really good blue areas. Okay.

514
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,430
So, uh, uh,

515
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,170
this is consistent with the idea that
you have transitioned state involves

516
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,640
backside attack, right? Not
The planar intermediate. Okay.

517
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,890
Now there's a question,

518
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,190
might it be possible to
have front side attack?

519
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:42,370
Might it be just easier to do backside
but you could do front side attack if you

520
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:45,200
want. If, if, if the
other one weren't faster,

521
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,450
how hard is it to do front side
attack? Right? Okay. So is this,

522
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,600
is this possible?
Okay.

523
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,450
Or is it possible to form a cat,
Diane,

524
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,690
that's not planer,
right?

525
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,460
So could you have it bent and not
planer so that the stereo chemical

526
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,240
consequences would not
necessarily be inversion? Right?

527
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,530
Might it be possible to have a non
planar cat ion as an intermediate?

528
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,470
But remember that that Bh three,

529
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:20,471
which has the same electrons
that that c h three plus does,

530
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,890
remember we talked last semester about
x h three. That one that's a cat Diane,

531
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,480
or be in VH three.

532
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,660
You expect it to be plainer but still
might it be not too bad to have it bent.

533
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:36,850
Okay,
so this was the subject of one of the uh,

534
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,790
second really classic
experiment in the 20th century.

535
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,040
The first one I talked about,
which I really love,

536
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,400
is that Kenyon and Phillips that
proves that it must be inversion,

537
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,390
but there's another one that shows that
it's not possible to have front side

538
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,520
attack. At least it's, it's, it's very,

539
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:56,420
very hard and it's not possible
to have a non planar cat I,

540
00:34:56,421 --> 00:35:00,820
and at least it's very, very hard.
And that was in this experiment,

541
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,730
this paper published in 1939,
which if you click there,

542
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:09,440
you can download a copy of the paper
by Bartlett and Knox. So this is the,

543
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,070
your grant, your chemical
grandfather, right? PD Bartlett,

544
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,170
who was a young man at that time.

545
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:20,171
He was a 32 years old and Knox who was
his graduate student who was almost the

546
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:23,910
same age because he was
an African American.

547
00:35:23,911 --> 00:35:28,060
There was one of the first African
Americans to get a phd in, uh, in,

548
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,420
in Chemistry and was uh,
and uh,

549
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,060
if you click on that asterisk
you can download a story, uh,

550
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,710
an account of his life,
which is fascinating.

551
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:41,260
He's the grandson of a slave and
he had a lot of trouble in, in his,

552
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,900
that's why he was old at the time.
He got his phd.

553
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,980
But you can read about it there
if you want to. At any rate,

554
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,250
they specifically designed and prepare
this molecule to test the mechanistic

555
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:57,930
questions. This is, this is rather
different than just taking things,

556
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,760
reacting to messing around,

557
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,580
observing what happens and
then trying to interpret it.

558
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,820
They specifically designed a molecule
that would test these questions about

559
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:10,440
whether you could have front side attack,

560
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,820
whether you could have a non planar
cad ion and the one that wouldn't be

561
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:16,680
complicated by other problems.

562
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,580
So they thought through very carefully
and design it and then Knox had to

563
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:24,300
prepare it and study it. Right. Okay.

564
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:28,560
Now this is a comment about that paper.
In 1939,

565
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,440
Bartlett and knocks published the
account of their work on the bridge,

566
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:35,610
head chloride, apoe camp, full
chloride. That's where x equals c l.

567
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,980
I believed then and I believe now that
this was a fantastically influential

568
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:43,620
paper for 30 years afterwards.

569
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:48,390
No one really accepted any mechanism
unless it had been tested out on a bridge

570
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:50,910
head case.
Indeed,

571
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,380
the Bartlett knocks paper shaped the
interests and viewpoint of many chemists

572
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,110
about the kind of physical
organic they wanted to do.

573
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,300
And that's a quote from John D.
Roberts,

574
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,680
who's an institute
professor at Cal Tech and,

575
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,970
and one of the real leaders of organic
chemistry through the 20th century and

576
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:12,960
he's still living now. He
said that in 1975. Okay.

577
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:17,400
So this is a, this is a structure of
that molecule in balls and sticks.

578
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,960
And, uh, it became so important,

579
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:26,760
this kind of structure that people who
are in the field know how to draw quickly.

580
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,790
And I'll show you how to draw it,
okay?

581
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,590
It has that stick structure and
here's how you draw you first forum.

582
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,470
Or I do any how different
people draw different ways,

583
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:40,890
but you draw this sort of a distorted w,
right?

584
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,660
And then you start at the nearest carbon
and draw up and down and to the right.

585
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,620
And then you draw the last bond and you
draw it last because it goes behind that

586
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:56,820
one. So you make it broken. So it has
a sort of a three d aspect to it. Okay?

587
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:01,190
So that's, that's this, uh, this
case. And notice what it is,

588
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:04,720
is a boat Cyclo Hexane,
right?

589
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,480
That has a bridge across the top.
So it's a bridged compound.

590
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,760
And formally it's called a bicycle.
Oh. Heptane. It's got seven carbons,

591
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,420
the six of the cyclohexane
plus the bridge, right?

592
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,840
And you give numbers in brackets in
the middle of bicycle to say how many

593
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:26,430
carbons there are in each bridge.

594
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,460
So there's a two carbon
bridge between these two,

595
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:32,910
a two carbon bridge and a
one carbon bridge. Okay.

596
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,480
And that those two positions
are called bridge heads, right?

597
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,900
So this is a bridge head chloride
that we have in the molecule,

598
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,860
the apple cam full
chloride that they studied,

599
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:48,100
that they designed and then
prepared to study, okay,

600
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:52,120
now here's a space filling model of
it and there's where you would have to

601
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,000
attack to get at the
backside of Sigma Star.

602
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,750
So that's obviously out of the
question that you could get in there.

603
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,920
So the molecule is designed so you
can't do backside displacement.

604
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:07,000
The question is if you can't do backside,
can you do front side displacement,

605
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,870
right?
So the attack would have to be front side.

606
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,290
Now notice something else
about this structure, right?

607
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,810
That if you were to flatten that carbon,

608
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,970
if you were to lose the chloride without
attacking it and generate the cad I and,

609
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:23,710
and generate a flat cat ion,

610
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,870
that would require generating really
strongly strained angles here or here and

611
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:31,990
here. Right. And it was
estimated by Bartlett,

612
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,980
the knocks that that would cost
more than 23 kilocalories per mole,

613
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,740
which three fourths of that is 16 right?

614
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:42,700
So it would be 10 to the minus
16 factor in rate. Right?

615
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,740
Forget that.
Okay,

616
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,360
so they've designed the molecule so it
can't go backside displacement and it

617
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:54,160
can't give the cat die and either lose
the chloride degenerate the cat. Right?

618
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,710
So the cat eye,
and if you were to get a cat ion,

619
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,170
it would have to not be plainer,

620
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,850
otherwise it would be slowed down
by 10 to the 16th fold. Okay.

621
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:08,010
So they've set up to answer
those two questions now. Now,

622
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:12,490
but there's another possible competition.
Remember in the Kenyan and Phillips,

623
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,140
they couldn't use hydroxide.

624
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:19,090
They had to use acetate
because the reaction would
go otherwise if they used the

625
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:21,850
strong base hydroxide.
So Mike,

626
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:26,740
Competition from loss of Hcl to generate
a double bond be a problem here.

627
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:32,260
Well, although there are hydrogens
on the carbon adjacent to the cl,

628
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,650
the carbon bearing, the chloride,
there are Beta hydrogens,

629
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,120
but they're not in the position you
would need in order to get elimination.

630
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,600
Notice that if you had
hydrogens here, here, and here,

631
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:48,190
then you could do the elimination,
right? This is anti to the leaving group.

632
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,530
So you could do that and
make a double bond there,

633
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,630
but there are not hydrogens
here or here or here,

634
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,140
right?
So you can't do the elimination.

635
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,510
Those are Gauche not anti to the chloride.
That's going to be leaving, right?

636
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,650
So,
and even if you could break off h and cl,

637
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,200
this would be the double
bond you would generate.

638
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,740
Now think about that double bond,
right?

639
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,300
Here's The p orbital on the carbon
that used to have the chlorine in it,

640
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,213
right?

641
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,480
But here's The p orbital on the
carbon that now has only one hydrogen.

642
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,890
What's wrong?
They don't overlap,

643
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,340
right? There's horrid overlap. So in fact,

644
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,640
there's a rule called Brett's rule that
the carbon carbon double bond cannot

645
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,520
originate from such a bridge
head. Incidentally, I just,

646
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:47,690
I looked up Brett's paper yesterday
and it's interesting that Brett himself

647
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:49,070
calls it Brett's rule.

648
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,880
Usually somebody else names
that in honor of the inventor.

649
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:56,600
But Brett didn't wait around.
Okay,

650
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,470
so would competitions from loss
of hcl make it hard to do? No.

651
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,590
So here's the beauty of the
design of this molecule.

652
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,750
It can't do backside displacement.

653
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,640
If it forms a cad I and it has to be
a non planar cat ion and it can't do

654
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:13,520
elimination. So how reactive visit, well,

655
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:15,680
here's the part of the
paper that discusses that.

656
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,820
It says all attempts to
replace the chlorine failed.

657
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
You can't do displacement on this bridge.
Head chloride,

658
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,990
they refluxed it for 21 hours with 30%
potassium hydroxide at 80% ethanol.

659
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,500
And they didn't get any reaction.
Notice they said they were,

660
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,960
it was a little hard to do because the,

661
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,140
these vigorous conditions
attack the glass,

662
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:44,060
but they didn't attack
this molecule. Okay? Okay.

663
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,710
So that front side attack where
you can't come at the backside,

664
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:50,120
you'd have to come in from the front,

665
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,420
must be at least a million times slower
than the typical backside attacks and

666
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:59,690
probably much, much
slower than that. Okay.

667
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,580
Now how about the possibility of forming
the cad and they said they refluxed it

668
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:09,290
with silver nitrate in aqueous
ethanol solution for two days. Right?

669
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,880
What's the idea of the silver?

670
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,390
Because silver can attack the unshared
pair on chlorine and form of bond and

671
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:18,730
break the bond to,
to uh,

672
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,910
from the ar to leave a cat
die and have our right.

673
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,270
So instead of pushing by
attacking the backside,

674
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,130
you pull the chloride off, pulled the
chloride off, leaving the cad ion.

675
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,240
So that's a good way to
generate a cad ions, right?

676
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,880
Except in this case,
it didn't work.

677
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,410
There was no opalescence that
is the solution remained clear.

678
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,710
Why opalescence?
Because if you get this reaction,

679
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:50,210
the sodium chloride makes a precipitate.
And if you get just a little bit of it,

680
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:54,710
you can see a little bit of cloudiness
there, but they saw none. In fact,

681
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:58,070
as you can read here,
the reaction of silver nitrate with,

682
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,340
with one claw apple campaign is at least
two times 10 to the minus 10th at about

683
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:08,150
85 degrees. Now, the reaction in, in, uh,

684
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,920
in this one, uh, which,
uh, partly this compound,

685
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,390
so it's carbon that has two
methyls at an ethyl on it. Uh,

686
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,220
that one is this,

687
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,630
this one here is at least a
billion times slower than that.

688
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,610
And when this one was measured,

689
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,440
it was done 60 degrees cooler and
without the silver pulling on it.

690
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,910
So it's many, many, many
powers of 10 difficult to form,

691
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,000
more difficult to form this
cat eye and one that's bent.

692
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:44,360
So you can't form or at least it's very
hard to form bent cat ions and it's very

693
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:49,730
hard to do front side attack.
So this was a beautiful experiment that,

694
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:54,570
that showed that where they specifically
designed a molecule to answer these

695
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:56,170
questions and,
and,

696
00:44:56,171 --> 00:45:00,600
and it succeeded than it became the model
for many kinds of mechanistic studies

697
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,220
that were done over the
next 30 years. Now. Uh,

698
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,760
they're also an interesting cases
when the r group is in a ring.

699
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,410
So here's a no ring at all, just two
methyl groups than a three, four,

700
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:18,240
five and six membered rings and
we're going to displace the bromide.

701
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,990
Now cyclo pental bromide is almost
exactly the same rate as ice appropriate

702
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,670
bromide, which we're taking to
be one for relative purposes,

703
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,740
but Cyclo butyl is, is,
is very much slower.

704
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:34,530
What does that 200 times slower,
right?

705
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,480
And cyclo propyl is very,
very much slower than that.

706
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,050
Now, any ideas about why? Why?

707
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,390
There's nothing problem with cyclopentane,
but Cyclo butyl and Cyclo are bad.

708
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,170
What do you think about when
you compare those rings,

709
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,460
Chris Straight, right, exactly.

710
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,590
That one has 109 degree bond
angle and so does cyclopentane,

711
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:07,430
but the others have very small
bond angles. Now wait a second.

712
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,670
This strain is in the starting material.

713
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,750
If you destabilize the starting material,

714
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,720
you should make a reaction faster,
not slower.

715
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,620
So that in itself seems to be backwards,
right?

716
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,540
What the heck is going on?
Well,

717
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:32,240
let's think about the transition
state for the reaction.

718
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:35,690
How hard does it get from the starting
material to the transition state?

719
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:37,040
That's what determines the rate.

720
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,020
So the transition state
looks like this and it wants,

721
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:46,730
it's sp squared hybridized to make those
bonds to the original substituents.

722
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,870
So it wants to have 120 degree bond
angle beforehand at wanted to have 109

723
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:57,230
degree bond angle. Now it wants
the bond angle to be even bigger.

724
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:02,900
So if you have a 60 degree bond angle
and it wants to be 120 that's worse than

725
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:07,901
having 60 when it wants to be a 109 so
indeed the starting material is strained,

726
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,440
right? But the transition
state is even more strained.

727
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,400
So you always have to compare the starting
material on the transition state in a

728
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,480
situation like this.

729
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,460
So the increased strain in the
transition state is what slows it down.

730
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:26,870
Now how about cyclohexane?
It has a 109 degree bond angle here,

731
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,980
right? But it's slowed down, right?
It can't be this kind of fake.

732
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:34,030
It could go to 120 no problem.

733
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,930
No problem with making 120
Bhanda degree bond angle here.

734
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,110
Can you see what the problem
is in the six membered ring?

735
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,230
Why is it slower than five?

736
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,930
You remember the shape of the five
membered ring? It's almost flat.

737
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:53,830
A little bit puckered, right?
But cyclohexane is the chair,

738
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,420
right?

739
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,420
Which means that that chloride is running
into these two ch two groups right

740
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,040
here in cyclopentane.
Those other groups would be out here,

741
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,980
not up here,
right?

742
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,810
And you notice that it's strained
because that's the, the, the,

743
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,360
the line between the leaving group,
the nucleophile is bent here.

744
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,020
This thing is being pushed
back, right? So that's the,

745
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:23,170
so there's a different kind of strain
in this case that slows it down by a

746
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:28,000
factor of 200 compared to that one.
Okay?

747
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:31,690
So we've seen the rate constant
dependence on the nucleophile, right?

748
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,590
Let's now, now we're, we've,
we've looked at it on our,

749
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,610
now we're going to look at it just
really quickly on the nuclear file. Okay?

750
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,320
So here are a bunch of nuclear files and
they get faster and faster and faster.

751
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,720
Okay? Now, is it the same with
a proton? How about the pks?

752
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,370
Well here,
uh,

753
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,540
if we look at this water
as a leaving group,

754
00:48:55,541 --> 00:49:00,400
fluoride and hydroxide,
you'll see that indeed as it gets to be,

755
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,650
uh, uh, wait a second,

756
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,760
as it gets to be a stronger acid.

757
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:09,603
Yeah,

758
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,730
it's slow.
Is that right?

759
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:16,680
A weak acid is fast.
Does that reasonable or is that backwards?

760
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,750
A weak acid means it holds
onto a proton tightly.

761
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,063
Right?

762
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:28,460
But it also, we see is holding onto
a carb attacking a carbon. Well,

763
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,990
so that makes sense, right?
That makes a lot of sense. Okay,

764
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,730
so for first row elements,

765
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:39,500
the nuclear physics Felicity attack on
Sigma Star parallels basis of the attack

766
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:43,670
on h plus both require a high higher
home. We'll, we'll make it more reactive.

767
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,900
So far so good.

768
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:50,030
Now let's look at the halides
fluoride chloride bromide iodide.

769
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,470
Notice that is the,
as the acid gets stronger,

770
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,490
it speeds up.
Now it's backwards.

771
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,580
The halides are going backwards.

772
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:05,240
The better they are at attacking a proton,

773
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,770
the worst they are at attacking carbon.
That doesn't make sense.

774
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:12,860
And we see actually the same
thing here for oxygen and sulfur.

775
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,550
Sulfur is a,
is a stronger acid,

776
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,980
but it's better at attacking carbon.
This seems nuts.

777
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,313
Okay?

778
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:30,450
Now this is actually tied in to the effect
of solvent because if you look at the

779
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:31,670
relative rates in,

780
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,680
in water for attacking methylene iodide
with these different nuclear files,

781
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,850
you see this, which is essentially
what we see here. This is,

782
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:45,650
this is 14 times faster.
Here's 10,000 this is 160 times faster.

783
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:47,450
Here it's 80 times faster.

784
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:51,770
These are generic numbers and these are
specific ones for a particular case,

785
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,340
okay? But look what happens
if you do it in acetone,

786
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,150
it turns around.
So it's what you expect and acetone,

787
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,140
but it's backwards in water.
What's special about water?

788
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,110
Why are things backwards in water?
What's different about water and acetone?

789
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,890
Water forms.
Hydrogen bonds.

790
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,660
And when you form a hydrogen
bond to an an eye on, right,

791
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,160
you deactivate it.

792
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:25,820
You have to break the hydrogen bond in
order for it to attack something else,

793
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:31,700
right? So you can see that
this is sensible and acetone,

794
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,680
but as backwards and water,

795
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:38,870
because it's harder to break hydrogen
bonds to the smaller ions, right?

796
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,870
So as the ions get big like I have died,

797
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,330
then they're not very
much hydrogen bonded.

798
00:51:44,331 --> 00:51:47,630
And even though they're not so good
at attacking protons there, in fact,

799
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:52,250
veteran attacking carbons, cause you
don't have to break the water away. Okay.

800
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:54,710
We'll continue with this stuff next time.
Thanks.
