00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:05.350
 Whether you're saying tomatoes or tomatoes, it's clear that your accent is a hallmark 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.190
 For your personality. Everyone has their own tone so goats have different ways of saying the word "Bawawah" 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.030
 But what is the opinion of science about language acquisition and does your dialect say something about you? 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.210
 In a poll in America, 47% of adults found they had high-end British dialects, while 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.250
 51% of New York dialect was slut. Southern accents were considered nice accents but were 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.890
 Uneducated, while dialects in Britain were considered a function of intelligence. But it turns out 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.870
 Humans have a tendency toward others who look like them or have the same tone. Definitely, 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.760
 It is important to distinguish between native language and acquired language 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.469
 Native English accents depend on factors such as geographic location 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.940
 Social and economic situation. For example the London dialect of the working class in London is different 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 Remarkably speaking of the rich class. 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.329
 However, when it comes to non-mother language dialects (acquired) things become more complicated 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.829
 If you decide to move to Spain and learn Spanish and your native language is English, you will always speak 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.969
 An English accent - even if you stay there for decades. After the age of 12 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.310
 The length of stay does not affect your accent. Studies accurately determine the ideal age 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.939
 Is 6 years, with decreasing capacity from that point. 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.200
 Interestingly, some stroke patients wake up with a completely different tone for the original acoustic tone 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.060
 This condition is known as "foreign tone syndrome" you get as a result of damage 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 In a specific area of ​​the brain which is responsible for language processing. 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.819
 An integral part of the language is the "functional vocal unit", which is a different voice message 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.799
 They are used to form words, some of which are distinct for different languages. For example, the audio units are in 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.609
 The word "TH" is pronounced in the form of "y" or "w" as in the word 'the' and 'thing'. They do not exist in German 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.719
 Making it difficult for German speakers to pronounce these words correctly. On the contrary 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.770
 There are many "audio units" in other languages ​​as in English speakers we can not pronounce or even hear correctly 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 In a pilot study conducted on 32 Americans and 32 Japanese children aged six months 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.959
 Where they listened to the recording of a voice for "no no no" is repeated many times and when the registration changed to "la la ra" 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.069
 The toy next to the kids will light up and play a musical tune. They were the children's pampers 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.159
 To understand this and distinguish the difference between "No" and "Ra" results from audio and visual equivalent 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.069
 The children studied by the two countries (America and Japan) were able to differentiate 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.299
 The flash predicted the game but "No" and "Ra" are audio units 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.079
 It does not exist in Japanese. When this study was carried out with children aged 10-12 months 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.189
 Japanese children did not know the difference between this unique difference 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.620
 English vocal units show that the critical age in the identification and development of the brain 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.560
 Is usually for the 6 month period 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.400
 If you are trying to learn a particular language, no matter how old you are, tangled threads are made 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 This increases gray matter density and strengthens white matter networks. In fact 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.269
 People who grew up in a bilingual family are always more sensitive to mastery 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.640
 Linguistic differences compared to their monolingual counterparts. Tests have been shown on Edema 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.079
 Bilingual children found stronger brain responses in the macular and frontal cortex 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.480
 Areas associated with concentration and problem-solving 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.999
 But have you ever wondered why so many people hate their voice when they hear it? 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.269
 We will destroy science and challenge some people to come out with their recorded voice 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.859
 For your home you can see it through the link in the description below
