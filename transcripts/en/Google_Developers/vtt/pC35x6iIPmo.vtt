ALEXIS MP: Hi there.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.180
We're here back at Devoxx.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.610
Exciting conference so
far, lots of content.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.250
I have with me the Chrome guys.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.110
So I have Joe, I have Francois.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.660
These guys have been here
talking about Chrome Apps.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.190
And I'll start with you Joe.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.100
Can you tell us what
Chrome Apps are, even?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.297
And how they differ
from maybe, real apps?

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:31.880
JOE MARINI: So they're
relatively new.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.160
We officially launched
them back in September.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.640
We've been developing them
for a couple of years now.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.220
Essentially, Chrome
Apps are a way

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.400
to use HTML5 to develop real,
native-feeling applications.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.880
Applications that look
and feel like native ones.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.200
They run outside the browser.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.800
They work offline by default.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.840
They work on desktop
as well as mobile.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410
So it's a great
way for developers

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.530
to build real
native experiences.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.940
ALEXIS MP: A lot of things
you covered briefly here.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.455
You want to cover
the offline part?

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:02.080
What does it really
mean to be offline?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.038
JOE MARINI: Yeah, sure.

00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:05.269
So we're all familiar with
building web applications,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:05.769
right?

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:06.484
So you use HTML5.

00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:07.775
You build your web application.

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.010
It's online.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.520
So when you build
a Chrome app, you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.860
build it the same way,
HTML5, JavaScript, CSS.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.020
But all the resources
are packaged up locally

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.860
into an application.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.740
It's local on your machine
like an installed app is.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.339
And you can run the app
when you're not connected,

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:24.380
or when you have a connection
that's not so good,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.570
and it just behaves normally.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.810
ALEXIS MP: Great, so
that's really, obviously,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.710
very important.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.920
Another thing is you can
access computer, the laptop,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.200
or the machine's resources,
as in the USB port,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.220
or the file system,
and stuff like that.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.090
So that brings up
the ability to build

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.635
a whole new range
of applications.

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.430
Which typically a
web app could not.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.050
JOE MARINI: We leverage
HTML5 wherever possible.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.030
But when HTML5 does not
provide a certain feature,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.040
we have Chrome app
APIs that fill in,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.512
for things like file access, and
USB and Bluetooth, and sockets.

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.720
ALEXIS MP: So one of the
reasons I have Francois here

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.219
with us also is that's Francois
has been doing some of that,

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.220
which is integrating
with some of the hardware

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.180
available on machines.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.289
Do you want to tell
us more about what

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.340
you're doing here at Devoxx?

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.340
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: One
guy, actually in Google,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.420
named Louis, built an
awesome library on JavaScript

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.960
to be able to communicate
with those USB NFC reader.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.590
So what we've done is, we've
built a Chrome app which

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.130
helps with registration.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.542
And basically those tie here.

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:28.750
ALEXIS MP: So the wristbands
that everybody has here.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.000
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And you
can scan it and write to it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.600
directly from a Chrome app,
only with web technologies.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.300
That's just awesome.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.180
ALEXIS MP: It's used
here for registration,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.260
for delivering the
wristbands, checking what's

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.160
on those wristbands, which is
used throughout the conference.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.379
And we use those on Chromebooks.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.670
But that could be on any
machine that's running Chrome,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.461
which kind of brings
me to the question of,

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:54.657
how are these packaged
and delivered?

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:55.740
I mean, those Chrome Apps.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.420
JOE MARINI: So
basically, it depends.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.720
On desktop machines, they
are packaged up as zip files

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.957
and they are stored in
the Chrome Web Store.

00:03:02.957 --> 00:03:04.540
And so you go to the
Chrome Web Store,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.510
you download and
install the application,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.390
and it's the same
as you download

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.330
an app from any other app store.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.010
On mobile, we use
the Cordova library

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.310
to package up applications
as native apps.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.320
So they're basically native
apps that host your web code.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.730
And they get packaged as a
native app for that platform.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.980
So for Google, they
go in the Play Store.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.542
For iOS they go in
the Apple App Store.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.500
So depending on whether
it's desktop or mobile,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.970
that's how they get delivered.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.840
ALEXIS MP: How real are
Chrome Apps today on mobile?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.160
How far along are we?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.690
JOE MARINI: Well, it's
really early days right now.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.930
We have a team of
people in Canada,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.460
in Waterloo, that are working
on contributing to the Cordova

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.830
effort.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.320
We've got a good set of the
core APIs ported over now.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.920
We think that
probably by early 2014

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.500
we should be in good
shape for people

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.040
to start building real apps.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.140
ALEXIS MP: So how would somebody
go about building an app,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.640
pushing it out, and
making it known?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.320
So there's a store for that?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.190
That's how people
find out about it?

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.260
JOE MARINI: To build
it, it's really easy.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.780
You can go to our website.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.020
It's developer.chrome.com/apps.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.710
That's where all the information
about the APIs are stored.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.260
If you want to go to Github,
we have a Github repo

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.557
at github.com/googlechrome.

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:20.140
Then there's a Chrome
app samples repo

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.774
in there, shows all the samples.

00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:23.190
So those are
probably the places I

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.832
would start to learn
how to build these.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:26.540
ALEXIS MP: Great.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.650
Francois, how hard was
it to actually build this

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.250
once the library was available?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.125
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Once
the library was done?

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:32.730
So easy.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.890
And we are hoping to make
this library open source

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.555
so that anyone can use it.

00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:39.930
ALEXIS MP: It's
interesting to be

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.720
able-- NFC is obviously
not built in every machine,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.170
but certainly devices
like this one has it.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.610
It'd be great to be able to tap
into that kind of resources.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.690
Any final words on
where to go next?

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.878
What you expect from this
technology going forward?

00:04:57.878 --> 00:04:59.128
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Oh, dammit.

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.600
JOE MARINI: We're building
new APIs all the time.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.200
We've already got a lot of great
apps in the Chrome Web Store

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.380
that some great
partners have built.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.060
So we're continuing to see
some really good uptake

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.247
in the platform among partners.

00:05:15.247 --> 00:05:17.580
We're looking really forward
to getting these things out

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.580
on mobile.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.110
We're really looking forward
to people building mobile apps.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.722
So I think that it's early days.

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:25.180
It's just beginning,
and I'm really

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.412
excited to see where it goes.

00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:27.120
ALEXIS MP: Great.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.078
I think I heard good
things about your session,

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.300
certainly here at Devoxx.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.920
And people can catch
it soon, and [FRENCH].

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.060
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And
if I can add something--

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.500
ALEXIS MP: You should.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.208
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
So, Chrome API, great.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:41.440
But my hope is that
we'd be destroyed

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.800
in a matter of years so that
the web can [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.774
ALEXIS MP: So you're saying
HTML++, 5+, whatever,

00:05:50.774 --> 00:05:51.440
is the standard.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.648
JOE MARINI: It would be
great see a lot of this stuff

00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:55.230
get standardized over time.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.460
ALEXIS MP: But you need
to start somewhere.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.360
JOE MARINI: Got to start
somewhere, exactly.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.070
ALEXIS MP: Chrome
Apps, check it out.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.194
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Woo hoo!

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:01.440
ALEXIS MP: Thank you.
