00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.946
In today's video,

00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:02.460
we are going to find
out what happens

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.640
when you light a giant
rubber band ball on fire.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.300
[Music]

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.160
Guys, we've heard

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.300
that some interesting
things happen when you light

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.920
a rubber band ball on fire,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.280
so we're going to try
this with a giant one.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.360
That's not very giant.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.900
How many did you add?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.440
2,000.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.300
In case anybody's wondering
about how long this took,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.040
Lord of the Rings Two
Towers Extended Edition.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.220
Here's the idea.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.100
We're going to test burning

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.660
out a regular-sized
rubber band ball,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.780
and then we're going
to upgrade to an ultra

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.860
sized rubber band ball.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.480
So, here's we're going to do.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.595
We're going to build a fire.

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.850
We're going to try putting
our small rubber band ball

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.860
into the fire,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.900
but we weren't satisfied
with just seeing it this size.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.200
So that's why we upgraded.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
That's true.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.060
But there is a few things
I want to do with this

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.180
before we destroy it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.820
I want to drop it
off of something.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.160
[Music]

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.980
All right.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:11.680
[Music]

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.100
Not even close.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.660
[Music]

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.820
Oh, so close.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.500
One more.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.280
One more.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.940
Boing!

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.820
Yeah.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.120
There we go.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.300
Boing.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.200
Boing.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.100
So I just remembered something.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.380
I'm afraid of heights.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.240
We've now got a setup

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.460
that should be able
to direct some heat right

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.740
onto our rubberband ball
for as long as we want.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.180
So we're gonna start
with the little one,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.340
see how that goes,
and then upgrade.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.960
[Music]

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.200
And now we run away.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.580
[Music]

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.100
There's no such thing
as too much fire, Nate.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:10.320
[Music]

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.100
There's just not enough tension

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.660
on this smaller rubber
band ball to do much,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.232
or to look very cool.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.880
It's just kind of melting.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.300
It's pretty much just
on fire now at this point.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.760
If we used both of these burners,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.320
we're going to get
a lot of fire,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.558
but you're not actually going

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.440
to see the rubber bands
themselves snapping.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.940
So we're going to stick
with one burner for now.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.980
See what happens.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.520
[Music]

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.160
Already, already!

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:53.580
[Music]

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.560
Yeah, that's going to pop--

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.180
Mark, there.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.980
Oh, oh!

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.340
There it goes.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.060
This is the world's most
dangerous game of soccer.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.320
Okay, before I put
this back in the fire,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.100
let's take a look
what's happened.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.020
That is probably
400 rubber bands right there.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.940
Oh, this burned
away an entire side.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.260
Can you see that?

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.080
You can kind of
see here it burns,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.160
but then they spark,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.260
and when they start to get
a little bit tighter,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.031
they fling in every direction.

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.984
This is probably
the hardest layer

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:21.560
for me to do,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.620
just with how tense some
of these rubber bands are.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.812
So hopefully, they
should start flinging off,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.100
and it looks pretty cool.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.940
There. Perfect.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.420
[Music]

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.540
So all those little sparks are
flinging pieces of melted rubber

00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:44.205
that are still on fire.

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:46.120
It's like a mini firework show.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.560
[Music]

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.720
Every single layer is just
pulling off into hot--

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.940
Alright,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.160
don't stand that close.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.700
[Music]

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.340
They are actually
hitting Nate's coat

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.080
while he's working.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.380
They're not on fire,
but they were hitting him.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.320
[Music]

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.211
Now initially, I wanted
to try this project

00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:23.511
because this is
how golf balls used to be made.

00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:25.450
They used to have
a thick rubber core,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.500
and then they would wind rubber
bands around it before putting

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.904
on that plastic shell.

00:04:29.904 --> 00:04:32.400
Now, some may still
be made like that,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.960
but most of them aren't.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.223
So making a rubber band ball is
another really good way to kind

00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:40.217
of see that reaction of tossing
a golf ball in a fire,

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:41.928
which some people have done.

00:04:41.928 --> 00:04:42.740
I've heard about it,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.480
so I wanted to see
what would happen.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:59.380
[Music]

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.292
Guys, that's all
we've got for you today,

00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:02.506
but the fun doesn't end there.

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:03.905
If you hit that box
up at the top,

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:05.460
it will take you
to our latest video.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.774
The box at the bottom
will take you to

00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:08.629
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:10.276
And if you hit this bomb
in the middle,

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:10.982
you'll be subscribe,

00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:12.280
so you never miss
out on the fun.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.700
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.980
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:05:14.983 --> 00:05:15.700
Talk to you then.
