00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.849
Finding your inner neanderthal is definitely

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.980
the most fun class even though it's only

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.750
once a week for two hours, I look forward

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.579
to it every week. A different way of

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.840
thinking with the past trying to sort of

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.059
recreate it and so the idea was let's not

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.410
just study the stone tools they made

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.850
let's see if we can make them to really

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.579
gain an insight on how they did it.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.379
The Peabody Museum has fantastic

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.239
collections of Neanderthal-made artifacts

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.620
we've been studying them, we've been

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.930
looking at even fossil Neanderthals

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.230
that are here.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.540
It's a lot of hands-on learning and every week is

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.009
something new to look forward to and

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:55.930
a new things we're talking about. Reading

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.580
about things is great, but if I can do it,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.869
if I can touch it, if I could feel it,

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.970
that is a is a sort of experience that

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.430
I don't forget. There's something about

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.820
hands-on making your own stone tools and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.130
stuff like that, but we had looked at

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.979
pictures of stone tools but you don't

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.780
really get a sense of what the process

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.460
is like sitting in those chairs and

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.110
actually like hammering out the stone

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.930
tools. Making stone tools is pretty

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.030
tricky. You got to, at first, make sure that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.159
you don't hit your own hand because

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.170
that's one of the biggest thing, you've got these

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.600
rocks and you just think it's always

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.940
just hit it and it'll make a point,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.600
not really. It's almost like the physics

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.850
of how you like need to hit certain

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.400
parts of a rock to get it to be the way

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.060
you want it.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.470
We live in such a technological society

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.030
that we lose sense of the technologies

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.710
everywhere and so by sort of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.540
immersing themselves in making what in

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.100
some ways is the oldest technology, I

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.900
think that's a really powerful way to

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.400
appreciate the past.
