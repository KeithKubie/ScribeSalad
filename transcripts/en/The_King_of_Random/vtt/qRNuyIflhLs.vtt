00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today ballpoint pens
are extremely common.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.840
They are the most used
writing implement in the world,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.380
with millions of them
manufactured every day.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.980
Today, we are going to see
what happens

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.920
if we take the ink
out of 1,000 of them.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.040
A thousand pens
is a whole lot

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.300
but each pen only
has a little bit of ink in it.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.380
Amazingly that little bit
of ink is enough

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.920
to write for quite a while,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.600
but we want to do some tests
with a lot of ink at once.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.640
So we've got 1,000 pens

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.400
and we are going to take the ink
out of all of them.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.160
The plan here
is pretty simple.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.200
We're going to drain the ink
out of 1,000 ballpoint pens.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.500
Collect it all in a cup and then
subject it to a number of tests,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.960
heat, cold and vacuum.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.600
I did a fair amount of
experimenting to figure out

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.440
what the best way
to get the ink out was.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.600
I tried rollers.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
I tried just letting
it drain out.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.540
I tried several different things
and in the end what I found was that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.300
this metal rod that
is almost the exact diameter

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.600
as the inside of the pens
does a pretty good job

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.800
of pushing the ink out.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.600
Of course, there is
still a little bit left

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
on the sides of the tube.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.360
It's not a perfect squeegee,
but there you can see

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.600
about the ink contents
of one single pen.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.180
It's not more than
a few drops.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.760
But when we take enough ink
out of enough pens,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.300
I think we'll have
quite a bit.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.680
That's it.
Last one.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.880
That's a lot of pens.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.800
According to mix website,
each pen has enough ink

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.120
to draw approximately two
and a half kilometers.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.300
That means with all 1000
of these pens,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.500
there should have been
enough ink to draw a line from

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.740
Los Angeles, California
to Lafayette, Louisiana.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.280
Oh man, there's
pens everywhere.

00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:44.342
Who did this?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.420
Look at that.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.340
That is a big old cup full
of ballpoint pen ink

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.500
and this other cup
that has just a tiny bit.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.860
We started in this cup
and I was like,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.140
oh we might run out of space
and so I moved on to this cup.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.520
Thinking we might need
to move on even from that

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.700
but it did all fit in here.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.060
So we've just got tiny bits
in here and a whole lot in here.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.020
I want to just look at it like,
this is interesting stuff.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.400
So it's not thin,
it's not like India ink

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.820
or just ballpoint pen ink,
this stuff is super thick

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.200
like corn syrup.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.000
This here is black ink,
but it's not perfectly black either.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.400
There's just this little bit
of a metallic sheen to it.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.360
I don't really know
what color it looks like,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.620
sort of a ridiculously
dark pinkish purple color,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.600
but it really does look like
a black metal sort of thing.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.600
It is of course a little tricky
to get something so dark

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.780
to show up on camera well,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.620
but we'll try and get some
good lighting on it so it's visible.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.700
It's really dark
and it's really reflective,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.860
both hard to film.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:04:05.620
[music playing]

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.200
We've got this smaller cup
of ink that we poured out

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.740
and we want to see
what happens

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.140
if we throw this
in a vacuum chamber.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.200
You're probably curious.
I know I'm curious.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.680
Let's see what it does.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.060
See bubbles forming.

00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:24.942
Now I'm seeing lots
of bubbles forming.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.000
And now it's expanding
very rapidly.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.940
Holy cow.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.820
[laughter]

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.980
I let back in
the tiniest amount of air

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.200
and just all of those bubbles
disappeared.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.820
I think that means
that this ink

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.280
bubbles really,
really easily.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.800
All right,
that looks awesome.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.180
Oh, and it broke.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.740
I'm not letting any pressure
back in now and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.720
and it's--

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.160
it's not bubbling up
over the top anymore.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.300
It's bubbling a lot.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400
Today's video is brought
to you by Venom.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.680
Please give us money.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.080
[music playing]

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.800
That looks so cool,
like a boiling black metal.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.560
I'm amazed that
it's still bubbling.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.420
Like, is it degassing?

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.020
It might actually just be

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.100
evaporating some of the liquids
that are down in the ink.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.700
There are actually quite a few
chemicals involved in ball point ink,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.780
and interestingly,
some of them

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.560
take almost two weeks
to evaporate out

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.220
after you write
on a piece of paper.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.100
So that ink doesn't actually dry
completely for a couple of weeks.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.660
I'm going to let
the pressure back in.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.100
I don't think much
is going to happen.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.120
Yep, didn't really
do anything.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.920
Has a strong chemical smell.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.880
Although,
it's going away quickly

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.600
so it might have just all
gotten carried off.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.272
The inside of that cup is
about as covered in ink

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.952
as anything has ever been
covered in ink.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.200
That's what happens when you
put it in a vacuum chamber.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.600
What do you think is going
to happen if we freeze it?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.300
Now, I've got a bowl
of liquid nitrogen.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.640
And we're going to drip some ink
into it and see what it does.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.860
I bet it freezes.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.820
All right, let's pour some ink
in some liquid nitrogen.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.500
I'm going to start
by just dripping a little bit

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.200
in out of our cup here
and the stuff is really thick

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.100
so it doesn't pour
super easily.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.460
Ooh, and it gets even thicker
on contact with the liquid nitrogen.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.080
Ooh, and then it just
starts to shatter.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.300
It went in and started making
these fun little strands

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300
and then after it was in there
for a few seconds,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.260
it started kind of
exploding apart.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.100
We got ink dust.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:55.140
[music playing]

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.060
Some of the smaller
bits are now melting.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:08.760
[music playing

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.760
We saw that this made
some really good bubbles

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.580
when we were using it
in the vacuum chamber.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.300
I'm curious to see what happens
if we blow bubbles down into it.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:33.540
[music playing]

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.880
Just look like a perfect
metallic spheres.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:49.140
[music playing]

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.600
We've got some ink
in a metal bowl

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.140
and we're going to put it on our
little electric hot plate here,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.900
and we're going to see
what happens to it.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:10.780
[music playing]

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.560
There are some vapors
coming off of that ink.

00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:18.500
Although to be fair,
I don't know 100% that's from the ink.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.660
It might be from
the enamel on the bowl.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.700
May not be a cooking bowl,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.620
but it's white,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.860
I wanted to use it because
it makes everything so nicely visible.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.600
Now that it's hot,
it is a lot more liquid.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.520
Before it was more
like the consistency of corn syrup

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.452
and now it's like the
consistency of cooking oil.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.700
I'm going to try
and avoid breathing

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.620
those fumes
as much as possible.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.700
I'm not a hundred
percent sure what they are,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.340
but I bet I don't want it
in my lungs.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.540
[music playing]

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.972
I would call that
a rolling boil at this point.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.120
[music playing]

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.320
Now the consistency is
almost as thin as water.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.540
Well after boiling off,
whatever it is that boils off,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.860
it's the same color,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.400
it's just hard
and dry and gross.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.760
So don't boil ink,
nothing good happens.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.700
Vacuumed, bubbled,
Frozen and boiled ballpoint pen ink.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.600
It looks really cool,
it's got a cool color

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.300
and consistency and of course,
it's super potent like it stains your--

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.300
I am covered in ink marks

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.120
and I don't even know
where those are from

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.700
but I've had them
all over my face

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.860
and it's probably all
over my clothing as well.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.800
I still have quite a bit of this stuff,
a little over a cup of it

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.360
that I haven't used up
or burned or anything like that.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.800
So if you have any ideas
of things you'd like to see me do

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.800
with this ink let me know down
in the comments

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.440
and if we use your idea,
we just might send you 25 bucks.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.940
Guys, that's not all,
we've got more for you to see

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.260
that box at the top will take you
directly to our last video.

You should check that out.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.900
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.900
you should be watching next

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.340
