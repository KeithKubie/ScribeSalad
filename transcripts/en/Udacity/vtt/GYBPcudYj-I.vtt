00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.770
In the course, we're going to build 
a weather app called Sunshine.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.856
The main screen is a list 
of this week's forecast,

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:11.502
with an emphasized presentation 
for today's weather.

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:14.870
With just a quick glance, I can decide if,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.840
today is a stay inside and code day. 
Or if I should code from the park instead.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.256
We have icons 
to indicate conditions, like snow,

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:30.790
rain, fog or sunshine. 
We can scroll through the list,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.730
to see a long range forecast. 
With a click on one of the forecasts,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.900
we bring up a detailed view containing 
the rest of the weathery goodness,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.390
which also gives us the ability 
to share the weather with our friends.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.760
We can go to Settings 
and change the unit of measure,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.090
as well as the location.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.360
The app can even post 
system wide notifications,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.780
to let us know about weather conditions 
without even entering the app.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.546
So, you might ask, 
why are we building a weather app?

00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:03.252
We chose the weather app 
because it's a simple concept,

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:07.070
which touches most of the core APIs 
we want to teach and everyone

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.200
can relate to weather, 
unless you're in a bunker.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.270
By the end of the course, 
you'll be able to use those APIs

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.620
and concepts to build your own app 
for your final project.
