00:00:01.214 --> 00:00:01.939
Dylan: Alright welcome back.

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.609
A little new idea for you here
and this one applies to learning

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.603
and most certainly would threaten to turn

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:10.563
our current educational
system on its head.

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:13.184
What's unclear is whether
it's good for America.

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:17.852
A California school called the
Khan Academy is reinventing
traditional teaching

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:22.935
by giving students lectures that they
can watch at home on their own time,

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:27.475
re-watch them if they'd like and
then having them do the homework

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:30.807
when they're in school in the classroom.

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:33.621
Salman: By removing the one size
fits all lecture from the classroom

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:37.474
and letting students have
a self pace lecture at home

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:39.592
and then when you go to the
classroom, letting them do work,

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:42.224
having the teacher walk
around, having the peers

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:47.267
actually be able to interact with
each other, these teachers have used

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:50.725
technology to humanize the classroom.

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:54.358
Dylan: Well the founder, Salman
Khan, started out by posting lessons

00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:57.321
for his cousin on YouTube
and now the Khan Academy

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.158
has over a million
unique students per month

00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:03.667
and boasts more than 2,000
tutorials covering everything

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:08.819
from basic addition and subtraction to
advanced calculus, physics and chemistry

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.274
and joining us now is Ben
Goldhirsh, the CEO of GOOD,

00:01:12.274 --> 00:01:15.569
it's a company dedicated to moving
the world forward through its website,

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:18.682
magazine, videos and events.

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:21.818
He thought that Khan was one of
the breakout stars at this year's

00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:25.652
Technology and Entertainment
and Design conference.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:30.126
Before we get to all this
Khan Academy business Ben,

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:33.068
do you like it better when
we're on opposite coasts

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:35.401
or would you be comfortable if
I was to move out to California

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:36.819
to spend more time with you?

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.103
Ben: I would love to have you out here
Dylan, I think we do better in person.

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:41.770
Dylan: And do you feel
that you speak on behalf

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.672
of the entire southern
California community when

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:45.807
you welcome me into that universe?

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:47.110
Ben: The thoughtful ones.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.233
Dylan: (laughs) Okay the thoughtful ones.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:54.235
We won't get into how many thoughtful
ones there are but we will get into this.

00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:58.569
Why did you decide to feature
this so prominently with GOOD?

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.869
Ben: For the past two years,
GOOD and University of Phoenix

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.923
have been focusing on solutions in this
education space and we haven't seen

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:10.327
anything like it and to contextualize the
findings for you, look at Los Angeles.

00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:13.664
We have Teach for America, we have
City Year, we have KIPP Academy.

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:17.753
The best of the best of social innovators
but they're facing a serious problem.

00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:22.103
600,000 students in LAUSD with
a 50 percent graduation rate.

00:02:22.103 --> 00:02:25.791
That's terrifying and the
bottom line is the solutions

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.876
that we have on the ground, in my opinion,
aren't going to catch this problem.

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:31.414
We need a disruptive technology,

00:02:31.414 --> 00:02:34.374
we need to really revolutionize
how we're tackling this.

00:02:34.374 --> 00:02:36.585
Khan Academy is the first thing I've seen

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:38.541
that gives me confidence that
we're going to tackle it.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.374
It's the most exciting thing I've
seen that we're doing to do this

00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:43.958
so I'm pleased to bring it to your show,

00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.661
I think we're going to dig
into a good conversation.

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.761
Dylan: Alright let's have at it.

00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.207
The man behind the idea
joins us, Salman Khan.

00:02:49.207 --> 00:02:50.898
Founder of the Khan Academy.

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:52.567
High praise for what you've got going

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:55.070
from our friend Ben down
there in southern California.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.457
He's a thoughtful southern Californian,
is how he likes to refer to himself.

00:02:59.457 --> 00:03:01.673
What have you found is the
biggest problem with this?

00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:06.181
What is the greatest barrier, the
greatest resistance point to this?

00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:08.916
Salman: Well I think that one,
it's such a radical change

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:10.586
to what traditionally
happens in a classroom.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:12.207
If you're telling someone to
do homework in the classroom,

00:03:12.207 --> 00:03:15.996
it's not called homework anymore.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:18.697
But I think once teachers
and students get used to it,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:24.673
it's kind of like they start to
think about they even did before.

00:03:24.673 --> 00:03:27.509
Probably the biggest problem,
I wouldn't call it a problem

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.968
it's actually a great thing, in
the same classrooms we have a pilot

00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:34.015
over here in northern California
where you have a 5th grade classroom,

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:36.850
this is their math curriculum, and
that same 5th grade classroom there are

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.135
some kids doing 3rd grade math and
there are some kids doing trigonometry

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:42.854
and the teacher needs to
feel comfortable with that.

00:03:42.854 --> 00:03:44.523
But what's cool about it is that
they're getting a dashboard,

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:48.361
they see where everyone is and every
student can work at their own pace.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:54.868
Dylan: If you were to look, Ben,
at the problem of having different,

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.772
same age, but at different places, right?

00:03:57.772 --> 00:04:01.218
That's the whole thing with the
educational system is you got one kid

00:04:01.218 --> 00:04:06.180
doing trigonometry and another
one who's trailing behind.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.217
How do you see this, what did you see
about this, that you felt not only

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:14.801
addressed the drop out rate but addressed
the variability of how people learn?

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.385
Ben: I mean if you look at decreasing
budgets and increasing class sizes,

00:04:18.385 --> 00:04:22.549
we need to solve the efficiency problem
and teacher's time is a limited amount.

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:26.433
So having this technology where they
can evaluate on a person-by-person basis

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.885
where their kids are at and they can
have their classroom time to work

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:33.206
with their kids who are at
different levels directly

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:36.109
so they can be taking the lectures
at home through Khan Academy,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.579
that's a big solution
to a critical problem.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.469
Dylan: Salman walk me through
very briefly how this works.

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.287
Let's say I've got a couple of kids,
they're in a traditional environment,

00:04:45.287 --> 00:04:49.636
I'm intrigued by what your
saying, how would it work?

00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:51.218
Salman: So every student
works at their own pace.

00:04:51.218 --> 00:04:54.160
They literally do exercises at their
own pace, they start at one plus one

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.761
and they keep moving up all the way
through algebra or trigonometry,

00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:58.331
however far they want to go.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.000
If they have trouble with
anything the videos are there,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.219
they can actually watch them
at home or in class time

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.939
and the teacher when they come to
class, they don't give lectures,

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.217
they don't grade homework,
they don't give exams.

00:05:09.217 --> 00:05:10.636
They literally just get
a dashboard and they see

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:13.550
where every kid in the class
is and some kids may be ahead

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.136
and some kids might be behind.

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:17.301
And we actually see them flipping
around, some of the kids that were behind

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:21.802
race ahead later on and all the teacher
does is look at the kids who are stuck,

00:05:21.802 --> 00:05:24.991
look at the kids where the video and
the software isn't enough for them

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:28.633
to get past that problem and then the
teacher just intervenes on those kids

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:32.385
or even better, gets one of the kids that
are already proficient on that module,

00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:35.502
because they have all of the data
to actually tutor their peers.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.206
So you can have a class where
everyone's working at their own pace.

00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:39.675
Dylan: Got it, you say that
instead of penalizing failure

00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:44.580
and rewarding test taking ability like
our current system does right now,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.184
education should encourage failure and
experimentation but demand mastery.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:55.040
Why do you think this model achieves that?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.791
Salman: Well what we do is we force...

00:05:56.791 --> 00:06:00.291
In a traditional model, I'll give you
some lectures, homework, lectures,

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.829
homework and then we have a snapshot
exam and regardless of whether you get

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.623
a 70 or 80 or 90 percent on that
exam, we move onto the next concept

00:06:06.623 --> 00:06:09.436
and no one ever asks what was
that 10 percent you didn't know.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.863
And so what we see happening in our
school system is by the time people

00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:15.422
get to 8th or 9th grade, they're
taking algebra, they're smart kids,

00:06:15.422 --> 00:06:18.302
they have a great algebra teacher,
but they're still flunking algebra

00:06:18.302 --> 00:06:21.639
because they have that 10
percent gap from 5th grade math,

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.676
that 15 percent gap from 4th grade math.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.744
So the way we're doing it is
we're actually teaching math

00:06:26.744 --> 00:06:28.049
the way you would teach anything else.

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:31.465
If you learned to ride a bicycle
you would stay on that bicycle

00:06:31.465 --> 00:06:34.418
until you master the bicycle
before you try a motorcycle

00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:36.153
or a unicycle or anything more advanced.

00:06:36.153 --> 00:06:39.424
So what we're doing is we're making sure
every kid has all of their gaps filled.

00:06:39.424 --> 00:06:42.632
So they literally start at one plus
one equals two and they don't move on

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:44.429
until they have 100 percent mastery.

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:48.881
Dylan: Very quickly, Ben, what do you
see is the barrier to scaling this?

00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:53.466
Ben: I think it's money, getting
Khan Academy the resources they need

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:56.575
to fill out their programming
and then getting school districts

00:06:56.575 --> 00:06:59.243
to adopt a pretty innovative solution.

00:06:59.243 --> 00:07:02.246
I think teachers are going to want this,
it's going to help them do their job

00:07:02.246 --> 00:07:05.966
and I think given what we're facing, as
I said 50 percent of a 600,000 person

00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:09.215
school district is looking to
not graduate from high school,

00:07:09.215 --> 00:07:12.590
there aren't more jobs for
high school dropouts right now.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.992
This must be adopted.

00:07:14.992 --> 00:07:21.216
Dylan: Listen I wholeheartedly
agree and I thank you Ben Goldhirsh

00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:24.549
as America's thoughtful southern
Californian for bringing that

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:27.300
to our attention and Salman it's
a true pleasure to meet you,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.881
congratulations on what you've
achieved up to this point

00:07:29.881 --> 00:07:33.844
and do let us know what we can
help you with in the future.

00:07:33.844 --> 00:07:37.257
Check out all of it, of
course, on GOOD's website.
