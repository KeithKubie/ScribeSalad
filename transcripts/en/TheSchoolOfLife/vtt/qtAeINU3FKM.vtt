00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:11.725
John Maynard Keynes was a political economist

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:14.605
of extraordinary optimism and vision

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:16.745
who believed that governments have it in their power

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.175
to solve some of the greatest ills of capitalism.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:23.100
Keynes refused either to believe in communism,

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:26.215
or in the utter wisdom of the unfettered free market.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:28.965
Instead, he occupied a middle course,

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.665
believing that governments could,

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.305
with a judicious injection of money here

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:36.335
and a rise regulation there, smooth out the peaks

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.440
and troughs to which all economies seem fatefully prone.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.235
Keynes believed that what chiefly holds back countries

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.540
is corruption, knee-jerk policies, and shortsightedness, but that if these three ills

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.860
are corrected, then humanity can look forward to an age of incredible and lasting wealth.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.900
In a charming essay titled, "Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren," written in 1930,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.500
at the height of the world economic crisis, Keynes outlined his belief that most severe economic problems

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.580
could be overcome, and give way to an age where the chief challenge for human beings would be how to occupy

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:19.820
their leisure time in conditions of mass prosperity. For Keynes, economics was not a dull science. It was the tool

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.820
with which to bring about economic security for all.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.300
Keynes' background was well-to-do, and throughout his life, he remained firmly a part of the British establishment.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.260
Educated at Eton and at Cambridge University,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.580
Keynes was unusual for the breadth of his artistic and literary interests.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.580
Throughout his life, he maintained friendships with some of the most brilliant artists and scholars

00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:43.525
of the twentieth century, and was an integral part

00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:46.515
of the Bloomsbury Group of writers and intellectuals.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.840
Virginia Woolf, for example, was one of his best friends.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.055
As the Bloomsbury Group recognized,

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.945
good economics is as fundamental to wellbeing

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:57.460
as good painting or literature, and at a deep sense,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.860
not fundamentally different in its search

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.380
for the wellsprings of fulfilment, and its attention to human error and blindness.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.315
Keynes' masterpiece was written in 1936.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:11.725
The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.445
In this work, Keynes set out to rethink the

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:17.295
causes of unemployment, in the hope of reducing new solutions

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:20.495
to this intractable problem of the 1930s,

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:23.085
and of capitalism more generally.

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:27.600
Classical economics give us three reasons why unemployment exists.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.640
Firstly, and most obviously, workers are temporarily unemployed when they move jobs.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.735
Secondly, individuals might simply elect not to work, particularly if they can

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.545
support themselves through some form of welfare payment.

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:41.520
But thirdly, and most interestingly,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.220
unemployment arises when wages are higher than what employers can afford.

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:49.075
In the classical model, it's assumed that a free market

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:51.565
will correct this last course automatically,

00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:54.385
and that the supply of labor and the demand for labor

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:57.425
will spontaneously come into equilibrium.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.235
ensuring something approaching full employment.

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:03.015
Only, if some outside force were to exert itself

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:05.745
on the market--for example, if governments set a minimum wage

00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:08.765
that artificially inflates wages, or

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:11.705
if trade unions organized workers so that they refused to take

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:13.505
lower wages in a declining market,

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:19.120
only under these conditions would equilibrium not be found. But Keynes took issue

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.940
with this classical theory. In the 1930s,

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:24.605
there were huge numbers of people out of work, as many as

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.305
3 million in Britain and 15 million in the United States

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:30.445
of America. These numbers were just too great

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:33.495
to shrug off as the result of people being between jobs

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:36.495
or simply idle. And to Keynes' way of thinking,

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:39.505
this level of unemployment was also too great to be explained

00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:41.905
by the interference of trade unions,

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:44.135
given that, during the years of the Great Depression,

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:47.165
high unemployment had severely curbed union power.

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:50.495
For Keynes, the real problem of unemployment lay in a

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:52.285
lack of demand.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:55.555
This was not something that economists had ever properly focused on,

00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:58.525
but it became the linchpin of Keynes' theories.

00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:01.605
Classical economic theory had simply assumed that

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:04.335
demand for goods would return by itself

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:07.135
once wages and labor requirements had equalized.

00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:09.715
But Keynes now famously declared,

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:12.535
"In the long run, we are all dead."

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.460
In other words, this process might simply take too long.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.180
Keynes argued that it was insufficient for economists and policymakers

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.760
simply to advise people to accept suffering in the short and medium term, secure in the knowledge

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.700
that at the end of the storm, the sea would return to calm.

00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:29.945
What was needed was intervention

00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:32.175
in the economy, by government, in order to break

00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:34.025
the cycle of economic depression,

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:36.255
and thereby restore prosperity.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.275
Traditionally, in an economic downturn, governments would turn to

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:42.315
matters of supply to provide an economic boost,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.245
encourage growth, and create employment.

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:47.615
For example, if interest rates were reduced, that this should encourage

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.440
savers to invest their money, providing cash

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.425
either for existing businesses to expand, or else for

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:56.375
entrepreneurs to establish new ventures. However,

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:59.125
Keynes now declared there might exist a persistent belief that

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:00.905
demand was so low

00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:03.935
that there was little point in supplying goods. In this case,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.980
traditional tools of promoting economic recovery

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.520
would be useless, and something else would be required.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.380
If market mechanisms were unable to stimulate economic recovery, then, Keynes now argued, it was the job of the state

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:25.600
to step in to create demand, by running, if necessary, a very large budget deficit in order to create jobs.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.440
Practically, this could be done by raising loans and using the money to finance vast public works

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.865
that could be brought on line relatively quickly.

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.205
These might include building roads or railways,

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:39.165
or else investment in other infrastructure that would not only

00:05:39.165 --> 00:05:42.215
create work for people, but which would leave a useful legacy

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.565
for private enterprise. Governments should, for Keynes, act as the primary shopper in the land,

00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:52.980
creating demand until more widespread sources off-demand can return.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.440
Keynes criticized governments for the way they typically respond to downturns.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.820
Their immediate (and understandable) impulse is just to rein in spending. After all, this is what a household would do when money is no longer coming in.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.940
But what is wise at the level of the household is often catastrophic when applied at the level of the nation.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.160
Nations are not households in all kinds of ways,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.220
and Keynes needed to persuade his audiences to act contrary to their simpler, more basic instincts.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.420
Reining in spending when an economy is in decline always worsens the very problem it's meant to solve.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.880
One obvious objection to Keynes' focus on government spending

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:34.045
was the question as to who should pay for the loans.

00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:39.180
By creating the debt, would not the problem be simply postponed to another day, rather than solved?

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.965
Here, Keynes applied his theory of what became known as the "Multiplier Effect."

00:06:44.965 --> 00:06:47.960
In the first instance, by creating jobs through public works,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.320
governments would save some of the money they would've otherwise spent on unemployment benefits.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:01.920
Secondly, the increase in the number of people in employment would create additional spending power, and therefore boost the economy and tax receipts.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:08.160
There would be an indirect effect on businesses as opportunities to service public works programs became available.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.480
The result would be increased tax revenue from businesses, as they began to once again prosper.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.195
In turn, these receipts would then pay off the debt created by the initial expenditure.

00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:21.025
That was the Multiplier Effect.

00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:24.920
Keynes' ability to conceive of grand macroeconomic architecture

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.460
put him in a high demand during the Second World War.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.960
When he went to the Treasury to work as an advisor,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.660
raised the peerage in 1942 as Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of Sussex, Lord Keynes

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.975
led the British delegation to the Bretton Woods Conference in the United States,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.840
at which the Allied nations hammered out post-war economic policy.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.880
Not only did Keynes believe that national governments could successfully manage economies,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.940
but Keynes also believed that a global system of economic organization was possible.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:01.420
He argued that, for the purpose of global trade, countries should subscribe to the creation of a new international standardized unit of account:

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.500
the Bancor.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.035
Through a complex system of accounting,

00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:07.145
the adoption of the pseudo-currency

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:09.700
would allow an internationally-recognized organization

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.920
to impose fines on countries in order to discourage them from running large trade deficits or surpluses.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.680
Such a system would help to smooth out peaks and troughs

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.960
in international trade and, not coincidentally, it would also benefit countries like Britain

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.580
who had, because of the cost of the War, had low reserves of gold.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.980
It was both a brilliant and self-interested idea in equal measure.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.040
But, ultimately, the Bancor did not come about.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.800
The United States, which was effectively bankrolling global post-war economic reconstruction, ran large trade surpluses

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.880
and had no intention of accepting limitations on these.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.860
But several of Keynes' other proposals, such as the establishment of the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.165
to oversee and encourage world trade, were accepted,

00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:56.260
and have dramatically changed the world.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:04.120
Testimony to Keynes' belief that national and super-national economic planning is both necessary and possible.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:10.560
The strain of the Bretton Woods negotiations were immense upon Keynes. In 1946, aged only 62,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.120
Keynes died of complications from a series of heart attacks.

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:15.785
Yet his legacy lived on.

00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:18.135
In the thirty years or so after the Second World War,

00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:21.715
Keynesian policies were adopted across the capitalist world.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.000
Economies saw record lows of unemployment, and record high levels of economic growth.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.780
Keynes' ideas became the new orthodoxy, and were particularly attractive to the political left.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.915
By the 1970s, however, critics of Keynes' ideas,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.840
notably, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.960
were gaining ground with politicians in countries like the United States and Britain.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:49.000
They argued for small estate, free markets, and a reduction in regulation of capitalist enterprise.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.260
At the same time, Britain and the United States

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.700
began to experience high inflation alongside high unemployment, known as "stagflation."

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.905
This phenomenon could not be explained by Keynesian economics,

00:09:59.905 --> 00:10:02.405
and Keynes' ideas came to be discredited,

00:10:02.405 --> 00:10:05.365
giving way to those of the neoliberals.

00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:07.995
Nevertheless, the financial crisis of 2008

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.500
jolted policymakers into considering alternatives to neoliberal thinking.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.660
When the global economy spiralled into decline, rather than wait for the market to correct itself,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.880
the G20 nations announced an economic stimulus package of around 2% of gross domestic product to stimulate growth.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.275
As one critic of Keynes wryly conceded,

00:10:28.275 --> 00:10:31.735
"I guess everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole."

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:40.360
To be sure, Keynes' ideas need to be modified to suit the conditions of the contemporary world, but Keynes would approve. His was not a static

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.545
or dogmatic understanding of economics. After all,

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:49.820
when asked why, in the 1930s, he had altered some of the positions on economic policy he had previously held,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.000
Keynes famously answered,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.580
"When the facts change, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?"

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.575
 

00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:03.435
 

00:11:03.435 --> 00:11:06.465
 

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:09.335
 

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.515
