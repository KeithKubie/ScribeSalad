00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.380
Hello and welcome to Crash Course: Navigating
Digital Information, I’m John Green.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.740
According to my Wikipedia page, I’m an American
author, vlogger, writer, producer, actor,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.920
editor, and educator.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.270
I’ve released some books, won some awards,
got married, had kids, and I have a brother

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.270
named Hank.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.900
There’s also a photo of me from VidCon in
2014 in which I’m wearing a football scarf

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.900
which is very on-brand.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.769
Now, you could’ve learned a lot of that
stuff from my personal website--but then again,

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.349
I have a certain bias in how I present myself.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.269
For instance, I would never write about Hank
on my website.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.000
He can start his own web site if he wants
that free promo.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
Also, as we’ve discussed through this series, you shouldn’t use one single site as a definitive source.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.160
When evaluating new information, we have to
read laterally.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.950
That means looking to other sources to provide
context.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.370
Now it’s not always easy to find sources to
consult, but when used correctly, Wikipedia

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.980
can be a great place to start.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.900
Right, I know that wikipedia can be unreliable.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.440
My own wikipedia page once briefly said that
I was a professional Lacrosse player.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.750
And I am an actor only in the sense that I
was cut from the one movie I appeared in,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.280
but I do think we can use wikipedia for good.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:15.120
INTRO

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.920
So, many of us have been told by teachers,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.079
librarians, parents, peers, coworkers, friends,
pen pals, babysitters, nieces and nephews,

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.159
celebrity spokespeople, Instagram famous dogs,
our favorite baristas, particularly cogent

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.040
toddlers, religious leaders, Jeff Goldblum,
long lost cousins, and anonymous twitter trolls

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.950
never to use Wikipedia.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.450
You’ve probably heard that Wikipedia is
full of totally unusable, unreliable information

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.380
written by random internet users.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.240
I’m here to dispel that myth.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.770
Well, me and my friends at MediaWise.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.459
Now, it’s true that Wikipedia is editable
by almost anyone, and its content is created

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.049
by a community of mostly volunteer Wikipedians.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.029
The whole network is owned and supported by
a non-profit, called the Wikimedia Foundation.

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:02.409
And Wikipedia has become the Internet’s
largest general reference work, with over

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.960
40 million articles in 301 languages, including
over 5.7 million articles in English.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.050
While you’re there, you can learn about
anything from the Gothic Bible to Whitney

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.090
Houston’s 1985 hit “How Will I Know”
to the absolutely terrifying star-nosed mole.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.420
I don’t know what it is about the star nosed
mole, but it freaks me out so bad.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.210
I’ve had dreams about it.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.210
Anyway.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.570
It’s got a great Wikipedia page.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.310
Now, you’re not going to learn every single
thing about a topic by reading its Wikipedia

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.310
page.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.030
The universe is much more complicated than
even an endless online encyclopedia could

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.030
account for.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.520
But what makes Wikipedia useful to citizens
of the internet is its breadth.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.730
It provides information on more topics than
any print encyclopedia could, and a top-notch

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.150
Wikipedia page can provide a solid overview
of a topic and also provide citations to sources

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.150
for it’s claims.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.020
It’s kind of like a tour guide -- it gives
you a general lay of the land and shows you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.040
where to discover more.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.170
Even fact checkers use Wikipedia to familiarize
themselves with unknown topics.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.270
Now, when Wikipedia first launched in 2001,
it got a bad reputation because of how easy

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.770
it was to create and edit articles.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.750
Essentially anyone with an internet connection
could log on and update their high school’s

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.260
“notable alumni” to include their own
name.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.240
You could also delete your brother’s Wikipedia
page on the grounds that he wasn’t a notable

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240
person.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.240
Not that I ever did that!

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.140
I mean that, that would be terrible.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.030
That flexibility, to put it diplomatically,
is likely why teachers and others have warned

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.030
you against it.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.910
But Wikipedia has grown up a lot since 2001.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.480
It’s nearly 18.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.150
Wikipedia is almost an adult--and it’s starting
to act like it.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.740
Today anyone with an internet connection
can still edit most pages on Wikipedia, but

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.510
there are much more rigorous content policies
in place and more Wikipedians and even bots

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.180
around to prevent and correct bad edits.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.370
Like, if you repeatedly add yourself to your
high school’s notable alumni section, you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.520
can bet an editor will be close behind to
keep you humble.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.650
You also now have to be a registered user
to create an article and article topics have

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.100
to meet a standard of notability before they
can even be created.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.620
Wikipedians also adhere to a set of rules
when editing and writing content.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.760
Their core content policies are summed up
by three key phrases.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.360
1.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.260
A neutral point of view, meaning content must
be represented fairly, proportionately and

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.320
without bias.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.920
2.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.980
No original research, meaning all material
must come from a published, reliable source.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.640
And 3.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.440
Verifiability, meaning people reading and
editing articles must be able to check that

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.310
the information comes from a reliable source.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.639
Now, policies and rules are all well and good,
but they’re only as good as the people who

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.710
enforce them.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.920
So volunteer Wikipedians act as writers and
editors and also they keep each other in check.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.330
There are also administrators, who have a
higher level of authority, and they can do

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.620
things like delete pages, or respond to vandalism,
or even lock a page so only certain people

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.889
can make changes.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.570
But they’re not all-knowing gods.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.860
They’re regular Wikipedians in good standing
with the community because they’ve proven

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.900
themselves to be responsible editors who use
accurate, documented information.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.980
As of the day we filmed this video, there
are 1,206 administrators for the English Wikipedia

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.980
site.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:23.330
In contrast, there are over 34.8 million registered
Wikipedians, about 134,000 of whom have edited

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.520
in the past month.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.160
The good thing about this giant buddy system
is that it has to be pretty transparent in

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.450
order to function.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.800
At the top of a Wikipedia article you’ll
see little tabs.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.470
One says Article, that’s pretty self-explanatory.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.470
And then there’s Talk.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.110
That’s where you can see the conversation
Wikipedians have had about editing that article.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.940
On the American Civil War page, there’s
even a Frequently Asked Questions section.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.950
And under a page’s View History tab you
can see how and when an article has been edited,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.320
and by whom.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.500
Some pages are especially prone to vandals
who alter their content by adding inaccuracies

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.699
or violating Wikipedia policies.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.530
This most frequently happens to sensitive
or controversial topics.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.450
And so if an article is contentious or prone
to vandalism, it may be locked for protection.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.470
There are different levels of protection under
which certain users might be able to edit

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.590
a partially locked page.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.220
The pages of the Quran and the Big Bang, for
example, are both semi-protected.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.639
That means no new or unregistered users can
edit it.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.370
But there are also other kinds of protection.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.070
To find out if a page is locked, look to its
upper right hand corner for a little padlock

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.070
icon.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.530
Locks appear in many different colors, with
gold denoting the highest protection -- only

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.830
administrators can edit those pages.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.800
On Wikipedia you might also come across different
notes and warning labels at the top of a page.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.120
Some substandard pages have problems with
their structure, or their sourcing, or even

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.199
their tone.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.889
So Wikipedians add attention-grabbing notes
to alert readers to any problems.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.090
For instance, the page for the National Aerospace
Laboratory of the Netherlands has been flagged.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.180
It warns: “This article contains content
that is written like an advertisement.”

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.150
Wikipedia pages are supposed to have a neutral
point of view, so that note gives readers

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.430
a heads up that this one might not.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.169
The freestyle monster trucks page also has
a warning: it doesn’t cite any sources.

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.280
That certainly breaks the verifiability rules.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.650
Although now I really want to know what a
freestyle monster truck show is.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.639
Anyway thanks to these policies and warnings,
Wikipedia can be a really useful place for

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.860
getting a bird’s eye view of a topic or
starting more thorough research.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.431
But -- and you knew there was a but coming
-- that’s not permission to use Wikipedia

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:36.490
as a one-stop shop for conducting /in-depth/
research, nor is it permission to cite it

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.740
in your work.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.830
Honestly, citing an encyclopedia of any kind
just isn’t a good look for research projects.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.000
And Wikipedia isn’t perfect, and it’s
not always accurate.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.031
As we’ve said before in this series, when
navigating digital information, there is no

00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:52.330
magic bullet.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:58.009
There is no one perfect or objective source,
partly because everything was made by fallible

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:03.350
humans, and partly because the people using
sources are also fallible.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:10.330
That said, Wikipedia does have real power,
and its biggest power lies in using it for

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.840
lateral reading and harvesting its citations.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.640
Let’s try it out in the Thought Bubble.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.979
So imagine your friend shares the following
post in your feed.

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:22.321
Thanks to this site I know exactly what’s
good for my body and, more importantly, WHAT

00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:23.321
ISN’T.

00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:26.800
It links to a website called Natural News
that you’ve never heard of.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.010
When you visit NaturalNews.com and check the
about page, they call themselves a “science-based

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.070
natural health advocacy organization.”

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.860
And the site is jam-packed with words and
pictures.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.800
But since you’re an excellent lateral reader,
the next thing you do to evaluate this information

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.960
is open a new tab to conduct a search.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.451
Pro tip: search the website’s URL and the
word “wikipedia” to surface its wikipedia

00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:49.560
entry.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.560
Wikipedians call Natural News a “website
for the sale of various dietary supplements,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.790
promotion of alternative medicine, controversial
nutrition and health claims, scientific fake

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.450
news, and various conspiracy theories.”

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.110
That’s, you know, a significantly different
characterization than their own about page.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.060
The Wikipedia entry also has a section for
criticisms and controversies,

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.790
which talks about scientists, writers, and
journalists who have called out factual inaccuracies

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.980
on Natural News.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.930
Throughout this section you’ll see superscript
numbers in brackets in between words and at

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.520
the end of sentences.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.570
Those link to citations -- hover over them
to find either direct links or references

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.810
to where the corresponding information came
from.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.880
Citation 22, for example, leads to a peer-reviewed
journal article calling Natural News a website

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.930
that spreads "irresponsible health information."

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.970
Citation 35 links to a post from climate change
site the Grist titled, literally, “Don’t

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.950
believe anything you read at Natural News.”

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.980
Thanks Thought Bubble So, Now you have a clear
understanding that this website and its content

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.110
are very controversial and considered unreliable
by other outlets.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.130
And whenever you are interested in a fact
on a Wikipedia page, look for the embedded

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.130
citation.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.680
You can then check in on those sources and
follow up to confirm the information you find.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.230
I’ve been using this in my own life.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.560
For instance, I recently reviewed the Taco
Bell breakfast menu for my podcast, The Anthropocene

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.100
Reviewed, and I started at the Wikipedia page
for Taco Bell, which through the citations

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.800
led me to the AMAZING biography of Taco Bell
founder Glen Bell, “Taco Titan: The Glen

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.800
Bell Story.”

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.870
So if you click any of those superscript numbers
on a Wikipedia page, you’ll find the full

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.149
list of references for that page at the bottom.

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:33.670
And those also link back to their locations
in the text, like an index.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.170
Now not all pages have citations, and not
all citations are reliable citations.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:43.130
But this is a place where you can quickly
look for more information from authoritative

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.130
sources.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.300
The main criticism of Wikipedia concerns the
reliability of its information.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.660
As we discussed earlier in the episode, the
community does have policies in place to regulate

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.709
its articles.

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:58.430
They have ways of letting readers know about
inaccuracies or incomplete articles, too.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.570
Which are certainly helpful.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.120
But plenty of bad information does slip through.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.430
It sometimes even leads to editing wars between
Wikipedians who edit back and forth to try

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.040
to set the record straight.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.050
Over the years a variety of studies have evaluated
how Wikipedia measures up to similar reference

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.240
works or examined the accuracy of selected
articles.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.670
And the results of these have been mixed,
with some finding Wikipedia comparable to

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.800
commercial encyclopedias and others finding
pretty serious errors of omission.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.140
And accuracy isn’t Wikipedia’s only weakness.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.400
Its community has also been criticized for
gender and racial biases, both for the kind

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.790
of community it fosters, and for the topics
it covers.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.760
The content on Wikipedia is a product of those
who get to participate, so it will inherently

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.970
reflect any inequalities in its community.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:51.250
One example of this is that the article about
Toilet Paper Orientation is incredibly carefully

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:56.170
written and cited, whereas the English-language
article on the Indus Valley Civilization city

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.180
of Harappa is much less detailed.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.690
Wikipedia is also dependent on published sources,
which have their own gender and racial biases

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.560
and contribute to what is and is not verifiable
on Wikipedia.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.110
But as we know from our last episode, it’s
possible to use sources that are systemically

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.570
skewed towards one group’s perspective,
as long as we take that perspective into account

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.529
when evaluating its information.

00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:24.010
In this case, that means treating Wikipedia
as a launchpad, not a finish line.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.140
It’s not where you should do all of your
research and lateral reading.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.750
But it’s a good place to start.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:35.649
One last note: Some researchers skip the body
of a Wikipedia article entirely and head straight

00:12:35.649 --> 00:12:38.390
for the citations to look for trustworthy
sources.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:43.350
After all, some pages have hundreds of references
to primary sources, scholarly journals, and

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.790
other strong publications.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:50.020
We should think of Wikipedia as another tool
in your information evaluation tool kit.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:55.000
You go there for a general overview of a topic,
or a stepping stone to more references, or

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.740
to use as one lateral reading source among
several.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.860
And as long as you know how and when to use
it appropriately, Wikipedia can be a great

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.860
friend.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.860
But it shouldn’t be your only friend.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.420
And actually, now that we’re talking about
it, I feel like like all your friends, really,

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.830
they should probably be people.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.820
Or dogs.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.340
Or a cat, if you’re that kind of person.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.340
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
