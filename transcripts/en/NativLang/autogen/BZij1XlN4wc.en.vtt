sentence structure they allow us to
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.700
sentence structure they allow us to
group words together into broader units

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710

preposition phrases have three parts the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
preposition phrases have three parts the
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.500
preposition phrases have three parts the
first part is the head the main word

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
first part is the head the main word
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.599
first part is the head the main word
mentioned above the second part is the

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609
mentioned above the second part is the
 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.549
mentioned above the second part is the
compliment which may be optional and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
compliment which may be optional and
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799
compliment which may be optional and
usually occurs next to the head it's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
usually occurs next to the head it's
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.430
