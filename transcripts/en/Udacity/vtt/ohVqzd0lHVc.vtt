00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is that it can be in any of these regions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All of the boxes should be checked.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
To see this, remember that our probability at each point is this formula,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the key thing to remember about this formula from the lecture is

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it becomes very close to 0 in both directions,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the probability of it being here or here is very small.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's not 0, so it could be here.
