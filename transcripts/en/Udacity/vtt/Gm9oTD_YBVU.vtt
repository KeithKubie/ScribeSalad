00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Your goal for this quiz is to define a procedure,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is_friend, that takes a string as its input, and outputs a Boolean value

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
indicating if the input string is the name of a friend.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This would be very hard to do, in general,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but we're going to assume that I have a very strict policy on friends.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm friends with everyone whose name begins with the letter "D"--and no one else.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So if the input name begins with the letter "D", your procedure should output True;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
otherwise, it should output False.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, for example, if we did: print is_friend('Diane'),

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the output should be True and if we did:

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
print is_friend('Fred'),

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you should see the output False.
