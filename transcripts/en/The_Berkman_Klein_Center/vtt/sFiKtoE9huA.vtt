00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.290
 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.870
Hello.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.420
I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.430
This is the 10th of a series
of 12 lectures on copyright.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.720
Links to the other
lectures in the series

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.670
and to the current
version of the map that

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.490
will accompany this
particular lecture are

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.225
available through my home page, the
address of which is tfisher.org.

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.750
 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.380
As you know by now, there
are four main theories

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.590
of intellectual property in general,
and copyright in particular.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.967
The fairness theory, which finds
inspiration in the work of John Locke,

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:48.800
centers on the principle
that the law should

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.700
be organized to provide authors and
inventors what they morally deserve.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.800
Somewhat more specifically, the
law, seen from this perspective,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.470
should award them property
interest or monetary rewards

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.349
commensurate with
their creative efforts.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.610
The fairness approach has
disproportionate influence

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.940
in the United States and other countries
influenced by the common law tradition,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.920
but finds some support
throughout the world.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.690
The personality theory,
which finds inspiration

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.200
in the work of Kant and Hegel,
is founded on the principles

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.640
that intellectual
products are extensions

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.020
of the personalities of their
creators, and that the law should

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.900
be organized to respect and nourish
the psychic bonds between creators

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.590
and their expressive products.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.510
The dimension of copyright law
that is most closely associated

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.060
with personality theory is the set of
so-called moral rights, which are most

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.250
generously recognized and
enforced in continental Europe,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.770
and in other jurisdictions influenced
by the civil law tradition.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.420
The third approach is
the welfare theory,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.460
a branch of the broad philosophic
tradition of utilitarianism.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.660
The welfare theory of copyright
starts with the proposition

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.940
that intellectual products are public
goods, an unusual and especially

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.199
important subset of products defined
by two related characteristics.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.663
They are both non-rivalrous
and nonexcludable.

00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:15.180
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.110
Copyright law, seen from this
angle, constitutes a mechanism

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.340
employed by governments to
prevent such public goods

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.990
from being produced in less than
socially optimal quantities.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.310
The general guideline that emerges
from this philosophic tradition

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.950
is that the law should be adjusted
so as to combine optimally,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.360
on the one hand, incentives for
innovation, and on the other hand,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.940
mechanisms for ensuring that
the fruits of innovation

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.390
can be consumed or reused by others.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.300
This theory has gained in
strength in recent years.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.540
It is now the dominant
approach to copyright law,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.910
at least in the United States, in part
because of the resonance between it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.560
and the utilitarian tenor
of the Constitutional clause

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.410
on which intellectual property
right's founded in the United States,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.850
and in part because this
theory has been refined

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.780
and popularized by an influential
group of scholars, some of whom

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.760
have since become judges.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.400
We come, finally, to the fourth theory.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.520
This is currently the least
well known and least influential

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.470
of the approaches, but it is,
I think, growing in strength,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.910
both among scholars and among lawmakers.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.560
It centers on the principle
that copyright law,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.320
like other fields of law, should be
organized so as to foster and sustain

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.340
a just and attractive culture.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.040
The cultural theory incorporates some
aspects of the other three theories,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.340
but as we'll see, also stands apart
from them on important dimensions.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.350
Like the welfare theory, it's
prospective and consequential.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.060
In other words, it urges us to
create a legal framework that

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.580
will enable or prompt people to
behave in ways that will give rise

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.490
to a more attractive
society in the future.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.160
But it differs from welfare
theory in a fundamental respect.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.280
It's not founded on the principle
of consumer sovereignty, the notion

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.600
that we should measure people's well
being by what they themselves currently

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.970
desire or loathe.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.220
In other words, the cultural theory
takes the risky and controversial

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.260
position that people are not always
the best judges of their own interests,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.620
and that the law should
sometimes guide them

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.080
in directions they are not
currently inclined to go.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.000
Like the personality
theory, the cultural theory

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.620
tries to identify in advance
fundamental human needs.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.180
However, as we'll see,
the set of needs that

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.780
figure in most current
versions of cultural theory

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.730
is different from the set that
figures in personality theory.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.630
Cultural theory is
also much less willing

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.760
to privilege the psychic bonds
between artists and their creations

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.080
over all other considerations.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.290
Like the fairness theory, and
unlike the welfare theory,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.350
cultural theory is intensely
concerned with justice.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.260
However, it's less interested in
individualized conceptions of justice--

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.290
in other words, attempts to give
individual workers or authors what they

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.400
have earned through
their labor-- and more

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.660
concerned with distributive
justice-- in other words,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.120
ensuring that all persons are given
fair shares of material resources,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.360
and above all, fair access
to the opportunities

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.415
necessary for full human flourishing.

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:37.080
 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.530
In the second segment
of this lecture, it

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.430
will become apparent
that these differences

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.720
in orientation prompt
advocates of cultural theory

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.700
to recommend a pattern of reforms to
copyright law that is significantly

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.065
different from the pattern commended
by any of the other approaches.

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:54.600
 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.870
As my tone undoubtedly conveys,
I myself find this approach

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.500
to be the most congenial
and powerful of the four.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.710
The result is that my
presentation of this approach

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.090
will be less dispassionate than were
my presentations of the other three.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.245
I'll do my best at the end to identify
the main weaknesses of cultural theory,

00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.370
but it would be hopeless
for me to conceal the fact

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.820
that I find it to be, on balance, the
most powerful of the four approaches.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.020
Needless to say, you should
make your own judgments

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.660
concerning the merits and
demerits of this perspective.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.860
One of the reasons why I have
waited until now to present

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.340
this argument to you
is to ensure that you

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.960
are familiar with the rival approaches
and their doctrinal implications,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.930
and thus inoculated
against my favoritism.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.640
 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.310
Here's how I plan to
organize my presentation.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.230
In the first segment
of the lecture, I will

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.830
outline the premises of this approach.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.720
In the second segment, I
will canvas various issues

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.820
in copyright law, with
which you are now familiar,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.570
and suggest how cultural
theory might illuminate them.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.110
In the third, I will address
a few possible reforms

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.320
outside of copyright law that the
cultural theory might commend, and then

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.020
discuss the principal limitations
and vulnerabilities of this argument.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.860
So let's begin.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.710
At the outset, it should be emphasized
that, like each of the other three

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.150
approaches, cultural
theory is best understood

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.980
as a family of related arguments, not
a single, tightly-knit, determinant

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.560
argument.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.110
Put differently, it's
an orientation, a way

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.860
of thinking about life, culture,
and law, not an algorithm.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.970
Partly as a result, people who
adopt this approach disagree

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.650
among themselves, just
as, as we have seen,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.390
the economists who dominate
the welfare approach,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.360
and the philosophers who
dominate the fairness approach,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.890
also disagree among themselves.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:02.130
Who, then, are the people who have
contributed to the cultural theory?

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.110
They are surely not limited to law.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.960
Indeed, most of the inspiration from
this approach comes from outside law.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.840
In philosophy, it has deep
roots in the work of Aristotle

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.750
and more modern expression in the
arguments of Amartya Sen and Martha

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.520
Nussbaum.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.600
In political theory, roots can be found
in the writings of the 18th century

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.890
commonwealth men, such
as Trenchard and Gordon

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:32.400
in England, the early Karl Marx,
Alexis de Tocquevile, Hannah Arendt,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.250
and modern communitarian theorists.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.460
Recently, the work of
several social psychologists,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.780
including Edward Deci, Richard Ryan,
Martin Seligman, and Christopher Atman,

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.905
have lent substantial
support to this perspective.

00:08:47.905 --> 00:08:50.420
 

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.950
Among legal scholars, and specifically
among the subset of legal scholars

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.300
who focus on intellectual
property, important contributors

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.520
include Keith Aoki, Yochai Benkler,
Julie Cohen, Neil Netanell,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.220
Madhavi Sunder, Talha Syed.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.940
Some of their works
are listed on the map.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.050
If you're curious about their
perspectives, follow the links.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.640
My own work in this area began with
an essay I wrote on fair use in 1988

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.090
and has continued to guide my
exploration of different dimensions

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.740
of intellectual property ever since.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.680
Indeed, I find myself closer to this
approach now than I did a decade ago.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.650
During the remainder
of this lecture, I will

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.430
focus on my own particular
variant of cultural theory.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.640
These other scholars are, as I
say, pursuing analogous projects,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.750
but likely none would agree
with all aspects of my argument.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.579
The most fundamental of the premises
upon which the argument is based

00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:54.620
is the proposition that
there exists such a thing

00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:00.600
as human nature-- it's hard to
discern, but real and stable.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.790
Because of their nature, people
flourish under some conditions

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.670
and suffer, or atrophy, under others.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.280
From those observations
emerges a normative guideline.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.710
Social and political
institutions, including law,

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.380
should be organized so as to
facilitate human flourishing.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.080
Eight conditions contribute
to human flourishing.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.180
Not all eight are essential
to a full and satisfying life.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.390
Indeed it's doubtful that anyone
has ever fully experienced,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.260
on a sustained basis, all eight.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.820
Life isn't perfect.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.430
But these are the
components of a good life.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.510
The most obvious is life itself.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.300
The flourishing is possible only
if you are alive-- somewhat more

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.900
specifically, if you are able
to live a life of normal length.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.800
Nuances lurk in the adjective
"normal," but we need not

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.930
tarry to consider them here.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.200
The second, nearly as
obvious, is health.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.050
Illness impairs flourishing.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.010
Freedom from psychic
and physical pain is

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:08.430
one of the conditions that
contributes to living well.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.100
As Martha Nussbaum observes,
health, in this sense,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.880
includes reproductive health.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.000
Now things begin to get more
subtle and controversial.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.750
A substantial degree of autonomy
is important to human flourishing.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.440
No one, of course, is wholly
self-made or self-directed,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.450
but a life without a substantial
degree of self-determination

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.250
is a life not fully lived.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.210
George Kateb, the person from whom
I first learned political theory,

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.601
put the point memorably.

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:45.050
"One's dignity resides in
being, to some important degree,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.020
a person of one's own creating, making,
choosing, rather than being merely

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.500
a creature or a socially
manufactured, conditioned, manipulated

00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:02.240
thing, half-animal and half-mechanical,
and therefore wholly socialized."

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.260
Kateb, in this passage,
was drawing in part

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.190
on the work of John
Stuart Mill, who also

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.230
emphasized the constitutive
value of choice.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.250
The same theme figures
heavily in the writings

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.710
of many other liberal
theorists, including

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.300
John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.490
It also infuses Yochai
Benkler's commentaries

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:25.305
on the affordances enabled by
participation in information networks.

00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:28.330
 

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.110
It's important to note three
refinements of this idea.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.130
First, autonomy does not mean
freedom from social connections.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:41.460
On the contrary, it means, rather, that
the bonds and communities through which

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:48.210
we define ourselves are at least partly
chosen, not inherited or coerced.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.200
Second, the dimension of
autonomy that turns out

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.120
to contribute most to well-being
is the subjective feeling

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.660
of self-determination,
which is only partly

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:04.090
dependent on the objective
number of options that one has.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.310
Third, autonomy not only
makes one feel better.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.250
It's also adaptive.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.090
Social psychologists have found
that autonomous motivations, meaning

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.760
motivations arising out of voluntary
choice, increase job performance,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.540
particularly when the task at issue
is complex and requires creativity.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.200
 

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.410
Of course, one can have too much
of a good thing, even autonomy,

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.490
as Barry Schwartz has shown.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.220
But a substantial degree
of self-determination

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.000
is key to the good life.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.590
The fourth of the conditions
conducive to flourishing

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.940
is engagement, by which
I mean participation

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.610
in shaping an important
dimension of one's environment.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.820
Many groups of theorists
have emphasized one

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.250
or another aspect of this principle.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:56.060
Karl Marx, for example, placed great
weight in his insightful early writings

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.410
on engagement in work.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.875
People ought to have access to what
he called meaningful work, by which he

00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:06.640
meant work that requires
skill and concentration,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.990
presents the laborer with
challenges and problems

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:15.000
he can overcome only through the
exercise of initiative and creativity,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.820
and is part of a larger project
he considers socially valuable

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.400
and must take into account
in making his decisions.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.874
 

00:14:23.874 --> 00:14:25.790
Notice that the fact
that the job is connected

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.880
to a socially valuable project
is part of this vision,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.170
but not the whole of it.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.520
Fulfillment comes only through
participation in the choices

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.620
that determine the direction of the
venture and whether it succeeds.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.040
That's where engagement lies.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.380
Notice also the beneficial role
played in this vision by risk.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.445
Certainty that a venture will
succeed innervates engagement.

00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:53.090
 

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.260
But work is not the only arena in which
one can find fulfilling engagement.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.300
Another is politics.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.270
This theme figured
prominently in the work

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.890
of classical Republican
political theorists,

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.740
including the pamphleteers
and activists who

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.410
helped power the American Revolution.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.900
They celebrated what they called
civic virtue, a key component of which

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.290
was active participation in politics.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.770
But not any sort of
participation-- rather,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.770
they privileged participation
in a particular posture--

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:28.220
altruistic, deliberative, genuinely
committed to the welfare of the polity

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:34.250
as a whole, not to the advancement of
self-interest or factional interest.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.480
Again, we see the conjoining
of involvement, choice,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.980
and, last but not least, commitment
to a larger enterprise one

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.560
believes to be socially beneficial.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.520
In Martin Seligman's words, "using
one's signature strengths and talents

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:56.290
to belong to and serve
something bigger than oneself."

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.920
Within legal scholarship,
this theme found expression

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.010
in a highly influential set of
articles during the 1980s and 1990s

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.150
that sought to reorient constitutional
law and administrative law

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.650
around the idea of altruistic,
deliberative citizenship.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.840
Key figures in that surge were
Frank Michelman and Cass Sunstein.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.910
Sunstein later went on to
become a central figure

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.205
in the Obama administration.

00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:24.160
 

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.190
Yet another arena for self-fulfilling
engagement is culture itself.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.970
We live today in a cloud
of symbols and images

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:39.100
that, like our jobs and our polities,
are all too often out of our control.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.870
The result is cultural alienation
analogous to alienation

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.730
in the workplace.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.780
Retaking some degree of
responsibility and control

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.360
for the shape of that
semiotic environment

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.050
is another way of achieving engagement.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.050
 

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.390
Each of these groups of
theorists argued vigorously

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.080
for the benefits,
individual and collective,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.109
of the particular kind of
engagement they celebrated.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.069
My own view is that no one of
these forms of participation

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:12.780
has pride of place, and that it's
hopeless to try to do them all.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.180
There just aren't enough weekends.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.020
The more general insight,
latent in all three variants,

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.540
is that active, risky,
altruistic engagement

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.880
in the shaping of a significant
aspect of one's world

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.255
is key to human flourishing.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:30.660
 

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.850
Closely related to engagement in
this sense is self-expression.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.660
Projecting oneself
into or onto the world

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.630
has long been regarded as constitutive.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.590
It's at this point that the
cultural theory of copyright

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.070
overlaps most clearly with
the personality theory.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.630
Indeed, the reflections I
discussed in the second lecture

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.460
by T. H. Green and others concerning the
importance of preserving opportunities

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.670
for self-expression could be simply
incorporated here by reference.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.460
A more recent manifestation
of the same theme

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.580
can be found in the
work of Larry Lessig,

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.280
in particular his book on remix.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.350
 

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:15.920
Competence, we know intuitively, is
also crucial to human flourishing.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.250
We feel better, and
we do better, when we

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.160
have a sense that we are
capable of performing the tasks

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.960
we address-- not that we
are certain of success,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.870
but that we have the
requisite talents and skills.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:33.430
A large body of literature in social
psychology confirms this intuition.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.960
A sense of competence
is key to learning,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.140
and a sense that one is incompetent is
strongly correlated with depression.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.120
Again, the subjective
feeling of competence

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:51.100
is at least as important as the reality
for both performance and well-being.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.630
This fact creates interesting
complications and possibilities

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.540
when combined with the fact
that assessments of competence

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.710
are often distorted in systematic ways.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.280
Unskilled people, psychologists
tell us, typically overestimate

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.320
their competence, while highly
skilled people typically

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.810
underestimate their competence.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.720
But this is a nuance,
not the core point.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.820
 

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.440
The seventh theme in the list
should not be surprising.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.690
We flourish through
connection with others.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.140
We atrophy alone.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.100
The vocabulary employed to
express this age-old insight

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.300
in different disciplines varies.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.980
A philosopher, such as Nussbaum,
might use the term "affiliation."

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.610
The psychologists, Deci and
Ryan, use the term "relatedness"

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:42.490
and place it on a par with autonomy and
competence as a fundamental human need.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.880
In political theory, the theme
finds clearest expression

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.775
in communitarian arguments.

00:19:47.775 --> 00:19:51.010
 

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.810
Finally, privacy-- on this
issue, like self-expression,

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:00.350
the cultural approach of copyright
overlaps with the personality theory.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.030
Both invite attention
to the fundamental human

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.690
need for relief from the
crowd, access to settings

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.575
conducive to experimentation,
and intimacy.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:13.270
 

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.750
The list on your screen
is rough and tentative.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.520
It is grounded in millennia
of reflection and experience,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.840
but it is still being
tested and refined.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.820
Date categories are not watertight.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.970
On the contrary, these conditions
reinforce and run into one another.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.470
That, in turn, means that
the set of functionings

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.920
essential to human flourishing could
be organized somewhat differently.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.180
But with those qualifications,
there's remarkable convergence

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.830
by scholars working in
many disciplines concerning

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.930
the importance of these
eight things to a good life.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:52.170
Having cataloged briefly the conditions
that contribute to human flourishing,

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.010
the next issue is how
widely available we

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.850
should strive to make those conditions.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.710
An enormous literature within political
theory addresses that question.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.270
Many different criteria
have been proposed

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.750
for how much equality or inequality with
respect to these or any other resources

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.240
is morally justified.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.410
Three of the many contending
positions are listed in the map.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.560
Exploring this literature
would take us very far afield.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.180
Fortunately, for present
purposes, we need not

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.670
do so because there's broad,
although, of course, not unanimous,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.070
agreement among the contending
camps that all societies today are

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:36.110
characterized by unjustifiably
high levels of inequality.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:40.080
In other words, our task
for the foreseeable future

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.780
is to adjust our institutions so
as to make the eight conditions

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.380
constitutive of a good life more
widely and equally available.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.290
At some point, the issue of
just how equal will become

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:58.060
salient, but unfortunately,
not in the near term.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.090
So when considering
modifications of copyright law,

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.510
we can postpone efforts to resolve
this fundamental issue decisively

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:09.280
and instead commit ourselves
to substantial movement

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.765
in the direction of equality.

00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:14.070
 

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.180
How, then, could we make a good
life more widely available?

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.610
Many possible initiatives
undoubtedly spring to mind.

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.480
Suppress both organized
and disorganized violence.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.020
Increase the availability
of health care and vaccines.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.880
Reorganize workplaces to
increase opportunities

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.960
for genuine participation, and so forth.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.760
It would be foolish to
attempt here to itemize

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.790
all of the political
and legal reforms that

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.020
would help advance the
goals I have posited.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.770
Although some initiatives are
obvious, others are not at all.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.140
I'm just now beginning work on
a book, tentatively entitled

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.370
Good Life, Good Law, that will attempt a
partial survey of this large landscape.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.180
It will likely take years.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.160
For the time being, we can
and should limit our attention

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.190
to dimensions of reform
that are likely to implicate

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.720
the subject at hand-- namely, copyright.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.900
As you might expect,
those dimensions all

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.590
involve improving our
culture, broadly defined.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.240
Four dimensions of culture seem
especially closely connected

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.540
to realization of the aspirations
we have identified thus far.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.100
The first is cultural diversity.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.350
Diversity fosters human flourishing
in many interlocking ways.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.910
It increases both the fact
and the experience of choice.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:39.650
Thus, at least if those choices concern
things that matter to the chooser,

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.640
diversity increases autonomy.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.610
Diversity also increases
invitations and opportunities

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:51.586
for self-expression and for engagement
to other dimensions of the good life.

00:23:51.586 --> 00:23:53.710
The way in which these
themes reinforce one another

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.680
was recognized long ago by Mill.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.620
"The more multifarious the lifestyles
and ideas on public display

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.420
in a society, the more
each of its members

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:09.100
must decide for herself what
to think and how to act,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.470
thereby developing her own
mental and moral faculties,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.830
and rendering the culture as a
whole even more rich, diversified,

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.320
and animating."

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.670
For many of the same reasons,
a rich artistic tradition

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.630
sustains opportunities for
flourishing of many sorts.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.020
This point was made
crisply by Ronald Dworkin,

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.010
one of the foremost
Anglo-American legal theorists.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.360
"The more complex and resonant
the shared language of a culture,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.920
the richer it is in the raw materials of
representation, metaphor, and allusion,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.370
the more opportunities for creativity
and subtlety in communication

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.830
and thought it affords the
members of the culture."

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.510
This claim, and the related notion
that governments should actively

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.580
seek to foster a rich
artistic tradition,

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.130
is unlikely to shock Europeans,
but it is far from universally

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.400
accepted in the United States
or many other countries.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:05.970
It should be.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:14.510
Third, education, it turns out,
is the linchpin of the good life.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.690
Autonomy, engagement,
self-expression, and competence

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.780
are all dependent upon the
kind of knowledge and skills

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.980
that only education can provide.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.340
Recognizing that education is the
preconditions for many dimensions

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.860
of human flourishing has
two important implications.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.250
First, it highlights the
importance of ensuring

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:39.880
that education is widely--
ideally, universally-- available.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.510
Second, it should guide reform
of extant educational systems.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.830
Our goal should be to
enable and encourage

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:54.550
lifelong learning that supports
creativity, competence, and confidence.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.660
We currently fall far short of that.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.330
Technology is rapidly
expanding our capacity

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.930
to construct a system for vibrant,
empowering, lifelong education

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.640
available to people worldwide.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.142
We should adjust copyright law to
facilitate that project, not impede it.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.230
The fourth dimension of a nourishing
culture is democracy-- by this,

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:25.210
I mean, to the extent feasible,
participatory democracy, not

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.080
representative democracy.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.900
There are two aspects of this theme.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.469
The first and more familiar
is political democracy.

00:26:33.469 --> 00:26:35.510
There are, of course,
well-known reasons grounded

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.400
in considerations of legitimacy
and the quality of governance

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.630
for vesting political power
in the people at large.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.710
I will not rehearse
those arguments here.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:49.195
For present purposes, I'm more
concerned with a less instrumental value

00:26:49.195 --> 00:26:53.450
of political democracy, the value
that most impressed Tocqueville

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:58.580
when he visited the United States in
the early 19th century-- specifically,

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.300
the beneficial effect
of political engagement

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.340
on the people who
participate in governance.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.310
Active citizenship, in short, is
good for the heart and the soul,

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:12.411
as well as the polity.

00:27:12.411 --> 00:27:14.160
For essentially the
same reason, we should

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.770
strive to increase participatory
democracy with respect

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:22.000
to cultural meanings, what John
Fiske, Michael Madow, and Jack Balkan

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.100
have called semiotic democracy.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.116
This theme merits some more elaboration.

00:27:28.116 --> 00:27:31.700
 

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.240
During the 19th and 20th centuries,
the cloud of images and symbols

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.810
I mentioned a minute ago gradually,
then rapidly, became increasingly dense.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.050
Equally important, control
over the content of that cloud

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.470
became increasingly concentrated in
fewer and fewer companies, advertising

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:53.630
houses, and political consultants
located in a few countries.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:59.100
The semiotic power, in other words,
was held by fewer and fewer people.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.880
To be sure, the concentration
was never total.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.210
As cultural populists point out,
opportunities for cultural resistance--

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:12.290
for recoding centrally-fashioned
and distributed symbols-- survived.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.557
But those opportunities shrank, and
the refashioned images almost never

00:28:16.557 --> 00:28:18.015
have the currency of the originals.

00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:20.550
 

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.410
Information technology not
only is enabling radically

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.730
new forms of education,
as I just mentioned.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.070
It is also beginning
to reverse this trend

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.410
toward the concentration
of semiotic power.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.340
Digital technologies are enabling
an ever-larger group of people

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.160
to engage in remixing of cultural forms.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.460
Surveys done by my colleagues
John Palfrey and Erst Gosser

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.930
suggests that, already, roughly
one in four young people

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:50.730
worldwide now engage in
remixing digital content

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.530
into their own artistic creations.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.570
That number will surely climb.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.190
This is a trend that should
be celebrated and facilitated,

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.170
not denounced.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:06.540
It implicates favorably several of
the dimensions of the good life.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.990
Specifically, it expands opportunities
for autonomy, engagement,

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.232
self-expression,
competence, and connection.

00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:15.940
Now, to be sure, it's
crucial that we not

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.314
lose sight of the importance
of preserving the incentives

00:29:18.314 --> 00:29:21.380
and rewards for the creation
of the cultural artifacts

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.070
that others can then remix.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.230
But there may be ways
of tuning copyright law

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.680
to reconcile these competing goals.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.990
That possibility and many other
potential reforms of the copyright

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.880
system, we'll take up after the break.
