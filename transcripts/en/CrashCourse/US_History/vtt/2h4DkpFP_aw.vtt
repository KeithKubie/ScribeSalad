Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. history, and today we're going to talk

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.190
about the guy who arguably did the most to
shape the world that I live in. NO, Stan not

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.870
Carrottop. No, not Cumberbatch although he
did do the most to shape the Tumblr that I

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.870
live in. I'm talking about The Great Communicator:
Ronald Reagan.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.420
Reagan is a fascinating president because
he was, in lots of ways, straightforward.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.390
His presidency was called the Reagan Revolution
but it's a bit odd that he gets so much

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.940
credit for changing America because he was
one of the least hands-on of all presidents

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.000
and as you know here at Crash Course we don't
really indulge in great man history. So we're

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.050
going to talk about Reagan but we're also
going to talk about the forces that predated

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.519
his presidency that led to the so-called Reagan
Revolution.

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.589
Mr. Green? Mr Green? I remember some of this
stuff. It's like almost interesting.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.089
I'm glad to be almost interesting me from
the past. Someday maybe you'll be almost

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:58.089
interesting.
Intro

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.800
The Reagan era began, unsurprisingly, with
his election to the Presidency in 1980. Now,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.110
anyone could have beaten Jimmy Carter, but
Reagan succeeded largely by pulling together

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.920
many strands of conservatism.
Reagan emphasized his belief in "states

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
rights" and he condemned "welfare cheats."
He also condemned busing and affirmative action.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
And he won the support of religious conservatives,
including the newly formed Moral Majority,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.410
by standing for family values, even though
in fact he was the first U.S. president to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.850
have been divorced.
Also, he once acted with a monkey. And there's

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.070
nothing "family values" about that.
Stan just informed me that Ronald Reagan did

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.860
not in fact act with a monkey. He acted with
a chimp. I apologize to all the primate rights

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.650
people out there. Good lord!
Now Reagan also appealed to the so-called

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.410
white backlash, working class white people
who resented the advances that African Americans

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.780
had made during the 1960s and the 1970s.
And economic conservatives liked his anti-union,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.740
low taxes, free market positions, and anti-government
crusaders and libertarians liked his assertion

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.700
that government was not the solution to problems,
but was itself the problem.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.570
Then there were the Cold War hawks who liked
his militant anti-Soviet rhetoric and his

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.269
desire to spend more on the military.
Now that's a big coalition but it turned

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.959
out to be just barely a majority coalition.
Still Reagan won in 1980.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.769
He even carried the traditionally Democratic
states of Illinois and New York proving that

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.129
Jimmy Carter truly was profoundly unelectable.
A lot of Reagan's policy ideas weren't

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.540
all that popular at the time, but he truly
was a great communicator.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.980
I mean Reagan's was a former actor and he
knew how to talk to people without them feeling

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.239
condescended to.
Reagan's most famous campaign advertisement

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.780
proclaimed that it was "morning in America"
again, and that relentless optimism (I mean

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.629
at least if you're a morning person) was
a welcome contrast to Jimmy Carter being like

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:42.629
"you should wear sweaters inside to save
fuel." Sorry Jimmy this is America!

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.709
Ronald Reagan used the word "freedom"
more than any other president in American

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.049
history, but it's interesting to think about
what he meant by the word "freedom."

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.329
Because as we've seen in American history
freedom has meant lots of things to lots of

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.359
people. Is freedom, freedom from government
tyranny?

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.099
Or is freedom government protection from hunger
and homelessness and military attacks?

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.239
Do governments ultimately restrict freedom
or provide it?

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.180
Now there's no question that the federal
government that Ronald Reagan inherited would

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.689
have been absolutely foreign to the people
who founded this country.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.939
I mean Social Security, Federal Income Taxes,
the National Endowment for the Arts.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.909
But some people would argue that the America
of 1980 was much more free for more Americans

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.290
than say the America of 1790 when after all
slavery was legal.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.029
And in fact in the early 19th century many
slave owners said that the government was

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:36.159
taking away their freedom to own slaves.
Ultimately, the question for how we should

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.159
imagine freedom and how we should allow for
it, is at the center of American history.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.950
And a big part of Ronald Reagan's vision
of freedom was economic freedom, which he

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.379
laid out in his Economic Bill of Rights.
It would curtain union power, reduce federal

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.639
regulation of industry and the environment,
and most of all lower taxes.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.730
All these ideas were a big part of the Reagan
Revolution. But as we know much of what he

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.430
proposed had been brewing for years during
the rise of conservatism.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.629
So what aspects this Economic Bill of Rights
actually ended up happening? Well, his main

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.010
accomplishment was lowering taxes: in 1981
Reagan persuaded Congress to lower the top

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.529
tax rate from 70% to 50%.
In 1986, Congress went even further with the

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.530
Tax Reform Act that lowered the top income
tax rate to 28%.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.530
Oh, it's time for the mystery document!
The rules here are simple...

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.490
I read the mystery document, I either get
the author of it correct or I get shocked.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.080
Alright here we go. Can I just take a preliminary
guess and say that it's going to be Reagan?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.759
"I will not accept the excuse that the Federal
Government has grown so big and powerful that

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.650
it is beyond the control of any President,
any administration or Congress. We are going

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.849
to put an end to the notion that the American
taxpayer exists to fund the Federal Government.

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.169
The Federal Government exists to serve the
American people and to be accountable to the

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.819
American people. On January 20, we are going
to re-establish that truth.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.310
Also on that date we are going to initiate
action to get substantial relief for our taxpaying

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.539
citizens and to put people back to work. [...] We
will simply apply to our government the common

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.080
sense that we use in our daily lives."

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.129
It is Reagan!

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.319
Stan is telling me that I'm not going to
get the check mark unless I guess the correct

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:18.590
speech?

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.919
Well he talked about January 20th, so obviously
it's not his inaugural address.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.180
It's either the acceptance speech he gave
at the convention or like the speech that

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.220
he gave after he was elected. But I don't
think.... convention? Yes!

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.030
So the idea that to lower taxes is the best
way to spur economic growth is called supply

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.650
side-economics, trickle down economics or,
if you're George HW Bush running against

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.659
Reagan in the 1980 primaries, voodoo economics.

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.319
Sadly, this does not involve zombies or putting
pins in dolls. Instead, it's about high

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.720
interest rates to combat inflation coupled
with cutting taxes, especially for wealthy

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.379
Those rich people then spend more and invest
more in private enterprise which creates new

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.830
jobs.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.470
Also, the thinking goes that lower taxes will
encourage people to work harder since they

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.139
will be able to keep more of their money.

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.270
Did this work? Eh. Now we're getting into
the part of history where it depends on your

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.129
political perspective.

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:14.759
Initially, the high interest rates definitely
provoked a recession in 1981 and 1982. Which

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.669
was not ideal.

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.669
But, inflation did drop from 13.5% in 1981
to 3.5% in 1988 and after 1982 the economy

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.789
began expanding.

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.139
And the rest of the Reagan era saw consistent
increases in gross domestic product; however,

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.439
not everyone benefited from that expansion.
While the stock market boomed, wages didn't

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.870
rise very much. And in fact, haven't risen
since.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.479
Now one of the central ideas of supply-side
economics is that you have lower tax rates

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.509
and you also cut government spending. Because,
you know, the government has less money.

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.729
Which, yeah, it did not happen. The government
is always good at cutting taxes but never

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.099
good at cutting spending.

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.960
The Reagan era did see cuts to some programs,
but the really expensive items: Social Security,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.740
Medicare, Medicaid, they remained largely
intact.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.280
And instead of cutting the overall amount
of spending it actually went up considerably

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.620
because of the defense spending binge that
saw the national debt balloon to 2.7 trillion

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.909
dollars.

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:12.610
But Reagan totally did deliver on his anti-union
rhetoric. In August 1981, when the unionized

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.229
air traffic controllers went out on strike,
violating federal law in the process, Reagan

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.469
fired more than 11 thousand controllers who
refused to return to work..

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:25.819
So as I mentioned before, the 80's were
a pretty great decade for Wall Street generally,

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.909
which is why Oliver Stone made a movie about
it that immortalized the line "Greed is

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:30.449
Good."

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:35.729
In the 1980s it became easier to make money
buying and merging companies than actually

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:42.729
like running them profitably. But fortunately
we later dealt with that problem..... ugh.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.439
We never fix the problems, we only fix the
things that are fine.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.840
One of the reasons that American history is
so important to me is that I want us as a

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.169
country to like summon the courage to deal
seriously with our problems. Sometimes I think

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:02.699
that we're just so cowardly like we're
the cowardliest country on Earth... alright

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:03.259
the French.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:07.259
Right, but like the merger of RJ Reynolds
Tobacco, maker of Winston cigarettes, and

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:12.030
Nabisco, which gave us Oreos, not only created
a cancer and heart disease dream team, it

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:17.430
also generated nearly $1 billion for the lawyers
and bankers who put the deal together.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.150
But if you were like most of us in the 80's
watching Dallas and Dynasty, working at your

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.449
regular job, inexplicably having a carpeted
bathroom, than you probably didn't share

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:26.069
in that abundance.

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:30.569
The 80's saw a rising economic inequality,
although not nearly as dramatic as we see

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:36.889
today. By the mid 1990s the richest 1% controlled
40% of the nation's wealth, double the share

00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:38.349
from 20 years before.

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.789
Meanwhile the income of middle class families
stagnated and that of the poorest 20% began

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:43.589
to decline.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:48.230
And one often overlooked aspect of de-regulation
was the closing of hospitals for the mentally

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.750
ill. Now, some of these institutions were
hellish, but rapid closure of all of these

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.420
facilities without replacement services meant
that many patients were left to live on the

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.320
street. Homelessness increased dramatically.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.000
Now of course Reagan is considered the darling
of conservatives today, but by current standards

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.550
he was something of a moderate.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.310
I mean yes, he cut taxes, and he cut funding
for programs that helped the poor like food

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.630
stamps and school lunches.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.410
But during his second term he worked effectively
with the democratic congress. There's no

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.660
bipartisanship today.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.130
Also, he left the big New Deal and Great Society
programs largely intact.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.630
I mean he was too old to believe in cutting
Medicare. He was like "all of my friends

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.160
are on this."

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.040
And the 80s also didn't see the fulfillment
of the desires of the Christian Right. I mean

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.380
divorce rates went up, abortion continued
to be legal, women didn't leave the workforce.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.200
In fact, Reagan appointed the first woman
to the Supreme Court. Are you kidding? We

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.279
didn't have a woman in the Supreme Court
until the 1980s? This is the craziest country

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:42.790
ever.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.250
Even affirmative action persisted, and Nancy
Reagan's urging of Americans to "Just

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.589
Say No" to drugs didn't convince anybody.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.810
And then we have Ronald Reagan's reputation
as the man who ended the Cold War. The thinking

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.450
here goes that Reagan spent so much money
on defense that the Soviet Union bankrupted

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.120
itself trying to compete.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.310
And there may be a case to be made there but
we don't want to remove agency from the

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.920
people who protested the oppression of life
behind the Iron Curtain.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.910
So while you can argue that the Reagan administration
helped create good conditions for the change

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.839
that happened, the people who made the change,
made it. Alright. Let's go to the ThoughtBubble.

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:19.480
In his first term Ronald Reagan took a really
hard line against the Soviet Union. He called

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.220
it an Evil Empire and even once joked that
the U.S. would "begin bombing in 5 minutes."

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.949
That was ill advised. Reagan also sponsored
the largest military buildup in U.S history

00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:31.440
including the MX missile.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.529
The highlight was his proposed Strategic Defense
Initiative aka Star Wars: space-based missiles

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:42.399
and lasers for shooting Soviet missiles out
of the sky. This was a fantastic idea, although

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:47.410
it would have violated the 1972 Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty, but anyway it was technologically

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.010
impossible to build. The force was not strong
with this idea.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.130
Reagan also pressured NATO to put missiles
in Western Europe and the war games that NATO

00:10:55.130 --> 00:11:00.440
staged in 1983 were so realistic that the
Soviets almost scrambled their planes and

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.880
launched ICBMs.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.910
Now if that had resulted in nuclear war, we
would have a very different story on our hands,

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.360
but it didn't. And Regan's aggressive
nuclear posturing had a couple of positive

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:10.790
results.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.250
First, it boosted the world wide anti-nuclear
weapons movement, called the FREEZE movement.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:20.100
Second, it turned Reagan into the most successful
nuclear abolitionist in the atomic age.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.959
There's nothing like a reasonably close
brush with nuclear apocalypse to tone down

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:28.519
your rhetoric a little. In his second term
Reagan was much more conciliatory towards

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:31.220
the Soviets and worked to reduce the number
of warheads.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.709
In his first term, according to the historian
Victor Sebastian, "[Reagan] spent nearly

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:41.519
as much on defense as Presidents Nixon, Ford,
and Carter combined and much more than both

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:46.860
the cost of the Korean and Vietnam wars,"[1]
but in his second, Reagan toned down both

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.209
the spending and his rhetoric, declaring,
"Our constant and urgent purpose must be

00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:55.220
a lasting reduction of tensions between us."[2]

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.019
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, Reagan was able
to negotiate the first reduction in nuclear

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:02.639
weapons with the new Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev in 1986.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.910
In fact, the two leaders might have tried
to get rid of nuclear weapons altogether,

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.399
but Reagan's unwillingness to give up his
Star Wars initiative made that impossible.

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:15.660
That was a big deal, but the rest of Reagan's
foreign policy was somewhat less triumphant.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.399
For instance, he sent Marines to Lebanon as
part of a peacekeeping mission, but then withdrew

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:22.820
forces after 241 of them were killed by a
car bomb.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.290
And Middle Eastern policy played a key role
in the biggest controversy of Reagan's presidency:

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.949
the Iran-Contra Scandal.

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:32.519
This was truly one of the craziest schemes
ever hatched up by an American presidential

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.519
administration. Which is really saying something.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:39.860
The Contras were rebels seeking to overthrow
the socialist Sandinista government of Nicaragua.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.350
Because they were anti-communists and the
Cold War was in full swing, the Reagan administration

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.470
wanted to support them. But Congress passed
a law saying that they couldn't.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:53.100
So two administration officials, John Poindexter
and Oliver North, got creative. They hatched

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.459
a plan to sell arms to the Iranian government,
still technically our enemies, and then funnelled

00:12:58.459 --> 00:13:01.540
some of the profits from these illegal arms
sales to the Contras.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.769
And Congress would never have to know about
it. Except that they found out.

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.649
Congressional hearings followed, and we learned
a lot about Ronald Reagan's penchant for

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:11.490
delegating the details of his policy to underlings.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.449
In this case, that served him well as he could
plausibly claim that he knew nothing about

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:17.779
the clandestine activities of these two rogue
employees.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.860
And this gets to the big point of the Reagan
era. I'm not sure that it was really about

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:28.300
Reagan. In fact, I'm not sure that any great-man
history is really about the great men that

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.790
supposedly spearheaded it.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.220
Whether or not you think America is better
off from the rise of conservatism we've

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.339
seen since LBJ's great society. It wasn't
really, and it still really isn't about

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:38.940
individuals.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:45.360
It's about us collectively deciding what
we mean when we talk about freedom and equality.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.220
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.589
Crash Course is made with all the help from

00:13:50.589 --> 00:13:53.649
because they care it and partly because, you
know, money.

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:57.420
