science class it's about how we
 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.880
science class it's about how we
represent music especially about how we

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890
represent music especially about how we
 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.790

systems and so that includes a lot of

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
systems and so that includes a lot of
 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.710
systems and so that includes a lot of
work on representing time and scheduling

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720

software that hasn't been thoroughly

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630
software that hasn't been thoroughly
 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.660
software that hasn't been thoroughly
tested but you know I think it's it's

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670
tested but you know I think it's it's
 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.280
tested but you know I think it's it's
part of the excitement and also it makes

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290
part of the excitement and also it makes
 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.369
part of the excitement and also it makes
it makes these projects really real for

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379
it makes these projects really real for
 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.499
it makes these projects really real for
students when the performance is

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509
students when the performance is
 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.080
students when the performance is
successful which I'm sure it will be

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
successful which I'm sure it will be
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.880
successful which I'm sure it will be
I'll be in a much better mood and I'm

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890
I'll be in a much better mood and I'm
 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.199
I'll be in a much better mood and I'm
sure that will have some effect on

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209
sure that will have some effect on
 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.540
sure that will have some effect on
grades
