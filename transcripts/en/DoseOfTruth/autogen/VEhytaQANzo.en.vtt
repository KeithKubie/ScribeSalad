should treat human experience as that
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
should treat human experience as that
reality<00:00:09.690><c> and</c><00:00:10.080><c> so</c><00:00:10.530><c> the</c><00:00:10.710><c> reality</c><00:00:10.950><c> for</c><00:00:11.639><c> you</c><00:00:11.820><c> from</c>

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
a phenomenological perspective is
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
a phenomenological perspective is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
everything you experience is real and
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060 align:start position:0%
everything you experience is real and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 align:start position:0%

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
get more real than that and so your

you know three thousand years ago
 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.450 align:start position:0%
you know three thousand years ago
because<00:00:51.780><c> we</c><00:00:51.960><c> didn't</c><00:00:52.320><c> really</c><00:00:52.500><c> concentrate</c><00:00:53.250><c> on</c>

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
because we didn't really concentrate on
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
because we didn't really concentrate on
