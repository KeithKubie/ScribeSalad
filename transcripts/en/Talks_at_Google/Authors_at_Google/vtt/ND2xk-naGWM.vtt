[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:09.740
GRETCHEN HOWARD: All
right, welcome, everyone.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.300
I am Gretchen Howard.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.340
I am one of the
partners at CapitalG,

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.100
which is Alphabet's growth
equity investing fund.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.840
And I have the privilege
and honor of introducing you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.060
to my friend, Jimmy O. Yang.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.260
Come on down.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.718
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.962
[DOG BARKING]

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:35.128
I'm going to give you a hug.

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:36.116
JIMMY O. YANG: Thank you.

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:36.630
Thank you.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.915
GRETCHEN HOWARD: All right.

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:38.122
[DOG BARKING]

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:40.430
JIMMY O. YANG: Hey, gang.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.961
Thanks for coming
out, everybody.

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:42.710
I appreciate that.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.959
Is there a dog here?

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.250
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yes, there is.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.041
JIMMY O. YANG: Aww.

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:49.440
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So Google
has a dog open-door policy.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340
So Jimmy wrote a book recently.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.005
It's called "How to American."

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:56.630
We're going to have
a little chat here,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.610
and then we'll open
it up to questions.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.730
And just as a little
incentive, if you

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.040
don't have the book already,
those who ask questions

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.800
will be the first to get your
very own copy of the book.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.700
JIMMY O. YANG: Ooh!

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.992
So exciting.

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:11.288
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:13.730
And I'll be signing and
taking pictures afterwards.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.001
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Exactly.

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:15.500
Yeah.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.840
All right.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.820
So we're going to
start in the beginning.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.610
JIMMY O. YANG: Hi.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.169
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
You're born-- hi.

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:20.210
You're born in Hong Kong.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.930
JIMMY O. YANG: Uh-huh.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.800
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
Tell me about that.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.970
Let's start there.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.803
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:28.039
I was born in Hong Kong, and
I moved to LA when I was 13.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.080
GRETCHEN HOWARD: In 2000.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.090
JIMMY O. YANG: In 2000.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.410
That was after, like, the
handoff from the British colony

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.010
back to China, right?

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.000
And I think there was
a lot of worry there.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.845
It's probably one of the reasons
why our family moved here.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.720
And when I first came
here, I couldn't really

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.020
speak English very well, kind
of like Jian Yang, you know?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.130
And I just, I've learned
English in Hong Kong

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.652
how kids here would
learn Spanish.

00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:52.610
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.060
JIMMY O. YANG: So
it's not very well.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.460
And like, I didn't understand
the simplest slangs,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.180
like what's up.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.930
Like, they don't teach
you that in school.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.940
Like, what's up?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.870
You know, right?

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.350
And eventually I
learned a lot of English

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.289
by watching "BET Rap City."

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.240
That was like, my thing.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.925
So yeah.

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.550
And then it just
progressed from there.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.633
GRETCHEN HOWARD: But even
before you moved to LA--

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:17.610
let me see if I
get this straight.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.655
Your parents were
originally from Shanghai.

00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:20.780
JIMMY O. YANG: That's true.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.660
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Did
they spoke Shanghaiese?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.580
JIMMY O. YANG: We spoke-- it was
speaking Shanghaiese back home.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.667
And then I learned
Cantonese from school.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:28.500
GRETCHEN HOWARD: OK.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.450
JIMMY O. YANG: So I speak
Cantonese in school,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.064
and then I watch
shows in Mandarin.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:33.980
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So no
wonder you're confused.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.730
JIMMY O. YANG: Very.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.230
Yeah.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.854
And then English
somewhere came along.

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:39.020
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So how did
that even feel as a kid,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.020
even before you got to the US,
not knowing how to speak really

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.150
good English, just
being in Hong Kong

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.557
but having parents who
came from the mainland?

00:02:46.557 --> 00:02:47.390
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.630
I was kind of already the
foreign kid, because whenever

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.720
I speak to my parents,
they'll be like, oh, that's

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.040
the Shanghai boy right there.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.340
You know, there was like an
internal almost hierarchy,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.812
and a semi-racism
within Chinese people.

00:03:00.812 --> 00:03:02.270
Like, Hong Kong
people always think

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.500
they're better than other
mainland China people.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.830
And so they always called
me the Shanghai boy.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.900
And so maybe that was
like, my first experience

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.170
at assimilation, which
really came in handy later

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.840
when I came to America, when I
was actually the foreign kid.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.370
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Already sort
of felt like an outsider--

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.790
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.750
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
--still in Hong Kong.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.020
OK.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.100
So you get to the US.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.704
You're in LA.

00:03:22.704 --> 00:03:23.620
JIMMY O. YANG: Mm-hmm.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.150
GRETCHEN HOWARD: What's
your first day in the US?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.860
What happens?

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.341
JIMMY O. YANG: It was just
complete culture shock,

00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:32.840
because Hong Kong
is like Manhattan.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.702
You've got buildings
25 stories high.

00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:35.660
It's a concrete jungle.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.790
And then you came to LA.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.530
The streets are
like six lanes wide.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.622
Everything was just like
a two-story strip mall.

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:42.830
And you walk down the street.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.038
There's nobody in the street.

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:45.730
So it's like, where am I?

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.323
It was like, is this "Mad
Max," or what's going on?

00:03:48.323 --> 00:03:50.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.250
And the first day,
my grandpa took us

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.410
to his favorite
American restaurant.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.960
We walked 45 minutes
down the street.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.130
First of all, we
passed by Pizza Hut.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.910
And that was my favorite
restaurant in Hong Kong,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.410
because Pizza Hut in Hong Kong
is like a gourmet restaurant,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.920
with like, seafood, pasta,
and like, real gourmet soups

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.000
and stuff.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.860
And then I saw the real,
authentic American version,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.860
and it was just a hole
in the wall with an oven.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.336
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:15.640
I'm like, what is this?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.990
How is the real version worse
than the foreign version?

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.702
I was panicking.

00:04:21.702 --> 00:04:23.660
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So where
did Grandpa take you?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.580
JIMMY O. YANG: And then
Grandpa, he was like,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.455
this is my favorite
American restaurant, when

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:28.940
we arrived at this strip mall.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.565
And it was El Pollo Loco.

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:35.900
It was a Mexican
fast food place.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.412
But it was amazing.

00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:38.870
And then it was
like the first time

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.879
I experienced American freedom
inside of El Pollo Loco,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.420
because if you think about it,
they give you so many choices.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.072
There's dark meat
and white meat,

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:48.530
which my grandpa was like,
don't ever order the white meat.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.620
That's dry and rough.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.310
That's for American idiots, OK?

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.950
Get the dark meat.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.160
There's corn tortilla
and flour tortilla.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.760
You get the flour tortilla
because the corn tastes funny.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.604
And then you get
a glass of water,

00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:03.020
and you can go to
the soda machine

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.820
and get whatever you want.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.570
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Not
exactly how it works.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.620
JIMMY O. YANG: And then
you can go to the salsa bar

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.780
and just get whatever
you want, you know?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.745
Get some onions and cilantro.

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:17.010
You can go home and saute that
stuff for some dish later.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.955
It's freedom, people.

00:05:19.955 --> 00:05:21.080
GRETCHEN HOWARD: All right.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.340
So after you ate your
little chicken taco,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.550
you go to middle school in LA.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.140
And you go to John
Burroughs, right?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.598
JIMMY O. YANG: Yes,
John Burroughs.

00:05:28.598 --> 00:05:31.130
It's very-- it's inside of
LA Unified School District,

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.720
so it's very diverse.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.780
It's the first time I
ever met a black person,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.060
a white person, a Latino
person in real life,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.530
because in Hong
Kong, obviously all

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.570
you had was Chinese
people in my school.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.990
And it was crazy,
because I had seen

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.910
these different types
of people on TV,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.380
but I had never met them.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.160
And I was 13.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.080
I was about, I don't
know, like 4' 10"--

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.392
really scrawny little
kid with glasses.

00:05:53.392 --> 00:05:55.100
And like, I just
remember the first day--

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.026
I was pretty good at basketball
back home, in Hong Kong.

00:05:58.026 --> 00:05:59.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.330
And then when I came here,
I was-- in eighth grade,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.072
this kid, Marquise,
was like, dunking.

00:06:05.072 --> 00:06:07.700
And I'm like, yo, like, this
is what America is about.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.570
Like, it was crazy to me.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.960
And then I saw this Latino kid.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.370
He had a mustache.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.410
I couldn't grow any
hair at that point.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.690
It was complete culture shock.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.410
And I was just-- you know,
my English wasn't that good,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.780
so I was just trying to fit in.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.070
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I thought
you were a ping pong

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.230
star back in Hong Kong, which
is so stereotypical, but like--

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.521
JIMMY O. YANG: Back in the day.

00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:28.040
I was very stereotypical
growing up in Hong Kong.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.280
I played the violin.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.570
I was pretty good at math.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.610
And I played ping
pong competitively.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.920
But that seems like a stereotype
here, but in Hong Kong,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.990
you're just another dude.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.740
That's just what people do.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.170
It's like playing catch.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.730
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Did you
bring your skills, though,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.410
to the middle school?

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.960
Did you show them off?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.320
JIMMY O. YANG: No, nobody
cared about ping pong.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.456
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:50.456 --> 00:06:53.850
Maybe until college, when it
became like a beer pong game,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.580
but that's a whole different--

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.120
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
We're not there yet.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.490
JIMMY O. YANG: --skill set.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.810
GRETCHEN HOWARD: We're
in middle school.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.130
Yeah.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.860
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.276
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
So middle school,

00:06:59.276 --> 00:07:01.520
is this when your BET love
affair with the television

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.020
started?

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.500
JIMMY O. YANG: I
think it started.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.958
I remember the
first day of school,

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.756
people were telling
me to sag my pants.

00:07:07.756 --> 00:07:10.130
Like, I'm in the locker room
changing into my PE clothes,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.500
and the kids are like, hey, hey.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.010
Pull your shorts down.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.341
And I'm like, oh my god,
what is going on here in LA?

00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:16.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.420
And apparently, it's a culture
of sagging your pants, back

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.620
in the early 2000s.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.850
You know, that looks cool.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.470
If you pull it all the way up,
they call you John Stockton.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.380
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So how
far did you pull them down?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.796
JIMMY O. YANG: I pulled them
all the way down to my knees.

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:31.860
And they were like, no,
no, no, don't do that.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.026
And even just-- even
underwear, it's just different.

00:07:34.026 --> 00:07:35.810
Like, people wear boxers here.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.986
In Hong Kong, we
wear tighty whiteys.

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:39.860
And people made fun of
me for that, you know?

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.190
So I learned a lot, not just
by the language, but culture,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.642
from watching BET.

00:07:45.642 --> 00:07:46.600
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.940
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.790
GRETCHEN HOWARD: And
then how was it--

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.890
so you're in middle school.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.760
Then you go to Beverly
Hills High School, right?

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.593
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:52.570
My dad was a genius.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.379
He used a fake
address for me to go.

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:56.170
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Jimmy's
dad is right here.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.450
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.850
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Stand up.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.320
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, he's--

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.945
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Say
hi to Jimmy's dad.

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:02.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.610
JIMMY O. YANG: Oldest
Googler in the building.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.010
And the subtitle of the book,
it's-- well, the title is,

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.240
"How to American--

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.620
an Immigrant's Guide at
Disappointing Your Parents."

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.990
So here we are.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:21.740
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So we're going
to talk about, you're still

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.240
not quite in the disappointment
phase in high school, right?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.115
That's more college?

00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:26.448
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:26.448 --> 00:08:28.890
I'm still the good
Asian kid then.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.489
I got to disappointing
them later.

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:33.030
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So who did you
hang out with in high school?

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.529
JIMMY O. YANG: It's
a group of kids.

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:36.340
I wanted to hang out with--

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.309
I wanted to find, like,
a group of Chinese kids

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.020
I could kind of really
hang on to, you know?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.686
When you don't really
know the language,

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:45.850
you know, you kind of
long for that, something

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.590
that reminds you of back home.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.840
But there wasn't really a lot
of Chinese kids in high school.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.950
So I ended up just hanging out
a bunch random misfits, right?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.180
Like, I had a couple
of Persian friends,

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.190
a friend from Bangladesh,
and then a friend--

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.440
one Chinese friend and then
a Korean immigrant friend.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.600
So it was a great group
of different people.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.500
And we just kind of--

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.260
we were never the cool kids,
but we also weren't super lame.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.410
We just kind of never fit in
with any particular group.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.610
We weren't the skaters.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.200
We weren't the athletes
or anything like that.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.840
GRETCHEN HOWARD: But you
started to find your people.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.250
You started--

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.041
JIMMY O. YANG: I started
to find my people,

00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:20.081
and I started a rap group.

00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:22.080
That's what happens when
you watch too much BET.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.000
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Can you do a
little of that rap for us now?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.720
JIMMY O. YANG: I can't.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.350
No.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.850
No.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.482
I was horrible.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:27.510
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Just a little?

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:27.780
JIMMY O. YANG: No.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.380
I-- well, what I
did, I eventually--

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.450
I knew I was a horrible rapper.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.140
So I recruited my
buddies who can rap,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.700
and I just made the beats.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.590
And that was like, my
first creative outlet.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.410
It was me, my black
friend Julian, and then

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.250
my other friend, Yuji, who was
half black and half Japanese.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.440
So it was perfectly one
and a half Asian guys

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.690
and one and a half black guys.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.870
And we called the rap
group the Yellow Panthers.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.850
It was very embarrassing.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:58.540
Yeah.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.150
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Did you
ever sell one of your songs?

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.707
JIMMY O. YANG: I sold maybe a
couple bootleg CDs in school.

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:04.915
Like, we would just burn CDs.

00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:06.540
You guys remember
that, when you burn--

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.150
it takes 30 minutes
to burn a CD,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.160
and then you sell it for
like $5 to some kids.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.720
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
There wasn't like,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.019
a porn site that bought one
of your songs or something?

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:13.852
JIMMY O. YANG: What?

00:10:13.852 --> 00:10:16.420
What are you talking about?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.230
My first paycheck I really
made in show business

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.980
was from a website
called fudgestick.com.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.522
This is true.

00:10:24.522 --> 00:10:25.021
OK?

00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:25.950
Don't look it up.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.572
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:27.572 --> 00:10:29.570
It's not a thing anymore.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.410
It used to be a
site, a porno site.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.610
And I used to post my
beats that I made online.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.020
And this guy called me one day.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.600
He was like, hey,
are you Doc West?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.250
That was my beat maker name.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.920
Which is like the
wackest name ever, right?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.600
Doc West.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.850
It's like from Dr. Dre and Kanye
West, I just combined the two

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.125
and called myself Doc--

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:55.160
it's horribly hacky.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.240
And he called.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.840
He was like, hey, so,
are you Christian?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.280
I'm like, not really.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:01.780
Why?

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.279
What's up?

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:05.420
He was like, well, so I'm in the
adult entertainment business.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.190
And a lot of Christian
people aren't

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.870
down with what I'm doing.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.670
And my name's LeRon James.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.420
That was his name.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.820
Not LeBron James--

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.570
LeRon James.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:16.472 --> 00:11:19.400
And he was like, I
like one your beats.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.611
And can I use it for a
trailer for one of my pornos?

00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.260
So I sold it to him--

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.775
my first paycheck.

00:11:29.775 --> 00:11:30.900
GRETCHEN HOWARD: All right.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.490
So a little short-lived
music career.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.270
You go to college.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:33.844
UCSD?

00:11:33.844 --> 00:11:35.010
JIMMY O. YANG: UC San Diego.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.020
[CHEERING]

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.830
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Ooh, we've
got some in the house.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.871
JIMMY O. YANG: I'm sorry.

00:11:37.871 --> 00:11:39.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:45.360
I'm sorry-- one of the most
boring places I've ever been.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.100
Did you like it?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.300
You did like it?

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.870
Oh, good.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.650
What did you guys study?

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.740
Like, engineering, computer
science, or something?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:51.990
Good.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.365
Well, at least you guys studied
something you guys liked.

00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:55.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.520
Economics!

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.876
How did you end up here?

00:11:57.876 --> 00:12:00.392
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:00.392 --> 00:12:03.300
Imposter.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.000
Kidding.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.500
Kidding.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.440
So am I. I studied
economics also.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.300
And here I am.

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:12.180
GRETCHEN HOWARD: But you
didn't-- is that what your dad

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.482
wanted you to major in?

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:14.690
JIMMY O. YANG: He wanted me--

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.106
like, something
legitimate, right?

00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:18.090
What Asian parents would
consider legitimate

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.100
is like, engineering, science.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.650
So I went in as a mechanical
engineering major.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.101
And I realized I
would never graduate.

00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:27.600
So then I went into
economics, which

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.700
is like the easiest
major that is still

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.110
approved by Asian parents.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:34.170
Right?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.600
He was a financial advisor.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.540
It was like, that's what it is.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.196
And so I did it for five years.

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:43.320
It took me five years to
graduate with my economics

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.350
degree, which is very sad.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.560
And I didn't--

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.809
GRETCHEN HOWARD: A lot of
extracurricular activities?

00:12:50.809 --> 00:12:53.350
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, you know,
smoking a little too much weed

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.130
my freshman year.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.615
I was just trying
to not be grouped

00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:01.990
in-- because there's so many
Asian people in UCSD, right?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.020
It was like, for the first time
I came to America, that Asian

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.850
was the majority once again.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.730
But now, I have a different
identity crisis, because now, I

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.530
don't want to be grouped in
as the other kids, because I'm

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.180
like, dude, I listen
to Jay-Z, man.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.635
Like, I'm Doc West.

00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:15.510
You know what I mean?

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.147
Like, I don't--
you know, I'm cool.

00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:21.730
So when you're
younger, you don't want

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.039
to be grouped in with some--

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.830
or when you hit that
age, that college age,

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.163
you don't want to be grouped in.

00:13:26.163 --> 00:13:27.640
So I tried to do other stuff.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.910
And for some reason, as
twisted as this logic sounds

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.380
it kind of made sense to me, was
if you just smoke enough weed,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.420
you would transcend
being just the Asian kid.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.820
You will be the stoner kid.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.695
You know what I mean?

00:13:42.695 --> 00:13:46.760
And for me, in my mind,
somehow that's better.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.280
Sorry, Dad.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.205
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:49.705
But--

00:13:52.654 --> 00:13:54.320
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So
did you not hang out

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.520
with any other Asian kids, then?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:55.760
JIMMY O. YANG: No, no.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.260
I did.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.970
I mean, that's my only option
at UCSD, and it was fine.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.650
But it was like, maybe
other Asian stoner kids.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.240
I didn't know what
I wanted to do.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.364
Like, when I graduated
after five years,

00:14:07.364 --> 00:14:08.780
I had no idea what
I wanted to do.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.250
I just know I didn't
want to do economics.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.330
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.180
JIMMY O. YANG: You know, I had
an internship at Smith Barney

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.430
that my dad hooked me up with.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.780
It was one of the really
nice financial firms.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.488
I don't know if you
guys know about this.

00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:20.960
Smith Barney, I mean, it
just sounds nice, too.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.170
I think it's part of Morgan
Stanley now or something.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.074
But like, I just,
sitting behind a desk,

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.615
I was just like, oh
my god, I'm going

00:14:27.615 --> 00:14:28.990
to do this for
the next 40 years,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.270
looking at some other
people's mutual funds?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.590
I was having a panic attack.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.506
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yeah.

00:14:33.506 --> 00:14:35.690
JIMMY O. YANG: I mean,
that actually sounds

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.430
attractive to a lot of people--

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.890
like, you know, the safety of
having a nice job like that.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.641
But to me, it just
didn't appeal to me.

00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:42.140
So--

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.790
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
But that's hard.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.400
I mean, your dad
got you this job.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:44.530
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.070
GRETCHEN HOWARD: And he helped
you go to college, right?

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.190
He was there for you.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.904
He really like, raised you a
lot through your teenage years,

00:14:49.904 --> 00:14:51.820
right, because your mom
went back to Shanghai?

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.130
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.560
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So papa over
here, and all of a sudden,

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.650
you tell him you don't want
to do the job that he got you.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.020
I mean, what was-- how did you--

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.936
JIMMY O. YANG: That's
when I disappointed him.

00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:01.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:04.100
GRETCHEN HOWARD: How did you
get up the courage, though,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.189
to have that
conversation with him?

00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:08.480
JIMMY O. YANG: It was hard,
man, because you don't ever

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.160
want to disappoint your
parents, especially if they've

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.750
done so much for you, right?

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.660
Like, they came to this country
for you, for your education,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.474
got you in school, right?

00:15:16.474 --> 00:15:18.890
Faked an address to get me
into Beverly Hills High School.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.750
I mean, come on.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.250
And then I'm going to tell them
I don't want to do this job,

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.940
you know?

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.479
And do what?

00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:24.020
I don't know.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.910
Like, stand up?

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.440
And it was hard.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.820
But I figured it was probably
better to disappoint my parents

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.830
for a couple of years
than to disappoint myself

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.180
for the rest of my life.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.580
So that's why I just,
I was like, I can't--

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.564
Dad, I can't do this.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:40.730
I don't want to do this job.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.230
And I went through a
journey after that,

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.190
of finding what I wanted to do.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.380
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.370
JIMMY O. YANG: I
didn't think stand up

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.411
was going to be a career.

00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:54.030
It was just something
I found that--

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.590
it was a friendship that
I found in stand up,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.540
with other comedians,
and a camaraderie,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.040
and something to do,
even, just a community,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.009
so I don't feel as stuck.

00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:05.050
But I tried other things.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.050
You know, I got three
jobs when I graduated.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.160
I sold used cars during the day.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.010
This was all in San Diego.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.860
And then I would go to
work at the Comedy Palace,

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.147
working the door,
collecting tickets.

00:16:17.147 --> 00:16:19.230
And then in exchange, I
would get a couple minutes

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.340
of stage time, doing stand up.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.680
And then at night, I
became a strip club DJ.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.384
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:27.384 --> 00:16:30.180
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So let's talk
about that, because your boss'

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.117
name was Shooter?

00:16:31.117 --> 00:16:31.950
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:32.710
He was Shooter.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:33.270
I don't know why.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.353
He probably shot somebody.

00:16:34.353 --> 00:16:35.370
Who knows?

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.252
It was a very gangster,
seedy strip club.

00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:40.710
And when you're like, 22, you
think working at a strip club

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.150
is like the coolest
thing, right?

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.720
Especially when you watch
too much music videos.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.620
But it wasn't.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.280
It was like-- I soon realized
nobody in that strip club

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.166
actually wanted to work there.

00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:54.540
They were there because they'd
been to prison a few times

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.010
and they have to work there now.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.170
And everybody got
nicknames, like Shooter.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.570
The bouncer's name was Beast.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.820
He used to be in the Aryan
Brotherhood back in prison,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.144
so he probably wasn't too
hot on me working there.

00:17:05.144 --> 00:17:06.920
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right, right.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.300
JIMMY O. YANG: And yeah.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.280
It wasn't that great
of an environment.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.584
But I tried to be
professional, you know?

00:17:12.584 --> 00:17:14.442
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.442 --> 00:17:16.900
GRETCHEN HOWARD: That's all
we're going to talk about that.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.530
OK.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.960
But back to your stand up.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.849
It sounded like when you were
taking tickets at the door,

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.700
you actually had some people
who became really good friends

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.500
and also advisors.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.980
So Sean Kelly?

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.480
Was that--

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.110
JIMMY O. YANG: Sean Kelly.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.435
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
Talk to me about him.

00:17:29.435 --> 00:17:30.580
JIMMY O. YANG: A
good friend of mine.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.750
He kind of became my mentor.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.840
I think that's one of the most
important things, is finding

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.470
a good mentor, and not
afraid to ask somebody

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.947
to be a mentor, and really--

00:17:39.947 --> 00:17:41.530
GRETCHEN HOWARD: How
did you meet him?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.160
Who is he?

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.993
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:17:42.993 --> 00:17:45.980
So he was the guy that
started the Comedy Palace.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.170
He was like a businessman
and a comedian.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.670
And everybody in
San Diego was like,

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.670
yo, if you want stage time,
you need talk to Sean Kelly.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.830
I'm like, who's Sean Kelly?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.280
They're like, Dave Chappelle's
cousin or something?

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.630
Like, I don't know.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.510
And he turned out just to be
like this brilliant businessman

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.790
that really helped
me along my career.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.400
And yeah.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.266
He was the one, I guess, in
the beginning, he was like,

00:18:07.266 --> 00:18:09.140
man, you know, you've
got such a unique story

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.760
of your immigration, you know?

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.210
And you're wasting your time
talking about, like, hacky

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.277
masturbation jokes.

00:18:15.277 --> 00:18:15.860
Don't do that.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.030
Every other comic can do that.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.080
But you have your own story.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.520
You should develop
this material,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.894
eventually write
a book about it.

00:18:20.894 --> 00:18:22.437
And then you can do talks.

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:23.270
You can do whatever.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.770
And look.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.640
Look at me.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.290
And he was the one
that talked me out

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.230
of working at that strip club.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.979
He was like, yo, Jimmy,
you're funny, man.

00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:34.030
You've got to move to LA before
this gets like, into like,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.570
a point of no return.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:36.850
So yeah.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.680
Yeah, finding that mentor
is extremely important.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.080
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I love that he
pushed you in that direction,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.965
because there's one
part in the book where

00:18:42.965 --> 00:18:45.340
Terrell and Guam, who seemed
to be good friends of yours,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:45.835
who are also--

00:18:45.835 --> 00:18:46.810
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah,
they're two comics.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.335
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
They're two comics.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:47.890
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.848
GRETCHEN HOWARD: But it
sounded like, you know,

00:18:49.848 --> 00:18:53.362
they had a more lively sex
life than you did at this time.

00:18:53.362 --> 00:18:54.820
JIMMY O. YANG:
Right, right, right.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.945
GRETCHEN HOWARD: And so
they were incorporating all

00:18:56.945 --> 00:18:58.500
of that into their stand up.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.810
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.220
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
And you were like--

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.210
JIMMY O. YANG: I
wanted to do that.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.168
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:19:02.168 --> 00:19:04.060
But it wasn't authentic, right?

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.970
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.077
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So Sean has
somehow saw that in you, not--

00:19:08.077 --> 00:19:09.160
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.530
GRETCHEN HOWARD: And made
you tell your real story.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.989
So how did that
change your comedy?

00:19:11.989 --> 00:19:13.071
JIMMY O. YANG: It's great.

00:19:13.071 --> 00:19:14.422
I think it's still evolving.

00:19:14.422 --> 00:19:15.880
When you first
start as a comedian,

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.509
you just try-- you're
not funny, right?

00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:19.050
Nobody's funny when
they first start.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.130
You just try to do
jokes that you've

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.440
seen on TV and your
own remix of that--

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.920
you know, a lot of, like I said,
masturbation jokes, or like--

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.370
and then you graduate to some
like, self-deprecating Asian

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.930
jokes or something like that.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.300
And then eventually, you are
able to become more vulnerable

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.570
and talk about the immigration
stories that I have,

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.820
like that I wrote in the book.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.880
And I'm really happy to kind
of use some of that material.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.010
And that's material
people can't even steal,

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.260
and it's just your thing, right?

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.460
So I think that's what I'm
trying to strive to doing,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.590
because that's what some
my favorite comedians did.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.970
You know, Chappelle--

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.490
George Lopez has
great family stories,

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.482
and like, him being a
Mexican-American in America.

00:20:00.482 --> 00:20:01.690
So I want to do more of that.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.380
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.796
So how did you
then make that jump

00:20:03.796 --> 00:20:07.760
from doing stand up to then
going to LA, getting an agent?

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.190
Like, talk me
through that shift.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.840
JIMMY O. YANG: Oh, man.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.450
I just wanted to do stand up.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.550
My goal was to get
a college agent.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.326
I could make like $2,000 a week
doing college shows, right?

00:20:18.326 --> 00:20:20.200
But then, you know,
things started to unfold.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.220
And I went back to LA.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.410
I was living in this
dude's living room

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.680
from Craigslist, for $300,
because I didn't want to move

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.110
back to my dad's as a failure.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.799
So I--

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.340
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
You're on the couch?

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.715
JIMMY O. YANG: It
was a struggle.

00:20:37.715 --> 00:20:39.850
I was just trying
to make ends meet.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.494
I was hoping to
book a commercial,

00:20:41.494 --> 00:20:42.910
because a commercial,
you can make

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:48.834
like thousands of dollars in
one day of work, with residuals.

00:20:48.834 --> 00:20:50.250
So that was what
I was hoping for.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.440
So I signed up, put my head
shots up on all those websites,

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.427
like desperately
seeking for an agent.

00:20:56.427 --> 00:20:58.760
And then the first agent I
met with, a commercial agent,

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.000
I was like, oh,
man, this is great.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.490
I'm going to be great.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.150
This is going to change my life.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.960
And I drove up.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.965
I pulled up.

00:21:03.965 --> 00:21:06.017
It was an apartment
rental office.

00:21:06.017 --> 00:21:07.100
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Oh, jeez.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.766
JIMMY O. YANG: It
wasn't even an agency.

00:21:08.766 --> 00:21:11.180
I walked into an
apartment building.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.790
And then he had me read the
Staples commercial, right?

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.310
It's like, Staples, where all
the folks, da, da, da, da, da.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.880
And I was so bad, the apartment
rental agency rejected me.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.250
They were like, ah, we're fine.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.270
We don't need you.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.740
And I was like, almost
about to give up on that.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.940
And then I found another
small agent that kind of

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.230
took a chance on me.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.600
And she started sending me out
on auditions that were like,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.630
beyond my goals at
that time, even-- not

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.602
just commercials, but
like, "Modern Family,"

00:21:37.602 --> 00:21:39.060
just like two lines
here and there.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.470
And I couldn't--

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.310
I guess I learned some
timing from doing stand up.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:47.210
But I had never taken acting
classes, so I wasn't very good.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.660
And then eventually, I spent a
lot of money on acting classes.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.480
And I got my first part
on "Two Broke Girls."

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.920
It was just like two lines.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.530
And I thought that was
like the epitome of acting.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.500
Like, it was amazing.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.939
And then from then, you
know, the two-line part.

00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:05.480
And then I got
another two-line part,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.629
got a part on "Always Sunny"
with a few more lines.

00:22:07.629 --> 00:22:09.920
GRETCHEN HOWARD: And what
type of characters were they,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.820
you getting cast in?

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.070
JIMMY O. YANG: It's different.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.680
One of my favorite
parts in the book

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.970
is this audition
log I have, right?

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.970
It's the 101 auditions
that I went on

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.560
before I got my 102nd audition,
which was "Silicon Valley."

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.810
So let me see here, if I
can find a good section.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.230
Where is that log?

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.800
Oh, here you go.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.960
It was a hundred--

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.464
so all these auditions, I used
to meticulously keep a log.

00:22:38.464 --> 00:22:40.880
And then I got on "Silicon
Valley" and I'm like, OK, fine.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.960
But it's a lot of like,
stereotypical roles.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.157
Like, my first few parts
that I auditioned for,

00:22:49.157 --> 00:22:49.990
I don't even get it.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.680
It's like, loud Japanese host.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.440
Taiwanese, 20, looks
like 12, computer geek.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.330
Tucker-- ethnic friend.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:03.830
Right?

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.625
It's like these two-line parts.

00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:08.000
This is one of my favorite
parts, looking at these parts.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.990
I'm like, oh my god.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.236
Like, I used to dream
about getting these roles.

00:23:11.236 --> 00:23:12.110
You know what I mean?

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.540
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.210
JIMMY O. YANG: And really,
"Silicon Valley" started off

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.579
as a two-line part also.

00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:17.120
It was when Jian
Yang opened the door

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.620
and he's like, "This
is Pied Piper."

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.730
Like, that was the two lines
that kind of started it.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.480
And then they wrote
the fish scene after,

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.280
and then something else.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.380
And then by season 2, I
became a series regular.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.900
It was-- and so like, I felt
like I snuck in the back door.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.900
And it was just amazing.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.691
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So
even that first season,

00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:35.360
you were still trying to pay the
rent, trying to make it work?

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.690
JIMMY O. YANG: I got
paid $900 per episode.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.840
$900-- that's the
SAG minimum wage, OK?

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.540
That's the lowest
they can pay an actor.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.970
And that's what most people
get paid in Hollywood

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.650
when you're just starting out.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.400
So I was in three episodes
in the first season,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.255
and I had maybe like
five words total.

00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:55.130
And I was paid, what?

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.340
Like $2,700-- you know,
with maybe residuals, $3,000

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.020
at the end of the day.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.720
And I was still super broke.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.550
I actually drove
Uber between season 1

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.570
and season 2 of
"Silicon Valley,"

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.200
but nobody recognized me then.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:15.680
And I used that $2,700 as down
payment for like a 2006 Prius.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.070
And then that's how I
could sustain myself.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.690
And when I got a call to be
a series regular on season 2,

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.665
it was life changing.

00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:26.039
Like, I knew that
was the moment.

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:28.465
I was like, oh my god,
everything's about to change.

00:24:28.465 --> 00:24:28.920
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Awesome.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.140
So let's talk about
Mike Judge, then,

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.360
because he's obviously been
a big influence on you.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.776
JIMMY O. YANG:
Mike Judge, my guy,

00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:36.050
who wrote the
foreword on this book.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:36.550
Yeah.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.175
GRETCHEN HOWARD: And
the first time you

00:24:38.175 --> 00:24:41.030
ever heard him speak was,
besides "Beavis and Butthead"--

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.320
JIMMY O. YANG: It was at UCSD.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.670
Mike Judge was my commencement
speaker when I graduated.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:47.510
How crazy is that?

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.490
2009, he was the campus-wide
commencement speaker.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.410
I was very hung over that day.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.660
GRETCHEN HOWARD: But you went.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.950
JIMMY O. YANG: I
almost didn't go.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.030
And then my buddy convinced me.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.571
He's like, oh, come
on, man, just go.

00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:02.024
You know, he did, like,
"Beavis and Butthead."

00:25:02.024 --> 00:25:03.440
He's the "Beavis
and Butthead" guy

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.260
and the "King of the Hill" guy.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.218
I'm like, OK, whatever.

00:25:05.218 --> 00:25:06.510
I'll go.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.900
And then his story
really spoke to me,

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.490
because I was really
lost at the time.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.030
And he was saying that he
was a physics major in UCSD,

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.530
and he was working in Silicon
Valley in the late '80s,

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.770
making computer chips for
fighter jets, I believe.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.430
And he said he just
didn't like it, you know?

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.890
And eventually, he became
a touring musician.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.980
And then from then, he found his
passion in an animated studio,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.890
and that's how he made
"Beavis and Butthead."

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.120
It was an amazing story.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.510
It was a story that I kind of
never allowed myself to have,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.250
growing up in an Asian family.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.219
My dad always told me that
if you pursue your dreams,

00:25:46.219 --> 00:25:47.510
that's how you become homeless.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.996
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.560
Artists are homeless people.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.980
So he never-- like, I was
never allowed to kind of have

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.772
that dream thing, right?

00:26:00.772 --> 00:26:01.980
That's a very American thing.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.990
And that's what a big
theme in the book is.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.840
It's, in Asian culture, you're
supposed to be obedient, follow

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.820
the rules, be a good son.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.710
In American culture,
you're supposed

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.760
to be an independent man,
go pursue your dreams,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.676
pursue your happiness.

00:26:13.676 --> 00:26:15.242
So how do you kind
of-- you know,

00:26:15.242 --> 00:26:16.950
I'm sure a lot of
Asian people here could

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.810
relate to this, or even anyone.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.340
It's like, how do you--

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.820
which side do I go to, because
they're exact polar opposites,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.600
right?

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.520
And I think deep
down, I always wanted

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.904
to be that artist person.

00:26:27.904 --> 00:26:29.820
But you know, I did go
through the route, even

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.410
throughout college, of trying
to just be the good son.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.170
Right?

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.750
And then the Mike Judge
speech really spoke to me.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.450
I'm like, man, this dude didn't
know anything about Hollywood,

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.910
but he was able to make it.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.060
So that kind of gave me
a little extra motivation

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.880
to go pursue stand up
and whatever I loved.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.231
And yeah, five years
later-- he had no idea

00:26:50.231 --> 00:26:51.480
I was sitting in the audience.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.570
I just went into an audition
for the part and I got the part.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.547
And the first day at
table read, I told him.

00:26:56.547 --> 00:26:58.880
I was like, Mike, you were
my commencement speaker, man.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.370
Thanks.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.840
So that was a
pretty cool moment.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.814
And Mike's a very
calm, quiet guy.

00:27:04.814 --> 00:27:05.730
He's like, yeah, cool.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.224
Yeah.

00:27:07.224 --> 00:27:09.140
GRETCHEN HOWARD: He
majored in economics, too,

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.800
and he turned out all right,
so I think you're fine.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.752
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah,
yeah, you're fine.

00:27:12.752 --> 00:27:13.710
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So OK.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.340
So now you're on "Silicon
Valley" full-time.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.230
How do you reconcile,
you have your own sort

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.030
of immigrant story,
and then there's

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.610
the story of your character?

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.864
How do you think about that?

00:27:25.864 --> 00:27:27.030
How do you prepare for that?

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.821
What do you draw from
your own experiences?

00:27:28.821 --> 00:27:29.940
What do you draw from--

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.023
JIMMY O. YANG: Absolutely.

00:27:31.023 --> 00:27:32.850
I think it all came
full circle, that I'm

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.690
able to kind of use my past
story into building the Jian

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.750
Yang character, because he's
basically a version of myself

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.860
15 years ago, kind
of wandering around,

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.540
kind of can't understand a
lot of things, and in a way,

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.530
being kind of bullied by
TJ's character, Erlich.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.050
But he's not stupid.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.820
So he can kind of come back
with some just really deadpan

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.230
factual trash talk that
you don't see coming.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.480
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Do you have
a favorite comeback line?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.854
JIMMY O. YANG:
Well, I remember--

00:28:01.854 --> 00:28:03.919
so when I was younger,
when I first came here,

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:05.460
people would talk
trash to me, right?

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.020
And when you're young,
like when you're 13,

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.228
people were just like, hey,
your mom's fat, ha ha ha,

00:28:09.228 --> 00:28:09.780
or whatever.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.030
And I would be like, no,
she's a skinny Chinese woman.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.780
That's a very Jian
Yang moment, in a way.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.537
And I think one of my
favorite things in--

00:28:20.537 --> 00:28:22.870
I mean, there's so many
favorite moments with me and TJ.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.997
I just love working with him.

00:28:24.997 --> 00:28:26.580
One of my favorite
scenes, personally,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.610
is when we walk into
the mansion party,

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.869
and we try to get into
the Muir Woods project,

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:33.660
and we just constantly
keep trying to throw

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.180
each other under the bus.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.010
We did a ton of
improv there, too.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.390
One of the things was
like, when TJ was like,

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.780
can we just go in and
just take one quick lap?

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.710
He doesn't even eat.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.450
And I said, yes,
I'm very hungry.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.851
Like, stuff like that.

00:28:46.851 --> 00:28:48.600
And then there's another
take where I just

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.766
started naming off different
food that I see inside.

00:28:50.766 --> 00:28:54.150
I was like, oh, Korean
BBQ, spaghetti, meatballs.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.160
Just so much going
on in that scene.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.410
That was the first
time that me and TJ

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.270
had the whole
scene to ourselves,

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.462
and the whole
background and setting.

00:29:02.462 --> 00:29:03.420
So that was really fun.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.220
And I think that was the day
that we discovered, I was like,

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.450
oh, man, we do have something.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.710
Like, there's something
special there.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.626
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yeah.

00:29:08.626 --> 00:29:11.100
So in this season,
obviously TJ's not on.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.870
We're not quite
sure where he is.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.227
So how do you find--

00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:15.810
JIMMY O. YANG: Smoking
opium in Tibet.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.267
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:16.267 --> 00:29:17.467
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:29:17.467 --> 00:29:19.800
GRETCHEN HOWARD: How do you
find your rhythm, not having

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.127
him to go back and forth with?

00:29:21.127 --> 00:29:21.960
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.130
He's one of my best friends.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.550
I think him and Mike are my
two best friends on the show.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.210
So it was really
sad to hear him go.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.965
He called me like at
midnight one night,

00:29:28.965 --> 00:29:31.340
and he was like, I'm not coming
back for the next season.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.647
And I was like, shocked.

00:29:32.647 --> 00:29:33.480
I'm like, oh my god.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.834
So that means whatever
the last scene we did

00:29:35.834 --> 00:29:37.500
was going to be our
last scene together.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.932
So I was like,
really sad about it.

00:29:40.932 --> 00:29:42.390
But you know, I
think it turned out

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.950
to be kind of a
blessing in disguise.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.560
You know, the writers have to
think of more creative ways

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.580
to build out the
show without TJ.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.170
And also, for me,
I get to interact

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.210
with some other cool
people, and kind of

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:58.860
be a pain in the ass to other
people, which is really fun.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.360
Yeah.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.290
So I'm--

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:00.750
GRETCHEN HOWARD: You're
running the incubator--

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.290
JIMMY O. YANG: I'm excited.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:01.690
GRETCHEN HOWARD: --now, right?

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:02.773
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:02.773 --> 00:30:03.690
You know, I'm trying.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:04.920
I'm trying.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.830
We'll see how it develops.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:07.980
And yeah.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.870
I get to interact with
a lot more people,

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.410
and even, I think, one of my
favorite actors, Matt Ross,

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:14.580
who plays Gavin Belson.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:14.910
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yeah.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.993
JIMMY O. YANG: So I get
to do some stuff with him.

00:30:16.993 --> 00:30:18.575
And it will be fun.

00:30:18.575 --> 00:30:19.950
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
And another cool

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.910
project, "Crazy Rich Asians"?

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.597
JIMMY O. YANG: Yes.

00:30:23.597 --> 00:30:24.930
Are you guys familiar with that?

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.970
Have you guys read
the book or anything?

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.050
Yeah.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.750
So it was an international
best seller, a book.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.810
It's a satire of billionaires
in Singapore and that culture.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.500
And they turn it into a movie.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.410
And it's the first
studio movie in 25 years,

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.235
since "Joy Luck Club," that
features a full Asian cast.

00:30:43.235 --> 00:30:44.110
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Wow.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.933
JIMMY O. YANG: So this is
like, our "Black Panther."

00:30:46.933 --> 00:30:50.174
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:51.234 --> 00:30:52.942
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Not
the Yellow Panthers.

00:30:52.942 --> 00:30:53.090
Yeah.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.715
JIMMY O. YANG: Not
the Yellow Panthers.

00:30:54.715 --> 00:30:57.575
Well, basically the
Yellow Panthers.

00:30:57.575 --> 00:30:59.510
Yeah, so we just shot
in Singapore last year.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.980
It's coming out in August.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.520
And it's a really good movie.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.900
And the experience
of that was amazing,

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.790
because as Asians
in Hollywood, I

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.180
don't know if different
art forms-- like,

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.174
a lot of times on any set,
we're the only person on there.

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:17.840
And now there's an
added weight of like,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.362
now the scrutiny's on you to
represent Asian people, right?

00:31:20.362 --> 00:31:21.320
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Right.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.778
JIMMY O. YANG: So
and you're always

00:31:22.778 --> 00:31:25.291
looked at as the Asian
dude, no matter what.

00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:25.790
Right?

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.740
It's always Asian
dash something--

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.951
Asian leading man, Asian
asshole, Asian funny guy,

00:31:31.951 --> 00:31:32.450
or whatever.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.800
Right?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.480
But shooting this
movie was great.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.640
It was in Singapore, where the
most talented, most beautiful,

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.280
funniest Asian people
are all in one room

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.752
trying to make this movie.

00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:46.460
And the pressure is
just kind off of you.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.890
Like, you're not just the
token Asian dude on the set.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.260
You just, you can
do your job, like me

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.200
as the funny character,
Constance Wu,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.260
Henry Golding, as like the lead
character, the romantic lead.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.600
And we just kind of
handed off the baton.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:08.060
And it was the first time in
Hollywood that I felt white.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.550
And it felt great.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.481
It felt so good.

00:32:14.481 --> 00:32:16.980
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Are we OK to
open it up for some questions?

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.030
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, for sure.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.170
Let's get to some questions.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.490
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
So we actually have

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.840
a mic right there
if you guys want

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.100
to get-- we're live
streaming, so we're

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.450
going to need you guys
to talk into the mic.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.960
So if you can line
up back there.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.780
And we also have a
Dory, if you guys

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.480
want to ask anything
in the Dory as well.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.255
So just state your name,
and then the question.

00:32:33.255 --> 00:32:34.130
AUDIENCE: Hey, Jimmy.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.520
I'm Vince.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.395
Thanks for coming out,
and writing that book.

00:32:36.395 --> 00:32:38.647
It's awesome hearing that story.

00:32:38.647 --> 00:32:39.230
I was curious.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.970
I love your role in
"Silicon Valley."

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.600
And there are some
like, cringeworthy,

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.265
semi-stereotypical
Asian moments.

00:32:45.265 --> 00:32:47.390
I'm wondering how you
reconcile that with yourself,

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.530
having lived through that?

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.363
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:32:49.363 --> 00:32:54.050
I think it teeters the line of
being a stereotypical character

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.990
and then portraying an immigrant
character and humanizing it.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.740
Right?

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.790
I know a lot of, especially
American-born Asian actors,

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.200
that don't even--

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.600
they won't even audition
for a part that has

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.610
like an accent or something.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.610
And for me, I kind of
disagree with that,

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:12.280
because I was the
kid that was foreign.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.488
I was the kid with an accent.

00:33:13.488 --> 00:33:17.090
So my job is not to judge
that, but to portray them

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.550
in a humanizing, funny way,
to make them look better.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.570
I think that's more important
than shunning those people out,

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.350
because one of the most painful
things when I first came here

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.780
wasn't the fact that, say, black
people, Latino, white people

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.780
didn't accept me, because
I was the foreign kid.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.974
I expected that.

00:33:33.974 --> 00:33:35.390
But one of the
most painful things

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.750
was like, the American-born
Asian people didn't accept me,

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.750
because they didn't want to
be grouped in as like a FOB,

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.490
as like the fresh
off the boat guy.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:44.090
You know?

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.430
So I kind of feel
pretty strongly

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:51.250
about that, where I want
to make immigrants just

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.560
as appealing and just
as sexy and just as

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.792
funny as a perfectly
English speaking person.

00:33:57.792 --> 00:33:59.000
And I think that's important.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.332
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:03.677 --> 00:34:05.260
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
repping the FOBs.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.080
GRETCHEN HOWARD: We're going
to alternate, one live and one

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.850
Dory question.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:08.389
JIMMY O. YANG: OK, cool.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.630
GRETCHEN HOWARD: All right.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.963
The next question is, do you
have any thoughts on effect

00:34:10.963 --> 00:34:13.315
arts and artists,
TV included, they

00:34:13.315 --> 00:34:15.440
have on the perception of
the immigrant population?

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.250
JIMMY O. YANG:
Immigrant population.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.849
That's kind of
the same question.

00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:18.530
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Especially
modern day-- yeah.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:19.100
JIMMY O. YANG: Anything else?

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.389
What is your relationship like--

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:21.222
GRETCHEN HOWARD: TJ.

00:34:21.222 --> 00:34:23.480
JIMMY O. YANG: --with Erlich,
TJ Miller, in real life?

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.401
He's a good friend of mine.

00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:26.400
And we really got along.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.760
I think we've got the same
sense of humor and stuff.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.130
I felt pretty good about it.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.679
He said I was the first one
he called when he decided

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.170
to not do "Silicon Valley."

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.462
We hang out every now and then.

00:34:37.462 --> 00:34:39.878
He's in New York now, so we
don't get to hang out as much.

00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:41.900
But I took him to a
showing of "Patriot's Day,"

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.280
a movie I was in.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.909
And--

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:44.389
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Of the Boston--

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.680
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, about
the Boston Marathon bombing.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.931
And then after the movie, TJ
was like, standing up clapping.

00:34:49.931 --> 00:34:51.889
And then he just like
announced to the theater.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.504
He was like, guys, this is
my friend, Jimmy O. Yang.

00:34:54.504 --> 00:34:55.670
He was the kid in the movie.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.650
Please, everybody clap.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.960
So he's got a big personality.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.710
Like, he is kind of
that guy in real life.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.180
But I love him.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.170
He's awesome.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.860
Yeah.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.430
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
All right, go ahead.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.696
Thanks for coming out.

00:35:06.696 --> 00:35:07.600
JIMMY O. YANG: Hi.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.183
AUDIENCE: As someone
who has navigated

00:35:09.183 --> 00:35:11.030
that really complicated
space of kind

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:15.570
of giving up the more
guaranteed regular salaried job

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.950
to kind of pursue something that
could be a spectacular failure,

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.830
what kind of advice do
you offer, or could you

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.987
offer, to someone
trying to decide

00:35:23.987 --> 00:35:25.820
whether or not to take
a chance on something

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.140
that could not work out?

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.348
JIMMY O. YANG: Good question.

00:35:28.348 --> 00:35:33.780
I think for me, I just, I
almost couldn't live with myself

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.320
not doing what I love.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.930
I always think it's better
to try something and fail

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.772
miserably than to have
never tried at all.

00:35:42.772 --> 00:35:44.730
So if you sum it up in
that sentence, you know.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.070
And I talked to
some startup people.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.010
I think those guys
are really brave.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:52.470
And they're artists, too, right?

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.590
Because they could be working
somewhere for like $200,000,

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.250
but they decided
to take a chance.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.150
And one guy told
me, he was like,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.760
you know, all you
are missing is maybe

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.890
two years of opportunity costs.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.265
But you can always go back
to doing something safer.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.790
So yeah.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.540
You're just only losing
a couple of years.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:13.960
You're fine.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.459
Yeah.

00:36:14.459 --> 00:36:15.414
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:15.414 --> 00:36:17.830
JIMMY O. YANG: Just pretend
you're in a coma or something,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:18.746
if it didn't work out.

00:36:18.746 --> 00:36:19.951
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:21.700
GRETCHEN HOWARD: All
right, next question.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.740
Are you experiencing any
reverse culture shock now,

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.740
when you go back to--

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.710
JIMMY O. YANG: Yes.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.880
Yeah.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.338
When I go back to
Hong Kong, China.

00:36:29.338 --> 00:36:32.220
I went back to Hong Kong for
the first time in 17 years

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.080
last year, after I shot
"Crazy Rich Asians."

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.036
And that kind of--

00:36:35.036 --> 00:36:36.660
I couldn't find an
ending for the book.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.930
And that trip gave me the ending
that I needed for the book.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:40.920
It was culture shock.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.570
I'm so used to LA now.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.520
Now I'm not used to
tall buildings and stuff

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.390
like that, right?

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.890
And the people, I'm
like, oh my god,

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.330
this is so anxiety inducing.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.520
There are just
people everywhere.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.400
But there is still
a part of me that

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.410
feels like Hong
Kong is always home,

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.269
because when I went
there, there was just--

00:36:59.269 --> 00:36:59.810
I don't know.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:03.670
I felt at peace at
something, because here,

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:08.760
like we talked about, if
I'm playing ping pong or

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.060
playing the violin, or
just eating dim sum here,

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.120
I'll seem a little
stereotypical.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.930
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Do you
still play the violin?

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.804
JIMMY O. YANG: I try.

00:37:13.804 --> 00:37:15.120
I dabble.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.970
But I would be like the
stereotypical dude here, right?

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:21.720
But if I'm just, if I'm
eating dim sum in Hong Kong,

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.470
reading a Chinese newspaper,
I'm just another guy.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.790
I don't have to explain
myself, you know?

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.907
So there's some kind of
safety and a peace there.

00:37:28.907 --> 00:37:30.740
And I just, it was good
to know that there's

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.400
a part of the world
that I can always

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.290
feel that way, because
in America-- like,

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.820
I just became an American
citizen last year.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.380
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
Congratulations.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.421
JIMMY O. YANG: Thank you.

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.662
Still Asian, it's fine.

00:37:38.662 --> 00:37:39.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.360
Because like, I joke about
that, but it's true, right?

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.199
Because nobody in any part of
world-- not America, not Italy,

00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:47.490
not anywhere, not even Japan--
would be like, oh, look,

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.521
that's an American guy.

00:37:49.521 --> 00:37:50.020
No.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.230
No, no, because I don't have
blonde hair and blue eyes

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.950
or like, whatever, right?

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:53.630
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I don't either.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.860
JIMMY O. YANG: OK, but you
look way more American--

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:02.380
--than I do, even though we're
at the same level of American.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.310
So I think, hopefully, with
movies like "Crazy Rich

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.770
Asians," more seeing
Asians in media,

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.450
and seeing a more homogenized
place, like Google, like this,

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.660
people will start seeing
Asians as Americans

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.088
more and more in the future.

00:38:17.088 --> 00:38:18.107
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Great.

00:38:18.107 --> 00:38:18.940
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jimmy.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:19.860
JIMMY O. YANG: Hi.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.359
AUDIENCE: First
off, I wanted to say

00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:23.775
it was really freaky
looking over at your dad,

00:38:23.775 --> 00:38:24.442
because my dad--

00:38:24.442 --> 00:38:25.358
JIMMY O. YANG: Me too.

00:38:25.358 --> 00:38:25.970
Yeah, I agree.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.700
AUDIENCE: My dad is also
a bald Shanghaiese man.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.684
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:32.684 --> 00:38:33.668
He wears glasses.

00:38:33.668 --> 00:38:35.144
JIMMY O. YANG:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.670
AUDIENCE: Who gets up
randomly to take pictures.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.410
So it's great--

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.201
JIMMY O. YANG: Yes!

00:38:40.201 --> 00:38:42.470
AUDIENCE: --to see him here.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:43.932
Thank you.

00:38:43.932 --> 00:38:44.530
And my other--

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.196
JIMMY O. YANG: Does
he also have a photo

00:38:46.196 --> 00:38:47.960
shoot whenever he goes
to lunch or dinner?

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.300
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.133
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:38:49.133 --> 00:38:50.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.450
And my question is
about how you prepared

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.630
for your role of Jian Yang.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.760
JIMMY O. YANG: Mm-hmm.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.218
AUDIENCE: I think
some people could

00:38:57.218 --> 00:39:00.350
say that you've been preparing
for this role your whole life,

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.710
being Chinese,
being an immigrant.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:07.310
But did you do any
specific immersive research

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:11.090
in this area, for example,
going to Stanford classes

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.420
or immersing yourself
in a hacker hostel?

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.360
And if not, how did you
best prepare and develop

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.384
the idiosyncrasies of this area?

00:39:19.384 --> 00:39:20.300
JIMMY O. YANG: Thanks.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.020
So this past
off-season, I actually

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.870
made HBO give me like
a tour of everything.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:30.020
So I talked-- we have a lot of
great consultants on the show

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.700
that, you know--

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.070
Dick Costollo's one of them.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:32.570
So--

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.115
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Used to be
a PM here, CEO of Twitter.

00:39:35.115 --> 00:39:35.948
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:39:35.948 --> 00:39:40.280
And then I visited
Google this past summer.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.260
And I visited Facebook and more
mid-sized companies, like Lyft,

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:45.860
and--

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.960
which CapitalG invested in--

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.920
and a few places,
and I learned a lot.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.469
And studying the characters
there, it's really cool.

00:39:55.469 --> 00:39:57.260
And also, just for Jian
Yang the character,

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.350
the immigrant character itself,
whenever I drive to the lot,

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.620
I listen to Chinese radio for
like an hour when I'm driving.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:08.900
You know, 1300 AM, the Mandarin
station in LA, that's my jam.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.720
So it gets me kind of in
that Mandarin mindset.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.660
And

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.700
I also, whenever I--

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.780
before I do a scene, I always
kind of say this mantra

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.890
to myself in Mandarin.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:26.320
I say [MANDARIN],, which
means, I don't know,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.230
in Mandarin, which I
think it helps me think

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.640
in Mandarin, first of all.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.575
But also in a way,
it kind of sums up

00:40:34.575 --> 00:40:38.070
who Jian Yang is as a person.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.070
Either he actually doesn't
know about something,

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.770
or he doesn't even
care to know about it.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:43.340
So yeah.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.597
That would be, I guess,
my preparation for it.

00:40:45.597 --> 00:40:46.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:47.487
JIMMY O. YANG: Thanks.

00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:48.320
GRETCHEN HOWARD: OK.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.861
You've mentioned
before that stand up

00:40:49.861 --> 00:40:51.440
isn't really a
thing in Hong Kong.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.817
Do you have any plans to
try doing stand up there,

00:40:53.817 --> 00:40:55.025
and are you funny in Chinese?

00:40:59.007 --> 00:40:59.840
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.450
Stand up is becoming a
thing in Hong Kong now.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.600
There's a club that opened
up called Takeout Comedy.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.510
That's the actual name of
the stand up comedy club.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.810
So I would want to go
try some stand up out

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.060
in Hong Kong, maybe even
in Mandarin or Cantonese

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:14.900
or something.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.570
But it is not as easy as
just literally translating

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.667
my English jokes into
a different language.

00:41:20.667 --> 00:41:21.500
It's more than that.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.786
It's cultural differences.

00:41:22.786 --> 00:41:24.410
They wouldn't understand
a lot of stuff

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.970
that we talk about here.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.740
So it would be kind
of a challenge.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.367
But maybe in the future,
I'll be down to explore that.

00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:32.450
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Does your
dad think you're funny?

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.256
JIMMY O. YANG: Do
you think I'm funny?

00:41:34.256 --> 00:41:36.871
AUDIENCE: Yeah, he's getting
funnier and funnier day by day.

00:41:36.871 --> 00:41:38.870
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Funnier
and funnier day by day.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.411
JIMMY O. YANG: Still
keeps me humble.

00:41:40.411 --> 00:41:41.847
But you know--

00:41:41.847 --> 00:41:42.680
GRETCHEN HOWARD: OK.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.420
Go ahead.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.260
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for coming today.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.551
I know you talked a little
bit about your story getting

00:41:48.551 --> 00:41:50.210
into Hollywood in
America, but is there

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.810
any kind of specific occurrences
that you felt really down,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.360
or you got a lot of pushback,
like racially, or just not

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.590
fitting into the role?

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.380
And do you still face
that, moving forward today?

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.796
JIMMY O. YANG:
Yeah, when I didn't

00:42:01.796 --> 00:42:04.630
get the loud Japanese host
part, I was, you know--

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.580
I think one of the sadder
things is like a part perfectly

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.950
describes you, and you
still don't get it.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:14.807
It's like, short Asian, Chinese
with glasses and long hair.

00:42:14.807 --> 00:42:17.390
And you go and you audition, and
you still don't get the part.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.473
You're like, wow, I'm bad.

00:42:18.473 --> 00:42:20.765
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:20.765 --> 00:42:22.724
Like, the open ethnicity
part, I get it.

00:42:22.724 --> 00:42:23.890
They have plenty of options.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:24.340
But you know what?

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.270
At the end of the
day, I've never

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.490
tried to blame it on
the fact that I'm Asian,

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:30.064
even though that might be true,
even though people could be

00:42:30.064 --> 00:42:32.230
racist or they are actually
looking for a white guy,

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.960
but they have to audition
an Asian guy or something.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.900
But it doesn't
give me benefit me

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.560
at all, if I try to blame
that on me being Asian.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.810
So I just try to be
better the next audition.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.050
If I'm not funny on stage,
I try to write better jokes

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.820
and come back the
next day and not

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.460
use being Asian as a crutch,
even though it might be true

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:51.970
sometimes.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:53.020
Right?

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:53.860
So yeah.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.897
That's how I look at it.

00:42:55.897 --> 00:42:56.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.646
JIMMY O. YANG: Thanks.

00:42:57.646 --> 00:42:58.510
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jimmy.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.246
I'm actually a really
huge fan of yours.

00:43:01.246 --> 00:43:02.620
Other than "Silicon
Valley," I've

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.420
actually gone through
all of the videos

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.157
I can find of yours on YouTube.

00:43:06.157 --> 00:43:07.490
JIMMY O. YANG: Wow, thanks, man.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.290
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:08.789
Yeah.

00:43:08.789 --> 00:43:10.337
I even checked your
YouTube comments.

00:43:10.337 --> 00:43:11.170
It's kind of creepy.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:12.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:12.942 --> 00:43:15.150
GRETCHEN HOWARD: We'll keep
him a safe distance away.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:16.650
JIMMY O. YANG: Good guy.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.460
AUDIENCE: So I am super
excited to be here.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:22.030
My question would be,
further in the future,

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.550
would you more look
into continue your path

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:28.360
as a comedian or
doing both a comedian

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.474
and being an actor
in the show business?

00:43:31.474 --> 00:43:33.890
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, I think
both, and more writing, also,

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.725
and creating my own
IP because still,

00:43:36.725 --> 00:43:39.100
there's not a lot of material
out there for Asians to do.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.766
You have to come up
with your own stuff.

00:43:40.766 --> 00:43:43.510
So hopefully, one of my goals
is turning this into a TV show--

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.520
maybe like a version
of "Atlanta,"

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.500
but our version of it, right?

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.980
And that will probably reach
a more mainstream audience,

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.665
because stand up still doesn't
translate to a lot of Asians,

00:43:53.665 --> 00:43:55.210
especially.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.159
Like, I never grew
up listening to--

00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:58.450
like, knowing what stand up is.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.489
My dad didn't know what
really stand up was.

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:02.530
So I think turning it into
a TV show or something

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.302
would reach like a broader,
more mainstream audience.

00:44:05.302 --> 00:44:07.510
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Didn't he
think you did a talk show?

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.593
JIMMY O. YANG: Talk show--

00:44:08.593 --> 00:44:10.330
my dad still calls
it a talk show.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:11.890
I'm like, I'm going to
the Laugh Factory tonight.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:12.556
He's like, what?

00:44:12.556 --> 00:44:15.490
To do talk show?

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.484
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:16.484 --> 00:44:17.400
Sorry, one more thing.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.930
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah,
sure, go ahead.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.360
AUDIENCE: I also have a
question about the problems

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:27.210
you mentioned, about Asian being
minority in the show business.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.630
As you gain more popularity
and influence to your audience,

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:33.330
is there something you
want to do more about that,

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.950
like maybe like
what kind of actions

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.800
you would take to
change that, kind

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.660
of putting a great actor into
a sort of a stereotypical role

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.667
in a TV show?

00:44:43.667 --> 00:44:44.500
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.930
I think what I can do is
just creating my own material

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.090
and putting myself in it,
and giving myself jobs

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.340
that maybe other people
would have given to Scarlett

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.660
Johansson or Matt Damon.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.660
You know what I mean?

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.920
So I think it's really
important to create and do

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.520
what you do best, right?

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.172
Whereas it's right,
do stand up, act.

00:45:04.172 --> 00:45:05.630
So I always just
try to concentrate

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:06.740
on being the best I can.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.700
When there is an
opportunity, I can nail it,

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.491
because there is a lot
of groups out there,

00:45:10.491 --> 00:45:15.570
like NAACP, CAPE, that's for
the Asian advancements and stuff

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.170
like that.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:20.769
And they're doing a lot of
ground work in representation

00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:22.560
and making sure the
right article comes out

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.164
and there's no racist
commercials or anything,

00:45:25.164 --> 00:45:25.830
you know, right?

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:26.824
Or whatever, right?

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:27.990
So they are doing their job.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.850
But that's not
necessarily my job, right?

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.850
My job is to really
nail the opportunities

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.440
that they create for us.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.380
And really, when I go into an
audition room, not just being

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.510
the best Asian actor, but being
the best actor in that room

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:41.469
so I can get that role.

00:45:41.469 --> 00:45:43.385
GRETCHEN HOWARD: It is
kind of amazing though.

00:45:43.385 --> 00:45:45.450
You've gone, in just a
span of a couple of years,

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:49.470
from literally sleeping on the
couch, paying $300 in rent,

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.930
scraping it together,
driving Uber,

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:57.290
to now having the weight
of representing all Asians,

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:00.300
and what that means
on TV and in film.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.791
And do you do parts
of the accent or not?

00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:04.290
And how do you
create opportunities?

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.090
Like, how do you just
deal with that pressure?

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.320
JIMMY O. YANG: You try
to not think about it.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:07.770
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yeah.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:08.395
So that's why--

00:46:08.395 --> 00:46:10.950
JIMMY O. YANG: And then you
have a panic attack at 2:00 AM.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:11.977
No.

00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:13.060
I'm just enjoying it, man.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.393
Like, this is really fun to
see all of you guys show up.

00:46:15.393 --> 00:46:17.640
Like, I never imagined this
would happen, you know?

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.070
Or I would imagine this
happening in the future.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.130
But it's just great.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.320
I'm just trying to
enjoy the moment.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.310
Like, it's getting
a little busy,

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.810
but still, I never try to put
the weight of representing

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.850
Asians on my back, because
that doesn't make me better

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.230
at my job.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.854
So I just try to entertain.

00:46:33.854 --> 00:46:35.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:35.190
JIMMY O. YANG: Thank you.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.090
AUDIENCE: So great
to see you in person.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:38.131
JIMMY O. YANG: Thank you.

00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:39.040
Love this guy.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.510
GRETCHEN HOWARD: You
have to sign his book.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.870
JIMMY O. YANG: I love--

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:40.620
of course.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.250
Of course.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.822
I love this guy.

00:46:42.822 --> 00:46:43.710
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jimmy.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.291
So I think your story really
resonates with me because I

00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:47.540
dropped out of medical school.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.890
And for like two years, my
mom was like, you know what?

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.940
You're never going to get
a girl to want to marry you

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:52.898
if you're not a doctor.

00:46:52.898 --> 00:46:53.447
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:53.447 --> 00:46:54.780
I was like, under lot of stress.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.760
JIMMY O. YANG: Are
you married now?

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.968
AUDIENCE: No, no, no, no, no.

00:46:56.968 --> 00:46:58.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.740
So maybe she's right.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.280
Maybe she's right.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.860
So I've got two questions.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.819
The first question
is, if you never

00:47:05.819 --> 00:47:07.360
got the big break
on "Silicon Valley"

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.005
and you ended up being
a miserable failure,

00:47:10.005 --> 00:47:12.630
like you said, what do you think
you would have ended up doing?

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.492
And my second question is,
so do you have groupies now,

00:47:15.492 --> 00:47:17.200
now that you're like,
an Asian celebrity?

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.140
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Well, I'd say.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.396
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah,
the last guy, I guess.

00:47:19.396 --> 00:47:19.895
Yeah.

00:47:19.895 --> 00:47:22.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:26.520
If I didn't get
"Silicon Valley,"

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.930
I think I would still be working
hard to try to get something,

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:32.430
right?

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.784
And I always try to
put like-- you know,

00:47:34.784 --> 00:47:36.660
have different things
in the pipeline.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.260
Like, if maybe I never
became a really good actor,

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.780
I would have just tried
to concentrate on stand up

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.120
or concentrate on writing
or something like that.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.430
But I don't see
there's a world where

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.910
I would have went back to Smith
Barney or anything like that.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:54.900
I think people have
a misconception

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.650
of like, Hollywood or the arts.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.921
It's luck or it's nepotism
or something magical

00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:04.670
needs to happen for
you to make it happen.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.950
But at the end of the day,
if you work hard enough

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:09.730
and if you're good
enough, it's going

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.414
to happen, one way
or another, right?

00:48:12.414 --> 00:48:13.830
Especially in the
stand up world--

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.190
if you just get good enough, at
least you can do some colleges.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:17.814
At least you can make
ends meet, right?

00:48:17.814 --> 00:48:20.550
You might not be the
next Dave Chappelle.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:22.510
But you can make it a job.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.450
So I think that's
where the disconnect is

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.690
with maybe the older generation,
and also how a lot of people

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.050
think of the arts.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:29.900
Yeah.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.020
Groupies, I don't know.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.040
I still use Bumble sometimes.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.927
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:36.927 --> 00:48:37.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jimmy.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.900
My name is Zang.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.910
And the other part
of your story really

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:44.070
resonated with me,
the immigrant part.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.610
So as an immigrant
myself who's been living

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.180
in the US for
almost two decades,

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.750
one question really
trips me up a lot.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.840
And it's, where are you from?

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.520
So Jimmy--

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.353
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:48:56.353 --> 00:48:57.590
AUDIENCE: Where are you from?

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:58.040
Like--

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.581
JIMMY O. YANG: It depends who
is asking that question, right?

00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:04.730
If it's an Uber driver that I
don't really want to talk to,

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.630
I'll just say LA, and
that's the end of that.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:08.630
And a lot of people like
to ask you, no, no, no,

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.550
where are you originally from?

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.069
And people take offense to that.

00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.610
And I get it.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.977
Like, I wish we don't
live in a world like that.

00:49:14.977 --> 00:49:16.310
But I'm proud of where I'm from.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.410
Like, I'll tell people
I grew up in Hong Kong

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.820
and that I came here.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.909
So if they want to hear
the long story of that,

00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:22.700
I sell them a book.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:23.090
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Tell
them to buy the book.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:23.560
Yeah.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.560
JIMMY O. YANG: You know?

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.484
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:25.484 --> 00:49:27.650
GRETCHEN HOWARD: You, too,
can buy it on Google Play

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:28.930
or at a bookstore
near you, right?

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.138
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, exactly.

00:49:30.138 --> 00:49:30.900
Anywhere you want.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.055
Yeah.

00:49:32.055 --> 00:49:32.680
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.180
Thank you.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.757
JIMMY O. YANG: Thanks, man.

00:49:34.757 --> 00:49:35.590
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jimmy.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:36.930
JIMMY O. YANG: Hi.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.730
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you're still

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.520
keeping in touch with your high
school friends, the misfits

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.880
and other folks who knew
you before "Silicon Valley,"

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.450
and what are they up to now?

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:47.190
And do they think you're funny?

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.460
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.060
You know what?

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.700
They're still some of
my best friends, man.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:54.690
My buddy Jeremy, Persian guy,
he's in construction now.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.000
And but he wants to be a writer.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.890
So we're actually writing
something together

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.780
because he knows my
life as well as I do.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.280
Yeah.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.950
And you know, my friend
who lives in Irvine now,

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.500
he came out to support
one of my book signings.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.210
And it was really
sweet to see that.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.920
And yeah, they still live
pretty close to me, and still

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.920
some of my best friends.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.630
And it's good to have people
like that to keep you honest,

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:16.640
I think.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.600
Like, they'll check me.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.850
They're like, Jimmy, you're
acting too Hollywood, man.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:20.497
You know?

00:50:20.497 --> 00:50:22.080
Why you going out
to buy a gold chain?

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.850
What's wrong with you?

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:28.480
So I stopped at one gold chain.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.390
Thanks.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:31.284
AUDIENCE: Hey, Jimmy.

00:50:31.284 --> 00:50:31.950
My name is Tony.

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:33.180
I'm a big fan of the show.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.910
I'm excited to
check out this book.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.430
Also being the child of
like, immigrant parents,

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.790
I'm curious to see how the
conversations or process went

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:46.470
with you talking to your parents
about wanting to leave Smith

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:49.600
Barney, disappointing
your parents, you said,

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.640
for a couple of years.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.680
Like, what was that like,
talking to your dad?

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.114
And how did that all go?

00:50:54.114 --> 00:50:55.530
JIMMY O. YANG:
It's hard, I think.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:59.640
Also, in an Asian family,
we're not as open, in a way,

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.905
like with a Western family.

00:51:00.905 --> 00:51:03.030
Like, in an Asian family,
we don't necessarily say,

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.860
I love you, or I'm proud
of you, things like that,

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.870
on the surface.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.890
Whereas it's a very casual
thing for my American friends

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.140
to say, oh, I love you, I
love you, I love you, right?

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:12.510
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I love you.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:13.801
JIMMY O. YANG: So-- oh, thanks.

00:51:13.801 --> 00:51:15.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.750
So you know, it's hard, man.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.610
I sought some therapy.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:24.360
And you know, you have to kind
of just like kind of step up.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.880
You don't want it
to be like a thing

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.490
where you don't end up
talking to somebody, right?

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.180
So it's like an
ongoing conversation.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.340
I think me and my dad now have a
good communication, where like,

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.610
we talk all the time,
even about stuff that--

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.560
I make him talk about
stuff he doesn't

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.852
want to talk about sometimes,
like stuff from the book.

00:51:43.852 --> 00:51:45.560
And he read the book
and stuff like that.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.050
So sometimes it's up
to us to maybe force

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.225
that conversation on them.

00:51:50.225 --> 00:51:50.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.070
Was there a point that you felt
you had to kind of like, earn

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.160
his acceptance at all?

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.326
Or was it-- was he kind of--

00:51:55.326 --> 00:51:57.456
JIMMY O. YANG: I'm past that.

00:51:57.456 --> 00:52:00.660
I'm past that now, I think.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.217
Yeah.

00:52:01.217 --> 00:52:03.300
GRETCHEN HOWARD: You got
him to try acting, right?

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.091
JIMMY O. YANG: Yes.

00:52:04.091 --> 00:52:05.160
He's an actor.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.380
He played my dad
in "Patriot's Day."

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.660
He's a pretty good actor.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.000
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.499
Thank you.

00:52:09.499 --> 00:52:11.047
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, thanks.

00:52:11.047 --> 00:52:11.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jimmy.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.592
I'm Huang.

00:52:12.592 --> 00:52:15.890
And my question is actually kind
of similar to that last one.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.220
But having Asian
parents means that there

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.410
are a lot of expectations.

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.701
They expect you to go to a
good school, get a good job,

00:52:21.701 --> 00:52:24.295
and then get married after
school and have kids before 30.

00:52:24.295 --> 00:52:25.170
JIMMY O. YANG: Right.

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:26.900
AUDIENCE: Has your
parents' expectation

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.490
changed as your career grow?

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:33.733
And how do you deal with
those expectations, I guess?

00:52:33.733 --> 00:52:34.524
JIMMY O. YANG: Huh.

00:52:34.524 --> 00:52:36.150
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I think
there's a lot of people feeling

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:37.233
similar pressures in the--

00:52:37.233 --> 00:52:38.190
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.360
Has your expectation
changed, Dad?

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.014
Do you want me to
have kids, like, soon?

00:52:44.014 --> 00:52:47.423
AUDIENCE: I would like you
to apply for a job in Google.

00:52:47.423 --> 00:52:50.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.445
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Anyone want
to hire Jimmy at Google?

00:52:54.445 --> 00:52:58.080
JIMMY O. YANG: So
there you have it.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.730
Yeah.

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:01.710
I mean, maybe there is, I think.

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:02.340
I don't know.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.560
But I try and not
let it get to me.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.380
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.187
JIMMY O. YANG: Thanks.

00:53:08.187 --> 00:53:09.020
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jimmy.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:09.750
I'm Xiang Li.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.960
Thanks for sharing
the stories today.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.740
So my question is, now you've
gained lots of popularity

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.730
and fame, but at
what point do you

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:26.120
think that you think you are
actually going to be famous

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.320
someday from TV show?

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:32.250
And at what point do you
start to actually believe

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:36.409
that you're going to be--

00:53:36.409 --> 00:53:37.950
you know what you're
doing and you're

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.100
going to be good in
acting and stand up?

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.130
JIMMY O. YANG: I think being
an actor and being a stand up,

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:45.630
you're always kind of insecure.

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:48.740
And it's not like an absolute,
like, oh, now I'm a good actor.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.820
I think I'm very
confident in my abilities

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.607
now, ever since a few
seasons of "Silicon Valley"

00:53:53.607 --> 00:53:54.690
and other stuff I've done.

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:58.860
But it's-- you always try to
just get better, you know?

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.770
And not suck.

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:03.362
So I don't know.

00:54:03.362 --> 00:54:05.820
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Was the process
of doing TV versus a movie

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.750
different for you?

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.030
JIMMY O. YANG: Not too much,
because "Silicon Valley"

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:10.020
is a single camera, so
it shoots like a movie.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.006
So I think that gave
us a lot of practice.

00:54:12.006 --> 00:54:13.380
And you know,
"Silicon Valley" is

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.210
like going to school for me,
the acting school I never had.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:17.730
So that was awesome.

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:20.070
So maybe one day I'll sell out.

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:20.710
I don't know.

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:23.570
We'll see, as the
rappers would say.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:26.880
AUDIENCE: Were there nights
when you cry in the evenings

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.129
because you think
that it's difficult?

00:54:30.129 --> 00:54:31.670
JIMMY O. YANG: I
cry in the evenings?

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:32.093
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Do you cry?

00:54:32.093 --> 00:54:33.285
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:33.285 --> 00:54:34.774
JIMMY O. YANG: I
didn't know that.

00:54:34.774 --> 00:54:35.940
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Do you cry?

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.606
It's a question.

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:37.200
Do you cry?

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.360
Have you ever cried from
the pressure or the fear

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.980
of not making it?

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:44.820
JIMMY O. YANG: No,
I don't think so.

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.580
It wasn't the fear-- like,
I get anxiety from it,

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.110
but it's never like, crying.

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:51.870
Like, sometimes I
cry tears of joy

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:55.010
when I realize how blessed I am.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.760
That's when I cry.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.690
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.049
JIMMY O. YANG: Thanks.

00:54:59.049 --> 00:54:59.590
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.180
OK.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:09.410
My question is, actually, I
like Jian Yang, this role,

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:10.040
very much.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.300
But I think it's very
different with other guys

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.760
I met in Silicon Valley.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.720
I think, like me, I'm an
Asian guy and software

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.400
engineer in Silicon Valley.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.030
But I think most Asian
guys I met are very smart

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:27.500
and they did get things done.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.910
But Jian Yang is totally
different with that.

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:32.896
JIMMY O. YANG: As
to say he's stupid.

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:34.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:35.770
Do you know that?

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.710
Or I know the role is
not decided by you.

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:41.860
It's by a director
or some other guys.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:44.840
But I mean, do you know
what's the true software

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.525
engineer in Silicon Valley,
the Asian software engineer?

00:55:48.525 --> 00:55:50.150
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I
think she's inviting

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:52.396
you to do a Google engineering
immersion [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:52.396 --> 00:55:53.229
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:55:53.229 --> 00:55:56.596
These Chinese folks asks me
the tough questions, right?

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:05.427
I mean, you've got to still
play the comedy of it, right?

00:56:05.427 --> 00:56:07.760
Like, if it's just a dude
sitting in front of a computer

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:12.580
making really awesome apps
and really successful,

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:13.970
making hundreds, it's not funny.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.949
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:15.949 --> 00:56:16.490
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:20.180
JIMMY O. YANG: So it's, I think,
funny to make it a satire of he

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:23.900
has some of the mannerisms
of the Silicon Valley people,

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.770
but he still kind
of has the balls.

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:29.150
And he kind of steps up,
and he's kind of an asshole.

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:32.990
And you know, he's kind of an
opportunist in a way, you know?

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:35.840
I think Jian Yang
can code pretty well.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.387
The Not Hotdog app,
he just made it.

00:56:38.387 --> 00:56:39.818
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:39.818 --> 00:56:41.569
You know?

00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:42.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:42.680
Thank you.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.722
JIMMY O. YANG: Thank you.

00:56:43.722 --> 00:56:45.846
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Maybe time
for two more questions.

00:56:45.846 --> 00:56:46.680
JIMMY O. YANG: Cool.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.262
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming, Jimmy.

00:56:48.262 --> 00:56:48.980
My name is Vicky.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.900
I'm an ABC,
American-born Chinese.

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.940
My parents are from Taipei.

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.600
I grew up exactly kind
of the similar path

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.620
that you may have been.

00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:02.150
And until I got into Google, my
mom was disappointed with me.

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:04.520
JIMMY O. YANG: What
did you do before that?

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:08.194
AUDIENCE: Well, I actually went
through the recruiting program,

00:57:08.194 --> 00:57:09.110
university recruiting.

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:11.734
So I actually went to UCSD and
went through the career center,

00:57:11.734 --> 00:57:13.400
and actually applied
to work in AdWords.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.816
JIMMY O. YANG: I never stepped
foot in that career center.

00:57:15.816 --> 00:57:18.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.460
AUDIENCE: So it was my
first job out of college.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.970
It was the only
job I applied for.

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:24.430
And I was like, I
hope this works out.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:26.513
And my mom was like, you
better hope it works out.

00:57:26.513 --> 00:57:29.530
So now to this day, even
my grandparents are like,

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:30.590
don't leave Google.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:32.030
Whatever you do, don't leave.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.821
And I don't think they
even know what I do.

00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:35.560
So it's like, there
is an expectation.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:39.580
I totally understand what a
lot of us are going through.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.560
The question I had for
you was around children,

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.990
your future children.

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.120
I have a child now.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.300
And I grew up going
to Chinese school,

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:53.080
doing all the traditional
Chinese things we do.

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.610
I find it challenging
to figure out

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.890
how to raise my
child in America,

00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:00.700
and also instilling the
basic cultural traditions

00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.362
I grew up with.

00:58:02.362 --> 00:58:04.570
And I feel like there's some
responsibility on my end

00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.200
to do that.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.330
So my question to
you would be, imagine

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:10.924
yourself being your dad one
day, having your own children.

00:58:10.924 --> 00:58:12.340
How would you go
about making sure

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.050
that your own
children don't lose

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.335
their own cultural identity,
given that they're not

00:58:17.335 --> 00:58:18.460
from Hong Kong or Shanghai?

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.470
JIMMY O. YANG: Do
you speak Mandarin?

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.770
Or--

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:20.110
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:20.850
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:21.766
JIMMY O. YANG: Oh, OK.

00:58:21.766 --> 00:58:23.680
So do you speak to
your kids in Mandarin?

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.140
AUDIENCE: So she's only
one, like 14 months.

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.260
JIMMY O. YANG: Well, I
mean, will you, you think?

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:27.885
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:27.885 --> 00:58:30.670
No, I'm planning on sending
her to Chinese school--

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:30.950
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, I think--

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:31.600
AUDIENCE: --which is
what I am used to.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.500
JIMMY O. YANG:
--that's very cool,

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.030
because your kid's
going to learn--

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.196
this is what my dad told me.

00:58:35.196 --> 00:58:37.430
Like, your kid's going to
learn English in school.

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:39.370
You might as well speak
to him in Mandarin.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.470
Like, I see some of
my relatives, like,

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:44.560
they insist on speaking
maybe English to the kid,

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.640
so the kid doesn't--

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.610
aren't going to be
foreign like they were.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:50.834
But that-- the kid
grew up in America.

00:58:50.834 --> 00:58:52.000
He's going to speak English.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.771
So I think the language
itself is very important.

00:58:54.771 --> 00:58:56.770
I think everyone's trying
to learn Mandarin now.

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:57.680
GRETCHEN HOWARD: BET still--

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.721
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah, BET.

00:58:58.721 --> 00:58:59.854
Show him some BET.

00:58:59.854 --> 00:59:01.240
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.330
JIMMY O. YANG: So I think, look.

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:08.540
Like, even people, actors and
people in media, we're trying.

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.577
So hopefully, as he
or she-- he or she?

00:59:11.577 --> 00:59:12.160
AUDIENCE: She.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.618
JIMMY O. YANG: As
she's growing up,

00:59:13.618 --> 00:59:16.940
there will be more material
out there of a positive, cool

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:18.870
Asian representation.

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.365
Read her this book.

00:59:20.365 --> 00:59:21.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.010
I mean, we only have
[MANDARIN] right now.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.830
But I'm sure there's more
opportunities and things

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.210
for her to learn from.

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:29.120
But yeah, I agree.

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.660
I think language is
part of it, but also

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.590
the traditional sense--

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:35.530
I don't know if you
plan on celebrating

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:38.060
certain holidays with your
future children, and--

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:38.620
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah,
I would love to.

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:38.980
AUDIENCE: --teaching.

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:39.480
OK.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.360
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:44.770
But I'm not one to
give parenting advice.

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:45.520
Thank you, though.

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:45.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:46.660
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
You and your dad

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.420
could write children's
books though.

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:48.840
That could be a cool thing.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.048
JIMMY O. YANG: No, let's not.

00:59:50.048 --> 00:59:51.510
Let's not do that.

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:54.000
Let's not do that.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.870
GRETCHEN HOWARD: All
right, last question.

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:57.580
AUDIENCE: I feel so
incredibly grateful.

00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:59.122
I'm the last one,
so like, I made it.

00:59:59.122 --> 01:00:00.579
JIMMY O. YANG: This
better be good.

01:00:00.579 --> 01:00:01.274
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:01.274 --> 01:00:02.440
It's going to be a long one.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.600
First of all, hi, Dad.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.090
I mean, I didn't get the hot
dog signature on the book,

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:08.284
but that's not a complaint.

01:00:08.284 --> 01:00:09.700
JIMMY O. YANG:
There was only one.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.180
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:10.680
Yeah.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.210
Kudos to your comments on
the "Crazy Rich Asians" being

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.190
the "Black Panther" for Asians.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:18.210
I really, I feel
strong about that too.

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:19.600
This is about
thought leadership.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.070
So I'm also 1.5 generation Asian
Canadian, and went to Canada

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:24.791
when I was 14.

01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:26.290
My voice might be
shaking right now.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.340
Sorry guys-- too excited.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.650
JIMMY O. YANG: You're good.

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:31.150
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
You're doing great.

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:32.608
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
thought leadership.

01:00:32.608 --> 01:00:35.380
I also really liked how you were
saying the difference between

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.560
Asian-born Amer--

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.610
I mean, ABCs here and
the 1.5 generations.

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:42.750
I see there's a change
of like, ABC tolerating

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:46.840
1.5 generation more, as Asian is
rising, specifically in China,

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.820
after 2005.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.080
There's still more to be done.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.160
And the thought
leadership part is,

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.710
I don't want to divide
anyone with all these labels.

01:00:56.710 --> 01:01:00.500
Like, also, diversity is like
a talk in Google, globally.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.640
But like, how do you
just tell people like,

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.740
we're just the same,
and we're all immigrant,

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.007
and you should be proud
of who you are without--

01:01:08.007 --> 01:01:08.840
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.660
AUDIENCE: Like, if they
haven't been to your shoes.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:10.810
JIMMY O. YANG: Yeah.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.820
I think it's hard
to tell people that.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.710
I think even if
you turn on a TV,

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.750
like something like
the immigration issue

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:17.500
is so politicized.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.791
There's two sides, and they're
just two people arguing,

01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.670
and they never get
anywhere, right?

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:25.130
And that's why I kind of wanted
to write a book like this,

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:26.950
where it's just me
telling my story,

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:30.310
and hopefully it humanizes the
immigrant experience, right?

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:33.820
And so maybe people can see
it from my point of view,

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.520
in a kind of humorous,
lighthearted way,

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.860
and really understand what it
was like to be an immigrant.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.360
It's not always sob
stories, like, oh, whatever.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.950
But in a real way, as if
this is a real person.

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:50.110
So I think that's
important to me.

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:52.000
And it's hard to
convince people.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.800
But sometimes it's easier.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.900
It's like pitching jokes
to the writers' room.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.810
You don't want to
tell them, hey,

01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.880
this is the joke I want to do.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.620
But you want to kind
of make them think

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.570
they came up with that idea.

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:02.075
Right?

01:02:02.075 --> 01:02:05.550
You should do that
with your bosses.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:07.540
You should make them
think it's their idea.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.060
And how do you do that
is maybe by telling them

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.000
a story through
different mediums--

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.960
stand up, books, or just in
person, telling them a story.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.100
So I think-- and
just showing them

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.490
who you are, letting them
know you as an immigrant.

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:27.350
And I think that does more
work than arguing with someone

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:29.264
and shoving a point
down their throat.

01:02:29.264 --> 01:02:30.680
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
I think we're all

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.160
very lucky that we get to
hear your story, in writing--

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:33.400
JIMMY O. YANG: Thanks, guys.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.066
GRETCHEN HOWARD: --TV,
and in the movie.

01:02:35.066 --> 01:02:38.250
[APPLAUSE]
