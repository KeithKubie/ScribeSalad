00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.800
A team of researchers have developed an incredible
new technology that allows them to reprogram

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.300
skin cells into any cell an ailing body needs,
with a single touch.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.510
The technology is called Tissue Nanotransfection
(TNT).

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.430
It involves using nanochip technology that
could generate any kind of cell within a patient’s

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
own body.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.000
The new cells could repair injured tissue
or restore function of aging tissue, organs,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.070
blood vessels and even nerve cells.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.630
Here’s how it works a nanotechnology-based
chip about the size of a postage stamp is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.239
placed on the skin and stimulated by an electrical
current.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.049
In less than a second the chip creates nanometer-scale
entry pathways into tissue cells.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:41.940
Or, basically, provide a way to access skin
cells -- like an opening.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.800
These openings can be used to deliver a cocktail
of reprogramming factors.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.010
This “cocktail” is a combination of genes
that reprogram the cell’s DNA.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.079
Reprogramming the cell basically turns a skin
cell into an induced pluripotent stem cell.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.769
As you probably know stems cells can then
be reprogrammed into any cell the body needs.And

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.920
it does all this without hurting the patient,
or having to take the cells out of the body.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.869
Which is how we currently do stem cell therapy.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.939
This technology allows any cell to turn into
a stem cell provided, of course, it’s a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.310
dividing cell.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.140
Skin cells naturally replenish so are a perfect
“fertile land” where the elements of any

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.670
new organ can be grown.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.740
In this study, the team was able to reprogram
skin cells to become vascular cells in a mouse’s

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.649
leg that was in need of better blood flow.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.039
In two weeks, the leg was saved.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.009
Skin cells reprogrammed into nerve cells were
also able to repair the brains of mice recovering

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.140
from strokes!

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.369
This technology is still in the research phase.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.170
So far it’s only been tested on mice, but
the team hopes to begin clinical trials soon.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.979
The implications of cell reprogramming are
huge.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.390
Something as simple and easy as this method
could change stem cell therapy forever.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.159
Doctors could just, recruit your own cells
to fix a problem… and it’s not like you’re

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.179
short on cells… why not put them to good
use?

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.229
Nanotechnology is super cool.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.710
Maybe you think so too?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.440
You could buy nano.news or nano.expert from
Domain dot com!

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.310
When you buy a domain name from Domain Dot
Com, you’re taking the first steps in creating

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.649
an identity and vision for your brand.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.069

So speaking of the risk of rejection with
new organs, ever wonder why exactly that happens?

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.040
Well, we’ve got the answer right here.
