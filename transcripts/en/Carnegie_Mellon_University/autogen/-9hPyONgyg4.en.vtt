by combining this data you can end up
with something which is more than the

social security numbers and this is an

social security numbers and this is an
 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.910

important lesson because it shows how

because information regulation is
 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.340
because information regulation is
ubiquitous and is silent it happens

that this information dissemination is
going on and this creates lots of

act in a efficient optimal way and

act in a efficient optimal way and
decide what should we protect the show

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200
decide what should we protect the show
 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.030
decide what should we protect the show
and what should Olivia so hence the

and what should Olivia so hence the
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.860
and what should Olivia so hence the
importance of the kind of research we we

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
importance of the kind of research we we

try to do combine economics psychology
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.300
try to do combine economics psychology
to really understand what people know

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310
to really understand what people know
 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.550
to really understand what people know
why they act the way they do and whether

why they act the way they do and whether
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:50.350
why they act the way they do and whether
we can try to find the solutions
