00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.660
- [Instructor] When we think
about how the executive

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.890
or the legislative branch
have some form of check

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.990
or power over the judicial branch,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.750
a key element of that is
the executive's ability

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.500
to appoint judges to federal courts,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.510
including the US Supreme Court.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.580
But it's not just that
the president can decide

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.920
who gets to be a justice;

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.940
they have to be confirmed by the Senate.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.890
And what you see over here,
what I'm about to play,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.900
are the confirmation hearings

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.623
from Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009,

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:35.160
and what I hope you get from
it is it's not an easy process.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.670
This is going to be a question
from Senator Chuck Grassley,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.220
who's a Republican from Iowa,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.150
and he's going to be asking
about whether marriage

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.130
is a state or a federal question.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.500
- So, do you agree that
marriage is a question

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500
reserved for the states to
decide, based on Baker v. Nelson?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.770
- That also is a question
that's pending and impending

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.203
in many courts.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.270
As you know, the issue of
marriage and what constitutes it

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.180
is a subject of much public discussion,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
and there's a number of
cases in state courts

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.170
addressing the issue of who
regulates it, under what terms--

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.580
- Can I please interrupt you?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.820
I thought I was asking
a very simple question

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.820
based upon a precedent
that Baker v. Nelson is,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.130
based on the proposition that yesterday,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.560
in so many cases, whether it was Griswold,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.410
whether it was Roe v. Wade,
whether it was Chevron,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.280
whether it's a whole bunch of other cases

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.410
that you made reference
to, the Casey case,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.240
the Gonzales case,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.230
the Leegin Creative Leather
Products case, the Kelo case.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.480
You made that case to me.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.700
You said these are precedents.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.860
Now, are you saying to me

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.370
that Baker v. Nelson is not a precedent?

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.370
- No sir, I just haven't
reviewed Baker in a while.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.930
And so, I actually don't
know what the status is.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.550
If it is the court's precedent,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.510
as I've indicated in all of my answers,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.440
I will apply that precedent

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.440
to the facts of any new
situation that implicates it.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.930
Always, the first question for a judge--

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.330
- Well then, tell me
what sort of a process

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970
you might go through--

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.100
- [Instructor] So anyway, you can see

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.390
that this is not an easy process.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.350
And in this situation,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.690
you have an appointment
by a Democratic president

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.780
and you have questions
from a Republican senator,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.090
and this is fairly typical.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.150
They're likely to ask
more pointed questions

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.980
and try to get the appointee to trip up.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.640
And if you were to see questions
from a Democratic senator,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.700
they'd be more likely to ask questions

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.560
that would make the nominee
look a little bit better,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.340
and that tends to always be the case.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.750
If it's from the same party,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.130
they tend to try to smooth the process,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.270
while the opposition party

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.860
tries to make it a little
bit more difficult.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.930
And an interesting thing to
think about is Justice Sotomayor

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.820
eventually does get appointed
to the Supreme Court,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.850
but what was the goal
of Senator Grassley here

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.210
in asking these questions, even if he knew

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.620
that she was eventually
going to be appointed?

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.640
There's other themes
that we've talked about

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.820
in government that he might be playing to.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.100
He might be asking these questions
more for his constituents

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.210
or there might be an element of,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.560
even if a Supreme Court justice
is going to be appointed,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.600
at the end of the day,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.930
there's also the court of
public opinion, so to speak,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.510
and these might be opportunities
to sow some seeds of doubt

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.550
or to make it a little bit more difficult

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.230
for a Supreme Court justice to,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.630
in the future, vote one way or another

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.350
based on what they say
during these hearings.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.000
Interesting things to talk about.
