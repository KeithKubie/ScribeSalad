[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:06.410
CALEY SHOEMAKER: Awesome.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.701
So my name is Caylee Shoemaker.

00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:09.510
I'm the head distiller
for Hangar 1.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.490
We're up in Alameda, California
on the former Naval Air

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.320
Station.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.260
So just up the way.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.670
I'm actually relatively
new to California.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.530
I moved here to join Hangar
1 about three years ago

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.592
from Denver, Colorado.

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:25.800
I actually started distilling
at Stranahan's Colorado

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.940
Whisky in Denver.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.750
Go Broncos.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.380
I like that shirt.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.250
So I started my
career in whisky.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.010
And the time that I
spent making whisky,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.740
I've really had an opportunity
to learn pretty much

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.720
every aspect of
distillation-- everything

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
from tours and tastings
to grain selection

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.280
to mashing, fermenting,
distilling, barrel maturation,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.120
bottling.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.620
There's so many
awesome aspects that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.786
go into making delicious,
delicious beverages.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.160
But when I had the opportunity
to come join Hangar 1 here

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.720
in the Bay Area, I
was really excited.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.094
Hangar 1 is a
brand that's really

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:01.269
well-known for using
fresh ingredients

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.060
and partnering with
local farmers to source

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.810
those ingredients.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.060
And that was
something that I found

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.986
really exciting,
intriguing, and that

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:09.110
would be a great challenge.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.229
So here at Hangar
1, where I am now,

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.645
working with our
local communities

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:18.144
and local farmers is pretty
much at the center of everything

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.020
we do.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.284
We source grain and
wine from local folks.

00:01:22.284 --> 00:01:24.450
We work with farmers
throughout California to source

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.030
the fruits and botanicals
for our flavored vodka.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.190
And we even get some water
from our friendly neighborhood

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.650
fog for fog point.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.250
But we'll talk a little bit
more about that in a bit.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.360
Part of this collaboration
with local suppliers

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.360
leads to partnerships with
like-minded individuals.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.390
So Chris is with me here today.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.050
Chris is from FogQuest.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.140
And he'll talk a little
bit about fog and fog water

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.580
and how we use
fog to make vodka.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.170
But what we're going to touch
on today is a few things.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.220
We're going to talk a little
bit about innovation in vodka,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.860
innovation in
distilling, and our most

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.180
recent innovation at Hangar 1--

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.950
Fog Point vodka.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.640
All right.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.119
So before I get too crazy
talking about fog point,

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.410
you guys probably would like
to know how vodka is made.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.060
Right?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.910
A lot of people have
this perception of vodka

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.810
being a spirit.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.190
That's vodka because
it comes from potatoes.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.300
This is not actually the case.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.410
Vodka can be made from
just about anything.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.570
If it can be fermented
to create alcohol,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.220
it can be made into vodka.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.140
So there are grain
vodkas out there.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.220
There's corn vodka.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.330
There's fruit vodka.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.700
There's even a guy
making vodka from milk.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.520
So people get really
creative with it.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.070
Basically the way to
make vodka is you start

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.300
with your fermented material.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.180
And then you need to
distill it to 190 proof.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.130
190 proof is 95% alcohol.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.380
It's pretty spicy stuff, right?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.880
The idea is to reach towards
a clean, odorless, flavorless

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.410
profile.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.740
That's actually in the
federal definition.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.060
We don't want it to be 100%
odorless and flavorless.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.143
We want to have a nod to
our starting ingredients.

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:56.400
We put a lot of work into
sourcing really good stuff.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.050
We want you to be
able to taste it.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.425
So the 5% water that sneaks
through with that 95% alcohol

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:03.550
is going to carry through
a little bit of character

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.800
from our starting ingredients.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.960
And at Hangar 1, that's
Midwestern grains

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.931
and California wine grapes.

00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:11.180
So you guys just saw a picture
of the still behind me.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.860
We've also got a
photo right here.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.350
Distilling in a
nutshell is the act

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.960
of boiling our
fermented material.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.670
So we're using
California wine grapes.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.560
In our case, that's wine.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.950
And as we boil that material,
the alcohol portion of it

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.230
has a lower boiling point
than the water, which

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.790
means that the
alcohol steam is going

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.530
to rise up off that
solution before the water,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.550
allowing us to collect it and
condense it back down into more

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.087
pure liquid alcohol.

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:38.420
Now you see the still behind me.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.580
It's got a lot of little
windows and things on it.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.080
We have to get to 190 proof.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.002
It's a pretty important
part of being vodka.

00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:46.710
So that doesn't look
like a whisky still.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.039
That's specifically
a vodka still.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.580
The reason it is
specifically a vodka

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.610
still is because the
towers next to the pot

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.350
contain a series
of small chambers.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.240
That's what those windows
represent are small chambers.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.864
And in each of those
chambers the vodka

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:02.130
is forced to go from a liquid
to a gas to a liquid to a gas.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.050
Each time leaving
behind more water,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.940
leaving behind impurities,
and making its way

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.510
to the collection tanks
at the end at 190 proof.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.430
Now distilling is what
people think about when

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.570
they think about making vodka.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.070
Right?

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.420
Distilling is the
most important part.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.935
Crazy thing is-- if we're
distilling up to 190 proof,

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:20.560
you guys don't want to drink it
at that high of a proof, right?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.870
So we have to have water.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.760
Water is actually 60% of vodka.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.550
We're going to add water back
into our vodka to bring it down

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.724
to that bottle strength.

00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:29.640
So there's actually more
water in your alcohol

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.670
than there is alcohol
a lot of the times.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.980
Another fun party fact you
can share with your friends.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.960
So for most of our
vodkas-- our straight vodka

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.418
and all of our
fruit vodkas-- we're

00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:42.150
using reverse osmosis water.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.444
Reverse osmosis
water is so clean

00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:46.110
that it allows our
ingredients to shine.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.430
It allows all of the
different nuances

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.580
in the flavor profile of
these awesome ingredients

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.900
we're using to shine.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.510
And through using
our own water, that

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.010
was one of those
things that started

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.710
to inspire me to look
at our water usage

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.647
and make something
like Fog Point.

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:01.980
I'll get there in a few, though.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.560
I was talking about
our fruit and our wine.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.760
And that's been one
of my favorite parts

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.260
of moving from whisky and moving
from Colorado to California

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.900
is our collaboration
with our local farmers.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.420
When I first got
here and I saw all

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.220
of the really interesting
produce that's

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.470
at the farmer's
market year-round,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.050
it inspires us to continue
to make new vodkas.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.570
And our partnership
with those farmers as we

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.580
do this is so integral
to everything that we do.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.980
And the drought has had a huge,
huge impact on our farmers.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.780
So this is a really
important time for us

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.450
to talk about water and
drought and the water cycle

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.740
and its impact on everything
we do in California.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.500
So the drought officially
ended in March.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.350
I know the rain was terrible,
and we're all very tired of it.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.170
But it helped us to get out of
this six-year drought cycle.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.090
That over the course
of the last six years

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.680
has caused a lot of
impact on California.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.650
For example, last
year, the drought

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.330
cost California $3 million.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.690
And 102 million trees
died over the course

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.370
of that six-year drought period.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.680
So that's a little bit
of the impact globally.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.500
But the farmers are really
paying a heavy price

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.461
on this drought.

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.210
It's important to
remember that California

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.080
is an agricultural
center for the US.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.490
It's our biggest
agricultural producer.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.860
There's more than 200
crops grown in California.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.271
So drought and farmers
definitely go hand-in-hand.

00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:18.270
The thing that I kept
hearing as we were talking

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.186
with our farmers, as
we're sourcing our fruits

00:06:20.186 --> 00:06:21.630
for our vodkas is
how the drought

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.180
is impacting all of our
fruit quality and our fruit

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.440
availability.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.100
Plus, it's impacting me, because
I need water to make my vodka.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.400
Like I said, there's
60% water in vodka.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.920
Water adds to the overall
character of what we're making.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.890
So the final package of a
vodka is that distillate.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.120
You know, it's distilled
up to 190 proof.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.880
Any process that we do.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.775
So any infusion or maceration
of our fruits or botanicals

00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:46.980
if we're making a
flavored expression,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.630
and then of course water.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.940
The characteristic of the
water can have a huge impact

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.286
on the final product.

00:06:53.286 --> 00:06:54.660
So the good news
as we're talking

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.076
about water and
these water issues

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:59.070
is that here in
California, as a community,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.190
we like to all innovate as
a group to find solutions

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.010
to these problems.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.440
So individuals,
businesses, we're

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.460
all committed to chipping in and
making our state a better place

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.020
and helping sustainability.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.514
So we tried to do the
same thing at Hangar 1.

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.930
As a group, we started looking
for a new, more sustainable

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.070
source of water.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.950
What's a way that we could
talk about this issue,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.439
raise awareness for the
water crisis we were having

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.480
during the drought, and
make a really tasty vodka

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.200
at the same time?

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.460
That was our end goal.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.890
So we searched for all kinds
of different processes.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.630
And in that search, someone from
our team came across FogQuest.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.270
Now FogQuest is a nonprofit
that works worldwide

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.510
to collect fog for agricultural
and drinking water use.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.130
They work in countries like
Chile, Nepal, Guatemala.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.660
It sounds really cool.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.310
And we realized that fog is so
iconic here in the Bay Area,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.410
the solution for our
water issue was actually

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.951
right in front of
us this whole time.

00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:54.750
Right?

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.390
The question is, could we
actually use fog to make vodka?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.940
Sounds like a really cool idea.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.690
Is it actually
something we can do?

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.390
So we decided to reach out
to the experts at FogQuest.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.632
So Chris here is our
local fog expert.

00:08:06.632 --> 00:08:09.090
Chris has been volunteering
with FogQuest for the last four

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.590
years.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.850
And he has been instrumental
in this project for us.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.120
We've actually learned so much
visiting the fog collectors

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.160
with Chris, and
learning about how

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.474
fog is created in California,
and how is a way that we

00:08:20.474 --> 00:08:21.640
might be able to collect it.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.820
So Chris, tell us a little
bit about fog, please.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.680
CHRIS FOGLIATTI: Excellent Hi.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.130
Like Caley said, I'm a volunteer
with the charity FogQuest

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.710
Sustainable Water Solutions.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.260
And FogQuest's mission
is to provide water

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.289
to people in remote
locations using fog.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.409
And right now,
FoqQuest has projects

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.149
in eight countries supplying
significant amounts of water.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.690
Like Caley said,
they brought me here

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.310
to explain a little
bit about the fog,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.840
because it's kind
of bewildering.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.030
And I want to try to explain
how this mechanism works.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.055
And the first question I want
to answer is, what is the fog?

00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:00.720
And out here in the Bay Area,
the most prolific kind of fog

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.670
that we see is the
fog from the ocean,

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.320
the fog comes off the ocean.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.750
And that is technically
called advection fog.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.660
And advection means movement.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.230
And so the way the fog is
generated from the ocean

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.520
is warm air moves
across the cool ocean.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.350
And as that air is cooled,
it cannot hold as much water.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.570
So the air becomes
supersaturated.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.820
And then as the air
cools even further,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.600
water droplets are formed.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.400
So that's the mechanism
for generating ocean fog.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.380
This ocean fog is
the starting point

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.520
for fog collection
in most areas.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.510
And in one area where FogQuest
has the largest network of fog

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.630
collectors-- it's in a
remote village in Guatemala--

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.120
the advection fog is
the starting point.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.280
In this village FogQuest has
around 35 large fog collectors.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.530
And that occupies a
collection surface

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.270
of around 15,000 square feet.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.150
So that's about a third of
a football field vertically

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.540
posted like billboards.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.950
And those collectors produce
around 1,800 gallons of water

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.700
a day during the dry season.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.380
This network by FogQuest,
it's a minimalist network.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.620
It's designed to be
rather inexpensive.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.580
And also it's a
passive technology.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.570
And so it doesn't
require any energy.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.090
And so for the people
in this one village,

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.940
the fog is a very positive
aspect in their life.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.880
Now out here in the
Bay Area, people

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.310
have a little more mixed
feelings about the fog.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.210
Sometimes the fog will cause
traffic delays or airport

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.110
delays.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.990
But also during the
summertime, the fog

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.930
can cool off an entire
city or an entire county.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.940
And so if you think
about it, for the fog

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.690
to have an impact
over a square mile,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.190
there's a lot of
energy in the fog.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.540
There's a lot of cold water.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.954
It's just difficult
to acquire that water.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.370
So I hope that
helps a little bit.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.980
Now the process
for fog collection

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.840
is pretty straightforward.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.610
What has to happen
is fog has to be

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.020
blown through a mesh
for several hours.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.990
And then water is
trapped on the mesh.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.060
And it's eventually
collected in a tank.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.890
So I want to explain a little
bit more about why this works.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.260
And the starting
point to understanding

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.920
why this system works is I
can explain a little bit more

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.520
about fog.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.150
And the most important aspect of
fog is that the droplets in fog

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.560
are microscopic.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.010
They are about 100 times
smaller than a raindrop.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.375
So raindrops, their trajectory
usually is vertical.

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:47.250
They're falling from
the cloud to the ground.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.940
Fog droplets tend to float.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.410
They move horizontally.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.520
So fog collectors will be
posted in a vertical fashion

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.390
to try to maximize the fog
going through the material.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.200
So the process, like I said,
it's pretty straightforward.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.940
Fog droplets impact the mesh.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.790
Then they get trapped,
and they start moving.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.520
And over time, the mesh
becomes waterlogged.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.000
And then larger droplets fall
from the mesh into a trough,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.530
and then into a collection tank.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.110
So basically what these
fog collectors are doing

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.650
is they're converting the small,
microscopic droplets in fog

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:31.890
into larger droplets, which
we can then plumb into a tank.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.130
And one tool that
fog researchers use

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.180
is called the standard
fog collector.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.310
A standard fog collector can
measure the fog collection

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.640
efficiency in a particular area.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.870
And last year for the
fog vodka project,

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.930
we mainly used these
standard fog collectors.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.500
Also, the researchers
commonly use them.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.210
And from June through September,
this one small fog collector

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.230
averaged over a gallon a day,
produced over a gallon a day

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.850
during the fog season
at Sutro Tower.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.449
Now these standard
fog collectors,

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:13.990
because researchers
use them, they're

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.320
made to standard specifications
and standard sizes.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.630
The main component
on a fog collector

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.760
is one square meter metal frame.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.820
And then that metal frame is
wrapped in a specific type

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.630
of shade cloth.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.070
There's two layers
of shade cloth

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.420
that go over the metal frame.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.750
That makes up the
fog collection panel.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.430
Then the fog collection
panel is lifted two meters

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.579
off the ground.

00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:38.370
It's also anchored in
place with guy wires.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.620
The shade cloth that we use
for the standard fog collectors

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.730
was studied for around 10 years.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.080
And this particular shade
cloth with a Raschel weave

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.570
and a 35% shade
coefficient was determined

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.180
to be the most optimum
material for fog

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.680
collection at high elevations.

00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:05.390
And if you look at
the shape cloth,

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.680
it's a little hard
to see right here,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.790
but the Raschel weave
forms a triangle.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.500
And that facilitates water
shedding off the material.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.870
And also, that
triangle pattern is

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.070
similar to the branch and needle
structure on redwood trees.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.360
It's very similar.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.790
So there's a lot of biomimicry
going on in fog collection.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.950
And a big topic of
research is a lot

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.800
of researchers in schools are
trying to develop materials

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.440
which are more efficient than
the standard fog collection

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.260
material.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.460
And for this project
for this upcoming year

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.100
we have several standard fog
collectors that we're using.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.770
And we're also using
a larger fog collector

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.780
with one of these
more exotic materials.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.820
So it'll be interesting
to see what happens.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.490
CALEY SHOEMAKER:
So we learned a ton

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.960
from working with
FogQuest and Chris.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960
And it turns out that fog
collection is actually

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.260
like the perfect Bay Area
solution to our Bay Area water

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.320
problem.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.770
So we worked with Chris
and FogQuest to build

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.660
and strategically placed
these fog collectors

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.040
throughout the Bay.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.210
Now Chris is monitoring three
fog collectors at Sutro Tower.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.290
This is actually a photo
of one of our collectors

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.840
you can see at the
base of the tower.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.360
And then we have a fog farm
that was recently installed

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.025
at a farm in Half Moon Bay.

00:15:17.025 --> 00:15:20.190
Chris, can you tell us why
fog collectors at Sutro Tower

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.210
make sense?

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.240
CHRIS FOGLIATTI: Sure.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:22.740
Yeah.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.785
Well, to do fog
collection successfully,

00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:27.600
it does require a
very specific set

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.694
of geographic
characteristics be met.

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:32.610
And one thing that's a
little counterintuitive

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.060
is we're using the advection
fog-- the ocean fog.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.080
But the main criteria
that FogQuest requires

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.640
is the fog collectors should be
placed at around 2/3 the height

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.540
of the fog bank.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.500
So in the Bay Area, that means
generally around 1,000 feet up.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.690
And this is because the
fog collection is passive,

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.430
an additional condensation
step is required.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.810
And as the fog from the
ocean travels up the hill,

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.220
more condensation occurs.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.520
And the fog becomes
more water dense.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.240
So that's one requirement.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.410
Another requirement is
proximity to the ocean.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.500
It's generally recommended
that the fog collectors should

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.230
be installed within
five miles of the ocean.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.180
And another requirement
is generally

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.360
a free path for the fog to
go from the ocean to the net.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.100
Now these characteristics
in the Bay Area

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.530
are very difficult
to reach, because we

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:31.410
have real estate and vegetation
that's always occupying space.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.310
So it's really a
matter of compromises.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.010
Other important
factors that we look

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.230
at when we're seeing if
fog collecting will work

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.140
is if there's a
change in the plant

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.900
ecology, if there is really lush
green ferns, or a lot of moss

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.200
on a tree during
the summertime, it's

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.750
pretty likely there's going
to be fog in that area.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.230
Also, you can use just
physical examples.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.850
Like if you're driving
through an area

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.100
and you have to turn on your
windshield wipers, that's

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.920
an area that has a lot of fog.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.930
And another cue is from nature.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.602
We can study the fog drift
that comes off the trees.

00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:09.060
And if there is a significant
amount of water under a tree,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.010
that's a good clue that
fog collection will work.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.500
And really to combine all
these characteristics,

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.230
I've noticed that one
tool the researchers use

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.970
is Google Earth,
because it can pull up

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.531
the elevation, the
proximity to the ocean.

00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:24.780
And you can see the obstacles.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.960
So that's pretty interesting.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.050
CALEY SHOEMAKER: Awesome.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.420
So last summer, Sutro
Tower's fog collectors

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.151
were able to collect about 350
gallons during the high fog

00:17:33.151 --> 00:17:33.650
season.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.210
So just a little idea of
how much water we can get.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.660
So it's now time for a little
bit of audience participation.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.300
You guys have all
got a vial with you.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.700
This is a sample of the water
collected at Sutro Tower

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.440
over the last couple of days.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.940
So I'd like to take
this opportunity

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.760
to taste this fog water
so we can understand

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.845
how the flavor of this water
impacts the final flavor

00:17:53.845 --> 00:17:54.720
profile of the vodka.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.820
And we'll taste the
vodka in just a moment.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.950
So go ahead and give
this water a sip.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.510
So the water's collected.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.820
It's brought to the
hangar in tanks.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.030
We then carbon
filter it, boil it,

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.047
and carbon filter
it a second time.

00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:08.880
Now the filtration step
is really important,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.700
because we are collecting fog
and these nice beautiful nature

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.965
areas that have things
like leaves and dust

00:18:13.965 --> 00:18:15.840
that might be able to
fall into the fog tank.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.330
So we want to remove any
of those particulates.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.310
We then boil to ensure
the water is sanitary,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.460
and just filter one more time to
make sure it's nice and clean.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.960
Once we've been
through these steps,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.202
we send the water out to
the laboratory for analysis.

00:18:27.202 --> 00:18:29.160
And it turns out that
the fog water is actually

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.980
cleaner than the average
tap water in the Bay Area.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.780
However, as you
guys are tasting it,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.322
you'll notice it does have
its own character to it.

00:18:36.322 --> 00:18:38.280
So the thing that I really
like about the water

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.650
is that mineral note
that you get there.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.210
It reminds me a lot of hiking.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.200
I'm really into hiking.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.480
And when you are outside
on a nice warm day

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.030
after a damp morning or
a rainstorm, and you can

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.284
smell the warm, wet stones
of like river or something

00:18:51.284 --> 00:18:52.200
as you're crossing by.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.870
That's exactly what the
fog water reminds me of.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.050
It also has a slight salty
mineral characteristic to it.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.850
I don't know if that
comes from the ocean.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.830
I like to think that it does.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.820
Awesome.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.860
So we've talked a
lot about the water.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.110
What are we distilling
to make this vodka?

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.072
We're using wine.

00:19:08.072 --> 00:19:10.530
We decided to partner with
Bonny Doon Vineyards, because we

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.863
decided if we're going to
make this a sustainable vodka,

00:19:12.863 --> 00:19:15.530
is we're going to do this,
we want to really do it.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.090
Now Randall Graham and
the Bonny Doon team

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.430
really inspired me with
their wine-making techniques.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.460
They're huge into sustainable
biodynamic farming.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.260
When I'm talking about
biodynamic farming,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.620
I'm talking about synchronizing
the viticultural process

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.470
with the natural cycles of
the plants and of nature,

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.470
so that it's a low-impact,
natural way to farm.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.990
Things like bringing in
symbiotic plants and animals

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.970
to augment the growing
conditions of the grapes

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.845
instead of using artificial
elements-- things

00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:42.940
like fertilizers and pesticides.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.170
So we have these really great,
sustainable, delicious grapes

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.630
that are turned into a
wine, as Randall puts it,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.370
with minimal human intervention.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.050
So we worked with the entire
2012 vintage of Bonny Doon's Le

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.980
Cigare Blanc wine.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.420
This is a white
wine blend that's

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.540
made of Picpoul, Roussanne,
and Grenache Blanc.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.760
We brought all of the
wine to the distillery

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.220
and distilled it
up to 190 proof,

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.360
and then used nothing but
pure California fog water

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.220
to cut that vodka
back down to 80 proof.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.610
And poof-- Fog Point vodka.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.270
This delicious stuff
that you guys all

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.590
happen to have a taste of.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.420
So now the moment
you've been waiting for.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.740
We've been talking all morning.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.900
You're here to taste vodka.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.610
So when I'm tasting a vodka, I
like to start with nosing it.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.950
It gives my mind and
my palate a preview

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.270
of what's about to happen.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.940
You guys don't
need to swirl this.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.010
I know we're all very
used to wine tasting.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.190
But there's a lot
more alcohol in here

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.190
than there is in a wine.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.470
And swirling it is going to
make that volatile alcohol

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.640
rise above the surface.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.370
So when you nose it, you'll
get less of the lovely notes

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.400
and a lot more alcohol.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.530
So no swirling.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.067
But go ahead and take a nose.

00:20:48.067 --> 00:20:50.400
Breathe in through your nose
and mouth at the same time.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.110
That aerates that alcohol
scent a little bit

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.485
so you can start to notice
the characteristics coming off

00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:55.770
of the vodka.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.240
Now you can smell
that mineraliness

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.198
you get from the water.

00:20:58.198 --> 00:21:00.630
But there's also a little
bit of floral characteristic,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.424
also a little bit of sweetness.

00:21:02.424 --> 00:21:04.590
Next, go ahead and take a
small sip from your vodka.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.673
This is going to prime
your palate and cleanse it.

00:21:06.673 --> 00:21:08.640
Saw some of you guys
eating salads back there.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.389
Don't want your vodka
to taste like salad.

00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:13.260
So this step will go ahead
and cleanse and get you ready.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.630
And on the next sip, take
a slightly larger sip,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.340
and allow yourself
to really experience

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.280
the texture of the vodka,
the nice round mouth feel.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.530
And all those flavor notes
will start to come out.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.930
Floral notes, sweetness.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.570
Making a vodka from
100% wine was something

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.050
I was really excited to do.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.190
Our straight vodka combines
the grain and great profile

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.940
to make a really interesting,
complex expression.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.760
But so much of that
sweetness and that softness

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.650
comes from the grain.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.370
So to have 100%
grape vodka makes

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.710
for a really-- dare I say--
robust flavored vodka.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.550
All right.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.730
After vodka tasting,
a little bit of fun

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.140
factoids about Fog Point.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.320
So we used a vintage wine
and all the fog water we

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.580
could collect for six months.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.204
And in doing that,
we were able to make

00:21:58.204 --> 00:22:00.800
2,472 bottles of Fog Point.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.630
So this is a really
limited edition vodka.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.030
We released it here in
California and in a couple

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.010
select areas
throughout the country.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.850
And the response was awesome.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.440
It was really exciting to
see spirits nerds and people

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.830
that are really into the
distilling industry like it.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.425
But to see average people
really getting into it too.

00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:19.800
Everyone across
the board thought

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.120
this was a really cool idea.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.340
And I think it really
brought forth a conversation

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.430
about water conservation
and collecting fog.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.770
We created our bar programs
to different bartenders

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.314
throughout the country to
make some Fog Point Martinis.

00:22:31.314 --> 00:22:32.730
We actually just
enjoyed one right

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.550
by the Bay Bridge over there
at EPIC Steak House yesterday.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.817
Really delicious way
to taste the vodka.

00:22:37.817 --> 00:22:39.900
And that salty characteristic
makes it pair really

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.400
well with seafood,
which is perfect,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.890
because we have a lot of
that here in the Bay Area.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.830
The last fun note is that we've
donated the profits from Fog

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.640
Point sales back to FogQuest
and to other water conservation

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.730
organizations to push this
conversation forward and help

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.700
facilitate more research into
how fog collection could become

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.972
a viable solution for
some of this water crisis

00:22:58.972 --> 00:23:00.180
that we've been experiencing.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.638
And I understand that it really
has pushed the conversation

00:23:02.638 --> 00:23:03.360
forward.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.070
CHRIS FOGLIATTI: Yes.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.600
Because of this
project, I've been

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.760
introduced to numerous
groups of researchers.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.250
And they're interested more
in talking with Hangar 1,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.670
because they're so
supportive of that community.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.711
But we've also met some
businesses that are using fog.

00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:18.960
I'll talk about them in a bit.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.920
But some of the researchers
that Hangar 1 has now

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.640
been associated with
are out of the USGS.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.470
Alicia Torregrosa.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:32.230
She works in the Western
Regional Science Center

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.880
down the street at Menlo Park.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.390
And one aspect of
her research is

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.320
to compile satellite
data over several years

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.730
during the summertime.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.580
And she overlays
those satellite images

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.370
and is able to get an estimate
of the approximate fog

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.930
and low coastal cloud
concentrations in an area.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.260
This is a good starting
point for fog researchers.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.820
And this map is of
the Point Reyes area.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.010
If you're familiar
with the North Bay,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:07.250
you can see that
the white parts are

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.490
kind of in the Marin headlands,
and then up by Point Reyes.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.380
And once again, if
we were to cross

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.150
this map with the
other characteristics,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.060
especially using
Google Earth, we're

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.200
able to pinpoint
locations much better.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.730
Other researchers
that we've met include

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.390
ecologists and botanists.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.650
Some ecologists are studying
the fog drip off of trees.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.410
And they found that
in some locations,

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.620
especially on the ridge
line above Half Moon Bay

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.240
that the fog drip
off the trees can

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.420
account for twice as
much water as comes

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.070
during the rainy season.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.030
This image here is an image
from Alicia Torregrosa's

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.320
standard fog collectors up
in the mid-peninsula research

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.280
area.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.320
And what she has there
is-- like I said,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.260
researchers are trying to
study different mesh to see

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.010
which ones are more effective.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.530
And so she has an array up.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.320
And there's going to be a
journal article out shortly

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.340
combining this evaluation along
with several other evaluations

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.050
along the coast of California.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.510
But what's really
fascinating is we

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:19.250
met a botanist who was doing
research out of Santa Barbara.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.920
And she set up some
standard fog collectors

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.680
at a strawberry farm and
other biology type equipment.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.660
And she was able to measure
how efficiently plants were

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.360
transporting water and
doing photosynthesis.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.940
And she was able to
prove that after a fog

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.430
event at these particular
strawberry farms,

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:42.050
the strawberries required
less water to thrive.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.760
And that's really
interesting, especially

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.270
if we combine that fact with
Alicia Torregrosa's maps, where

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.250
they show that
Salinas Valley where

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.860
there's a lot of these
lettuce and strawberry farms--

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.330
that's prime fog area.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:59.020
So there's a lot of
interesting studies of fog,

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.380
not really related to
collecting the water.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.130
But ecologists are studying it
and botanists are studying it.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.600
And also toxicologists
are studying it.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.520
So now some of the businesses
we've met with this project

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:19.360
include a guy who sold Hangar
1 the first ever fog collector

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.730
of this style in
the United States.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.690
We met Michael Donahue
with this company Fog2H2O.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:30.880
And he is a distributor of this
German-engineered style fog

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.660
collector, which has been
trademarked and branded

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.780
the Cloud Fisher fog collectors.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.540
They use, like I say,
a more exotic mesh.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.120
And also they have an
aspect of German engineering

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.810
where they're more robust than
the FogQuest fog collectors.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:51.740
But there's also more money
involved in the materials.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.920
So it's interesting to see the
different charities compete.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.835
One's a highly
engineered device.

00:26:58.835 --> 00:27:01.150
And one's more of a
minimalist device.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:05.380
Now those collectors that
we saw have been installed

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.180
successfully in Morocco.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.860
And in 2018 with the support of
a couple of Moroccan charities

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.230
and the support of
a German government,

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.620
these Cloud Fisher
style fog collectors

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.599
are estimated to be the new
largest fog collector network.

00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:23.890
They're supposed to be larger
than the one FogQuest has

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.200
up in Guatemala.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.020
So it will be interesting to
see if they can accomplish that

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.420
by 2018.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.930
So through talking
with these researchers

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.060
and these businesses, I
really think that Fog Point

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.270
has established a dialogue.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.300
And we think it will be
interesting to see where

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.870
we go forward from here with
water conservation and fog

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.180
studies and the
work on the farms.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.340
CALEY SHOEMAKER: Very cool.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:52.880
Awesome.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.014
So a little bit in closing.

00:27:56.014 --> 00:27:58.430
I hope you guys can see that
innovation and fresh thinking

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.013
are at the center of pretty much
everything we do at Hangar 1.

00:28:01.013 --> 00:28:04.220
So we were so excited
to be invited to Google.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.770
Google is thought of as a really
progressive company that's

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.806
on the forefront of human
ingenuity, I would say.

00:28:09.806 --> 00:28:11.180
And so it's really
exciting to be

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.330
able to come here and talk
to you guys about Fog Point.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.214
I hope I've changed
your perception of what

00:28:16.214 --> 00:28:16.880
you're drinking.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.463
So next time you're
out at happy hour,

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:21.140
you can think about how
much water is in this vodka

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.880
and where did it come from?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.610
We do welcome your
thoughts, though.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.610
We're always innovating.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.770
We're always
looking for new ways

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.080
to make vodka and new
things to make vodka from.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.480
So please feel free to reach
out to me if you guys have

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.200
any ideas about any sort of fun
projects we could go forth on

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.560
and any issues we can address
in the vodka-making world.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.240
And also lastly, I'd like
to invite all of you--

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.400
we passed a little card.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.500
But please come visit
us at the distillery.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.309
We're located just up the way at
the Alameda Naval Air Station.

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:50.600
And we'd love to have you so
you can see our equipment,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.670
learn about our process, taste
Fog Point, Hangar 1, and some

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.550
of our limited edition vodkas.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.215
So thank you very much.

00:28:57.215 --> 00:28:58.715
I'd like to open
it up for questions

00:28:58.715 --> 00:28:59.940
if anyone has any questions.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.440
Yes.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.280
CALEY SHOEMAKER: That's
a great question.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.930
CHRIS FOGLIATTI:
Well, like I said,

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.320
the researchers
from Stanford are

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.180
trying to study the
characteristics which

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.590
produce a lot of fog drift.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:15.140
And so they were at
that stage in 2015.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.170
I know the research is ongoing.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.930
Now, I'm not sure
what you mean by what

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.920
the impact on the ecosystem is.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.332
What the researchers are
able to do other than study

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.790
the fog drift is
they're able to do

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.820
an isotope analysis of the
water table from well water.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.360
And they can identify
how much of the water

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.430
recently came from fog
and how much of the water

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.600
came from rain.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.159
And there has been, once
again, in some watersheds,

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:43.325
especially along the coast--

00:29:43.325 --> 00:29:48.050
I'm talking about the Crystal
Springs watershed just east

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.190
of Half Moon Bay--

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.790
the isotope analysis
of that water table

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.430
shows that the fog has a
very significant impact

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.630
on that watershed.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.180
Yeah.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.360
Well, that's a good question.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.720
Of course, if you were to
layer fog nets everywhere,

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.790
it could have an impact.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.960
But generally the
fog is so spread out,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.910
and it does encompass
such a high and wide area,

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.720
that it would be difficult to
remove a large amount of water.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.880
But an obvious thing
to do-- and the reason

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.970
I think that the USGS is
involved in mapping this out

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.130
is they could potentially
regulate it and set up

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.850
a permit system.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.970
So people are removing the
water in a sustainable manner.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.090
AUDIENCE: Isn't the fog
that you get near the Bay,

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.140
wouldn't it have salt in it?

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.910
CHRIS FOGLIATTI:
Well, certainly there

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.120
is an impact on the fog from
the wave-breaking action.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.750
And that does introduce
different chemicals

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.860
into the fog.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.580
Now as the fog
travels up a hill--

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.070
like I say, FogQuest recommends
installing the fog nets

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.090
at a high elevation.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.660
Most of the impurities
in the fog drop out.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.160
And in order to provide water
to these remote communities,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.160
the fog water had to be tested.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.840
And it's been
tested for decades.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.100
And it most generally
meets the criteria set

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.280
by the UN for clean
water, especially

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.660
compared to groundwater in some
of these more remote areas.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.440
But yeah.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.880
There is an impact there.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.150
And it's due mainly
to the wave action.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.605
That's the point of exposure.

00:31:33.605 --> 00:31:36.440
That's where the fog changes
characteristics is right

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.560
when it crosses the beach.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.890
AUDIENCE: How much water
does a single catcher get

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.140
on a good day, I guess?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.640
CHRIS FOGLIATTI:
Sutro Tower I think

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.450
is a good optimum
location in the Bay Area.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.030
And last summer during
our heavy fog period,

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.604
it averaged just over
a gallon per day.

00:31:55.604 --> 00:31:56.770
And that's one square meter.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.660
Usually Usually they're
measured in gallons--

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.560
or liters per day
per square meter.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.646
So a little over
four liters per day.

00:32:04.646 --> 00:32:06.770
CALEY SHOEMAKER: We put up
a standard fog collector

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.785
at the distillery
in Alameda as well,

00:32:08.785 --> 00:32:10.410
mainly because people
want to see them.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:11.960
But also we were kind of
interested in how much water

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.860
we would collect.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.562
We get about a half
liter a day, maybe

00:32:14.562 --> 00:32:15.770
a liter on a really good day.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.560
So we use it to
help water plants.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.320
But we're not in an optimal
area like Sutro Tower.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.050
AUDIENCE: Does the distillery
make any naturally flavored

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:24.556
vodkas?

00:32:24.556 --> 00:32:25.430
CALEY SHOEMAKER: Yes.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.138
All of our vodkas are
naturally flavored.

00:32:27.138 --> 00:32:30.410
So any of our flavored
bunches that you will taste

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.560
are made by macerating fruits
and botanicals in 190 proof

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.700
spirit.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.670
We then save that infusion
and take the fruit out.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.500
If you've ever made
infused vodka at home,

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.580
you know that when you
take the fruit out,

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.120
you have really
boozy fruit left.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.100
Right?

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.104
We don't want to let
that alcohol go to waste.

00:32:45.104 --> 00:32:47.270
So we take the fruit and
we put it back into our pot

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.728
still with a little water, and
then distill the alcohol out

00:32:49.728 --> 00:32:50.330
of the fruit.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.830
And during that
process, whatever

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.990
oils and compounds that
were in our botanicals

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.652
that the alcohol
couldn't pull out,

00:32:55.652 --> 00:32:57.860
the heat from the still
breaks down and pulls through

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.049
in that distillate.

00:32:59.049 --> 00:33:00.590
That distillate and
infusion are then

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.020
used to flavor the final vodka.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.090
And so that's why our
vodkas taste so fresh.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.269
We work with our farmers
at the peak of freshness.

00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:09.060
They deliver all of
the fruit for the year.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.809
So for example, when
we do Buddha's Hands,

00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:12.560
they're in season
December-January.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.570
I'm in Buddha Hand
land during that time.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.610
And then I don't touch Buddha's
Hands for the rest of the year.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.151
So we do all of our infusions
and distillates more seasonally

00:33:19.151 --> 00:33:21.114
like a winery, and then
blend and batch them

00:33:21.114 --> 00:33:23.780
throughout the air so that we do
have that fresh-flavored vodka.

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:26.950
AUDIENCE: Where can you buy it?

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.660
That's the question.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.880
So Fog Point did
sell very quickly.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.290
It was so popular.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.340
It is sold out
almost everywhere.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.550
There is a shop located
at the distillery that

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.600
has a few bottles left.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.030
And as far as I know,
those are the last few.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.940
The good news is that with
Chris's help and our new fog

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.359
farm, we're working on another
expression of Fog Point.

00:33:46.359 --> 00:33:48.650
It will be a little bit
different than the current one.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.814
We're collecting fog
from a different area.

00:33:50.814 --> 00:33:53.230
So there may be a slightly
different flavor profile there.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.188
And we're exploring what
other types of wine we

00:33:55.188 --> 00:33:58.210
might be able to use as well.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.830
Any other questions, guys?

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.746
AUDIENCE: How much does the
standard fog catcher cost?

00:34:03.746 --> 00:34:05.620
CALEY SHOEMAKER: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.078
CHRIS FOGLIATTI:
Yeah, well, like I

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:11.260
said, the materials using the
FogQuest design like the one I

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.409
showed up at Sutro Tower,
they use an ABS post

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:15.400
system to hold them up.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.020
So it's relatively inexpensive.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.510
Around $300.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.969
And the academics
use steel posts.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.389
They're a little more expensive.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:26.320
Now that's not including
any measurement equipment.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.360
Usually the SFC array I showed
that Alicia had up here,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.940
it had tipping bucket
rain gauges on there

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.908
where they can
monitor in real time

00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:37.449
how much the water
is being produced.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:40.730
That adds another
$300 or $400 per unit.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.820
So it can get expensive.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:48.690
But the idea is that these
can be assembled by people

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.310
who have few resources.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.922
So it should be
relatively feasible.

00:34:52.922 --> 00:34:54.630
CALEY SHOEMAKER: As
I understand it, too,

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.670
once we've determined an area
is good for fog collection,

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.800
it's very easy to put in an
expensive fog collector there,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.120
because they know they're
going to get good fog.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.619
Right?

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:01.850
CHRIS FOGLIATTI: Yeah.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.830
The first step is to put
a smaller one up, test it,

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.540
verify, and then go larger.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.470
AUDIENCE: So speaking
about fog, and I

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.880
guess there's a certain
height of the fog.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.890
Like, it won't go past a
certain altitude or whatever.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.260
Is that taken into
consideration when you're

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.910
making the fog collectors?

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.700
Is there an optimal height of
the fog collector that you've

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.370
seen and the ones
that are produced,

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.460
being that maybe
if it's too tall,

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.440
it will evaporate
before it gets collected

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.660
or something like that?

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.118
CHRIS FOGLIATTI: Yeah, well,
certainly the fog collectors--

00:35:35.118 --> 00:35:37.545
both the standard fog
collectors and larger collection

00:35:37.545 --> 00:35:39.960
nets, it's important to
have them a couple of meters

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.407
off the ground, because
there's a boundary layer

00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:43.240
right on the ground.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.690
And there's a lot
of fluid dynamics

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.370
involved in fog collection.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.860
And the fluid
dynamics-- people say

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.850
that the closer to the
ground you get, the more poor

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.140
the performance is.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.530
So there's that question.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:01.210
And so they're usually about
2 meters off the ground.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:04.800
And this larger system we had,
it went to about three meters

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.180
up after that.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.930
And like I say, in order to
find the optimum elevation,

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.290
generally you don't try
and raise the fog net

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.097
up to the elevation, you try
and get the right height land,

00:36:17.097 --> 00:36:18.930
and then just put it
two or three meters up.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.720
Cause it's a lot easier
to construct than trying

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.950
to raise it really high up.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:27.030
But there are opportunities
to install fog collectors

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.250
on rooftops.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.480
But then those are much higher.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.460
But then you have another
fluid dynamic problem

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.680
where the fog hits the
building, and it kind of

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.220
shoots over the top.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.010
So we're involved
with fluid dynamics.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.830
People are trying to create a
spoiler or something that will

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.210
force the fog into the net.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:45.190
But that's a
problem that's going

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:49.384
to take several decades,
probably, to solve.

00:36:49.384 --> 00:36:50.550
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:54.990
How is the vodka affected,
if at all, by geographically

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.592
where the fog is collected?

00:36:56.592 --> 00:36:58.300
CALEY SHOEMAKER: That's
a great question.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.440
So for the Fog Point
that we tasted today,

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.430
we collected fog from
a couple of locations,

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.420
including Berkeley,
Tilden Park, Sutro Tower.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.840
And we had a few collectors
for a while in the Presidio.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.840
Because we were so
new to collecting fog,

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.590
and because we were collecting
such small amounts day by day,

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.540
we added them all
to the same tank.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.880
So the flavor
profile of the fog is

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.160
how I know the flavor
profile of the fog to be.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.870
And I never had the
opportunity to taste

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.245
the fog from
different collectors

00:37:26.245 --> 00:37:28.149
separately until just recently.

00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:29.940
I'm finding that the
water is very similar.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.130
But there definitely is a
little bit of shift from place

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.640
to place.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.440
I never thought I would
talk about fog terroir

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.565
at this point in my career.

00:37:35.565 --> 00:37:37.140
But, you know, it happened.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.840
So yes.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.155
The flavor difference
is very minor I'm

00:37:40.155 --> 00:37:41.280
finding here in California.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.821
But I'd be really interested to
see how fog water might taste

00:37:43.821 --> 00:37:45.660
different in
Guatemala or Morocco

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.674
than what we can get here
in northern California.

00:37:48.674 --> 00:37:50.340
AUDIENCE: So I wanted
to know if there's

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:55.110
a way for you to tell us
how long does it usually

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.400
takes before a new
flavor of vodka comes up.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.830
Or in this case, when you
develop the Fog one vodka,

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.380
how long did this whole
planning process happen

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.980
from beginning to the end?

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.688
CALEY SHOEMAKER: That's
a great question.

00:38:07.688 --> 00:38:10.110
So we do a lot of
experimentation

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.890
at the distillery.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.020
I often find myself going
to the farmer's market

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.550
and finding some really
awesome fruit or botanical

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.710
we want to play with.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.540
So there's always
this sort of research

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.290
new product development time
involved where we really

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.600
want to dial in
the vodka itself,

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.334
how delicious it's going to be.

00:38:26.334 --> 00:38:27.750
Once we get to
that point, there's

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.430
a lot of other things involved--

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.830
things like package design,
the federal government

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.970
has to approve our
labels, things like that.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.350
So it can take quite a while to
get all those things together

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.760
and to get the bottling
materials in and whatnot.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.790
But it does vary from
product to product.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.695
Some take a lot
less time to plan.

00:38:43.695 --> 00:38:45.570
Fog Point, unfortunately,
took quite a while,

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.880
because we had the lead time
to collect all this water.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.070
So it was kind of an
ongoing experiment for us

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.445
and a really
exciting day when we

00:38:51.445 --> 00:38:53.695
had the opportunity to
actually say, here's the vodka.

00:38:53.695 --> 00:38:54.207
Here it is.

00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:55.290
Go out and taste it, guys.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.700
AUDIENCE: So the question is,
what is your advice for someone

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.070
interested in becoming
a master distiller?

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.937
What education avenues
would you recommend?

00:39:07.937 --> 00:39:10.020
CALEY SHOEMAKER: That's a
really awesome question,

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.930
because I got into distilling
a little bit by mistake,

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.950
if you will.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.110
I'm very lucky that I
found my passion this way.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.620
I have an art degree.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.840
And it was during
a gap in employment

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.590
that I was looking for
something fun to do

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:25.500
and stumbled upon distilling.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.626
I was really into craft
beer, so it drove me there.

00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.500
But I never knew how
much I'd love distilling

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.980
and how interesting the
science of distilling would be.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.430
I'm hoping seeing more people
out doing things like growing

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:39.630
distilling wine-making drives
people towards STEM a little

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.120
bit more, because I think
understanding science

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.740
and engineering is
really helpful--

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.492
chemistry especially
as a distiller.

00:39:45.492 --> 00:39:46.950
But there is a lot
of art involved.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:50.010
So people from all walks of life
are involved in this industry.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.779
And there's a lot that folks
can contribute from anywhere.

00:39:53.779 --> 00:39:56.070
So I say if you're interested
in distilling or learning

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.470
to distill, just get
out there and learn.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.730
Read as much as you can.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.632
And involve yourself
in the industry.

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:03.090
Because you never
know when there's

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:07.606
going to be a job opportunity
and an opportunity to learn.

00:40:07.606 --> 00:40:08.480
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.130
CALEY SHOEMAKER:
Thank you, guys.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.930
SPEAKER 1: round of applause.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.221
