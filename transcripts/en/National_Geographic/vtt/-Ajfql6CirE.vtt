00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:05.305
( intro music )

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:20.687
( applause )

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.289 line:0%
Ken Edgett: I've been with
this project with the Rover

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.259 line:0%
since 2004
when we proposed the cameras

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.029
that take all these
beautiful color images.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.434
And... but my own story
goes back to

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.937
reading National Geographic
in the early 1970s,

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.139
and the coverage
of the Mariner missions

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.508
and the Voyager and Apollo.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:47.113
So, it's kinda trippy
to be standing here right now.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.615
<i> This is a landscape.</i>

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:51.751
<i> Mount Sharp you see
 to the upper left</i>

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.520
<i> rising out of the scene
 in that direction...</i>

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.855
<i> in the other direction,</i>

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.957
<i> you don't actually
 see it here, but we'll see it.</i>

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:01.460
<i> You'll see the wall of Gale,
 off further in the distance.</i>

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.431
<i>Mount Sharp is three miles high
 of layered sediment.</i>

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.701
The kinds of outcrops of rock
that we've been looking at

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.971
since we landed are more like
ankle and knee high.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.573
And some of them
are down underfoot like

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.008
the mudstone that we drill.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.144
By the way,
two years ago when we landed,

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.645
if you said the first thing
we drilled

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.580
was going to be a mudstone.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.316
And that,
we would find that it was

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:25.317
actually
habitable environment,

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:26.585
I wouldn't have believed you.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:29.689
So, this has been
an amazing two years.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.625
<i> You see, Curiosity carries
 its name on its arm,</i>

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.228
<i> it carries its name
 on its sleeve.</i>

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:38.063
And... what we are doing,

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:40.166
we are geologists
for the most part,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.702
and what we are doing is,
trying to read the history

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.104
of this place
in the layered rock.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.106
We call it stratigraphy.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:51.277
So basically, the oldest rocks
are at the bottom of the stack

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.945
and the youngest
are at the top,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.147
and so, if you go like,

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.748
to the Grand Canyon
in Arizona,

00:01:55.748 --> 00:02:00.153
for example or Letchworth,
I've been there many times.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.788
Older... younger.
So, what you see

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.491
<i> here behind me is one of these
 landscapes in a place</i>

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.626
<i> called Dingo Gap.</i>

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.294
<i> This was just
 a few months ago.</i>

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.729
<i> In the far distance
 you actually see</i>

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.499
<i> the north wall of Gale Crater.</i>

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.801
<i> So, we are trying to look
 at these rocks</i>

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.170
<i> with the rover and trying to
 understand the history</i>

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.039
<i> that they are telling us
 about this place.</i>

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.908
<i> Here's another place
 we call this one Shaler</i>

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:24.610
<i> and this is layered rocks,</i>

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.346
<i> laid down by moving water
 in a stream.</i>

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.915
<i> All of that orange-brown stuff
 you see,</i>

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:31.417
<i> that's the dust.</i>

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.053
<i> The rocks is
 the dark grey stuff.</i>

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:37.256
<i> Everything we've seen in Gale
 has been sedimentary rock</i>

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.958
<i> and it's been
 various shades of grey.</i>

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.660
<i> Here's another landscape again</i>

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.429
<i> in the direction
 we are driving.</i>

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.164
<i> Here you can actually see</i>

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:48.768
<i> the wall of Gale off
 in the far distance</i>

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.070
<i> and you see a little bit of
 Mount Sharp off</i>

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.939
<i> in this corner up here,</i>

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.308
<i> in front of us,
 right in the foreground</i>

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:58.310
<i> is a little drift of sand...
 windblown sand.</i>

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.579
<i> What we've been dealing
 with here is</i>

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.382
a very, very thin veneer of

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.119
windblown sand,
windblown dust,

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.855
and all those little pebbles
and cobbles you see,

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.424
that's just the detritus,
as this rock breaks down

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:15.528
and then wind carries it away.
This is a story of...

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.296
we are right there
by the bed rock,

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.032
it is right under our feet,
we can drive up to it,

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.567
we can read this history,

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:25.304
but we do have to deal with
this veneer of dust and sand,

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:28.007
and pebbles here and there.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.243
Wind erosion
is a big deal in Gale

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.611
in allowing us
to do our jobs.

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.013
<i> And if you look in the sort of</i>

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.282
<i> the bottom middle
 of this picture,</i>

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:40.386
<i> you see a little pebble
 and behind it is a protrusion</i>

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:43.422
<i> going back under the sand
 into the rock outcrop,</i>

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:45.024
<i> or into the rock face.</i>

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.527
<i> The little pebble
 and then this protrusion.</i>

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:50.797
<i> That pebble protected
 all that rock behind it</i>

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:55.133
<i> as wind blew sand
 and eroded that rock back</i>

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.269
<i> except where that pebble was.</i>

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.072
<i> That's like one of
 my favorite pictures</i>

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.373
<i> from this mission.</i>

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.641
<i> Now, here is a close up.</i>

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:06.112
<i> Like I said sedimentary rock,
 so this is bits of old rock.</i>

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.747
<i> So, think about
 the history here.</i>

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.182
There was rock on Mars.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:13.018
That rock broke apart,
made sand and pebbles

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.121
and cobbles and dust.

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:19.058
And then, that stuff was
transported by wind or water

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:21.160
and deposited in Gale.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.996
And then later,
it becomes rock,

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.131
okay, so sediment then
becomes rock

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:29.235
and then even later
the wind is eroding that,

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:32.238
leaving like that protrusion
with the pebble. Okay.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:35.741
<i> This is a picture of one of
 the conglomerates that we saw.</i>

00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.110
<i> This is a close up
 and you see a penny for scale,</i>

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.378
<i> so you get some idea...</i>

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:42.348
<i> these are actually
 very small pebbles,</i>

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.716
<i> something about
 the size of Lincoln's head...</i>

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.819
<i> that penny is also on Mars,</i>

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.187
<i> but not actually
 in this photo,</i>

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.724
<i> I photoshopped that in.
 To give you a sense of scale,</i>

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:54.760
<i> but that-- the rover carries
 that penny with it</i>

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.262
<i> and I love to use it
 for scale,</i>

00:04:57.262 --> 00:05:00.266
<i> because we are all
 familiar with that.</i>

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.868
<i> That was a Conglomerate.</i>

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.436
<i> Now I'm going to go to
 a finer grain sediment,</i>

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:07.272
<i> this is a sandstone. Okay?</i>

00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:10.943
<i> And what you are looking at
 is the sand is both,</i>

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:14.914
<i> the very dark grey mass
 that you see everywhere.</i>

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.682
<i> You can't actually see
 the individual grains</i>

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.150
<i> because they are actually
 smaller than</i>

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.486
<i> the camera was resolving here.</i>

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.021
<i> And then you see
 little protrusions</i>

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:26.659
<i> which are larger sand grains
 set in that finer sand.</i>

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.794
<i> Those protrusions are there
 because of wind erosion,</i>

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:31.297
<i> those are resisting
 the blasting by the sand,</i>

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.065
<i> so they stick out.</i>

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.334
<i> But then at the bottom
 you see a void,</i>

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:38.938
<i> you see out of focus
 dirt in the background...</i>

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:41.073
<i> because this is a layer,</i>

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:44.877
<i> it's forming a shelf overhang
 and the layer beneath it</i>

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.580
<i> retreated back out of view,
 you can't see it.</i>

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.048
<i> Now, everything
 you see in this picture</i>

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:52.284
<i> that looks kind of brownish
 or reddish</i>

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:54.220
<i> is just dust
 sitting on the rock.</i>

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.822
<i> This rock is dark grey.</i>

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:58.424
<i> Next slide shows</i>

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:01.627
<i> the finest grain
 sedimentary rock we've seen</i>

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.495
<i> which is this mudstone</i>

00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:05.732
<i> and the penny here
 is for scale again</i>

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.233
<i> and you see an area
 that the rover brushed,</i>

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:10.002
<i> it has a little wire brush.</i>

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.136
<i> We don't use it often,</i>

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.139
<i> but when we do it,
 it does a good job.</i>

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.507
<i> Now, let's look at that
 close up. Okay?</i>

00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:18.310
<i> The camera on the arm
 can get right down</i>

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.479
<i> literally within an inch or so</i>

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.514
<i> and we can take these
 close up views.</i>

00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:24.816
<i> Here now,
 you actually see grooves cut</i>

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:26.452
<i> into the rock by the brush.</i>

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:29.421
<i> So, this rock is not
 really, really hard,</i>

00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:32.324
<i> it actually can get
 little grooves from the wire,</i>

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:34.660
<i> as it, the wire brush
 as it moves.</i>

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.029
<i> And you see some of the dust
 that is sort of generated</i>

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.697
<i> as it swirls that up.</i>

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.299
<i> But when we look
 at the rock itself,</i>

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.201
<i> ignore the dust,
 ignore the groove,</i>

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.336
<i> we find that the grains
 are too small</i>

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:45.872
<i> to see... with this camera.</i>

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.673
<i> And this is one of highest
 resolution images</i>

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:50.575
<i> ever taken outside
 of a microscope,</i>

00:06:50.575 --> 00:06:53.379
<i> you know, on board
 the Phoenix Lander,</i>

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.448
<i> this is one of the highest,
 right down there</i>

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.716
<i> with this camera
 and we can't see the grains.</i>

00:06:57.716 --> 00:07:01.653
<i> So, they are
 very, very fine grains.</i>

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:03.989
So, let me talk briefly about
some of the other tools.

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:05.191
You've seen a lot of pictures.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:08.360
You get a sense that
we can do a lot with pictures.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.897
But we also want to know about
the chemistry of the rocks

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:14.566
and the minerals
that make up the rocks.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:17.769
<i> This is the arm, it's that
 the white thing sticking down</i>

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.873
<i> and then the turret
 and the shadow underneath it,</i>

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:24.310
<i> you see a little box,
 called the APXS.</i>

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.247
<i> That is a science instrument
 that is using X-rays and</i>

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:31.116
<i> it is measuring the chemistry
 of the rock there.</i>

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:33.051
<i> So, that is one of our tools.</i>

00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:34.853
<i> Here now is
 another brushed spot.</i>

00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:36.989
<i> This was just
 at the end of April.</i>

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.425
<i> This was a sandstone...</i>

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.327
<i> and remember the penny
 in the brushed spot.</i>

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.962
<i> So, it is like three, or
 four, five pennies across,</i>

00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:47.900
<i> but you see an array of dots
 going through that,</i>

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.870
<i> those were formed
 by a laser beam,</i>

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.739
<i> zapping the rock
 at each one of those spots.</i>

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:57.476
<i> Multiple times,
 at each spot... okay?</i>

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.345
<i> And then the instrument
 observes</i>

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:00.913
<i> the light
 that comes off of that</i>

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:03.349
<i> as it zaps it and it can
 tell you something about</i>

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.251
<i> the chemistry of the rock
 that way.</i>

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:08.620
<i> Later in May,
 we actually drilled this rock.</i>

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.189
<i> But here is
 our very first drill hole.</i>

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:14.626
<i> The diameter is
 16 millimeters.</i>

00:08:14.626 --> 00:08:17.096
<i> One-six millimeters, I don't
 know what is a millimeter.</i>

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:22.468
<i> Well, a Roosevelt dime,
 a US dime is 17 millimeters.</i>

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:26.138
<i> So, this is one millimeter
 smaller than a dime.</i>

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:27.807
<i> This is the stuff
 that if you told me</i>

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:29.708
<i> this was going to be
 first thing we drilled,</i>

00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:31.310
<i> you know, before we landed,</i>

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.245
<i> I didn't even know that
 we would land, right?</i>

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:35.981
<i> It... it... ( laughter )</i>

00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:37.883
<i> You see
 the grey mudstone there,</i>

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:40.019
<i> you also see this
 white lightning bolt.</i>

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.722
<i> That is... there was a crack
 in that rock</i>

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:45.758
<i> at some point in its history
 and minerals filled that...</i>

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.560
<i> sulphur and calcium
 bearing minerals</i>

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.794
<i> filled that vein.</i>

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:51.397
<i> Getting a picture like this
 allows us</i>

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:54.199
<i> to get a sense of what did
 we actually drill through.</i>

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:57.136
Then that sample
is put into instruments

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.438
that are inside
the rover's body.

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.406
One to find out
what the minerals are

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:03.542
and one to find out
what the chemistry is.

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.311
I just want to leave you
with this

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.579
because
this is why we do this.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:11.416
It's really for
understanding our home and

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:15.655
<i> so what you are seeing is
 the rim of Gale after sunset,</i>

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:18.723
<i> and there's a bright dot
 in the sky. That's Earth.</i>

00:09:18.723 --> 00:09:20.459
<i> And if you look up
 at the little blow up,</i>

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.294
<i> you actually see
 there are two dots.</i>

00:09:22.294 --> 00:09:26.364
<i> The bright one is Earth,
 the fainter one is the moon.</i>

00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:28.734
<i> You can see these from Mars.</i>

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:33.806
And we study this stuff
to understand our home planet.

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:37.610
Just as much,
because of our curiosity.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.777
Thank you.

00:09:38.777 --> 00:09:40.079
( applause )

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:46.652
( outro music )
