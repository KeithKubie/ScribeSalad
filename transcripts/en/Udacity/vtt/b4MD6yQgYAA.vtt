00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A final question we've had is about project management and keeping your code

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
somewhat manageable and not into a crazy ball.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Sure, sure.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The code I've been writing--ASCII Chan and whatnot--actually resembles a crazy ball,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is fine when you're starting out, but as your project starts to grow,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
yes, you need to add some more organization.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I generally have a directory with all my templates in it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I have another directory that'll have all my static files--my CSS, my JavaScript.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In this class, I've given you the little bit of CSS that we've used.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Then the rest of the Python files, I generally have one main file that is my controller.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's basically the URL mapping and then the classes that those URLs map to,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
what their basic handler is.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I try to put all of the database stuff in a separate files.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If I have a datatype for--in ASCII chan we have a datatype for art.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That would be in its own file that has a functions related to art.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I generally have a utilities file that has things like generating random strings

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and creating hash values and secure values and all that stuff you're going

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to see in the next lecture.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Just like when you're organizing any large programming project,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
pulling things apart. It's easy to pull things apart into separate files.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Sometimes you get some weird dependency issues with tricky imports--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
one file depend another, depends on the same file.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That generally means you did something wrong.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But you'll kind of learn over time how to structure things so it makes sense.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Lots of files is good. It keeps things clean. It keeps each file sane.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You know where to look for things and that sort of problem.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In the class, however, I've been working in the same file so you can see it all in one place,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but if the projects were getting much bigger than what I was working on now,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I would and I would encourage you as well to start separating things out

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and organizing them a little bit better.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay. I think that's about all the questions we have for this time.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Is there anything else you want to add on at the end?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Just a quick thank you to everybody in the forums who has been helping us out,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
explaining things. I know the permalink thing was tricky for a lot of you.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
A lot of that is my fault so those of you who figured it out or already knew

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
what I was getting at, thank you very much for explaining that. It's been really helpful.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And thank you, Sean, for hanging out in the forums and keeping things going smoothly.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It's really helpful. This is my first time teaching a class.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm kind of learning along with you guys what works and what doesn't.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I think we're starting to trend in the right direction.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's been pretty fun so far, and I think you'll enjoy Unit 4. That was one of my favorites.
