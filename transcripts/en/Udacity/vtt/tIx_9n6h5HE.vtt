00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.782
Now along the way,
you're going to run into bugs.

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:09.020
And these little critters are dead
set on breaking your app.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.900
And much like cockroaches in Florida,
there's just no avoiding them.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.410
There's going to be times in this
development process where your

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.760
code isn't going to work, and
you're not going to have any idea why.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.170
And you're going to get
incredibly frustrated, and

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.890
you might even want to throw
your computer out the window.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.180
Don't do that, seriously.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.159
One tiny bug is not worth
thousands of dollars.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.640
When I'm in these situations, I find
the best thing is to just walk away.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.030
I mean, not forever, just for
like a few hours, or

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.618
maybe even a day, but
I go do something else.

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:46.600
I watch TV, or
I grab a drink with a friend, or go for

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.800
a run, or something to clear my mind and
take a mental break.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.330
And I find that when I come back,
it's a lot easier to both find and

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.255
solve the problem that
I was having before.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.980
Now, that's not the only way to deal
with these types of situations.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.600
Let's go check back in with our pros and
see their advice for

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.040
dealing with bugs and
other issues in code.
