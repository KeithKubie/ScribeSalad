00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.153
- [Voiceover] So in
the last couple videos,

00:00:02.153 --> 00:00:03.557
I talked about partial derivatives

00:00:03.557 --> 00:00:05.047
of multivariable functions.

00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:08.125
And here, I want to talk about
second partial derivatives.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.172
So I'm gonna write some kind
of multivariable function.

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:11.157
Let's say it's

00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:14.880
well, sine of x times y squared.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.414
Sine of x multiplied by y squared.

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.124
And if you take the partial derivative,

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.193
you have two options, given
that there's two variables.

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:23.455
You can go one way

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:25.804
and say what's the partial derivative?

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:29.091
Partial derivative of f with respect to x.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:30.866
And what you do for that,

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.339
x looks like a variable

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.416
as far as this direction is concerned.

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:35.714
Y looks like a constant.

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:38.532
So we differentiate this by saying

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:41.605
the derivative of sine of x is cosine x.

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:44.020
You know, you're differentiating
with respect to x.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.487
And then that looks like it's
multiplied by a constant.

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:49.649
So you just continue
multiplying that by a constant.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.207
But you could also go another direction.

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:52.917
You could also say, you know,

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:55.779
what's the partial
derivative with respect to y?

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:59.160
And in that case, you're
considering y to be the variable.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.435
So here it looks at y.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.045
And says y squared looks like a variable.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:03.652
X looks like a constant.

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:05.565
Sine of x then just looks
like sine of a constant,

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.980
which is a constant.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.449
So that will be that constant, sine of x,

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:12.966
multiplied by the derivative of y squared.

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.747
Which is gonna be two times y.

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:17.197
Two times y.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:19.681
And these are what you might call

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.855
first partial derivatives.

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:24.283
And there's some alternate
notation here, df dy.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.665
You could also say f and
then a little subscript y.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.221
And over here, similarly,

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.595
you'd say f with a little subscript x.

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:33.405
Now each of these two functions,

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.127
these two partial derivatives that you get

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.116
are also multivariable functions.

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:39.197
They take in two variables
and they output a scalar.

00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:41.093
So we can do something very similar,

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:43.118
where here you might then apply

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:46.316
the partial derivative with respect to x

00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:49.819
to that partial derivative
of your original function

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.150
with respect to x, right.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.569
It's just like a second
derivative in ordinary calculus,

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:56.963
but this time we're doing it partial.

00:01:56.963 --> 00:01:58.611
So when you do it with respect to x,

00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:01.289
cosine x looks like cosine of a variable.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.267
The derivative of which is negative sine

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:06.504
times that variable.

00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:09.415
And y squared here just
looks like a constant.

00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:11.648
So it just stays constant at y squared.

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:13.820
And, similary, you could go down

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.604
a different branch of options here.

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:17.698
And say what if you did
your partial derivative

00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:19.646
with respect to y?

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:20.866
Of that whole function,

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:24.339
which itself is a partial
derivative with respect to x.

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.714
And if you did that,

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:31.551
then y squared now
looks like the variable.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.395
So you're gonna take
the derivative of that,

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:34.987
which is two y.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:36.201
Two y.

00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:38.402
And then what's in front of
it just looks like a constant

00:02:38.402 --> 00:02:41.798
as far as the variable y is concerned.

00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:43.709
So that stays as cosine of x.

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.553
And the notation here.

00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:49.107
First of all, just as in
single-variable calculus,

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:52.407
it's common to kind of
do a abusive notation

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:53.343
with this kind of thing

00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:56.238
and write partial squared of f

00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:01.184
divided by partial x squared.

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:03.845
And this always, I don't know.

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:05.079
When I first learned about these things,

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:05.925
they always threw me off

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.910
because here, this Leibniz notation,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.547
you have the great intution of, you know,

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:11.013
nudging the x and nudging the f.

00:03:11.013 --> 00:03:13.267
But you kind of lose
that when you do this.

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:15.608
But it makes sense if you think of this

00:03:15.608 --> 00:03:17.635
partial, partial x as being an operator

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.409
and you're just applying it twice.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.073
And over here, the way
that that would look,

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:22.331
it's a little bit funny.

00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:25.014
Because you still have that
partial squared f on top.

00:03:25.014 --> 00:03:26.357
But then on the bottom,

00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:30.987
you write partial y, partial x.

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:32.806
And, you know, I'm putting
them in these order

00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:35.061
just because it's as if I
wrote it that way, right.

00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:37.247
This reflects the fact that
first I did the x derivative.

00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:39.414
Then I did the y derivative.

00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:41.506
And you could do this on this side also.

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:42.842
And this might feel tedious,

00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:44.607
but it's actually kind of worth doing

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:46.695
for a result that we end up seeing here

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:49.795
that I find a little bit
surprising, actually.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:51.885
So here, if we go down the path

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:54.717
of doing, in this case,
like a partial derivative

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:56.145
with respect to x.

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:57.244
And, you know, you're thinking of this

00:03:57.244 --> 00:03:59.715
as being applied to your
original partial derivative

00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:00.941
with respect to y.

00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:04.923
It looks here, it says sine
of x looks like a variable.

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:06.545
Two y looks like a constant.

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:07.923
So what we end up getting

00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:11.023
is derivative of sine of x, cosine x.

00:04:13.063 --> 00:04:14.730
Multiplied by that two y.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.251
And a pretty cool thing
worth pointing out here

00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:23.380
that maybe you take it for granted.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.832
Maybe you think it's as surprising

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:26.148
as I did when I first saw it.

00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:28.493
Both of these turn out to be equal, right.

00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:30.002
Even though it was a very different way

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:30.813
that we got there, right?

00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:32.757
You first take the partial
derivative with respect to x

00:04:32.757 --> 00:04:34.423
and you get cosine x, y squared.

00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:36.920
Which looks very different
from sine x, two y.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.503
And then when you take the derivative

00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:40.011
with respect to y,

00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.758
you know, you get a certain value.

00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:44.582
And when you go down the other path,

00:04:44.582 --> 00:04:46.526
you also get that same value.

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:48.151
And maybe the way that you write this

00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:50.139
is that you'd say

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.952
Let me just copy this guy over here.

00:04:54.342 --> 00:04:57.022
And what you might say is that

00:04:59.622 --> 00:05:01.214
the partial derivative of f.

00:05:01.214 --> 00:05:02.592
When you do it the other way around,

00:05:02.592 --> 00:05:04.367
when instead of doing x and then y,

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:08.329
you do y and then x.

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:09.618
Partial x.

00:05:09.618 --> 00:05:11.390
That these guys are equal to each other.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.252
And that's a pretty cool result.

00:05:14.202 --> 00:05:15.595
And maybe in this case,

00:05:15.595 --> 00:05:17.372
given that the original function

00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:18.895
just looks like the product of two things,

00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:20.776
you can kind of resaon
through why it's the case.

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:24.366
But what's surprising is that
this turns out to be true

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.092
for, I mean, not all functions.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.155
There's actually a certain criterion.

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:29.589
There's a special theorem,

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.864
it's called Schwarz's theorem.

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:36.145
Where if the second partial derivatives

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:38.405
of your function are continuous
at the relevant point,

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.289
that's the circumstance
for this being true.

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.095
But for all intents and purposes,

00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:43.975
the kind of functions you
can expect to run into,

00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:45.464
this is the case.

00:05:45.464 --> 00:05:48.357
This order of partial
derivatives doesn't matter.

00:05:48.357 --> 00:05:50.344
Truth turns out to hold.

00:05:50.344 --> 00:05:51.866
Which is actually pretty cool.

00:05:51.866 --> 00:05:53.424
And I'd encourage you to play around

00:05:53.424 --> 00:05:54.353
with some other functions.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.168
Just come up with any
multivariable function,

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:57.383
maybe a little bit more complicated

00:05:57.383 --> 00:06:00.127
than just multiplying two
separate things there,

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:01.669
and see that it's true.

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:02.913
And maybe try to convince yourself

00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:04.394
why it's true in certain cases.

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:07.059
I think that ought to actually
be a really good exercise.

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:08.481
And just before I go,

00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:10.169
one thing that I should probably mention,

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.116
a bit of notation that
people will commonly use.

00:06:14.116 --> 00:06:15.757
With the second partial derivative,

00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:17.485
sometimes instead of saying

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:19.793
partial squared f, partial x squared,

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:22.894
they'll just write it as
partial and then x, x.

00:06:22.894 --> 00:06:25.696
And over here, this would be partial.

00:06:25.696 --> 00:06:27.597
Let's see, first you
did it with x, then y.

00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:30.045
So over here you do it first x and then y.

00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:31.418
Kind of the order of these reverses.

00:06:31.418 --> 00:06:32.800
Because you're reading left to right.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.909
But when you do it with this,

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.225
you're kind of reading right to left

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:36.479
for how you multiply it in.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.593
Which would mean that this guy,

00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:40.349
let's see, this guy over here.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.721
Now he would be partial.

00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:42.960
First you did the y,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.211
and then you did the x.

00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:47.816
So those two guys are
just different notations

00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:48.896
for the same thing.

00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:50.666
I mean, that can make it a
little bit more convenient

00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:52.320
when you don't want to write out

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.932
the entire partial squared f
divided by partial x squared

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:57.684
or things like that.

00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:01.324
And with that, I'll call it an end.
