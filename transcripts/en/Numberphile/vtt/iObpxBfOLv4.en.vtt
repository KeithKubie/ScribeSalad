00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
You can try many many other variations

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.430
depending on where to put the rubber bands, and also using more paperclips.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.480
Let me show you one or two examples.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.680
We have tried the position No. 1 or position No. 2,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.360
but one position that we have never tried-

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.880
This is quite interesting, rubber band in the middle,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.090
and it has to stay on the paper

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.140
and you can put the paperclips and see what happens.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.480
Rubber band now in the middle here and paperclips at the top.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.890
So, now what's going to happen when I pull...

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.190
This is what happens. So rubber band is hanging from the paper but it's ok.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.060
but those 2 paperclips got linked against each other,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.280
but each one of them is linked with the rubber band.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.460
So, they're all 3, if you like 3 circles meeting in the middle and any 2 of them being linked.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.840
- [Not Borromean?]
- It's not Borromean, because...

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.300
even if I make, for example, the rubber band disappear

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.280
the 2 paperclips are still linked, and so on...

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.100
You can probably guess at this stage, what's going to happen

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.720
if I put the rubber band in the same position

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.590
that one paperclip at the top, but the other paperclip at the bottom,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.760
so paperclips are on the wrong side of each other.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.930
So, now what's going to happen when I pull...

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.060
Do you have a guess? Interesting, let's try this.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.520
That's interesting, it looks like the previous one.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.050
But this time,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.680
each paperclips is linked to the rubber band, but not between themselves.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.090
Let's finish with something that is 'work in progress'.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.300
So far, we have been linking paperclips together,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.720
and sometimes we refer this as "addition".

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.940
I mean those 2 paperclips coming together, so it's like adding.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.660
What about subtracting?

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.240
By which I mean, can we start from 2 paperclips that are linked already

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.760
and slotting them in some configuration on the bent paper,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.840
Can you take them apart?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.910
Now, I've tried many many different possibilities,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.160
and it turns out that this time the orientation matters.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.940
You know, you can link paperclips in many many different ways.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.160
For example, you can link them here,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.030
or you can link them, for example, here,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.560
or you can link them here, and so on.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.480
So the position matters, and also,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.780
you know, you can link them like this,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.580
or you can turn the paperclip around and you can link them like this.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.830
It's very very confusing.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.680
So, let's try to link them here,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.140
and see how we fare.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.750
It turns out that this kind of link will end up tearing the paper,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.980
and it just distorting the paperclips and it ends up in disaster,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.820
or so I think, because, you see, I haven't done many times so...

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.760
I have to be very careful each time.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.680
But if I change the orientation of the paperclips,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.750
and put them in this configuration, that's the right configuration.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.740
You may not see much of a difference, but the key is how those are linked at the top.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.360
Let's do it very very carefully.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.540
Those 2 paperclips are already linked.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.320
I bend the paper in that standard position,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.100
but I slot the paperclip here and here,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.830
by allowing this linked pair to straddle over the paper like so, here

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.380
and here like this, okay.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.640
And then I slot them very carefully.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.220
And here is the preparation; paperclips were linked.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.690
Now I pull the ends, and...

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.770
hopefully this works, if it doesn't, we'll be very sad, and something... some disaster happens.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.500
OK let's see, will it be able to do it?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.660
They came apart, so we can now subtract.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.520
- [You like that, don't you?]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah that's very nice.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.850
Because you can make them come apart, yeah, yeah...

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.920
[from Part One]: â€”computation, or calculation in general.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.360
We always think naturally, because that's how we learn these things in school

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.700
and about numbers - calculating with numbers - or, perhaps, at a more advanced level

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.860
calculating with formulas.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.040
And, you know, you do some algorithm, you do some recipe, and then the expected results come out.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.200
But here, your brain, although it hasn't formalized anything,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.960
- you know, it hasn't written any numbers or formulas - has, effectively, computed.
