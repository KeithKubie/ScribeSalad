00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
Hello, learned and astonishingly attractive
pupils. My name is John Green and I want to

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.130
welcome you to Crash Course World History.
Over the next forty weeks together, we will

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.790
learn how in a mere fifteen thousand years
humans went from hunting and gathering...

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.269
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Is this gonna be on
the test?

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.180
Yeah, about the test: The test will measure
whether you are an informed, engaged, and

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.100
productive citizen of the world, and it will
take place in schools and bars and hospitals

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.910
and dorm-rooms and in places of worship. You
will be tested on first dates; in job interviews;

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.590
while watching football; and while scrolling
through your Twitter feed.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.239
The test will judge your ability to think
about things other than celebrity marriages;

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.039
whether you'll be easily persuaded by empty
political rhetoric; and whether you'll be

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.499
able to place your life and your community
in a broader context.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.859
The test will last your entire life, and it
will be comprised of the millions of decisions

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.999
that, when taken together, make your life
yours. And everything — everything — will

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.320
be on it. I know, right? So pay attention.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.120
[theme music]

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.020
In a mere fifteen thousand years, humans went
from hunting and gathering to creating such

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.770
improbabilities as the airplane, the Internet,
and the ninety-nine cent double cheeseburger.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.550
It's an extraordinary journey, one that I
will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.290
of my own ... over to camera two.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.460
Hi there, camera two ... it's me, John Green.
Let's start with that double cheeseburger.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.540
Ooh, food photography! So this hot hunk of
meat contains four-hundred and ninety calories.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.330
To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed,
raise, and slaughter cows, then grind their

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.420
meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination;
you also gotta grow some wheat and then process

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.910
the living crap out of it until it's whiter
than Queen Elizabeth the First; then you gotta

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.500
milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese.
And that's not even to mention the growing

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.640
and pickling of cucumbers or the sweetening
of tomatoes or the grinding of mustard seeds, etc.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.420
How in the sweet name of everything holy did
we ever come to live in a world in which such

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.950
a thing can even be created? And HOW is it
possible that those four-hundred and ninety

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.120
calories can be served to me for an amount
of money that, if I make the minimum wage

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.320
here in the U.S., I can earn in ELEVEN MINUTES?
And most importantly: should I be delighted

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.020
or alarmed to live in this strange world of
relative abundance?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.210
Well, to answer that question we're not going
to be able to look strictly at history, because

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.890
there isn't a written record about a lot of
these things. But thanks to archaeology and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.110
paleobiology, we CAN look deep into the past.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.630
So fifteen thousand years ago, humans were
foragers and hunters. Foraging meant gathering

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.530
fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses;
hunting allowed for a more protein-rich diet

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.520
... so long as you could find something with
meat to kill. By far the best hunting gig

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.530
in the pre-historic world incidentally was
fishing, which is one of the reasons that

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.970
if you look at history of people populating
the planet, we tended to run for the shore

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.340
and then stay there. Marine life was:
A) abundant, and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.450
B) relatively unlikely to eat you.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.060
While we tend to think that the life of foragers
were nasty, brutish and short, fossil evidence

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.720
suggests that they actually had it pretty
good: their bones and teeth are healthier

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.819
than those of agriculturalists. And anthropologists
who have studied the remaining forager peoples

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.780
have noted that they actually spend a lot
fewer hours working than the rest of us and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.000
they spend more time on art, music, and storytelling.
Also if you believe the classic of anthropology, NISA,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.819
they also have a lot more time for skoodilypooping.
What? I call it skoodilypooping. I'm not gonna apologize.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.430
It's worth noting that cultivation of crops
seems to have risen independently over the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.790
course of milennia in a number of places ... from
Africa to China to the Americas ... using

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.209
crops that naturally grew nearby: rice in
Southeast Asia, maize in in Mexico, potatoes

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.720
in the Andes, wheat in the Fertile Crescent,
yams in West Africa. People around the world

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.069
began to abandon their foraging for agriculture.
And since so many communities made this choice

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.980
independently, it must have been a good choice
... right? Even though it meant less music

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.500
and skoodilypooping. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.180
All right, to answer that question, let's take a look
at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.300
Advantage: Controllable food supply. You might
have droughts or floods, but if you're growing

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.360
the crops and breeding them to be hardier,
you have a better chance of not starving.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.569
Disadvantage: In order to keep feeding people
as the population grows you have to radically

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.440
change the environment of the planet.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.849
Advantage: Especially if you grow grain, you
can create a food surplus, which makes cities

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.910
possible and also the specialization of labor.
Like, in the days before agriculture, EVERYBODY'S

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.560
job was foraging, and it took about a thousand
calories of work to create a thousand calories

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.090
of food ... and it was impossible to create
large population centers.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.660
But, if you have a surplus agriculture can
support people not directly involved in the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.820
production of food. Like, for instance, tradespeople,
who can devote their lives to better farming

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.120
equipment which in turn makes it easier to
produce more food more efficiently which in

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.300
time makes it possible for a corporation to turn a
profit on this ninety-nine cent double cheeseburger.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.640
Which is delicious, by the way. It's actually
terrible. And it's very cold. And I wish I

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.860
had not eaten it. I mean, can we just compare
what I was promised to what I was delivered?

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.420
Yeah, thank you. Yeah, this is not that.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.240
Some would say that large and complex agricultural
communities that can support cities and eventually

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.210
inexpensive meat sandwiches are not necessarily
beneficial to the planet or even to its human

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.950
inhabitants. Although that's a bit of a tough
argument to make, coming to you as I am in

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.480
a series of ones and zeros.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.200
ADVANTAGE: Agriculture can be practiced all
over the world, although in some cases it

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.570
takes extensive manipulation of the environment,
like y'know irrigation, controlled flooding,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.100
terracing, that kind of thing.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.840
DISADVANTAGE: Farming is hard. So hard in
fact that one is tempted to claim ownership

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.750
over other humans and then have them till
the land on your behalf, which is the kind

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.669
of non-ideal social order that tends to be
associated with agricultural communities.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:29.870
So why did agriculture happen?

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.660
Wait, I haven't talked about herders. Herders,
man! Always getting the short end of the stick.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.880
Herding is a really good and interesting alternative
to foraging and agriculture. You domesticate

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.820
some animals and then you take them on the
road with you. The advantages of herding are

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.190
obvious. First, you get to be a cowboy. Also,
animals provide meat and milk, but they also

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.300
help out with shelter because they can provide
wool and leather.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.860
The downside is that you have to move around
a lot because your herd always needs new grass,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.240
which makes it hard to build cities, unless
you are the Mongols. [music, horse hooves]

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.570
By the way, over the next forty weeks you
will frequently hear generalizations, followed

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.990
by "unless you are the Mongols" [music, hooves].

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.020
But anyway one of the main reasons herding
only caught on in certain parts of the world

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.729
is that there aren't that many animals that
lend themselves to domestication. Like, you

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.770
have sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, horses, camels,
donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, all

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.320
of which have something in common. They aren't
native to the Americas. The only halfway useful

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.180
herding animal native to the Americas is the
llama. No, not that Lama, two l's. Yes, that llama.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.380
Most animals just don't work for domestication.
Like hippos are large, which means they provide

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.509
lots of meat, but unfortunately, they like
to eat people. Zebras are too ornery. Grizzlies

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:45.460
have wild hearts that can't be broken. Elephants
are awesome, but they take way too long to

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.530
breed. Which reminds me! It's time for the
Open Letter.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.460
Elegant. But first, let's see what the Secret
Compartment has for me today. Oh! It's another

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.200
double cheeseburger. Thanks, Secret Compartment.
Just kidding, I don't thank you for this.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.980
An Open Letter to elephants.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.479
Hey elephants, You're so cute and smart and awesome.
Why you gotta be pregnant for 22 months? That's

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.150
crazy! And then you only have one kid. If
you were more like cows, you might have taken

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:21.090
us over by now. Little did you know, but the greatest
evolutionary advantage: being useful to humans.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:27.180
Like here is a graph of cow population, and
here is a graph of elephant population. Elephants,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.639
if you had just inserted yourself into human
life the way cows did, you could have used

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:35.479
your power and intelligence to form secret
elephant societies, conspiring against the

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.060
humans! And then you could have risen up,
and destroyed us, and made an awesome elephant

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.580
world with elephant cars, and elephant planes!

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.440
It would have been so great! But noooo! You
gotta be pregnant for 22 months and then have

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.440
just one kid. It's so annoying!

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.000
Best wishes, John Green.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.700
Right, but back to the agricultural revolution
and why it occurred. Historians don't know

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.630
for sure, of course, because there are no
written records. But, they love to make guesses.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.910
Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture
even though it was more work, or abundance

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.270
gave people leisure to experiment with domestication
or planting originated as a fertility rite

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.980
- or as some historians have argued - people needed
to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.830
Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists,
believed agriculture was an accident, saying,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.289
"a wild and unusually good variety of native
plant might attract the attention of some

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:28.190
wise old savage." Off topic, but you will
note in the coming weeks that the definition

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.070
of "savage" tends to be be "not me."

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.500
Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't
really an agricultural revolution at all,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.870
but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary
desire to eat more. Like early hunter gatherers

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.120
knew that seeds germinate when planted. And,
when you find something that makes food, you

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.899
want to do more of it. Unless it's this food.
Then you want to do less of it. I kinda want

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:55.130
to spit it out. Eww. Ah, that's much better.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.890
So early farmers would find the most accessible
forms of wheat and plant them and experiment

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.270
with them not because they were trying to
start an agricultural revolution, because

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.880
they were like, you know what would be awesome:
MORE food!

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.870
Like on this topic, we have evidence that
more than 13,000 years ago humans in southern

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.830
Greece were domesticating snails. In the Franchthi
Cave, there's a huge pile of snail shells,

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.800
most of them are larger than current snails,
suggesting that the people who ate them were

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.950
selectively breeding them to be bigger and
more nutritious.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.660
Snails make excellent domesticated food sources,
by the way because

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.160
A) surprisingly caloric
B) they're easy to carry since they come with

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.680
their own suitcases, and
C) to imprison them you just have to scratch

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.780
a ditch around their living quarters.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.120
That's not really a revolution, that's just
people trying to increase available calories.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.900
But one non-revolution leads to another, and
pretty soon you have this, as far as the eye can see.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.780
Many historians also argue that without agriculture
we wouldn't have all the bad things that come

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:49.120
with complex civilizations like patriarchy,
inequality, war, and unfortunately, famine.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.470
And, as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture
has been a big loser. Without it, humans never

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.339
would have changed the environment so much,
building dams, and clearing forests, and more

00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:01.230
recently, drilling for oil that we can turn
into fertilizer.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.170
Many people made the choice for agriculture
independently, but does that mean it was the

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:10.130
right choice? Maybe so, and maybe not, but,
regardless, we can't unmake that choice. And

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.740
that's one of the reasons I think it's so
important to study history.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.570
History reminds us that revolutions are not
events so much as they are processes; that

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.300
for tens of thousands of years people have
been making decisions that irrevocably shaped

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.060
the world that we live in today. Just as today
we are making subtle, irrevocable decisions

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.320
that people of the future will remember as
revolutions.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.490
Next week we're going to journey to the Indus
River Valley - whoa - very fragile, our globe,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:39.370
like the real globe. We're going to travel
to the Indus River Valley. I'll see you then.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.750
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.910
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself, and our

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.750
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.500
If you want to guess at the phrase of the
week, you can do so in comments. You can also

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.959
suggest future phrases of the week. And if
you have a question about today's video, please

00:10:55.959 --> 00:11:00.499
leave it comments where our team of semi-professional
quasi-historians will aim to answer it.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.980
Thanks for watching, and as we say in my hometown,
Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
