00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.050
MARTIN OMANDER: Hi, my
name is Martin Omander,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.560
and I welcome you to
"Google Root Access,"

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.190
the show featuring
actionable startup advice.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.940
My guest today,
like last episode,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.550
is Nelson Pereira, co-founder
of the startup TOP Docs.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.570
Welcome to the
show, and would you

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.915
tell us a bit about
what TOP docs does?

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:23.040
NELSON PEREIRA: Hi, Martin.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.060
Thank you for having me.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.290
TOP Docs is a cross-format and
cross-platform document editor,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.910
allowing people from
different clouds

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.550
to collaborate on Microsoft
Office documents, Open

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.374
Office, and Google Docs.

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:38.290
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.630
So in the last
episode, we talked

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.220
about business
challenges and strategy.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.080
Today, let's talk a bit
about the technology.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.520
You are using the APIs of
several cloud providers,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.310
like the Google Drive
API, I understand?

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.310
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.490
Because when we started
to build this product,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.740
one of the main
challenges was, OK, we

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.370
need to have a tool to
synchronize all the documents

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.590
across the devices and store in
the cloud, backup, and so on.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.040
So instead of creating
our own back-end,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.960
all these features--
it would take

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.810
ages to build-- we
looked at Google Drive

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.840
and started to
build on top of it.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.110
Because it addresses
a lot of features,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.210
like syncing, backing
up, provisioning,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.450
backup in the cloud.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.980
All the goodies
are there already,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.730
so we don't need
to build anything.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.330
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, so you can
just use that cloud storage,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.450
all those features
you mentioned?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.530
You don't have to
build them yourself.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.010
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.440
Exactly.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.356
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:36.950
So then there is an
API for Google Drive.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.000
How do you build your
things on top of that API?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.700
I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.450
NELSON PEREIRA: Well, we
started checking the SDK.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.370
It was a great the way
to go to market first,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.990
to use it's on one of
our first interactions.

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.570
But then we started
collecting feedback

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.260
from users wanting a more
personalized experience

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.980
on Drive.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.100
So we read more documentation.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.590
We learned more about what
is underneath the SDK,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.690
and we found the REST API.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.080
And we started to build
our own customized

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.964
features for our
users on top of that.

00:02:13.964 --> 00:02:15.630
MARTIN OMANDER: So
you actually dug down

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.640
into the technical details to
see what goes over the wire,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.800
and then you could use
the REST API, which

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.730
gave you-- it was
a little more work,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.750
but gave you
greater flexibility?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.750
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.190
It's more work.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.570
But by the end of
the day, you have

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.000
more power or more flexibility
to customize everything

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.535
that you want on top of the
great Drive platform already.

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:40.910
MARTIN OMANDER:
So the SDK should

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.327
be used-- when should you use
the SDK versus the REST API.

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:45.076
NELSON PEREIRA: You
should use use the SDK

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:46.660
when you need to
deliver very fast,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.100
and if the features that
Google Drive has built in

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.060
is enough for you,
for what you need.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.650
If you want to customize
for a specific segment,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.660
then go for the REST API, and
you'll have more flexibility.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.610
It will take longer, but
by the end of the day,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.254
you'll have a very good
experience with it.

00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:06.170
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.960
So you're saying you customized
the experience for your users.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.010
What kind of features
are you adding

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.380
that's not there already?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.800
NELSON PEREIRA: Well,
we listen to our users

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.340
because Google Drive is
a very broad product.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.560
It tries to be
everything for everybody.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.340
It has a large audience.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.400
Our approach has a
specific audience segment.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.800
So based on feedback, we
customized the experience

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.930
on Drive for that
specific segment.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.030
One of the features
that they most requested

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.610
was a very fast search,
because business

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.120
have a lot of
documents on cloud.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.100
So we built a search
engine, and local index,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.610
on device which allows
very fast search,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.430
even when you are offline.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.110
The other feature was
having an entire folder

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.620
offline full of content.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.910
Because Google Drive,
right now the client

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.630
only offers having
offline files one per one.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.820
And if you have a folder
working on a project with 20

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.180
or 40 or 100 files, it's a
pain and takes a long time

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.450
to make them available offline.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.054
So--

00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:10.970
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.792
NELSON PEREIRA:
That's two examples

00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:15.530
of how we customized the API.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.220
MARTIN OMANDER: You and
Google are basically

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.500
innovating together here.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.459
Google's providing
the substrate,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.180
the basic functionality,
that would work for anybody.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.880
But then you know your
segment of customers better

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.800
and can build on top
of that, and customize

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.861
to your customers.

00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:32.860
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.940
Google did all the hard
work, providing the back-end,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.540
the servers, the
syncing, the versioning--

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.890
all the good stuff
about having a cloud.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.170
And then we just customizing
the experience on Google Drive

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.160
for this specific segment.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.730
So together we team up and
created a better experience

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.551
on Drive for these
specific users.

00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:54.800
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, right,
because you know your users

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.951
better than anybody else.

00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:56.950
NELSON PEREIRA: Exactly.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.020
And it's also a good API
for use for other startups

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.110
which may be building different
features from ours on top

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.870
of the REST API
from Google Drive.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.010
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.000
So finally, Nelson,
there are a lot

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.560
of startups out
there using APIs.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.550
Maybe even most are using APIs,
some providers, from others.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.190
And now that you've done a lot
of API integrations, what would

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.099
your advice be to
these other startups?

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.390
NELSON PEREIRA: Well, if you
need very fast integration

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.460
and standard
features, use the SDK.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.790
It's really easy
and fast to build.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.230
You can do it in a day or less.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.410
But if you need to
customize because you

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.260
have a specific audience,
you have specific needs

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.480
from users-- not a very
general, like Google Drive is

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.820
for general public-- to the
REST API, learn about it,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.384
and build their own features,
customized for your audience.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.300
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.840
And you, I understand,
are going mobile first.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.620
What are you
thinking behind that?

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.869
NELSON PEREIRA: Yes, we are
building everything mobile

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.880
first, because mobile is
the biggest challenge.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.480
If you are able to implement a
feature on a mobile platform,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.160
going back to the
desktop will be easier,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.780
because you have much
more power and flexibility

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.755
on a desktop computer,
on the browser.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.730
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.280
Great.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.190
Well, thank you very much
for sharing your experiences

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.106
with us today, Nelson.

00:06:20.106 --> 00:06:21.540
NELSON PEREIRA:
Thank you, Martin.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.081
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope that
you found something useful there

00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:26.520
that you can use
for your startup.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.100
If you have comments
on the show,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.340
file them under the
YouTube comments section.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.200
We love comments, and we
read everything you write.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.120
Finally, if you're a
high-tech entrepreneur,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.470
go to
developers.google.com/startups

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.020
to learn how Google
can help you.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.280
That's it for now.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.060
See you next time.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.620
