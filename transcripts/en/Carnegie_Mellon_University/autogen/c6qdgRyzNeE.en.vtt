might be a little bit uneasy about the

might be a little bit uneasy about the
 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070
might be a little bit uneasy about the
idea of robotic snakes but my hope is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
idea of robotic snakes but my hope is
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.540
idea of robotic snakes but my hope is
that in the very near future there will

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550
that in the very near future there will
 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.250
that in the very near future there will
be a lot more people that are glad to
