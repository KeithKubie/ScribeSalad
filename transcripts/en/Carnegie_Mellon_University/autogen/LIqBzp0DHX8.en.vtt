that everybody's after i get asked a lot
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.420
that everybody's after i get asked a lot
what what is the what's the X Factor all

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430
what what is the what's the X Factor all
 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.030
what what is the what's the X Factor all
you guys look for when you assess there

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040
you guys look for when you assess there
 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.860

isn't really an X Factor there's an A

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870
isn't really an X Factor there's an A

league baseball stadium now we're
 

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.090
league baseball stadium now we're
getting a spin rate on every pitch so

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100
getting a spin rate on every pitch so
 

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.480
getting a spin rate on every pitch so
it's fascinating we're getting I mean

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.490
it's fascinating we're getting I mean
 

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.530
it's fascinating we're getting I mean
we're getting movement of the ball in

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:29.540
we're getting movement of the ball in
 

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.760
we're getting movement of the ball in
three dimensions so in addition to just

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:34.770
three dimensions so in addition to just
 

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.380
three dimensions so in addition to just
the speed there's the movement of the

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:36.390
the speed there's the movement of the
 

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.420
the speed there's the movement of the
ball and there's also the deception of

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:38.430
ball and there's also the deception of
 

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.900
ball and there's also the deception of

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:41.910
the picture has before he throws so and
 

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.030
the picture has before he throws so and
then you added stress because these are

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040
then you added stress because these are
 

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.260
then you added stress because these are
not robots these guys have emotions and

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.270
not robots these guys have emotions and
 

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.520
not robots these guys have emotions and
they have egos and they have

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:51.530
they have egos and they have
 

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.050
they have egos and they have
expectations and you put all that

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060
expectations and you put all that
 

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.290
expectations and you put all that
together and you've got beautiful game

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300

Carew I had a conversation with him

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540
Carew I had a conversation with him
 

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.340
Carew I had a conversation with him
about this issue and

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.350
about this issue and
 

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.550
about this issue and
that the pitchers that he can pick up

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560
that the pitchers that he can pick up

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.430
the ball when it's still in their hand
and it makes sense if you think about

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440
and it makes sense if you think about
 

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.770
and it makes sense if you think about

the balls moving a little slower it's
 

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.710
the balls moving a little slower it's
really moving a lot slower in the

if I see it earlier and that so to me I

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:45.250
if I see it earlier and that so to me I
 

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.260
if I see it earlier and that so to me I
think that that deception begins in the

a part of the reason to take care of
such a tough pitcher hit is because

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:00.850
such a tough pitcher hit is because
 

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.310
such a tough pitcher hit is because
every pitch looks the same looks like

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320
every pitch looks the same looks like
 

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.480

so much of it is really the stress or

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:22.930
so much of it is really the stress or
 

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.790
so much of it is really the stress or
lack of stress and i think that if the

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800
lack of stress and i think that if the
 

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.310
lack of stress and i think that if the
batter thinks he's picking up the ball

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320
batter thinks he's picking up the ball
 

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.150
batter thinks he's picking up the ball
early he's so much likelier to hit it

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160
early he's so much likelier to hit it
 

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.540
early he's so much likelier to hit it
even if he's he's only picking it up a

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:36.550
even if he's he's only picking it up a
 

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.490
even if he's he's only picking it up a
tiny bit early or maybe not even picking

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:38.500
tiny bit early or maybe not even picking
 

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.150
tiny bit early or maybe not even picking
it up earlier thinks he is you know like

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160
it up earlier thinks he is you know like

so I have a question at some point in

00:14:57.929 --> 00:14:57.939
so I have a question at some point in
 

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.259
so I have a question at some point in

the pitching is not getting faster there

00:15:08.099 --> 00:15:08.109
the pitching is not getting faster there

is an Olympic sport where people just
saw a fixed weight and they look at how

00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:13.359
saw a fixed weight and they look at how
 

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:16.650
saw a fixed weight and they look at how
far they throw it I wonder if in that

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:16.660
far they throw it I wonder if in that
 

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.129
far they throw it I wonder if in that
sport people can throw it increasingly

00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:20.139
sport people can throw it increasingly
 

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:23.400
sport people can throw it increasingly
further and it can be a comparison

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.410
further and it can be a comparison

case versus not being able to throw
 

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:39.389
case versus not being able to throw
faster that's a great question we should

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399
faster that's a great question we should
 

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:42.059
faster that's a great question we should
look into that and see I have a feeling

00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:42.069
look into that and see I have a feeling
 

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:46.710
look into that and see I have a feeling
that I guess the javelin is is a

that I guess the javelin is is a

throwing but there's my shop hood is
 

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:54.329
throwing but there's my shop hood is
more brute force than speed anyway it's

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:54.339
more brute force than speed anyway it's
 

00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:56.729
more brute force than speed anyway it's
a really interesting question it is

00:15:56.729 --> 00:15:56.739
a really interesting question it is
 

00:15:56.739 --> 00:15:58.319
a really interesting question it is
interesting that more and more pitchers

00:15:58.319 --> 00:15:58.329
interesting that more and more pitchers
 

00:15:58.329 --> 00:16:00.900

so the number of great pictures we have

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:02.769
so the number of great pictures we have
 

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:04.829
so the number of great pictures we have
now seems almost impressing them at what

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839
now seems almost impressing them at what

now seems almost impressing them at what

00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639
time yeah I think it is I think clearly
 

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:09.329
time yeah I think it is I think clearly
there are more pitchers throwing at this

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:09.339
there are more pitchers throwing at this
 

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:11.729
there are more pitchers throwing at this
maximum but I've been asked this

00:16:11.729 --> 00:16:11.739
maximum but I've been asked this
 

00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:15.259
maximum but I've been asked this
question so many times during the

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:15.269

analogy that that I came up with was
 

00:16:22.329 --> 00:16:26.549
analogy that that I came up with was
it's like the human lifespan like ever
