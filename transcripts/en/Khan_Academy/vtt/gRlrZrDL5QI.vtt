00:00:00.582 --> 00:00:01.415
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians!

00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:02.653
Welcome to the present tense,

00:00:02.653 --> 00:00:05.820
or that which is happening right now.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:09.954
The present tense is how we talk about

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:12.810
things that are happening
in the present moment.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.727
Like, "I eat a donut."

00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:19.536
If I say it that way, it means

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:22.707
it's happening right now in the present

00:00:22.707 --> 00:00:25.229
as opposed to happening
later, in the future,

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:27.562
or before now, in the past.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.553
The present tense is
what's happening right now.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:35.234
If you can just imagine,

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:39.438
just put the words "right now" at the end

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:42.443
of anything that takes
place in the present.

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:45.358
"I eat a donut right now."

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:48.941
"Louise doesn't want
a catapult right now."

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.109
"The water is super cold right now."

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:59.352
"Bertie is singing in
the shower right now."

00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:01.585
All of these sentences are taking place

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.575
in what we call the present.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.899
There are a couple of ways
to form the present tense,

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.772
and I demonstrated two of them here.

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:12.088
So we can say "eat" or "doesn't" or "is".

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.771
We can also say "is singing".

00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:18.142
So when you generally have something

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:20.726
that has "is" and "ing" in it,

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.166
means it's happening right now.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.959
It's happening in the present tense.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.455
So yeah, those are two of
the ways to form the present.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.935
If the verb is kind of unadorned,

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:34.443
if it's kind of plain, "I eat a donut.",

00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:36.840
not "I was eating a donut."

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.815
or "I ate a donut."

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:40.171
or "I will eat a donut."

00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:42.139
if it's just kind of on its own like this,

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.658
it's probably gonna be
in the present tense.

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:48.737
Likewise, if you see the
word "is" and then "ing",

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:52.548
that also means it's in the present tense.

00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:55.190
That's what you gotta know
about the present tense.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.857
It's happening now.

00:01:58.203 --> 00:01:59.663
You can learn anything.

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:00.663
David, out.
