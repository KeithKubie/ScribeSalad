00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In fact, it's now infinite.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I can reapply this subject goes to subject rule

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
as many times as I want.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Students and students and students and teachers think.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And if someone were to challenge me and say,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
"Oh, there are only 5 strings in your grammar,"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I could always make a new one by using this rule

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
one more time, so for any number you might think are produced,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I can always get 1 more, so the number of potential strings I can produce is infinite.

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's a huge amount of scope for creativity.
