00:00:01.257 --> 00:00:03.090
 Birena Gupta: After selling my latest startups 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.710
 My husband and I decided to travel around the world 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.620
 And during our travels 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.900
 We came up with the idea of ​​creating Hooked 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.440
 This is a picture of a place in Costa Rica where I love writing 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.020
 And inspired new ideas 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.110
 The Hooked application is intended to tell short stories 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.299
 In the form of chats 

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.950
 Sarah Abdullah: I love writing 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.217
 I grew up in love reading Arabic literature 

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:29.020
 This has prompted me to share my experiences with my children 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.420
 I did not find a way to communicate with them better than the language they speak 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.390
 So I decided to create Makooky World 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.080
 After I had been thinking for years 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.560
 Makooky World is an interactive application featuring stories, songs and games in Arabic 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.330
 Kim Tae Neller: represents the kiwi symbol voltage 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.186
 And perseverance to reach the highest goals 

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:55.380
 Zen Koi shows a small fish trip from Koi fish 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.610
 Until it becomes a dragon 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.170
 What fish do you play? 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.756
 SPEAKER 4: I play with Yellow Coke 

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:07.761
 Maria Martina: I learned from my mother and my sisters 

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:09.270
 That no matter how you face challenges 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.665
 I have to learn how to rise after a failure 

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.570
 And try again 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.647
 Their advice has had a great impact on my work 

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:20.050
 Sarah Abdullah: It was not an easy start 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.060
 Because this area was completely new to me 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.900
 But it was worth the effort 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.230
 I had no investments 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.070
 That means I needed to invest my time and money 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.355
 And start a very small team 

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:37.150
 Maria Martina: At first we had no experience in the field of games 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.630
 It was our specialty to produce films, cartoons and story books 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.860
 Each of us has a different background 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.720
 We have learned a lot from our work elsewhere 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.240
 But we were struggling to make our own games 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.690
 And to provide stories of our authorship 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.930
 It was hard to get support 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.180
 Kim Tai Neller: The establishment of Zen Koi was a daunting trip for us 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.990
 But we decided to continue 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.410
 Knowing that we did not have enough money for it 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.740
 The launch of Hooked has been a scary step 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.780
 There were many doubts 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.747
 My biggest fear was that the project would stop there 

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:11.810
 Maria Martina: After years of challenge and learning 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 Finally, we achieved impressive results 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.070
 By working on our own game Realms of the Void 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.170
 It is a multi-role strategy game 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.050
 Kim Tai Neller: After attracting the first 20 installation 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.240
 We felt comfortable and happy too 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.290
 Because the game became accessible to everyone 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.724
 Zen Koi now has a total of nine million installs 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.570
 Birena Gupta: We continued to work, after a year of trials and tests 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.327
 We were able to translate the application into seven different languages 

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:41.910
 We launched it around the world until Hooked achieved first place 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030
 In more than 25 countries 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.472
 We've reached more than 13.5 million installs on Android 

00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.890
 Sara Abdullah: What drives me to advance every morning 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.920
 Is the ability to create something new 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.379
 I have always dreamed of doing it 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.920
 Kim Tai Neller: The success of Zen Koi is back to luck 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 Many patience, perseverance and support from family and friends 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.824
 Sara Abdullah: I would like to teach my daughters an important message 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.410
 That they can accomplish the impossible if they want 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.840
 I have a responsibility as a mother 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.120
 To prove them through the realization of my dreams 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.229
 That they can achieve their dreams as well 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.860
 Maria Martina: I'm lucky with this wonderful team 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.030
 And whatever the days have hidden 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.837
 We will continue our efforts to achieve what we want 

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:23.670
 Birena Gupta: When creating a new product you love 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.086
 And is looking to launch it in the market 

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:27.440
 This is what keeps you working 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.400
 And so leave your mark in the world
