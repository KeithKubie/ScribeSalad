 Waiberg: What attracts me in armchairs 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280
 Is that they always include a story. 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.480
 Some have been made 100 years ago, 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.920
 My life has become better with work 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.160
 In the manufacture of these chairs. 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.800
 When I was 25 years old, 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 I discovered that I had a disease in my eyes. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.540
 It has been 30 years now, 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.720
 I have a vision of 5 degrees, 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.080
 It will continue to fall until it is gone. 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.200
 The most important thing is that I feel the material in my hand 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.280
 I feel right. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 Everything is in your hands, 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.200
 You can feel something before seeing it. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.920
 I see that reviving the chairs again looks like 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 Give someone another life to live. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.920
 What makes me feel great 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 I am actually making something that makes a difference 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.960
 For others.
