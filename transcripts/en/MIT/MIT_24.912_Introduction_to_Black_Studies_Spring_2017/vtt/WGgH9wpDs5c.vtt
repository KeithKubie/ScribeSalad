00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.530
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So critical
computational empowerment.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.380
That's one of the key concepts
that Professor Fox Harrell, who

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.520
was one of our guest speakers,
discussed during his visit

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.020
to class.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.570
And it was a big
hit in the class.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.350
Because, as you know,
we have many engineers,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.710
scientists in the course.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.520
And many of them are so used
to the notion of coding,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.330
of computation, being
supposedly neutral

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.800
when it comes to ideology.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.390
And to the societal tendencies.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.530
But what Fox should
really clearly is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.280
that those hierarchies of power,
that this course is about,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.750
really, are themselves
embedded in these codes.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.350
In these codes that create
video games, virtual reality

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.160
platforms.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.690
So if we're not aware
of these hierarchies,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.340
and how they are coded--

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.580
really coded-- in
those platforms,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.489
then we become prey to
them without even knowing.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.830
We accept their
assumptions, and we

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.080
reinforce our own attitudes
that might put down women,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.380
or immigrants, or
Muslims, or gay people.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.800
So we will become part
of these hierarchies

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.960
and maintaining them.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.010
But also what Fox
showed in his visit is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.650
that, once you understand
how coding can encode

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.630
those hierarchies,
then we can actually

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.020
create codes that
will, in turn, give us

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.970
more flexibility for identities
that are more inclusive.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.810
And more humane towards,
especially, women,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.140
and blacks, and Latinos,
and Muslims, et cetera.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.560
So the one thing that
Fox did in his visit

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.510
was to show us one
of his platforms

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.470
where he brings together
people on different sides

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.410
of a conflict.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.410
So one case that he
showed was this conflict

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.690
between the Israelis
and the Palestinians.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.070
So there's this perform where
you can bring those soldiers

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.350
together, who fight
on opposite sides,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.080
and through that, they
get to better empathize

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.160
with each other's
identities, and biographies,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.410
and life circumstances.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.380
So that was really a powerful
concept for the students

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.730
to get to understand.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.330
How coding can indeed help us
code a better world for all.
