00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.660
The neck tie has its roots in military history.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.440
For starters, a collection of terracotta sculptures
discovered in 1974 in Xian, China gives insight

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.410
into the style worn by Chinese soldiers over
a thousand years ago.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.250
China’s first emperor, Qin Shih Huang, wanted
his army to be buried with him as his guardians

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.340
in the afterlife.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.190
Lucky for all the soldiers involved, his advisers
convinced him instead to have life sized replicas

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.760
of his troops made to be used as his protectors
throughout eternity.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.530
In 210 BC when he died, his terracotta “army”
was buried with him in this way.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.579
Each statue wore a wrapped neck cloth, the
earliest known predecessor of the modern tie.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.570
Yet Qin Shih Huang’s army seems to have
been the only known Chinese wearers of the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.570
neck cloth.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.790
There are no known representations of Chinese
soldiers or Chinese people in general wearing

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.300
this piece of clothing outside of this at
this time.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.200
So historians believe that these neck ties
might might have been used here more or less

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.640
as a badge of honor for Qin Shih Huang’s
army.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.580
The neck tie is also depicted in Trajan’s
column in Rome, Italy.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.470
Emperor Trajan ruled the Roman Empire from
98 to 117AD.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.970
He was regarded as a military genius and was
responsible for the greatest expansion of

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.350
the Roman Empire.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.880
His military conquest of Dacia is commemorated
in Trajan’s marble column erected around

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.420
113 AD, where thousands of soldiers are shown
wearing various styles of neckwear.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.720
Again, as was the case with the Chinese, there
is no record of other Roman soldiers wearing

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.280
neckties at this time.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.060
Thus, some think that it was also a sign of
honor befitting exceptional fighters.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.123
During the middle ages, another example of
the necktie was worn in a military setting.

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:51.229
In the early 1630s, during the Thirty Years
War, Croatian soldiers in support of France

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.810
were presented to the French King Louis XIII.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.530
The Croats wore colorful, knotted neckerchiefs
as a part of their uniform which attracted

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.920
their French partners who were accustomed
to wearing starched, ruffled collars.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.119
Apart from its decorative purpose, the necktie
was more practical than these stiff collars

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.150
and could protect the soldiers’ shirts and
buttons.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.209
By the time Louis XIV came to the throne,
these ties became fashionable in France.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.640
Military personnel, French courtiers, and
ordinary French people began sporting the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.650
accessory in various colors and fabrics.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.030
Some people even believe that “cravat”,
the French word for “tie”, was even just

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.400
a corruption of “Croat”, as the style
was adopted from the Croatians.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.090
Though the cravat is regarded as the true
forerunner to the modern tie as a fashion

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.890
statement, it would take a few hundred years
for the tie to evolve to the narrow strip

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.969
of cloth we think of today as a neck tie.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:50.950
The fancy cravat made its way to England after
Charles II reclaimed the throne in 1660.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.309
Other aristocrats who had lived in exile in
Europe followed him and took along the cravat

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.590
which became a fashion rage that also spread
to the English colonies.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.909
The neckwear grew to be a stylish accessory
for the well dressed gentleman who wore it

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.419
in every imaginable color and style.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.980
There were cravats of tasseled strings, ruffled
collars, ribbon, embroidered linen, cotton,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.260
and an abundance of lace.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.760
The trend continued into the eighteenth century
when donning a cloth around a man’s neck

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.370
became immensely popular among all men regardless
of status.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.189
Towards the end of that century, wearing a
black cravat was considered the height of

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.189
fashion.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.199
In 1815, the French Emperor, Napolean Bonaparte
who typically wore black, wore a white cravat

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.519
during the battle of Waterloo to honor the
Duke of Wellington who favored that color

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.750
during battle.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.010
It was also around that time that people began
to refer to a cravat as a “tie” for the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.809
first time, of course referring to the fact
that the cravats were tied around the neck.

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.939
Variety in ties, innovation, and complexity
in knots were the order of the day.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.689
Books and pamphlets were written about the
subject.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.669
In 1818, The Neckclothitania was published,
using satire to make fun of the elaborate

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.760
cravat styles.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.510
In 1828, H. Le Blanc wrote The Art of Tying
the Cravat demonstrated in sixteen lessons

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.170
including thirty two different styles.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.669
The industrial revolution from the eighteenth
to nineteenth century was the catalyst that

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.700
led to the necktie as we know it today.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.489
“White collar” workers of the day sought
comfort and simplicity over previously excessively

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.489
elaborate dress.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.729
Stiff, fancy, hard to tie neckties had no
place on the factory floor.

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.150
Men tied their neckwear four-in-hand allowing
for a knot at the throat with two ends of

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.759
fabric trailing down.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.430
This method of tying was a much less intricate
way of creating a knot than was necessary

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.370
when wearing a cravat, and the knot remained
secure.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.229
It remains a popular way of tying a tie to
this day.

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.550
Around this time also, the idea of wearing
a tie to show one’s affiliation developed.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.069
In 1880, the first school tie was fashioned
when a member of Oxford University rowing

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.740
club removed the ribbons from his boater hat
and tied them four-in-hand.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.430
The trend caught on and ties for various affiliations
developed.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.930
In the 1880s, the ascot tie became the standard
for formal morning dress.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.270
It was made a famous fashion item by Britain’s
King Edward VII, also known as Bertie, who

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.490
wore it to the horse races and his subjects
followed.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.430
The name is derived from one of the most celebrated
horse racing events in England, The Royal

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.590
Ascot.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.970
The ascot, tie or “bow tie” are still
today regarded as choices for morning dress.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.919
It was and is still typically decorated with
a pin.

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.539
By the 1920s, the tie was to evolve even more
drastically when Jesse Langsdorf, a New York

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.039
tie maker, cut the fabric at a forty five
degree angle using a three piece construction.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.710
The gist of it is that this allowed the tie,
when tied in standard knots, to drape evenly

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.419
without twisting, and gave us the modern look.

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.449
Since then, over the years the width of the
tie has expanded and shrunken; the length

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.710
has grown and shortened; and colors and designs
have become brighter and softer, but despite

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.330
those changes, the style remains substantially
the same.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:19.599
The modern tie is even generally manufactured
in the same basic way developed by Langsdorf.
