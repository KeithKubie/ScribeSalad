00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.650
Material design is a system for
cross platform visual, motion, and

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.930
interaction design.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.890
It employs our experience of
the physical world to make UIs

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.270
more intuitive.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.230
&gt;&gt; It borrows ideas from print design
world to help drive simplicity and

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.990
beauty in UIs.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.880
&gt;&gt; At a glance, it might appear as
another implementation of flat design.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.430
While material rejects the tropes of
extreme skeuomorphism, it does bring in

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.220
physical world concepts like light and
shadow and rendering volumes.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.810
&gt;&gt; Now the four main concepts
of material design, and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.240
coincidentally the titles of
the next four lessons are.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.970
&gt;&gt; Tangible surfaces, surfaces that
we can touch and react to our input.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.070
&gt;&gt; Bold graphic design.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.150
An homage to great typography and
print layout.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.440
&gt;&gt; Meaningful motion.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.640
Motion that guides and
encourages the user, and.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.940
&gt;&gt; Adaptive design.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.452
UIs that look great no matter how
large or small the screen is.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:56.160
&gt;&gt; Now we mentioned
cross platform before.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.150
While this is a course on Android,
material design is intended for

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.550
use on many different platforms,
such as the web.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.570
A lot of the design principles you
learn about here will be useful

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.420
outside of just Android.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.880
&gt;&gt; As in the first lesson,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.410
I'll walk you through code samples that
will help you tackle the final project.
