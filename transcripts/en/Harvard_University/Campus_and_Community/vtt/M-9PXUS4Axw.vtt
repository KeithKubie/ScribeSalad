00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.326
I actually have this girl

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.333
and she just recently switched into the Boston Latin Academy
I think she tested into this school

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
and in the beginning,  

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
she was having a really hard time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.466
with the math and she felt so behind and she was 
feeling a little bit discouraged.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
One week after I had been working with her she came in 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
and she pulled out this quiz

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and she said “Hannah, look at this I got a one hundred.”

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
so that was just so exciting

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
to see that our work had a 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
positive impact

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and you never really realize how much you
didn't know that something about something that you thought was familiar to you

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
until you actually have to you explain it to someone
else and you think “Oh, what was the point of this again?”

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I think I just learned a lot. You learn so much by 
Teaching.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
I think that’s just the philosophy that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
I had going through this whole experience.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
I have been a mentor at the Ed portal and what
that means is essentially I go in once

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
a week

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.733
for about four hours and I went on Thursdays
which was really great because I got to do

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
one-on-ones and a project they call “Science Club”.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
So one on one basically, you spent forty
minutes

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
with a student and they can be

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
age…I think the youngest one-on-one
was fourth grade and so fourth grade through

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
high school and basically this session is
tailored toward whatever the student likes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.066
Some students want to do experiments the whole
Time, some students just bring their homework

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.266
and we'll sit and do their homework and basically
the mentor is just there to be a resource, to

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.266
be a problem solver. So, you know, I have done my
homework with students you know we will both just sit there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.266
It is just the space for them to come and 
be able to do their work. Other students, especially

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.666
high school students, are sort of looking
for advice, so sometimes I just want to sit,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
and chat.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.333
So the one-on-one mentoring is so different
it just, you know, it goes from student to student. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
I've been focusing on the science mentoring
aspect

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
so we did a lot of manly a lot of really exciting
things like exploding various

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.866
objects like we would exploded foam canisters
with the alka-seltzer rockets and we'd let 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.133
them combine pretty basic things like vinegar and baking soda
and let them see the explosion.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.466
It was just really great to sort of introduce all
these aspects of science to these young children

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
because

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.866
I remember being their age and my first experiences
with science was a similar it was just some a mentor

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
of mine who came and  showed me all these
different aspects of in scientific research

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
and experiments

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
and from there I just became so inspired 
in science

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
and so I felt my goal in these one on one 
was to sort of

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
introduce that same

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.733
spirit of science in these young children
because I think it's very important that they

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
realized science is all around them and they can definitely explore science using just what they

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
have.
