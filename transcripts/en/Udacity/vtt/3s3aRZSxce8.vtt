00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.790
Here's a key number, 14.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.600
Studies show that patients like Marla,
patients with four or

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.610
five or more chronic conditions,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.230
are seen on average each year
by 14 different physicians.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.590
So why is this the case?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.910
Well they have a lot of problems
that involve many different parts of

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.460
their body.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.440
In Marla's case, her lungs, her heart,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.500
her blood vessels and
the insulin control system,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.160
which is centered in an organ
called the pancreas.
