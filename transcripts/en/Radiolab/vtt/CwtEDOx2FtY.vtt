7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.410
<v 1>the I'm Jad and I'm Robert and this is radio lab. Today on our program,</v>

8
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:33.850
the topic is liar, all kinds of liars and now it's time for the liar.

9
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:37.780
We haven't yet mentioned a layer which might actually be one very familiar to

10
00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:41.170
you. Jad this is the, uh, the self deceiver. Hey,

11
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.340
would you know that you might get somebody, somebody who lies a not to others,

12
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:48.640
but actually lies to oneself if you get my drift? Thanks. Which thanks a lot.

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.020
Anyhow. What does that even mean to lie to oneself? How would you,

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.920
that's tricky. Let me give you a classic example.

15
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:58.921
Let's say that you are madly in love with somebody who just conjure up whoever

16
00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:02.550
you really, you know, I don't know who. Okay, so now you're in love with her.

17
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.840
And strange things start to happen. Oh,

18
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.990
you were at home. The phone rings, you pick it up, hello,

19
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.460
and the person on the other end of the line is breathing and then hangs up next.

20
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.210
She's suddenly staying late at the office many nights a week. Didn't use it.

21
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.660
She said, honey, I've got to work late tonight. Again, don't wait up.

22
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.390
Then your friends tell you that they see this woman who's this guy in the

23
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:33.240
company of a man. You have a brother maybe repeatedly, dude, c'mon. Okay.

24
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.380
In short, all the signs are there and yet, despite the evidence,

25
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:40.930
you Jed continue to believe, and I mean you truly,

26
00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:44.490
truly believe that the woman is being faithful. Well,

27
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.810
maybe in this little scenario that you've created for me,

28
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:51.430
I'm just a stupid or clueless. No,

29
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:54.580
I'm not going to take that away from you. I'm not. But in this case though,

30
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.470
for the sake of argument, let's say you're not clear, okay?

31
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.730
Let us say you believe both these things in some different compartments in your

32
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:05.200
head. You believe that she is faithful at the very same time. You know?

33
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.760
You know what's really going on here? What's up deception really is,

34
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.761
is that you have two contradictory beliefs and you hold them at the same time

35
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.810
and you allow one of them into consciousness and that you have a motivation for

36
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.960
allowing one of them into consciousness. That's Joanna steric.

37
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:24.300
She's a psychologist and we're going to hear more from her later. Right?

38
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:27.120
So how does that work then? What, what you just said,

39
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.750
beg to have two contradictory thoughts in your brain at the same time and get

40
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:34.230
your own letting in one. Well, there's an experiment on this subject.

41
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.340
Kind of an interesting one.

42
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:39.810
And so what other experiment introduced you to the two guys who did it?

43
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.430
It's for, okay. Uh, uh, Harold [inaudible] professor in the

44
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.630
Departments of Psychiatry and Radiology at Columbia University. Okay.

45
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.400
My name is Ruben Gore. I'm a neuropsychologist by training.

46
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.500
Harold Sackheim and Reuben Glare are friends.

47
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.500
They met back in 1974 or 73 and make that 73 one was a grad student.

48
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.090
That would be Harold moment as a professor. That's Gore.

49
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.610
And we started talking and make a long story short,

50
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.190
we did a couple of experiments

51
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.560
and one of them we played clips of one's own voice and the voices of other

52
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:18.760
people. And here's the experiment. You the subject are sitting in a room, okay,

53
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.420
all right. And we're going to give you a big red button and you can press it.

54
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:26.470
Press the button yet. No sorry. And out of the speakers in this room,

55
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:29.380
you're going to hear 10 different voices.

56
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.260
And everybody was saying the same thing. The words were to say come here,

57
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.230
come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

58
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.880
And one of the voices in this group, one of the many is huge ad.

59
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.220
You saying come here. That was you.

60
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.540
When you hear yourself saying com, press the button. Press a button.

61
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.620
Me Or not me. When you, when you hear your own voice. So one of these in mind.

62
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.090
Yup, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. No here,

63
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.860
come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

64
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.790
Come here. Come think. Oh here, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

65
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.530
Not me here. Come now. If you listen very closely, it's going to come three me,

66
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.310
I'm shooting. I come here, not me, not me. Now he missed it. Right.

67
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.160
It's hard. You're right. And the people in Harold study,

68
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:18.130
many of them didn't do too well either because they had some trouble recognizing

69
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.520
their own voice. Uh, all right, bring it home. Robert, what's the point of this?

70
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.790
But here's what I didn't tell you. When they did this experiment in real life,

71
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.180
the real subjects in addition to having a little pusher button thing that we

72
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:29.020
gave you. Yeah.

73
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.920
They also had diodes all over their body measuring recorded their physio and

74
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.820
CRISPR aeration inspecting heart rate, stuff like that. Blood pressure.

75
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.560
And what they found is that when a person failed to recognize his or her voice,

76
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.090
nevertheless their bodies, the sweat heart blows so often the body's going,

77
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.430
their body seemed to notice their voices even though their conscious minds miss

78
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:55.600
the voices, the body knew. The conscious mind didn't.

79
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.040
Two thoughts in the same person. Come on now. I mean I'll give it to you.

80
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:03.520
That's kind of interesting. But that's it. That is not the same thing as lying.

81
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.510
While we're just starting here, we're just, this is now at least grant me this.

82
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.650
You can have two different experiences simultaneous. Okay.

83
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:16.480
I granted that you're on our way. We're on our way. Okay. Step two,

84
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.800
Harold and Ruben decide to leave the laboratory and go to a bar. Yeah,

85
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:25.670
I believe it was smokey Joe's just to sort of talk things over and kick back and

86
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.450
to deal with your very question like,

87
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.280
so let's really get to the core of what lying to yourself is about, et cetera.

88
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.400
So they're in the bar and they're getting kind of drunk.

89
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:35.410
We were probably pretty, John and Rubin proposes,

90
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:40.330
we need to come up with some way to get test subjects to have one thought and

91
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.190
instantly have a contradictory thought.

92
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.840
Maybe we could do that with embarrassment.

93
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.930
Maybe we could embarrass them into having two thoughts at the same time.

94
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:51.510
And yes, and at some point I said, let's ask people questions, questions,

95
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:52.720
so threatening,

96
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:55.900
so uncomfortable that you don't want to tell the truth about the quick way.

97
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.640
What questions would those be? Well, I mean we had to get down and dirty.

98
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.490
They got drunker and drunker and drunker and they came up with a whole bunch of

99
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.870
them writing them down right there in the bar on the Napkin. We were curious.

100
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.780
So we took their questions off the napkins so to speak,

101
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.710
and we brought them out onto the street.

102
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.140
Can I ask you some questions while you're waiting? Yeah, sure.

103
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.480
So here's what have you ever doubted your sexual adequacy? Oh No. And Yeah.

104
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.510
Another. Have you ever enjoyed your bowel movements? Enjoyed my bowel.

105
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.130
I think most normal people do. No. Here's another,

106
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.800
have you ever thought to committing suicide and it was to get back at somebody?

107
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.760
Yes. No, and another. Okay.

108
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.500
Have you ever wanted to rape feeling great for somebody? Come again? No. No.

109
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.740
Absolutely not. Oh No. Well, yeah. Have I had,

110
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.020
what kind of question is that? If you answered no to any of those questions,

111
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.690
they would say that you're lying to yourself.

112
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:53.170
So they are assuming then that everybody enjoys their bowel movements secretly.

113
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.590
Everyone secretly has raped what they are assuming. Yes.

114
00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:59.950
It was a supposition that these things are universal truths,

115
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.980
but it was a supposition that seemed to work

116
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.740
<v 2>because that night at the bar, Harold and Rubin stumbled across something.</v>

117
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.670
It turns out that how you answer those questions predict some very surprising

118
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:16.990
things about the kind of person you are.

119
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.200
How about the course of your whole life? First of all,

120
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.780
remember that previous study we talked about with the voices,

121
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.890
it just so happens that the people who were very bad at the voice test failed

122
00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:27.724
the voice test.

123
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.590
They were the very same people who did very badly on the embarrassing

124
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:33.940
questionnaire test. They didn't,

125
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.590
<v 1>when we admit to stuff, have you ever wanted to rape or be raped by somebody?</v>

126
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.480
Uh, now not at all, Huh? However,

127
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.930
when other scientists got ahold of Harold and Ruben's questionnaire and they

128
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.120
used it a lot in lots of situations,

129
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.040
can give it to thousands and thousands of people.

130
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:51.610
They dug deeper into the question of of what are these people who have trouble

131
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:54.460
with truthiness? What happens to them in life? And,

132
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.760
and it turns out that they do a whole lot better in all kinds of areas.

133
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.150
Better, better, better, you know, all kinds of things. Like what?

134
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.810
A whole lot of stuff like coming now say, by the way, these people are liars.

135
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.280
I am not quite ready to say that,

136
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:12.090
but let's just call them liars and can you please tell me what the hell you're

137
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.040
talking about? What, what sorts of things did they do better at? Well,

138
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.820
just to start, let me introduce you to someone. Okay.

139
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.430
My name is Joanna steric and I'm a psychologist,

140
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:25.030
psychologist and athlete. I was actually a swimmer.

141
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.930
I was a competitive swimmer at Colgate university and I think one of the

142
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:33.490
questions that I was really interested in is how can you have two people who

143
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:38.260
have the same physiological capacity and then one person over and over again

144
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:40.810
would consistently win or outperform the other?

145
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.690
Joanna had heard about Harold and Ruben's questionnaire,

146
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:45.880
so she and her research partner, Carolyn Keating,

147
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:50.800
decided to give the embarrassing question questionnaire to the swim team. Yes.

148
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.150
Just to see what they'd find.

149
00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:55.830
So we gave them that questionnaire at the beginning of the season and then they

150
00:08:55.831 --> 00:09:00.831
trained trying to qualify for the eastern Athletic Conference Championship.

151
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.650
That's the big race of the end of the year. It's, it's a very objective measure.

152
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.520
You either swim fast enough during the season to qualify or you don't.

153
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.610
And when at the end of the season, Joanna and her research partner,

154
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.210
Caroline looked at which swimmers did the best, which ones qualify.

155
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.930
We did find a bizarre relationship. This swimmers who said the one,

156
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.750
the liars who said no to all these questions.

157
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.460
Did you enjoy your bowel movements? No.

158
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.500
Have you ever thought about killing yourself? No.

159
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.570
Have you ever thought about raping summit? No.

160
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.910
Consistently they were the winners.

161
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.600
The fastest and most successful swimmers.

162
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.020
What are the ones who on the questionnaire according to Harold and Ruben,

163
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.330
lied to themselves? Yes.

164
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.720
I do think a little bit of deception is not necessarily a bad thing.

165
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.330
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

166
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.150
<v 1>it might even be a crucial thing. And just for example,</v>

167
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:49.580
I want you to listen to these Olympic track athletes.

168
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.000
We got these interview clips from the sound artist, Ben Ruben.

169
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:57.050
I listened to how these athletes describe the process of getting ready to race.

170
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.790
We believe we are investible is if we go in there with any other thought death,

171
00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:03.590
no chance of US accomplishing our goal.

172
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.480
Well of course I always win in my thoughts.

173
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.110
I have the ability to catch this person. It's going to happen.

174
00:10:09.111 --> 00:10:12.140
Take your head off, leave your head at home. Leave your brain at home.

175
00:10:12.141 --> 00:10:15.680
Today when I stepped on the runway, I just relaxed myself.

176
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.810
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

177
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.740
<v 1>you are the best and I go and more than sports,</v>

178
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:27.000
denying certain facts about the real world around you according to any number of

179
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:28.140
new studies producers,

180
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:32.370
people who turns out are better at business and better at working with teams and

181
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:35.790
now here's the real kicker. They turn out to be happier.

182
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.220
[inaudible] the question, you're served a couple of [inaudible].

183
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.460
<v 2>The purpose is one of the things that had taught us is that people who were</v>

184
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.250
happiest are the ones who are lying to themselves more

185
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.460
<v 1>people who are the most realistic that actually see the world exactly as it is,</v>

186
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.750
tend to be slightly more depressed than others. Time and time again.

187
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:58.050
Researchers have found that depressed people lie

188
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.190
<v 2>less. They see all the pain in the world,</v>

189
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.290
how horrible people are with each other,

190
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.100
and they tell you everything about themselves, what their weaknesses are,

191
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.690
terrible things they've done to other people. And the problem is they're right

192
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.420
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

193
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.110
<v 2>and so maybe it's the way we help people to help them be wrong.</v>

194
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.100
It might just be that hiding ideas that we know to be true.

195
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.940
Hiding those ideas from ourselves is what we need to get by.

196
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.960
We're so vulnerable to being here and we're given the capacity to the store as a

197
00:11:33.281 --> 00:11:34.114
gift.

198
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.003
<v 3>No.</v>

199
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.170
<v 1>Well, that's it for us.</v>

200
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.660
