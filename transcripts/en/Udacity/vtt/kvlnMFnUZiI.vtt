00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.660
Alright, let's see if we can make some sense

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.950
of this. First, we convert 64 kilobytes into bytes by

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.060
multiplying by 1,024 bytes, which is 65,536 bytes. Next

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.730
we convert this number into the number of packets by

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.350
dividing by the size of the packet, and that

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.580
turns out to be approximately 45 packets. Next we can

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.530
plug in the numbers that we have into the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.560
formula that we have here. We know that the roundtrip

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.680
time is 100 milliseconds. We have 45 packets that we

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.150
need to transfer, and the initial congestion window is 10

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.470
packets. Now, this actually simplifies to three, so what we actually

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.550
have is 100 milliseconds times three, or approximately 300 milliseconds.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.140
&gt;&gt; But Ilia, I have a question for you. Why do these brackets look weird?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.590
&gt;&gt; This is actually the ceiling function, which means you need

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.070
to round up the number to the next greatest integer

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.470
once you figure out the answer to this log function.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.850
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.580
&gt;&gt; So, the final answer is 300 milliseconds, which

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.140
is quite a bit of time. That's said, note

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560
that this is only true for new speed connections.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.970
