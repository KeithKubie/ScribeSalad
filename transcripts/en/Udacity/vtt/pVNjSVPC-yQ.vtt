00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It is time to declare moral victory.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
While there is much more to learn in computer science and the world,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
this about wraps it up for this class. You should celebrate.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here you can see happy people and clearly they're next to--let's call that a cake.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
At least one thing we can conclude is that while you've learned quite a bit about

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
computer science, my sketching skills have not improved at all.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This course was not easy. This course was not easy, and I fully acknowledge that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In fact, some of the material that it covers is similar to material covered in 400-level classes

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
at universities like Cornell or Berkeley or the University of Virginia.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There's a lot of deep stuff going on in here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You should really congratulate yourself on making through it alive.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A legitimate question is what comes next?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, there's likely to be a final for this course and perhaps some wrap-up surveys,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but if you'll indulge me for just a moment here at the end of the class,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
let me make some recommendations for what you might do with

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
your copious spare time.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I personally recommend that you study--if you have the time-- philosophy

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
until you've covered epistemology. What is true? How do we know things? Tricky.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Free will--do we have it? So unclear.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Logic, the philosophy of science, and what it is like to be a bat.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And there's my bat, using echolocation and apparently with the wings of a condor.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Similarly, I think there's a lot to be gained by studying cognitive psychology--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
at least until you've covered perception, which is magical; consciousness,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is perhaps even more magical--bonus points if you know what it is and can tell me;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and the Flynn effect--just when we thought we understood intelligence.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Study speech or rhetoric until you've covered persuasion,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and presumably made Captain Wentworth proud.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Is all persuasion self-persuasion? You tell me.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You should definitely investigate anthropology, possibly cultural anthropology,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and gender studies until you've covered, say, Mead and Freeman--

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Margaret Mead--and have a better feel for which behaviors are socially constructed

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and which may be essential.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I think you may find that a larger fraction are socially constructed that you would have believed.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You should follow along with statistics until you can avoid being fooled,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
either by others or by yourself.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You should spend some time with religion and ethics until you've covered the relationship

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
between unhappiness and unrealized desires. How do we become happy?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Study physics and engineering until you can explain how

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a microphone, a radio, and a speaker--or a headset--all work.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Spend some time studying government until you have an opinion about legislating morality

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and also the relative importance of freedom and equality.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They are both virtues worth striving for.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Ideally we'd like them both, but if you could only have oneâ€¦

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Read history until you are not condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
until you and Santana are friends.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Finally, study life until you are happy.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
They say ignorance is bliss, but they are wrong all but finitely often.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Wait, what was I saying earlier about statistics? Ah, never mind.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Let me just conclude by saying that it has been an honest pleasure leading you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
during your discovery of this aspect of computer science.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's rare that I can do something like teaching this class that will leave such an impact on the world.

00:03:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
