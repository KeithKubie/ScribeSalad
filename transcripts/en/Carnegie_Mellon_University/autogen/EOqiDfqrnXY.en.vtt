and brought them to the web they're all
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.090
and brought them to the web they're all
they're free to read so students in the

exactly what you're looking for it's a
 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.720
exactly what you're looking for it's a
very rich resource and one that we think

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730
very rich resource and one that we think
 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.610
very rich resource and one that we think
will become more and more important

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620
will become more and more important
 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.960
will become more and more important
important as we're able to do other good

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
important as we're able to do other good
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.520
important as we're able to do other good
technological advances like language

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530
technological advances like language

these books are in Chinese but someday
you'll be able to go find the book that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340
you'll be able to go find the book that
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.520
you'll be able to go find the book that
you want in Chinese and have it

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
you want in Chinese and have it
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.530

of your eyes students need to learn how

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270
of your eyes students need to learn how
 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.900
of your eyes students need to learn how
to use the resources in their discipline

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910
to use the resources in their discipline
 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.210
to use the resources in their discipline
so the accrediting agency actually now

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220
so the accrediting agency actually now
 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.810
so the accrediting agency actually now
requires that when students graduate

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820
requires that when students graduate
 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.810
requires that when students graduate
from the University they be nala they

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820
from the University they be nala they
 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.150
from the University they be nala they
have to be knowledgeable about how to

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160
have to be knowledgeable about how to
 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.330
have to be knowledgeable about how to
use the resources in their field whether

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340
use the resources in their field whether
 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.040
use the resources in their field whether
it's engineering or literature or

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050
it's engineering or literature or
 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.730
it's engineering or literature or
business and so part of our job in the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740
business and so part of our job in the
 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.710
business and so part of our job in the
library is to make sure that this

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720
library is to make sure that this
 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.800
library is to make sure that this
happens and we do this by going into the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810
happens and we do this by going into the
 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.470
happens and we do this by going into the
classroom to teach information literacy

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480
classroom to teach information literacy
 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.910
classroom to teach information literacy
in the junior year and at that time

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920
in the junior year and at that time
 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.950
in the junior year and at that time
students know where what they're going

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960
students know where what they're going
 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.600
students know where what they're going
to do in their profession and they want

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610
to do in their profession and they want
 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.120
to do in their profession and they want
to find out how they're going to be able

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130
to find out how they're going to be able
 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.210
to find out how they're going to be able
to keep on learning because unlike

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220
to keep on learning because unlike
 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.880
to keep on learning because unlike
people who went to school in years past

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890
people who went to school in years past
 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.700
people who went to school in years past
they are not going to be doing the same

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710
they are not going to be doing the same
 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.730
they are not going to be doing the same
job their whole lives they're going to

job their whole lives they're going to
 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.600
job their whole lives they're going to
have to learn to do new jobs so in many

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610
have to learn to do new jobs so in many
 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.210
have to learn to do new jobs so in many
fields as quickly as less than a year

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220
fields as quickly as less than a year
 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.010

students already have to be actively

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020
students already have to be actively
 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.950
students already have to be actively
seeking seeking new knowledge in order

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960
seeking seeking new knowledge in order

their field and that's an important job
 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.870
their field and that's an important job
for the libraries to make sure students

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880
for the libraries to make sure students
 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.500
for the libraries to make sure students
know how new information is created and

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510
know how new information is created and
 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.160
know how new information is created and
used in their discipline
