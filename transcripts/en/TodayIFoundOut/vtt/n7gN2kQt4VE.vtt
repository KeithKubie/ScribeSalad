00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.029
The Beatles Worst Experience

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.560
The Beatles arrived in Manila to give two
concerts in early July of 1966.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.330
This was to be one of their gigs on their
1966 final-ever tour; they had just finished

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.220
a few very pleasant gigs in Germany.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.560
There were “bad vibes” almost from the
word “go” as the boys arrived at the Manila

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.560
airport.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.760
Ringo: “I hated the Philippines.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.460
It was like that hot/ gun/ Spanish inquisition
attitude.”

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.519
George stated, “As soon as we got there,
it was bad news.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.539
There were tough gorilla-little men in short
sleeves who acted very melancholy.”

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.879
The boys were greeted at the airport by severe-looking
armed guards and were sternly instructed to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.879
get on a boat.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.340
A bit scared already, they complied.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.579
This was actually the first time in their
time together that they were separated from

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.100
their manager or any of their aides while
on tour.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.500
They were taken to a limo and solemnly escorted
to their hotel.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.820
No one except them knew it, but they had another
reason to be scared.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.270
The Manila guards had confiscated the boy’s
traveling bags- which contained marijuana,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.090
which was illegal there as in many places.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.110
(Fortunately for the Fab Four, their bags
were not searched and their secret stash was

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.110
never discovered.)

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.530
At the time in Manila, the country was ruled
by the dictatorship regime of Ferdinand Marcos

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.740
and as soon as the Beatles got settled in,
they were told they were to attend a reception

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.320
for the country’s matriarch.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.970
Tired and jet-legged, they politely informed
the guards they would not be attending.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.579
A bit of arguing back and forth went on, but
the boys stuck to their guns and settled in

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.770
for the day.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.680
They were soon joined in their room by their
roadies, a few aides and their manager, Brian

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.680
Epstein.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.150
They played two concerts that night and all
went well.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.799
(They performed before two huge crowds of
30,000 and 50,000).

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.890
Their dressing room had been “a mess”
and they had been served a horrible meal of

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.609
corn flakes with lumpy, sour milk and some
other horrible-looking food, but thought nothing

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:03.609
of it.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.469
Little did they realize what was in store
for them.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.220
The next morning, as they arose, Ringo and
John tried to order breakfast from room service.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.570
There was an ominous quiet on the other end
of the phone line and their order was not

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.570
taken.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.590
As the boys casually turned on the TV, they
saw films of President Marcos and a huge group

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.870
of disappointed children with tears rolling
down their faces.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.319
Apparently, the Beatles had disappointed and
insulted the Madame President and crushed

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.010
the hearts of the little kids by “snubbing”
them.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.720
(Presumptuously, Madame Marcos had told the
young hopeful children that the Beatles would

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.370
be making an appearance and that they could
meet them in person without first clearing

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.430
it with the Beatles or their management.)

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.099
Moments later, a newspaper arrived with the
headline “Beatles Snub President”.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.849
After much ruckus, increasingly worried manager
Epstein decided to issue a formal apology

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.660
over Manila television.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.209
As Brian’s apology was being broadcast on
TV, the picture mysteriously went off and

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.980
dead air was transmitted to the viewing public.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.420
Now very afraid, the whole crew packed as
quickly as they could and asked to be driven

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.180
to the Manila airport.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.250
Instead of the huge motorcade that had welcomed
them the previous day, there was just a car

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.840
and a cheap one-motorcycle escort.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.780
As they arrived at the Manila airport, the
band and their entourage were summarily dropped

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.780
off.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.340
Forced to carry their own bags, the small
group hastily made tracks for the gates, but

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.060
were soon greeted by a huge, hostile, bloodthirsty
mob of furious Filipinos.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.050
As the frazzled group made a mad dash for
the gates, the Beatles and their aides were

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.120
kicked, punched, spit on and yelled at with
angry epithets.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
“We treat you like ordinary passenger!

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
Ordinary passenger!”, the airport personnel
unsympathetically informed them.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.299
(Strangely, the Beatles aides were all attacked
more furiously than the Beatles themselves-

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.110
the boys were to remember their hapless chauffeur,
Alf, getting kicked, bloodied, and pushed

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.870
down a flight of stairs.)

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.090
John and Ringo ran for sanctuary behind a
small group of Catholic nuns, while George

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.319
ran for refuge behind a nearby Buddhist monk.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.650
(Thank goodness for the ever present airport
clergy.)

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.310
Ringo got decked by an uppercut and was kicked
on the ground.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.310
He also suffered a sprained ankle from the
melee.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.120
By a strange “coincidence”, the escalator
was “out of order”, so the beaten-up young

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.610
men ran as quickly as they could, up the steps
to relative safety.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.390
Bruised and bloodied, they all finally made
it on board the plane.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.290
The terrified group waited nervously in the
severe humidity- afraid for their lives.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.830
An announcement came over the intercom, requesting
a meeting with manager Epstein, their press

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.240
agent and the Beatles’ personal assistants,
Mal and Neil.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.139
As Mal solemnly walked out of the plane, he
asked the Beatles to “tell Lil I love her.”

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.030
(Lil being his wife.)

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.139
It seems the “airport-leaving Manila tax”
was being levied and it just happened to be

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.259
the same amount the Beatles had been paid
in currency.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.000
Epstein paid the extortion money and the men
were permitted to return to the plane.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.210
(The amount was reportedly around $18,000-
$125,000 today.)

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.710
After another long wait, the exhausted, terrified
group got permission to take off and fly home.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.910
Ringo, always the most easy-going member of
the group, was to remember the Manila trip

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.759
of 1966 as “the worst experience of my life…

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:00.759
I thought they were going to put us in jail”,
he recalled.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.190
Peace-loving George was later interviewed
on television and said he’d like to “drop

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.340
a bomb” on the Philippines.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.639
The Beatles made a vow never to return to
Manila or the Philippines and the vow was

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.639
firmly kept.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.180
(Oh yes- one final, bizarre tidbit: the 80,000
fans in Manila the Beatles performed before

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.150
on that July day in 1966 is still the record
for the largest number of people the Beatles

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:35.699
ever performed before on a single day!)
