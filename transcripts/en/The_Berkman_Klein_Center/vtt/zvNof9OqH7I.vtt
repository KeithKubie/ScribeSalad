00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:32.080
 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.650
Hello.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.220
I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.270
This at the second segment of
the eighth lecture in a series of

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.430
lectures on copyright law.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.100
I'll be focusing here on the rights
of public performance and display.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.695
This part of the lecture was
originally prepared in 2013

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.760
but was revised in October
of 2014 to take into account

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.100
some recent developments
in this sector of the law.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.180
The statutory provisions that govern
the rights of performance and display

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.000
are relatively few,
but they're slippery.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.200
So it's important to be
attentive to nuances here.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.940
The primary provisions are subsections
4, 5, and 6 of section 106.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.850
As you can see, subsection
4 gives the owner

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.400
of the copyright in a literary,
dramatic, musical, choreographic,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.230
pantomime, or audiovisual
work the exclusive right

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.750
to perform that work publicly.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.890
Subsection 5 is analogous.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.640
It applies to the same
types of copyrighted works,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.860
plus pictorial, graphic, or sculptural
works and the individual images

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.732
of an audiovisual work.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:45.020
It gives the owner of such things
the right to display them publicly.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.210
Finally, subsection 6.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.630
This was added quite recently,
specifically in 1996.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.600
As I hope you'll recall
from lecture number 3,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.640
before 1996 the owners of copyrights and
sound recordings in the United States

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.730
did not enjoy any rights
in public performance.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.530
At that time, the only provision
dealing with public performances

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.650
was subsection 4.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.990
And if you look back at
that subsection, you'll

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.480
notice that sound
recordings do not appear

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.130
in the list of types of
works that are covered.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.010
Musical works appear.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.250
As you know by now, that means musical
compositions but not sound recordings.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.690
As I explained in lecture
number 3, the record companies

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.470
that hold the copyrights in most
commercially valuable sound recordings

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.710
have long complained about
this state of affairs.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.570
In 1996 and then with a little
bit of adjustment in 1998,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.260
Congress responded partially
to the record companies' pleas

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.630
and granted them a limited,
very limited, public performance

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.110
right, which is now
embodied in subsection 6.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.190
As you can see, it only
applies to performances, quote,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.600
"by means of a digital
audio transmission."

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.530
In just a minute, I'll
give you some examples

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.040
of transmissions that
fit within this phrase.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.580
 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.690
The crucial terms in these
three statutory provisions

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.390
are performance, display, and public.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.490
Fortunately, all three are defined
in Section 101 of the statute.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.470
As you can see, perform means
to recite, render, play, dance,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.900
act, either directly or by
means of any device or process,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.080
or, in the case of a motion picture, to
show any of its images in any sequence

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.460
or to make the sounds
accompanying it audible.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.850
This is a very capacious definition.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.990
I'll give some examples
of its reach shortly.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.760
Display is defined as, quote,
"to show a work, either directly

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.740
or by means of a film, slide, television
image, or other device or process."

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.320
The key word here is show.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.350
Both performances and
displays of copyrighted works

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.650
can only give rise to liability
if they're done publicly.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.530
Section 101 defines publicly
as one of two things.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.720
The first of these two
subsections is sometimes

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.490
called the Public Place Clause.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.329
It classifies as public a performance
or display, quote, "at a place

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.870
open to the public or at any place
where a substantial number of persons

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.350
outside of a normal circle of a family
or social acquaintances is gathered."

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.100
This is the more intuitively
plausible meaning of public.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.600
The second subsection is sometimes
known as the Transmit Clause.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.930
It says that another way in which
you can perform or display a work

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.850
publicly is, quote, "to transmit or
otherwise communicate the performance

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.680
or display to a place specified
in clause 1 or to the public

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.550
by means of any device or process,
and whether the members of the public

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.950
are capable of receiving the performance
or display receive it in the same place

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.600
or in separate places, in the
same time or at different times."

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.730
That, as we'll soon see, is a
very generous definition of public

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.440
that sweeps within it many ways
in which copyrighted materials are

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.550
made available today.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.240
 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.660
Those are the main statutory provisions.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.820
Now let's turn to some examples to
give these provisions a bit of shape.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.260
Here's a hypothetical but
not implausible scenario,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.640
the purpose of which is to
illustrate these concepts.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.510
Suppose A sings a copyrighted
musical composition

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.890
into a microphone in a recording studio.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.530
Record company B records
A's rendition on a record.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.070
I know these technologies
are quaint, but bear with me.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.420
Suppose C purchases a copy
of the record and plays it

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.590
on a turntable in his
or her living room.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.800
Sounds are generated, either from
the turntable directly or more likely

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.140
from an amplifier and a set of
speakers connected to the turntable.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.010
Those sounds spread
through C's living room.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.690
Another copy of the record
is purchased by radio station

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.370
D. A disc jockey working for the radio
station plays the record on a turntable

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.870
there.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.170
The signal generated by the radio
station is broadcast over the airwaves.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.460
The broadcast is
represented in this diagram

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.020
by the dotted line on the slide.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.480
More specifically, this is a traditional
analog, over the air transmission.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.480
It's received in the home of
E, who, in her living room,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.220
plays another stereo,
depicted by a boombox.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.530
Sound comes out of the
speakers into E's living room.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.200
The next day, the disc jockey
plays the record again,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.800
broadcasting it again
through an analog signal.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.290
This time, it's received by a
tuner and an associated stereo

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.570
system located in a restaurant.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.645
The sounds generated by the stereo
spread through the restaurant.

00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:04.130
The customers, eating
their meals, hear it.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.760
The next month, the radio station shifts
to a digital broadcasting technology.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.480
The DJ plays the record again.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.610
Suppose cable system G
picks up the digital signal

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.480
and relays it, through
a cable of course,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.570
to homeowner H, who plays it
through a stereo in her home.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.600
Finally, suppose that the station
abandons over the air broadcasting

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.650
altogether and shifts to
webcasting over the internet.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.850
Yet again, the DJ plays the record.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.430
The owner of a laptop residing in
another state receives that webcast

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.400
and listens to it in her living room.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.760
Now let's consider
the legal significance

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.200
of this sequence of events.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.900
My suggestion, when you're confronted
with a real or hypothetical story

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.880
of this sort, is that you
analyze it in three steps.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.650
Breaking the issues down this way
may seem needlessly laborious,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.250
but it will help alert you
to some hidden landmines.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.380
Step number 1 is to identify
all of the performances.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.850
Keep in mind the capacious definition
of performance in the statute.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.800
Also keep in mind that
when dealing with music,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.370
you have to look for both
performances of musical compositions

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.440
and performances of sound recordings.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.610
Let's start with the musical work.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.240
Here are all the places in the
hypothetical story where and when

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:35.679
the musical work, abbreviated
with MW, was performed.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:40.100
When A sings the song,
that's a performance.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.230
When the sound emerges from the record
player in the living room of C's home,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.200
that's also a performance
of the musical work.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.195
When the radio station plays
the record the first time,

00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:53.160
it too is performing the musical work.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
This is slightly less
obvious, but remember

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.260
that the term performance includes
to render a work either directly

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.860
or by means of any device or process.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.830
That has been construed to include
sending signals of this sort.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.200
When E receives the
signal in her living room

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.070
and sends the sound out
into her living room,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.530
that's yet another separate performance.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.510
Same thing happens with the restaurant.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.420
When the station sends the signal
containing a rendition of the song,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.640
that's a performance.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.840
When the restaurant receives that
signal and plays it for its customers,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.020
that's another performance.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.640
Things get even more complicated
when we get to the cable system.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.190
Here there are three
performances, by the station when

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.910
it broadcasts the rendition of
the song, by the cable system when

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.660
it relays that signal,
and by the homeowner

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:47.110
who receives the relayed signal
and plays it in her home.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.270
With respect to the webcast,
there are only two, by the station

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.420
and by the recipient when she plays it.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.845
Each time A's rendition
of the musical work

00:09:56.845 --> 00:10:00.770
is performed, the sound recording
embodying that rendition is also

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:07.660
performed, except of course when A sang
it, because there's no recording yet.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.120
Why differentiate the
performance of the musical work

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.330
and the performances
of the sound recording?

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.350
Because the copyrights in these things
may well be held by different parties

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.430
and because, as you already know,
they're governed by different rules.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.930
All right.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.280
That's step 1 of the analysis.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.850
Having identified all
of the performances,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.492
the next step is determine
which of them are public.

00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:36.200
If they're not public, we don't
have to worry about them anymore.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.780
If they are, we'll have
to proceed to step 3.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.870
This one is not public, because it's
done in the studio without an audience.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.760
And this doesn't fit either of
the two definitions of public.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.670
Neither of these two
performances, of the musical work

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.990
or of the sound recording, is public,
because they occur in C's living room.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.390
The same is of course true of E's living
room, H's living room, and I's living

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.120
room.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.510
The radio station, however, is
in a very different position.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.840
Every time it broadcasts a
signal containing the song,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.940
it is publicly performing both the
composition and the sound recording.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.290
The relevant definition of public
is, of course, the Transmit Clause,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.990
specifically this part of the clause.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.040
Quote, "to transmit a performance
of the work to the public,

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.140
even if the members of the public
capable of receiving the performance

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.110
receive it in separate places
or at different times."

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.400
The result is that, even if
all of the station's listeners

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.110
are home alone in their living rooms,
the transmission of the signal to them

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.440
is still public.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.992
The same is true of the
transmission by the cable company.

00:11:47.992 --> 00:11:50.770
This may not be altogether obvious
to you, but in a few minutes

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:55.430
I'll return to the special
legal status of cable companies.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.580
What about the performance
in the restaurant?

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.560
That's not a transmission, so the
Transmit Clause is not relevant.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.460
But the other definition of public, the
so-called Public Space Clause, applies.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.740
What if there's only one patron
eating dinner when the song is played,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.140
or indeed no customers at all?

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.220
Doesn't matter.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:20.760
So long as the restaurant is open to
the public, the performance is public.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.570
The third and last step is to survey
the public performances we've identified

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.850
and determine if there any
grounds for exempting them

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.470
from the reach of the statute.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:34.400
There are several possible exemptions,
one of which you already know.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.800
If the work performed
is a sound recording

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.770
and if the way in which it is performed
is not a digital audio transmission,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:46.290
then it's not covered by
either 106(4) or 106(6).

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:52.265
So all of these performances escape,
either because they are analog or they

00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:54.570
are not transmissions.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.380
For the time being,
anyway, these do not.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.990
 

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.500
This concludes our survey of the basics.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.750
Now let's consider some refinements.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.340
Focus on the upper right-hand
corner of the diagram.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.250
You'll recall that the way in
which the music got into E's ears

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.670
is that singer A sang the
composition, record company B recorded

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.260
A's rendition, radio
section D played the record

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.940
and broadcast the signal
over the airwaves.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.230
E's radio, located in her living
room, picked up that signal

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.670
and converted it into sound waves.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.420
If E listens to the music
while alone in her living room,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.000
the two performances that
occur within the red rectangle

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.260
are surely not public.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.540
Now let's alter the facts slightly.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.151
Suppose that E's dining room
is adjacent to her living room.

00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:45.900
She has a dinner party
in the dining room,

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.610
and the invitees are able to hear
the music coming out of the radio.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.950
Is that a public performance?

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:52.920
The answer is no.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.420
The guests are social
acquaintances gathered together

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.870
in a room that's not open to the public.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.620
Suppose that E is a professor.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.005
She invites the students in one of
her seminars to her house for dinner.

00:14:04.005 --> 00:14:06.610
The radio is playing in the background.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.900
Is that a public performance?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.860
This is closer to the line.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.600
The answer is still probably no.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.690
But an argument might be made
that E's home is now, quote,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.750
"a place where a substantial
number of persons

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.580
outside of a normal circle of a
family and its social acquaintances

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.120
is gathered."

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.390
Change the facts once again.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.580
The personnel are the same.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.320
But instead of hosting
her students in her house,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.196
E holds a party in a semi-separate
room of a restaurant.

00:14:35.196 --> 00:14:38.970
The radio in the room
plays A's rendition.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.960
Is that a public performance?

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.750
Yes.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.090
The restaurant is a place
that's open to the public.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.220
And therefore, under the
first of the two clauses,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.640
would clearly be considered public.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.630
Now suppose that E takes her radio
to a public park at 5 o'clock

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.120
in the morning, tunes
it to the D station,

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.310
and listens to it while
doing some exercises.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.760
The park is otherwise empty, so
no one but E hears the radio.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.730
Is that a public performance?

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.910
Strictly speaking, yes, because
the place is open to the public,

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.140
even though she's the only listener.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.160
The chances of copyright owners
pursuing her for infringement

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.220
are tiny, but at least technically
that's a public performance.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.330
It's still possible
that it may nevertheless

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.210
be excused by one of the exceptions
we'll consider later in this lecture.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.590
But E is at least
presumptively in trouble.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.230
For the past few minutes, we've been
considering possible applications

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:39.360
of the first and more intuitive of the
definitions of public, the Public Place

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.860
Clause.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.380
The more serious and economically
important puzzles in this area

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.180
arise under the second branch,
the so-called Transmit Clause.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.880
Here are three illustrative cases.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.530
The first is Redhorn, one of the
old chestnuts of copyright law.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.840
It involved a very early
application of VCR technology.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.410
The defendant operated a somewhat
shady operation that rented VHS tapes

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.890
but also provided small, carpeted
rooms in the back of the facility where

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.420
you could have a VHS tape played.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.350
Here's how the system worked.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.370
The customer would walk into
the front of the store, where

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.350
he'd see many tapes displayed.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.970
He'd select one.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.130
The attendant would place it
into a VCR and activate it.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.710
The customer would retire to a
room in the back, where he alone,

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.920
or with a companion or
two, would watch it.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.260
The court of appeals ruled that this
system entailed public performances

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:46.350
of the audiovisual works on the VHS
tapes for two independent reasons.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.870
First, because the facility
is open to the public.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.050
This again is a bit counterintuitive.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:56.480
After all, it's only open to a couple of
members of the public at a given time.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.750
But as a whole, it's open
to the public and that's

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.510
enough to render the performances
public under clause number 1.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.280
The second reason is more
interesting for our purposes.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.069
The performances are also public
because they involve transmissions.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.880
Short transmissions, to be sure,
presumably from the front desk

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.550
to the room in the back, but
transmissions nevertheless.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.079
And members of the public are capable
of receiving those transmissions

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.470
in the same place or separate
places at different times.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.660
The court didn't spell
this out in great detail.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.650
But its analysis seems to be
that a given audiovisual work is

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.820
shown to successive customers
or groups of customers

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.850
in the same room at different times
through the same transmission facility.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.550
That's enough to make it public
and to make the proprietor liable

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:53.350
for some $44,000.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.920
The second case is the
important recent decision

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.430
in Cablevision, one aspect of which
I discussed in the previous lecture.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.310
The essential facts are
depicted on this slide.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.680
If this is mysterious
to you, please pause

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.560
to review the pertinent
section of lecture number 7.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.560
As you'll recall, I hope,
the owners of the copyrights

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.840
in the works that would be stored
and then replayed by Cablevision

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.770
challenged this technology
on three grounds.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:28.120
A, that the brief retention of
slices of each work in the BMR buffer

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.210
constituted in the aggregate an
unauthorized reproduction of the work.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:38.110
B, that the more durable retention of
a copy on the hard drive of the Arroyo

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.120
server also violated 106(1).

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.540
And C, that the transmission from
the Arroyo server to the customer,

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.110
when the customer asks to watch
one of his saved programs,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.400
constitutes a public
performance of the work.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.770
The trial court, as we saw,
accepted all three claims.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.200
But the court of appeals
rejected all three.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.100
How did the court of appeals
reject the third argument?

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.010
It might have done so by ruling that
even if the transmission involved

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:13.730
a public performance, that transmission
is initiated by the subscriber

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.210
when he presses the button on his
remote control in his living room,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.310
not by Cablevision.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.070
But it did not.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.290
The court assumed, for
the sake of argument,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.700
that Cablevision is responsible
for the transmission.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.550
Nevertheless, it ruled that
the transmission did not

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.140
violate Section 106(4).

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.540
Crucial to this ruling are two
facts-- that the transmission is only

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.280
delivered to one person at a time
and that each subscriber receives

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.000
his transmission from
the unique copy the work.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.680
If Cablevision transmitted the work
to multiple subscribers seriatim

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.390
from the same copy, then in
the court of appeals' judgment,

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:00.990
this case would resemble Redhorn, which,
as we saw, gave rise to liability.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.530
But the fact that each subscriber
received a transmission

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.560
from his own personal copy
made all the difference.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.440
Here's the crucial
language from the opinion.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.780
"Because each RS DVR
playback transmission

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.510
is made to a single subscriber
using a single unique copy produced

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:24.110
but that subscriber, we conclude that
such transmissions are not performances

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.220
to the public and
therefore do not infringe

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.360
any exclusive right of
public performance."

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.480
This fact was also emphasized
by the solicitor general

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.050
when advising the Supreme Court
not to review the decision.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.770
 

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.700
As we saw in lecture number
7, the ruling in Cablevision

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.680
catalyzed a great deal of
investment in cloud-based services--

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.770
several billion dollars.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.310
However, the aspect of the
court's ruling I just emphasized

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.470
renders that investment less
efficacious than it could be.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.250
Why?

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.670
Because constructing systems
that store individual copies

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.430
of works for individual
subscribers is very inefficient.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.590
The Cablevision ruling also catalyzed
considerable innovation with respect

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:14.280
to technologies and business models
in the entertainment industry.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.770
When those innovations have been
challenged by copyright owners,

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.330
some have been held to
be lawful, while others

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:25.020
have been ruled to run
afoul of the owner's rights.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.520
The most important of the
innovations that came to grief

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:35.500
was the service briefly offered by
Aereo, an ingenious but risky startup.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.780
To understand the nature and
novelty of the Aereo system,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.310
you need a bit of background.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.580
For a long time, as you probably
know, television stations

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.750
have been broadcasting
entertainment and sports

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.000
programming free over
the public airwaves.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.450
This system has worked well
for consumers located in

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.020
metropolitan areas with
good television reception,

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:01.040
but less well for consumers in
rural areas with poor reception.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.680
For several decades, the
latter group of consumers

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.700
has overcome this impediment by
subscribing to cable television

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.920
services such as Comcast
in the United States.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.930
Among the many channels that
cable companies typically

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:20.070
carry are over the air broadcasts
that the cable systems pick up

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:25.400
in major cities and then we
redistribute through their cables.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.590
Do the cable companies
have to pay the owners

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:32.490
of the copyrights in the programs
that they relay in this fashion?

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.920
When cable systems
were first introduced,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.665
the Supreme Court answered
no, on the grounds

00:22:37.665 --> 00:22:42.080
that the cable companies neither
reproduced nor publicly performed

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.320
the programs.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.770
In 1976, Congress repudiated
that position and in the process

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.280
adopted the expansive
definition of public performance

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.740
with which we've been wrestling.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.690
Since then, the cable
companies have been

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.550
obliged to pay copyright owners
whose programs they retransmit,

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:04.260
although the amount they pay is
capped by a special compulsory

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.920
license of the sort
I've mentioned before

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:12.730
and we'll consider again in the
final segment of this lecture.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.260
Nowadays, a growing
group of consumers get

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.620
access to audiovisual entertainment
not through over the air broadcasts

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.150
or by subscribing to expensive cable
systems, but through the internet.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.330
This arrangement works fine
if the programming they want

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.190
is available either for free,
from sites like YouTube,

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.530
or from various fee-based
on-demand or subscription services

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.370
now accessible through the internet.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.240
But what if the programming they want
to watch is broadcast over the airwaves

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.290
by television stations
located in distant cities?

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.320
Until recently, there was
no convenient way for them

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.410
to gain access to that material.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.240
Enter Aereo.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.600
For consumers of the
sort I've just described,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.240
located in the New
York metropolitan area,

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.590
Aereo set up a new subscription service.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.310
Here's how it worked.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.690
Suppose, counterfactually, that
I live in Westchester County.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.780
I'm a fan of the New York
Yankees baseball team.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.510
And I don't subscribe to cable TV.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:23.470
A subset of Yankees games are broadcast
on WWOR, an over the air television

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.970
station based in northern New
Jersey, which operates a broadcast

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.880
tower on the top of the
Empire State Building.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.260
When I'm at home, I watch
the broadcast for free.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.420
But I often travel for
work, and I want to watch

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.100
the games when I'm on the road.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:46.210
For a fee of $12 per month,
Aereo would, at my request,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.170
pick up the broadcast of a particular
game, convert it to packets,

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.040
and stream those packets
to me over the internet,

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.430
enabling me to watch the
game on my laptop or tablet.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.080
Now if the way that Aereo
picked up the program

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:07.330
was by building and operating a
single big TV receiver on Long Island,

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.450
then it would have been working
very much like a cable company

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.440
and thus would have
been obliged to pay fees

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.190
to the owners of the copyrights
in the broadcast of the games.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.710
But it didn't.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:22.850
Instead, Ariel obtained thousands
of tiny TV antennas, each

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.390
the size of a dime, which
it arranged in arrays.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.370
Then, when I asked to
see a particular game,

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:34.550
Aereo would rent me one of
those tiny, individual antennas

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:39.430
and tune it to the free,
over the air broadcast.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.940
One more potentially important
feature of Aereo's system.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.170
The game would not be shown to me live.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:51.400
Instead, like Cablevision, Aereo
captured and recorded the live program.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.790
The packet sent to me would be
from that personal recording.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.780
However, the resultant lag
time was tiny, a few seconds.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.620
A different service offered
by Aereo, not considered

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.500
in the judicial opinion
that I'm about to describe,

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.310
allowed subscribers like me to
time-shift programs-- for example,

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.890
to replay the recording
of the game hours or days

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.020
after it was first broadcast.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.370
But for the time being, keep your
focus on the nearly live broadcasts.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.170
 

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.410
By now, it should be
obvious that the reason why

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.700
Aereo used this seemingly bizarre
technology was to make its system

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.250
resemble, as closely as possible,
the system created and upheld

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.560
in the Cablevision
decision and thus to avoid

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.840
having to pay for the material it
was supplying to its subscribers.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.870
At first it seemed that
Aereo had succeeded.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.310
When copyright owners
challenged the system,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.800
the trial court ruled in favor
of Aereo, relying heavily

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.040
on the Cablevision doctrine.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.790
So did the court of appeals for the
Second Circuit, by a vote of 2 to 1.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:00.890
But the Supreme Court granted
certiorari and in July

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:06.290
of 2014 reversed by a vote of 6 to 3.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.270
The basis for the
Supreme Court's ruling,

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.520
unfortunately, is not completely clear.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.440
Justice Breyer, writing
for the court, repeatedly

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.520
stressed that Aereo's business
looked a lot like a cable television

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.490
service, which Congress had made
clear both A, performed programs

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:29.150
they relayed, and B, made those
performances to the public.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.040
But what about the aspect
of the Aereo system

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.650
that differentiated from a cable system?

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:39.130
Namely, that each Aereo subscriber
received an individual transmission

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:43.240
from an individual copy
of the program at issue.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.680
Breyer's answer, in brief, was that
neither the subscribers nor the owners

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.360
of the copyrights in the programs cared
about what was going on under the hood,

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.860
and so neither should the law.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.540
Breyer's analysis is distilled in the
sentence set forth on your screen.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.060
"In light of the purpose and
text of the [Transmit] Clause,

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.130
we conclude that when
an entity communicates

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:13.880
the same contemporaneously perceptible
images and sounds to multiple people,

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.840
it transmits a performance
to them regardless

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.640
of the number of discrete
communications it makes."

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.640
This language is quite broad.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.550
Among other things, it
seems to render irrelevant

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.850
the factor that the court of appeals
treated as so important in Cablevision.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:35.550
Namely, whether a transmission is
made to a single subscriber using

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:40.610
a single unique copy
produced by that subscriber.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:45.640
Does this then mean that
RS DVR services are doomed?

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.320
Some copyright owners and
commentators think so.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.750
My own view is no.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:55.200
Most RS DVR systems remain
lawful in the United States.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.280
The principal reason is that, although
Justice Breyer did not expressly

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.610
endorse the Cablevision
decision, he went out of this way

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:08.540
to emphasize several limitations on the
Supreme Court's ruling against Aereo.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.230
For example, Breyer stressed the fact
that neither Aereo nor its subscribers

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.666
had paid for access to the
programs that Aereo streamed.

00:29:16.666 --> 00:29:19.790
And Breyer strongly suggested that the
case would have come out differently

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.670
otherwise.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.800
Here's the crucial sentence,
quote, ""[A]n entity that transmits

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.030
a performance to individuals in their
capacities as owners or possessors does

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:35.740
not perform to 'the public,' whereas
an entity like Aereo that transmits

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.620
to large numbers of paying subscribers
who lack any prior relationship

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.840
to the works does so perform."

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.790
This sentence, although
not a model of clarity,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:52.550
would seem to leave a safe harbor for
cloud locker services and arguably

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.380
for services like Cablevision that
allow consumers who have already

00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.880
paid for programming to watch
those programs at later times

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.120
or in different places.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.530
Finally, Breyer pointedly
emphasized, quote,

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.990
""[T]he doctrine of 'fair use' can help
to prevent inappropriate or inequitable

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.490
applications of the [Transmit] Clause."

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.360
The potentially expensive safe harbor
that might be built on that sentence

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.140
will become apparent next week.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:26.180
Sadly, the net effect of the
Supreme Court's ruling in Aereo

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:30.410
is to reduce considerably the clarity
that in the wake of Cablevision

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:34.290
stimulated so much investment
in cloud-based technologies.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.930
For the next few years, lower
courts confronted with challenges

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.420
to businesses that offer consumers
new kinds of streaming services

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.710
will have to determine whether
they are more like Cablevision

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.030
or more like Aereo.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:52.480
Until the dust settles, entrepreneurs
and technology innovators will have

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.820
some trouble predicting
what they can and cannot do.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.090
An additional source of instability
is the divergence between the United

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.570
States and Europe with respect
to the permissibility of services

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.260
of this general sort.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.810
As I hope you'll call from the
first lecture in this series,

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.540
one of the multilateral treaties to
which the United States is a party

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.600
is the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.130
Articles 6 and 8 of that
treaty require member countries

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:27.080
to provide copyright owners a generous
version of the right of distribution

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.690
and a right of
communication to the public.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.120
Both provisions use the
phrase, quote, "make

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.260
available to the public,"
which arguably encompasses

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.572
more activities than
are reached by US law.

00:31:40.572 --> 00:31:42.405
Nevertheless, after the
treaty was ratified,

00:31:42.405 --> 00:31:45.820
the United States took the
position that this language did not

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:52.030
require any adjustment in US law
because sections 106(3) and 106(4),

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:55.680
as construed by the US
courts, already adequately

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.450
provided such a so-called
make available right.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.760
That contention was dubious
when it was first made

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.090
and has become more so over time.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:10.840
In Europe, as professor Jane Ginsburg
of Columbia Law School has shown,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.640
the right to make works
available to the public

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.480
is construed more broadly
than in the United States

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.460
and in particular is less forgiving
of cloud-based services of the sorts

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.970
we have been considering.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:29.080
As you can see on your screen, the
Information Society Directive of 2001,

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.190
which implemented in the EU
the WIPO Copyright Treaties,

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.120
requires EU member states
to, quote, "provide

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.940
authors with the exclusive
right to authorize or prohibit

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:45.190
any communication to the public of
their works by wire or wireless means,

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.460
including the making available to the
public of their works in such a way

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.600
that members of the public
may access them from a place

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.160
and at a time individually
chosen by them."

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.100
In 2013, the European
Court of Justice ruled

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.380
that a British company
called TVCatchup, which

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.650
had offered a service that
resembled that provided by Aereo,

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.710
violated this particular entitlement.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.910
The ruling forced a
redesign of TVCatchup,

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.290
and that company is now
in financial trouble.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.050
Even more striking was the
insistence by the European Commission

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:26.380
that Italy rescind a law that had
granted partial immunity to an RS DVR

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.100
service analogous to that
offered by Cablevision.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.030
 

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.420
The United States is not
likely in the near future

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.420
to adopt the EU's more
restrictive interpretation

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.000
of the so-called make available right.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.030
But the gap between the US and the EU
on this score is not good for business.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.650
In particular, it's likely
to bedevil enterprises

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:53.900
that seek to provide novel cloud-based
services not just to US customers

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.160
but to users of the
internet in other countries.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.620
I've concentrated in this lecture
entirely on section 106(4)

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.610
and have paid no attention to section
106(5), the right of public display.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.179
The reasons are that the bulk of
the economic and litigation action

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:15.340
involves performances, not displays,
and that the definition of display

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.620
is clearer and more intuitive
than that of performance.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.679
As you can see, the statute
defines display pretty much

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:26.130
the way you'd expect, as
to show a copy of the work

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.790
either directly or by means
of a film, slide, television

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:33.670
image, or other device or process,
or in the case of a motion

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:37.969
picture or other audiovisual work,
to show the individual images

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:40.250
nonsequentially.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.170
That definition creates few
interpretive difficulties

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.090
with respect to real space displays.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.340
Now recently, information
technology such as the practice

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:56.080
of framing websites have generated
some interesting interpretive problems.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.550
But I'll leave such
matters to the discussions

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.710
that will accompany this lecture.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.350
This concludes our discussion of the
rights of performance and display.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.773
After the break, we'll examine some
statutory limitations on those rights.

00:35:10.773 --> 00:35:11.273
