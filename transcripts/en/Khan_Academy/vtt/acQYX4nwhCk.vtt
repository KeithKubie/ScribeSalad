00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.200
In the last video, I showed
that a bunch of triangles

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.750
are similar to each
other to come up

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.890
with the relationship
between the focal length,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.450
the distance of an object
from the convex lens,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.450
and the distance of the image
of an object from that convex

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.950
lens.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.330
And I realized that there was
one extra low-hanging fruit

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.560
based on all of the
geometry that I had done,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.110
another relationship that
might come in useful.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.370
And that's the relationship
between the size

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.800
of the object-- or maybe
since it's an arrow here,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.670
we can call it the
height of the object,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.000
and the height of the image.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.370
And we really set up
everything already.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.640
We already figured out that
this triangle over here

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.680
is similar to this
triangle down here.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.420
And we figured out
in the last video

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.540
that this triangle over here
is similar to this triangle

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.960
over here.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.430
And since these
two are similar, we

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.920
could say that A is to
B-- we did this over here.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.710
I'll rewrite it.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.020
A is to B as-- and both
of those are the sides

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.350
opposite the right angles of
these two similar triangles.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.660
So that's going to be the same
thing as the ratio of the sides

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.650
opposite this yellow
angle right over here.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.230
So in this triangle over here,
since we started with A first,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.480
it's this height
right over here.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.230
Now what is this
height right over here?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.910
This is the height
of the object.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.590
So this is the
height of the object

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.339
is to-- Now what is
this opposite side

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:35.880
of this yellow angle
right over here?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.463
Well, this is the
height of the image.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.065
Or we know from the
last video the distance

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:44.815
of the object to the
distance of the image

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:46.870
is the same thing as A to B.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.750
So this is going to be
the same thing as this.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.010
So the ratio of the
distances is also

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.430
the same thing as the
ratio of their heights.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.240
So let me write it this way.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.970
So the ratio of the distance
from the object to the lens,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.640
to the distance from
the image to the lens,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.590
is the same as the
ratio of the height

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.770
of the object to the
height of an image,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.732
or to the image of that object.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:14.190
So I just wanted to do that
little low-hanging fruit there,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.020
since we set up all of
the mechanics already.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.520
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
