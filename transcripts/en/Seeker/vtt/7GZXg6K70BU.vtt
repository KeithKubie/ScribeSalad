00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.539
You put this out there every single day.
Anyone has access to it.

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:06.440
And they can learn a bucket load of
information about you.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.650
What is it?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.879
Hey peeeeps. Trace here for Dnews.

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.550
Any idea what I'm talking about? I'll give
you a hint.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.840
It has nothing to do with social media but
you do it every day.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.270
Still no guesses?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.020
It's pee.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.990
Urine. Piss. Mixture it.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.980
Yeah its pee, and it is dead
useful.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.020
You're probably wondering what I can
find out from your urine.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.410
Science has tools to find out what drugs you
are taking,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.540
what you've eaten,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.870
the health of your excretory system, whether
you're pregnant and crap ton

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.370
of other the things that you likely already
heard about.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.550
We wouldn't be Dnews if we only told you the
stuff that you already knew.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.920
So how about this: I could take your
urine and make brain cells.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.050
Urine contains water soluble waste that
your body doesn't need. It's filtered through

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.640
the kidneys and stored in the bladder
until you get rid of it.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.110
Reprogramming skin cells that make their
way into this waste, Chinese scientists created

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.500
brain cells.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.809
You're literally pissing away your brain cells.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.449
Using these cells scientists
believe we can turn little bits from our own

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.409
pee

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.920
into our own stem cells and use them to
cure diseases like Parkinson's or

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.380
Alzheimer's.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.640
Yeah from pee.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.030
Not good enough?

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.280
Okay

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.080
How about cancer?

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.570
Scientists in the UK created
an electronic nose that can tell if you have

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.250
bladder cancer with a single sniff of your
urine.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.210
Usually a cystoscopy has to be performed to
check the bladder

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.619
from the inside so it has to go

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.390
[gulp]

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.030
You know what, just look it up. It's awful.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460
This is way better.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.760
The odoreader has a 100 percent accuracy
at identifying bladder cancer in a thirty

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.740
minute window.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.880
That's pretty great.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.170
And if you're not worried about cancer, how
about something more

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.799
practical?

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.650
Students in Nigeria used urine to
create hydrogen power.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.810
And some scientists in the UK turn
similar technology into a pee-powered

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.799
cell phone charger.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.119
Both work by feeding pizzle to microbes
which turn the compound and

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.080
excrements into small amounts of energy.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.700
And it's not just phones and lights.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.119
NASA was looking at this technology to
hydrazine as a propellant that can be used

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.009
in rocket fuel.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.979
And using micro organisms some Dutch

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.369
scientist were able to create hydrazine

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.060
from the ammonia in urine.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.420
Ammonia is what gives your pizzle that acrid
smell.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.310
Unfortunately the hydrazine was created
in such small quantities that NASA lost

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.590
interest.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.900
If you're more into the practical
fun of urine. You know, writing writing your

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.280
name in the snow.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.540
Or whatever. Then you should check out
Captive Media, a London-based company, that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.090
uses your stream to power video games.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.730
You can create art, which is

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.980
shareable via email thank goodness,
navigate ski slopes and even play trivia

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.310
games.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.700
Aside from games, some Singaporean urinal
cakes can

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.450
identify how drunk you are

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.480
by testing biomarkers in your tinkle.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.480
Paired with RFID tags, these unusual

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.340
urinals can alert valet workers that
certain drivers might be too

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.440
drunk to drive home.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.480
Are you gonna look at your pee a little
differently now?

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.400
Is this gross science or just great stuff?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.820
Share your thoughts with us and hey, don't
forget to flush.
