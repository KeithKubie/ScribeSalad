00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.950
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.870
Obesity seems to be on the rise.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.260
Polls and studies like a 2014 Gallup-Healthways
poll show that nearly a third of all Americans

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.410
are clinically obese.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.340
But it’s not just the ends of the scale,
most people are on average are 10 percent

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.140
heavier than the average person 30 years ago.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.420
Seems everyone’s a little rounder in the
middle.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.420
So are we lazy?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.890
Or are did previous generations screw us over?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.680
Well recent research suggests we aren’t
getting lazier.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.420
It seems even if you eat the same amount of
calories and exercising the same amount, your

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.390
BMI might be 2.3 points higher than Marty
McFly according to a new study Obesity Research

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.439
and Practice.

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:49.970
So what’s going on?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.370
Maybe It’s not just the food we eat or the
amount of streaming binges we do.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.910
Maybe it’s environmental too.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.670
I mean, believe it or not there’s evidence
that all animals are getting bigger.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.070
And dogs just don’t marathon shows in one
sitting.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.800
Which is just crazy like why haven’t we
talked about this before?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.810
In a study published in the journal Proceedings
of the Royal Society B, Researchers looked

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.330
at 20,000 animals from 8 different species.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.090
They called these species “canaries in the
coalmine”, animals that live near and around

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.390
us that could give us clues if things are
heading south.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.560
They found that several species like cats
and dogs and rodents ARE getting bigger.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.460
Which I know you’re probably thinking, like
as our diets get more processed and less healthy,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.460
so do theirs!

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.549
But the weight gain held true not just for
wild rats living off our trash but even rats

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.780
in labs fed a specially controlled diet got
chubbier.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.780
Some researchers point the finger at “Obesogens”
which a study published in the journal Environmental

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.969
Health Perspectives defines as “dietary,
pharmaceutical, and industrial compounds that

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.250
may alter metabolic processes and predispose
some people to gain weight”.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.890
Basically the idea is that low background
levels of certain chemicals can be linked

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.759
to an increase in weight.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.759
What chemicals?

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.590
The study implicates several chemicals like
DDE —a DDT breakdown product), the notorious

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.060
(BPA) used in plastics, and PFOA used as a
protective coating on some fabrics like carpets.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.909
Sometimes these chemicals find their way into
an expecting mother from a water bottle, from

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.569
upholstery and disrupts the fetus’s development.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.760
In several animal studies, the generation
exposed to chemicals while in the womb were

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.950
fatter than their parents.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.300
The most common theme of these chemicals,
is that they’re known endocrine disrupters.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.800
These types of chemicals are frequently linked
to ill health effects like weight gain.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.360
They can change the way adipose cells, or
fat cells work.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.860
Rather than triggering the body to make more
of these fat cells, endocrine receptors can

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.500
make the cells hold more.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.700
The cells get bigger.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.500
But maybe there’s more than just what we’re
exposed to in the environment.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.170
Even routinely prescribed medication seem
to have weight gain as side effect.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.140
70% of Americans take some form of prescription
drug.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.260
And antidepressants are one of the most common,
more than 10% of people are on them at one

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.260
point or another.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.250
Unfortunately many are linked to a rise in
weight.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.990
Not because they change fat cells necessarily
but because they increase appetite.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.680
But that could be because loss of appetite
is a symptom of depression.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.300
So maybe these people lost weight because
they were depressed and simply put their normal

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.540
weight back on.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.090
Other studies like one published in PLOS one
show a strong link between weight gain and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.620
almost all antipsychotic medication.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.410
And other common medications like anti seizure
meds, and ironically medications for blood

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.320
pressure and diabetes can lead to some people
putting on the pounds.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.530
But it’s hard to tell what’s really causing
the link between gaining weight and these

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.530
drugs.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.370
But authors of the study published in the
journal Obesity Research &amp; Clinical Practice

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.320
think besides all that I’ve mentioned, our
microbiomes might be to blame too.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.560
Maybe the hormones and antibiotics in our
food might be changing the gut bacteria that

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.380
helps us digest food, potentially leading
to more weight gain.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.350
But it’s kind of hard to take a sample of
someone’s microbiome from 30 years ago to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.250
compare it to the microbiomes of today, so
it’s hard to draw hard conclusions here.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.930
But all this taken together makes a strong
case that there’s more to the story than

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.030
just diet and exercise.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.280
Some people think health food could be to
blame.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.180
Matt Lieberman finds out the answer in this
episode, right here.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.510
So what do you think?

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.250
What if diet and exercise can’t stop the
rise in obesity?

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.790
