00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.070
&gt;&gt; Kahin Mohammad: Well,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.960
and I'm a program specialist
here at the Library

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.880
of Congress's Young Reading Center.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.050
And I want to thank you

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.310

big friend of ours

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.140
and we're appreciative
of you coming out.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.390
I also want to thank
Tulane University,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.410 position:56%
Vanderbilt University class, also
Center for the Book, and the Library

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.870
of Congress as well
for hosting us today.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.370
We're very, very pleased to have
Duncan here to read his book

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.200
and also discuss with you all today
a very important subject matter

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.730
and topic, and we'll
hope you'll enjoy it.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.030
So thank you.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.590
And we'll have a question-answer
session at the very end.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.410
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Hi, everybody.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.130
Good morning.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.460
Buenas dias.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.050
So my name is Duncan Tonatiuh.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.020
And I write and I illustrate
children's books.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.370
And so this is one of
the books I've made.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.970
And so what I thought I'd do is I
will go over it quickly for those

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.340 position:56%
of you that don't know the book, and
then I want to show you a little bit

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.450
of the process of making the book.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.830
Tell you a little bit more
of why I wrote the book

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.700
and show you some other pictures.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.960
And I want to make sure I give
you guys time to ask questions.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.550
Maybe I'll show you some of my
other books if we have time.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.850
Does that sound good?

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.150
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.350
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: So
the other book is called

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.260
"Separate is Never
Equal, Sylvia Mendez

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.070
and Her Family's Fight
for Desegregation."

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.960
And this story is a true story.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.500
It happened about 70 years ago.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.890
And so it starts here and this
is the first page and we see

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.240
that Sylvia, right, she's very sad,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.770
and it's her first day
at this new school.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.450 position:56%
But a boy, a white boy, points at
her and says, you don't belong here,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.990
go back to the Mexican school.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.340
And so Sylvia doesn't want to
talk with anybody that day.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.930
And when she comes home from
school, she tells her mom, mom,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.300
I don't want to go to school
that anymore, the kids are mean.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.330
And her mom says, Sylvia,
[foreign language].

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.970
What does that mean?

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.270
[foreign language].

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.570
Yeah, don't you know
that is why we fought.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.460
And so then Sylvia remembers
all that had to happen

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.560 position:56%
so that she could go to that school.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.990
So she remembers how she moved from
the city of Santa Ana in California

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.980
to the town of Westminster.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.480
And in this town, her
family was leasing a farm.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.830
And in the farm they were going to
grow asparagus, tomatoes, chilies.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.950
And then because summer was
almost over, Sylvia's aunt,

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.550
her aunt Soledad, drove
Sylvia and her brothers

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.910
and also her cousin's Alice and
Virginia to the local public school

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.650
so they could attend
school when it started.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.480 position:56%
And they went there and Sylvia
thought it was a really nice school.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.080
It had those tall trees
in the front.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.690
There was a nice playground
in the back.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.310
And when she went in there, when
they went in there, her aunt talked

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.080
to the secretary at the
school, and she said,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.010
I'm here to bring my daughters
Alice and Virginia to the school

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.620
and also my niece Sylvia and
my nephews, Gonzalo and Jerome.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.020
And the secretary said,
your daughters Alice

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.890 position:56%
and Virginia can come to the
school, but Sylvia and her brothers,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.280
they cannot come to the school.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.260
They have to go to
the Mexican school.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.460
And Sylvia was very
confused when she said that.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.380
She said, why do I have
to go to a Mexican school?

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.680
I'm a US citizen.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.420
I was born here in
the United States.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.740
My father's from Mexico
but he became a US citizen.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.570
My mom is from Puerto Rico
which is a US territory.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.300
So why do I have to go
to a Mexican school?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.760
And that she wondered if it was
because of the color of her skin,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.350 position:56%
or because her last name was Mendez.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.910
And so her aunt told her that,
talked to the secretary, and said,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.040
but we all live in
this part of town,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.710
all the students should be
allowed to go school together.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.570
And the secretary said, no.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.160
The Mendez children have to
go to the Mexican school.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.830
So her aunt told her that and
said, I won't be enrolling any

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.880 position:56%
of the students at this school then.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.800
And so she drove back to the
farm and told Sylvia's father,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.750
Gonzalo, what had happened.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.810
And he said, oh, it must
be a misunderstanding.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.490
I'll go talk with the
principal or the superintendent

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.370
or someone at the school.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.240
So he talked with the
superintendent,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.970
a man named Mr. Atkinson.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.090
But Mr. Atkinson said
the same thing.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.920
The Mendez children have to
go to the Mexican school.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.710
And Mr. Mendez asked, but why?

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.330
And Mr. Atkinson said,
that's the way it's done.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.440
The Mendez children have to
go to the Mexican school.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.700
So that fall, Sylvia
and her brothers had

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.600
to go to the Mexican school.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:17.770
And the school was on Olive Street,
and everyone called that school

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.460
on Olive Street the Mexican
school because that's

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.280
where all the children
of Mexican parents

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.640
or all the Latino children
were sent.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.930
And the school was
a clapboard shack.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.820
It did not have any --
there was no playground.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.470
The students had to
eat their lunch outside

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.940
and it was next to a cow pasture.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.560
And that fence that kept the cows

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.150
in the pasture had
electricity running through it.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.810
So if any of the kids touched
it, they would receive a shock.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.200
But the worst thing
about the school was

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.110
that the teachers there didn't
care about the students' education,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.620
because they thought
they would all drop

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.760
out by the time they
were in eighth grade.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.440
They thought that they
would stop going to school

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.560
and they would just start
working in the fields.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.570
So they didn't really pay
attention to their education.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:10.070
And Sylvia's family didn't
think that that was fair.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.570
Her parents didn't
think that was fair.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.520
Sylvia didn't think
that that was fair.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.650
So her father decided to write
a petition, write a letter,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.040
saying that all children should be
allowed to go to school together.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.720
And he tried to get other
parents that had children

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.140
in the Mexican school to sign it,
but the other parents were scared

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.900
to sign it because they
thought they would get

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.150
in trouble or lose their jobs.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.210
Because their bosses were white.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.940
So they didn't want
to sign the petition.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:42.580
But Sylvia's father didn't give
up, and he kept talking to people.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:48.510 position:56%
And one day a truck driver that went
to his farm to pick produce told him

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.500
about a man named Mr. Marcus.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.800
And Mr. Marcus was a lawyer,
and he had helped the people

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.110
of a nearby city, in the
city of San Bernardino,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.220
to desegregate the public pool.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.730
Because at that time
not only in the '40s --

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.880
this story takes place in the '40s.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.900
Not only were schools divided but
also other places, like parks,

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.450
public pools, movie theaters.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.410
And children like Mexican
American children

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.110
or African-American children,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.450
Asian-American children
were not allowed to use them

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.170
or were only allowed to use them on
certain days or only certain parts.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.910
And so Mr. Mendez decided
that he was going to hire

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.790
that man Mr. Marcus even if he had
to spend all his savings to do so.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:40.950
So that he would help them
desegregate the school and make it

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.890
so that all the Mexican
American children go to school

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.220
with the other children,
with white children.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.830
And so Mr. Mendez and Mr.
Marcus started traveling

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.610
to the different towns
and cities in the county,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.050
in a county named Orange County.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.800 position:56%
And they talked with other families.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.690
Because it wasn't only Sylvia and
her brothers that weren't allowed

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.780
to go -- that were sent to Mexican
schools, but there were thousands

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.440
of children in the area that
were sent to the Mexican schools.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.380
And so while Sylvia's father
traveled around trying

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.000
to get more families involved
in the case, Sylvia's mother had

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.410
to do all the things that I
Sylvia's father usually did.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:28.470
Her mother, Felicitas, had to drive
a tractor and take care of the farm

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.700
and do all the things
that he usually did.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.910
And Mr. Mendez was able to get
different families involved

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.880 position:56%
in the case, like the Strata family.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.380
And Mr. Strata, he had fought
in World War II for the US Army.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.890
But when he came back, he saw that
his children weren't allowed to go

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.960
to school, that they were
sent to a separate school.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.960
So he didn't think
that that was fair.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.960
So he decided to join the case.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.560
And several more families of
the different cities and towns

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.700
in Orange County joined the case.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.510
And on March 2, 1945, the lawyer,
Mr. Marcus, went to a courthouse

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:14.040
in Los Angeles and filed a lawsuit.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.160
And so what that meant is
that the different families

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.410 position:56%
and different superintendents and
teachers from the schools would come

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.270
to a room, a room like this
or even larger than this.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.700
And at the front, there would
be a judge who would listen

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.520
and the different lawyers would
ask people to come to the stand.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.220
And so, for example,
on the first day,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.080
Mr. Marcus called to
the stand Mr. Kent.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.520
And Mr. Kent was in charge --

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.110
was the superintendent from
one of the schools in the area.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.070
And he asked him several questions.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.450
He said, why do you send the
Mexican-American children

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.750
to a different school?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.560
And he said, oh, it's
because they don't know how

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.720
to how to speak English.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.150
And Sylvia was very upset when
he said that because she knew how

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.630
to speak English perfectly well.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.750
And no one had asked
her or given her a test

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.560
to see if she spoke English.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.040
So that was not true.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.490
And then Mr. Marcus
kept asking questions.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.390
And then Mr. Kent started saying
some very mean things, like that --

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.540
he said that the Mexican
children always have problems.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.390
They were always dirty.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.440
They always have dirty
hands, face, neck, and ears.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.880
That they were inferior in their
ability to behave and their ability

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.680
to learn and their ability
to participate in the school.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:38.270 position:56%
And so the Mendez family was very
upset when he said all those things.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:43.390 position:56%
But it was -- but those things that
Mr. Kent said were things that a lot

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.190
of people at the time believed
and had that same attitude.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:52.780
And so the trial continued
for several more days.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.130
And so every day different people
were asked to come up to the stand

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.110
and they were asked questions.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.570
And so, for example, Sylvia's
father came up to the stand

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.990
and Sylvia's mother and Mr.
Atkinson from Sylvia's school.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.600
And Sylvia herself was
not called to the stand

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.610
because she was still young,
she was like eight years old.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.570
But a girl that was a little
older, named Carol Torres,

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.100
was asked to come to the stand.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.320
And she proved that she
spoke English perfectly well

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.630
and that it was not true
that she was being --

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.640
that the Mexican-American
children were being sent

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.730
to a different school
because of language.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.790
And then they also asked questions
to some college professors,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.710
some education specialists,

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.710
that said that it was
bad to divide children.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.190
Because then it makes
one group feel superior

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.160
and one group feel inferior, and
that children should be allowed

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.450
to go to school all together.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:52.890
And so the judge had to listen
to all these things, right,

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.790
and then he had to
decide who was right.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.840
Whether the school board, the
people from the schools were right,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.650
or whether the families,
like the Mendez family

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.580
and the other families involved
in the case, were right.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.460
And so he took almost a year
to decide, but he decided

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.960 position:56%
that the Mendez family and the other
Mexican-American families were right

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.750
and that all children should
go to school together.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.530
And so the Mendez family
was very happy,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.310
and the news appeared
in local newspapers.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.060
But they didn't have much time
to celebrate because the people

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.690
in charge of the schools
appealed the case.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.630
And what that means is they ask a
different judge that has more power

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.470
to review the case,
because they were hoping

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.550
that he would change the decision.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:47.500 position:56%
So this time, a judge in San
Francisco, in Northern California --

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.070
because this was happening
in Southern California --

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.560
had to review the case and had

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.390
to decide whether the Mendez
family should win again

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.390
or whether the schools should win.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.830
But this time while he was
deciding, different organizations

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.260
that represented different kinds
of people in different parts

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.220
of the United States started
sending letters to the judge

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.840
so that he would favor
the Mendez family.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.910
And so, for example, the National
Association for the Advancement

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.390
of Colored People, the
Japanese-American Citizens League,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.190
the American-Jewish Congress,

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.900
and other organizations
sent these letters.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.540
And on April 15, 1947, the
judge in the Court of Appeal

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.930
in San Francisco decided that the
Mendez family should win again.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.470
And that June, the Governor of
California signed a law that said

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.550
that all children in
California were allowed to go

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:48.040
to school together regardless
of race, ethnicity, or language.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.790
And so here is Sylvia, and it's
her second day at the school.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.600
And do you remember when we
first started the story, right,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.440
that's her first day at school.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.790
And she remembers all of this,
all the things that had to happen

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.970
so she could go to that school,
to the Westminster school.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:15.640 position:56%
And so the second day at school, she
doesn't listen to any of the kids

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.440
that say mean things to her.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.760
And she realized that other
kids want to be nice to her

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.480
and want to be her friend.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.800
And by the end of the
year, she makes a friend.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.980
And by the end of the school year,
she makes lots of friends of --

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.570
and she's friends with kids of
different backgrounds and races.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.000
And she's very proud to
be attending that school

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.360
because her family fought
very hard to make that happen.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.290
And that's the end of the book.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.590
Do you guys like it?

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.890
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:53.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: And like I
said, this story, it's a true story.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:16:00.350
So here's a picture of Sylvia
when she was about 10 years old.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:06.770
And this is a picture of Sylvia
a few years ago, in 2011,

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.070
when she received a medal.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.550
Do you see here that she has
a medal, she received a medal

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:15.320
from President Obama for
all her courage and all

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.860
that her family accomplished.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.390
And here's a picture of Sylvia's
father and Sylvia's mother

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.110
and that's a picture of
the Westminster school

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.130
that she was not allowed to go to.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.710
And that's the school
on Olive Street

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.260
that everyone called the Mexican
school that she had to go to.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.340
Do you guys have any
thoughts or questions so far?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.640
Yeah.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.980
&gt;&gt; Do you know Sylvia Mendez?

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.280
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Yeah.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.100
So I had the chance
to meet Sylvia Mendez.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.090
So this story I think is
a very important story,

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.350
but not a lot of people
know about it.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.490
I didn't learn about
it till recently.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.700
I learned about it like
three or four years ago.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:06.650
And there's -- raise your hand if
you've heard of Martin Luther King.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.120
Okay, put your hands down.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.630
Raise your hand if you've
heard of Cesar Chavez.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.130
Okay, a few of you.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:19.600
Raise your hand if you've heard of
Brown versus Board of Education.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.820
Okay, just a couple of you.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.250
So there's some civil rights
leaders, right, there's people

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.100
that sometimes you learn in
school, like Martin Luther King,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.960
which most of you have heard
about, that fought to bring justice

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.500
and equality in the United
States so that people

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.360
of different races could live
and have the same opportunities.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.700
But there's a lot of other
people that also fought for that

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.170
that you may not learn
about or hear as often.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.460
And so Sylvia's family
is one of these cases.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.380
And there's a similar case
that happened seven years

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.750
after all this happened
and involved a girl,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.450
an African-American girl,
that lived in Kansas.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.540
That also like Sylvia, she was
not allowed to go to the school,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.130
to the public school,
that was near her house,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.880
but she had to go much farther away
to a different school that was only

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.610
for African-American children.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.130
And her family didn't think that
this was fair and they fought

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:25.950
and eventually that helped
make it so that all children

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.450
in the United States could
go to school together.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.720
And some of the people that were
involved in that second case,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.210
that's very famous and that
some of you may learn about,

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.600
were first involved in this case,
like the Governor of California.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.870
He became a judge in that case.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:47.650 position:56%
And, for example, Thurgood Marshall,
who was the lawyer in that case,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:53.550
he sent letters for this
case, for the Mendez case.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.430
So going back to what
you asked, I only learned

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.690
about this story a few years ago.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:04.940
And I was at a book festival in
Texas, and Sylvia Mendez was there.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.720
And I had just learned about the
case, so I had a chance to talk

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.310
with her and ask her questions.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.930 position:56%
And so a lot of things in the book
come from talking with her directly.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.350
And other things in the book
come from doing research

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.530 position:56%
and reading different books and
reading different articles about it.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.160
Do you have a question?

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.490
&gt;&gt; Is Sylvia Mendez still alive?

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.790
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Yes.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.880
So let me show you guys
some other pictures.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.890
How do I exit this, do you know?

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.000
Like make it small.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.690
So let me show you some more
pictures from the time period.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:07.250
And I'll show you a
picture of Sylvia nowadays.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:17.000
Can you press down shift, please.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.900
So here's a picture
of Sylvia's parents,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.110
a picture of Sylvia's mother.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.540
And so, you know, I looked at
these pictures and that's how --

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.910
for my drawings, I tried to --

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.950
hopefully they look a
little bit like them.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.360
That's the school that everyone
called the Mexican school.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.420
That's Sylvia's parents.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.120
Sylvia's father.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.180
Sylvia's father and mother.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.600
That's Sylvia and her
two brothers and a nanny.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.320
That's her a few years ago.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.000
That's her when she
was 11 years old.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.500
That's her aunt Soledad,
that drove her to the school.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.080
That is the Westminster school.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.430
And that's a picture of Sylvia
a few years ago when I met her

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.150
and when I had a chance
to ask her questions.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.820
So she's still alive, and she
travels off to different parts

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.130
in the United States
and talks about the case

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.340
and about education
with different students.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:52.210
She is -- I forget her rage now --
but she's going to turn 80 soon.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.320
But she's a very active woman.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.730
And she's very nice
and very friendly.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:04.100
Yes? Let me bring you the mic.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.180
&gt;&gt; Are you the author
and the illustrator?

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.480
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Yes.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.880
So I am the author
and the illustrator.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:21.040
And so I want to ask you guys
a few questions about that.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.090
Well, here I just want to
show you this really quick.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.790
So, like I said, I talked
with Sylvia and that was one

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.820 position:56%
of the ways that I wrote this story.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.720
But I also learned when people
go to court, there's a secretary,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.470
there's someone that types
everything that people say.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:46.040
And so, for example, here, I
was able to read transcripts

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.670
of all the things that
were said during the case.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:55.350 position:56%
And you can see here what Mr. Marcus
said, Mr. Holden who was the lawyer

00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:00.200
for the school board, and
all the different questions

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.630
and all the different
things that they asked.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.130
I read through that, and then
after reading some of those things,

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.320
I used that for the story.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.580
I included some of
that in the story.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.480
But if we go back here,
I made drawings.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:27.370
And I want to see if you guys
notice anything -- let me go to --

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:36.200 position:56%
do you guys see how when I made my
drawings, they're always in profile?

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.500
What does that mean?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.300
Profiles, they're always
looking to the side.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.360
We never see them looking
with both eyes straight ahead.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:49.570 position:56%
And do you guys notice anything else
that strikes you about the drawings?

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:50.870
Let's hear over here.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:57.150
[inaudible response] I have
pictures in the drawings, okay.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.780
Anything else?

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.990
Over here.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.920
[inaudible response] Well, let's go
back to your question in a moment.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.900
But does anybody else
perceive anything different

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.380
or unusual about these drawings?

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.680
Over here.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.980
[inaudible response].

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.960
Okay. Yeah, yeah, maybe like
in this image, for example.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.640
Let me find it.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.290
Like here, right, their
body is facing one way

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.770
but their head is facing
another, kind of.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.870
And does anybody notice anything
interesting about their ears?

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:51.470
Their ears look a little bit like a
number three or a letter E, right?

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.950
Does anybody -- why do you guys
think I make my drawings like that?

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:01.800
Anybody want to take a guess?

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.060
Let's see, maybe over there.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.590
Yeah. [inaudible] Okay, to make it
more creative, that's part of it.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.890
Anybody else?

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.640
Here. [inaudible] To
make it more real.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.740
All right, so let me show you some
drawings that inspire my drawings.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:26.000
And these are drawings that
people made about 500 years ago.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.980
So these drawings are drawings
that the Mixtec people made.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:46.260
And the Mixtec were an indigenous
group from the South of Mexico.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.340 position:56%
And they would make their own books.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.130
And in their books,
they told their stories

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.100
about their kings and the warriors.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:58.730
And you can see that
in the drawings,

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.180
people are always in profile.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.620
They're always looking to the side.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.750
And the ears, you can see here,

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.690
that sometimes look a little
bit like the number three.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.270
And you can see that the hands
are often kind of like this like

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.320
or like this or like that.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.220
And so I looked at those things
and I thought that this art

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.270
that people made hundreds of
years ago was very interesting,

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.700
very creative.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.940
And I kind of wanted to
do something similar,

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.990
make drawings that are similar to
those, but make them about stories

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:30.550
that are happening now or that
happened in the recent past.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:38.510
So we go back to the book, maybe
you can see, you know, how the ears

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.460 position:56%
or the eyes or here maybe the hands,

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.610
I try and do it similar
to that style.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.200 position:56%
But then like you guys have noticed,
then I also used pictures --

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.980
let's find a large image.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.230
And I used different textures.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.530
Have you guys ever made a collage?

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.230
Raise your hand if
you've made a collage.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.430
Okay, you can put your hands down.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:11.200
So a collage is when you
cut different types of paper

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.870
or maybe pictures from magazines
or maybe different types of cloths,

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.120
and you glue it all
together to make a new image.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.160
So I do something like that
but I do it in the computer.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.410 position:56%
And so I graph, for example, this
brown paper, and that's one texture.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.780
And then, for example, this here,
her skirt is a different texture,

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.180
and, for example, her shoes.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.980
Maybe I'll take a picture of
something like a leather seat

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.220
and then I'll use part of that
picture to make her shoes.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.960
And that's how I make
the illustrations.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.660
[inaudible] Yes, so you
can see the hair here.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.080
So what that is -- I don't
have my own computer here,

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.260
otherwise I'd show you how I do it.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:01.940
But it's a picture, like I can
take a picture of someone's hair

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.860
or I find a picture of someone's
hair or a wig on the Internet,

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.510
and then I cut it out and glue it
there, that's basically what I do.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.670
But I do it in the computer
so it's a little neater.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.600
Because I'm kind of
a messy, messy guy,

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.090
so I just use glue and scissors.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.390
Other questions?

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.650
Let's see, over here?

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:31.050
Maybe they're going to
pass you the microphone.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:37.580
&gt;&gt; How do you make the pictures?

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:44.450
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Well, how about
I draw on a piece of paper, right,

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.240
just like a letter-size
regular piece of paper.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.350
I make a drawing with a pencil.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.660
So let's say I draw Sylvia.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.500
And then after I like the
drawing, I go over it with a pen.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.510
And after I draw with a pen, I
use a machine called a scanner.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:03.560
A scanner is a bit like
a photocopy machine.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.900
And you put it on top
of the scanner.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.330 position:56%
And there's a cable connected to the
computer and it goes [makes sounds].

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.390
And so then the drawing that I
did on a piece of paper appears

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.890
on the screen, like
on a computer screen.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.770
And then on the computer screen,
I put the different textures

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.290
and different colors on it.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.470
But what I want to do now is
show you how I make a book,

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:30.260
because it's related
to what you asked.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:42.890
How long do you guys think
it takes to make a book?

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.190
[inaudible].

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.890
Any idea? How long do you think
it takes me to make a book?

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.830
[inaudible] 30 what?

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.250
30 minutes?

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.550
Okay, let's see.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.110
Someone else, over there?

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.730
&gt;&gt; Maybe a month or four weeks.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.360
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Okay,
a month or four weeks.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.010
Let's see, back there?

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.310
Yeah?

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.610
&gt;&gt; A year maybe.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.910
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: A year maybe.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.150
Okay, so usually it takes
me about six months,

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.700
sometimes closer to a year.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.810
And so the first thing I do is, you
know, I have an idea for a story,

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:23.140
I write it out, and then
I send it to an editor.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.580
An editor is a person kind of
like a teacher, who reads it

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.970
and then gives me comments and
says, oh, okay, this is very good,

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.290
but I'm not sure what's going
on here, or I don't know

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:38.770
if the ending is very good or what
happened in this part of the story.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:44.890
So you know, so what I wrote,
for example, here is in black.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.340
And all these things
in green are things

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.250
that he changed or
had questions about.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.110
So you can see that it never
comes up perfect the first time.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:59.260
I write it out and then the
editor crosses out all sorts

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.250
of things and has questions.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.540
And, you know, often in the
side here he'll put questions,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:12.120
like but what happened to Aunt
Solidad or what did she do

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.100
after she took the
kids to the school.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:20.590
So you can see -- so
that's the first part,

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.170
I write the story,
and then I revise it.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:27.620
I send it back and forth with this
editor, like four or five times

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.210
at least, till we're both
very happy with the story.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:40.170
And then after that -- and so that
usually takes me about two months,

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:45.000
sometimes more, till we're
both very happy with the story.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.250
And then after that, I make
sketches for the entire book.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:54.220
I draw just in black and
white, the entire book.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.700
So you can see there, that was
my first idea for the cover.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.300
And the cover changed.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.140
And then here, you know, that's
the first page in the book.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.290
And here a different person,
called an art director,

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:17.680
she or he gives me comments and
says, oh, but maybe move this

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.160
because you forgot to include this.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.510
Like maybe she should have
lunch, a lunch bag or a backpack,

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:31.870
or maybe move the text a little
bit because it won't fit.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.510
You know, like here it says maybe
I should move it up a little

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:40.480
because otherwise it's
going to be too [inaudible].

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.110
Yeah, so I get a lot
of these comments.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.810
And so they've now changed
the sketches many times also.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:51.550
And that usually takes me
like two or three months.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:56.110
And then after that, after both
the art director and I are happy

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:58.350
with the book, with the drawings,

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:03.190
then I put the different
texture and color in the books.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.120
Any other questions?

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.920
You have a question?

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.370
[inaudible].

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.980
Am I already happy with the book?

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.090 position:56%
Yeah, I'm very happy with this book.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.780
One reason why I decided
-- I made this book for --

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:25.360
I had two big reasons
to make this book.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:31.100
So the first reason is that I
think it's an important piece

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.370
of American history that not
a lot of people know about.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:34.670
I think it's an important story

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.390
that I think more people
should learn about.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.970
Because, like I said,
sometimes kids in school learn

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.800
about important civil rights
leaders, like Martin Luther King

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:52.810 position:56%
or Cesar Chavez, but there were also
other people that also fought hard

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.940
to bring positive change,
create positive change

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.530
in the United States, in America,

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.380
and not a lot of people
know their stories.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.110
So I thought that this story
was important for that.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:08.520
But the other reason is that,
you know, because I'm an author

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.640
and illustrator and I write
books, sometimes I get invited

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.890
to visit different schools
in the United States

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:16.930
in different parts
of the United States.

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:20.380
And sometimes I see that schools
continue to be very divided.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.690
Like sometimes if I go to a school
that's in a poor neighborhood

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:27.250
or poor area, it's
usually Latino children

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.370
and African-American children
that go to that school.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.580
And if I go to a school
that's maybe in a suburb

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.020
where there's more money, it tends

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.440
to be mostly white
children or Anglo children.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:45.900 position:56%
So a lot of the problems that Sylvia
was having 70 years ago are still

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.530
kind of happening today.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:51.000
So I thought that was another
reason why I should write this book

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.720
and why maybe some of you
will relate to this story.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.930
You have a question?

00:34:55.930 --> 00:35:06.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So how do you fit
the texture onto the picture?

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.940
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: So
I do it in the computer

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.280
and then gets printed by a printer.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.930
But when they print the book,
they print thousands of copies.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.440
So it actually gets printed
by large, large machines

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.640
that print thousands of copies
of the book and it gets bound.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.010
So I don't do that
myself personally,

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.100
it gets printed by machines.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.970
And so it takes me like six months
or a year to make the book, right.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.720
But then after I finish the book,
it takes like another six months

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.870
for the book to come out,
because it gets printed

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:42.560 position:56%
by those large machines, then it has
to be shipped in boats or airplanes

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.970
or trucks, be sent to different
stores, to different libraries.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.640
And before the book comes out,
they usually send some free copies

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.260
to different librarians or teachers
or people that write for magazines

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.030
so that they will read the book
and say, oh, it's a good book,

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.670
people should buy it, people should
have it in their school library

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.040
or in their public library.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:12.570
So from the time that I first have
the idea for the book till the time

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.620
that someone is actually
holding and reading the book,

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:20.960
it takes at least a year, sometimes
more like a year and a half or two.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.600
Yes, do you have a question?

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.100
&gt;&gt; Well, I think you guys remember

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.260
that Ms. Kleinman has been
telling you all that I've been

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.380
on this award committee, right.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.980
I've been telling you
probably since last year.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.670
And I think I've showed some
of you some of the books

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:44.230
that we were reading and picking
and thinking about carefully,

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.380
to see which books we were going

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:51.330
to decide got this very
special gold award.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.410
And if you see, my
copy has one award.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:00.800
But if you look at Duncan's
copy, it has three awards.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.800
Can you hold that up for them?

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.860 position:56%
Okay, so these children have learned
about book awards because I've kind

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.820
of been trying to explain
to them what it's been

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.820
like to be on the committee.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.490
And so another thing that happens
besides sending books to schools

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:28.270
and libraries is, when a
block is a very important book

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.300
for a particular group of people,

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:36.870
what group of people do you think
this book is most important for?

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.500
Delara?

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.830
&gt;&gt; Mexicans.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.540
&gt;&gt; Mexicans who live in Mexico?

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.600
&gt;&gt; No, the Mexicans who
live in the United States.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.390
&gt;&gt; Mexicans who live
in the United States.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.560
Only Mexicans?

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.960
What do you think, Millon?

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.600
&gt;&gt; I think it's for people
who live around the world

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:05.230
that don't get good schools
in the United States.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.200
&gt;&gt; Do you mean people from all
over the world who might not get

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.890
to go to the best schools?

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the United States.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.790
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:17.750 position:56%
I don't want to take too much time
away from the author, because I talk

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.050
to you guys all the time.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:24.850
But I just want to say that
one of the groups of people

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:29.380
that Duncan sent this book
to were three different --

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:34.740
or probably his publisher --
three different award committees.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:41.230
And all the award committees said,
yes, this book deserves an award,

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.770
because it's such an important
story, and it's beautiful.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:50.570
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: And so
awards, I mean , it's very special

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:55.650
to receive an award, but it
also helps the book a lot.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.410 position:56%
Because what happens, every year in
the United States, there's thousands

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.340
of children's books
that get made, right.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.990 position:56%
But only a few of them, only a small
percentage, only a small amount,

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.740
talk about different
minority groups,

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.430 position:56%
talk about African-American children
or Mexican-American children

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.160
or Asian-American children.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:19.440
The amount of books that talk
about those people is very small.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.680
So an award like this helps it --
helps more people find these books

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.540
and shows that these books are
good books and important books.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.540
Because, you know, the United
States is such a diverse country

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.400
with different types of people,
that the books that get published

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.710
and get printed should also be
-- should also reflect that.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:49.270
&gt;&gt; I think you have time
for three more questions.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.510
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Yes?

00:39:51.510 --> 00:40:02.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.090
Yeah, there's the T-shirt I
made with one of my drawings.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:10.250
Most of the T-shirts I wear
have my drawings on them.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:15.540
But yeah, it's something that
I've done for several of my books.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.940
So I've done -- this is my
fourth book that I've written

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.480
and illustrated, and
I have five books now.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.630
Because I have a new book that
came out a couple weeks ago.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.990
So I have five books that
I've written and illustrated.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:35.460
And sometimes I get
invited by different --

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.110
to make the drawings
for a different author

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.290
who writes a story and
I make the pictures.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:45.310
But I've done five that I've
written and illustrated myself.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.110
Yeah?

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:57.890
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:02.080
So what I do there -- so
in that machine, a scanner,

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.830
sometimes I put something, right.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:09.910
Sometimes I'll put like my sweater
on it and then I'll see an image

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:11.270
of the texture of my sweater

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.120
on the computer screen,
and then I'll use that.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.230
Other things, for example,
like the wheel of a tractor,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.380
I can't put the wheel of a
tractor on top of the scanner.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.470
So I'll take a photograph myself
or I'll go on the Internet

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:26.970
and I'll search pictures
of wheels of tractors,

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.010
and I'll find one that
I think will work.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:33.880
And so by doing that, then I
use a program called Photoshop,

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.570
in which I can kind of cut things
and paste them in different areas,

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:47.710
and that's how I build
my illustrations.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.810
Here in red, yes?

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:54.880
&gt;&gt; When you were talking to
Sylvia, when you wrote the book,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:00.910 position:56%
did you remember -- did she remember
you, that your name was Duncan?

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:07.930
And that she had actually
talked to you?

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:09.230
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Yeah.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.290
So I learned about this
story from my editor,

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.310
the person that's kind
of like a teacher.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:17.470
He was working with a different
author on a book that relates

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.470
to that case that I told, Brown
versus Board of Education.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.510
And in there she mentioned the
Mendez case, this other author.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.700
And then he said, oh, I think he
would be very interested in this,

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.950
because he knows I'm
very interested in issues

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:35.240
that affect Mexican-American
children and Latino children.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.610
And so I said, oh, yeah,
this sounds very interesting.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.170
And I looked online and I
found out more about it.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.960
And then I happened to
be in the same place

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.930 position:56%
where Sylvia Mendez was going to be.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.590
And so I got to meet
her and talk to her,

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.620
and I told her I wanted
to make a book.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.930
There's a different book that's
been made about Sylvia's story,

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.960 position:56%
and there's been some documentaries.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.830
There's a really great novel
called "Sylvia and Aki,"

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.270
which is like for kids
in middle school.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:02.490
But I wanted to do a
book for younger readers.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.570
And so I told her and
Sylvia said, oh,

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.320
it would be great if
you'd do the book.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.600
If you make the book,
make sure I wear trenzas,

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:16.570
because I always wore trenzas like
that when I was a little girl.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:19.410
And so then I wrote the book,

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:23.140
and then when I finished writing
the story, I actually visited her

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.370
in her home in California.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:32.810
She lives in Fullerton, California,
very close to where she grew up.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:38.150
And I showed her the story, to make
sure that everything was correct.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.090
And those pictures that
included at the back

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.860
of the book are pictures
she showed me

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.680
and she gave me permission
to include in the book.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.420
And so this book has
received several awards

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.130
and honorable mentions.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:55.470
It received an award
some months ago,

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.420
an honorable mention
some months ago,

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.380
and Sylvia Mendez was
able to come to that.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:04.510
And so I've seen her a few times
and I've had an opportunity to talk

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:10.510
with her, and she likes the
book and she's happy with it.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:11.810
Yes?

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.080
&gt;&gt; What is the fifth book called?

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.940
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: So let me
show you really quickly some

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.240
of the other books.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.290
I won't be able to read them to you

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:27.810
because I know we're
running out of time.

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:31.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; We have I believe "Diego Rivera,"

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:35.890
and also "Pancho Rabbit
and the Coyote."

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:40.630
So I can show you at
least two others.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:44.090
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: And so then
I'll show you the latest one,

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.170
which is called "Funny Bones."

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:53.270
And so some books that I've
made are fiction, right.

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:59.550
There stories that I make up
with people that don't exist.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:03.080
But other stories, like this
book, "Separate is Never Equal,"

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.290
and like this book,
"Funny Bones," are based --

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:09.120
are nonfiction, are
based on true people.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:14.000
So this is the story of a man
named Posada, who was an artist.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.640
And he made these drawings
of these skeletons.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.490
And so wanted to learn, why
did he make these drawings

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:26.580
of skeletons riding bicycles
and dancing and playing guitars.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.500
So the book is a biography of him.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.700
I went to a library and
I learned about his life

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.380
and the different drawing
techniques that he learned,

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.440
different things that happened.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:44.780
And it's also about the Day of the
Dead, because he made the drawings

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.200
for the Day of the Dead,
which is a holiday.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.060
Maybe a lot of you know about it,

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.140
that happens just right
after Halloween.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.740
And so in the book I
talk about different Day

00:45:54.740 --> 00:46:00.300
of the Dead traditions, like
doing these paper cutouts

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.560
or like making these sugar
skulls or decorating shrines

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.390
with marigold flowers
and dead bread.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:15.910 position:56%
And then there's also this tradition
of writing calaveras poems.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:20.200
And they're poems that involve
skeletons in some kind way.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.660
So for example, this is
a calaveras poem I wrote.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.940
It says, "it was a warm
afternoon in the middle of May.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.160
Mr. Bones grabbed his hat
and went walking that day.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.810
When he noticed a beauty
on the opposite street,

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.600
he ran towards her and
kneeled at her feet.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.150
You're the prettiest girl
I've seen in my life.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.850
Please marry me, please be my wife.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.230
I am sorry, senor,
but that cannot be.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.440
You're handsome and all,
but too skinny for me."

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.530
And so the poems are supposed
to be silly and funny.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:56.310
And Posada, he drew -- he
made a lot of illustrations

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.030
for those kinds of poems.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.790
So in the book, I put his
illustrations and I ask questions

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:07.110
about why he drew those
images and try to think

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.240
of why he made those
images and ask questions

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.690
about why he may have done that.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:18.710
And so that's the latest
book I've done.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.510
Yes?

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:28.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:37.190 position:56%
Is anyone in the school [inaudible].

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.000
In this book, in "Separate
is Never Equal"?

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.330
Well, the main character,
Sylvia, she's still alive.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.200 position:56%
I forget exactly how old she is now,

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.540
but she's in her 70s,
close to being 80.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.730
And her brothers are still alive.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:55.320
Her parents passed
away some years ago.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:09.190 position:56%
And what happened is when Sylvia,
after she went to the school, right.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:14.350
After she went to that school
with children of all races,

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.960
she went on to middle
school, high school,

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.790
she went to college,
and she became a nurse.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:23.160
And she worked as a nurse for a
long time, for almost 30 years.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.080
But then her mother got sick,
and so she stopped working

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.150
so she could take care
of her mother.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.730
And when her mother was very
sick, she said, you know,

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:37.500
I'm so sad that no one knows
about our story and all the things

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.150
that we did to make it

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.600
so that children could
go to school together.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.460
So Sylvia decided she was not
going to work as a nurse anymore

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:47.030
and that instead she was going
to start traveling and talking

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:52.840
with people about this case so more
people would find out about it.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.610
And in that room were she
used to take care of her mom

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.690
when she was sick, now
it's kind of her office.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.600
And she has all these awards
and all these different pictures

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.370
and recognitions for her
effort, for her family's effort

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.600
and for her effort so that more
people learn about this story

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.470
and to talk about education
and equality.

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:16.800
&gt;&gt; Kahin Mohammad: All right,
I want you guys to join me

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.510
in thanking Duncan Tonatiuh for
making time to come here today.
