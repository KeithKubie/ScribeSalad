00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.770
Welcome to the presentation
on radians and degrees.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.010
So you all are probably already
reasonably familiar with

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.950
the concept of degrees.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.310
I think in our angles models
we actually drill you

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.820
through a bunch of problems.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:23.460
You're probably familiar that
a right angle is 90 degrees.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.650
Or half a right angle
-- 45 degrees.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.630
And you're also probably
familiar with the concept that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.610
in a circle -- and that's my
best adept at a circle -- in a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.010
circle, there are 360 degrees.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.750
So today I'm going to introduce
you to another measure or unit

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.270
for angles and this
is called a radian.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.450
So what is a radian?

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.650
So I'll start with the
definition and I think this

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.105
might give you a little
intuition for why it's

00:00:57.105 --> 00:00:59.910
even called radian.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.850
Let me use this circle tool and
actually draw a nice circle.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.270
I'm still using the radian
tool, the circle tool.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.530
OK.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.630
This is a radius of length r.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.500
A radian is the angle
that subtends an arc.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.210
And all subtend means is if
this is angle, and this is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.520
the arc, this angle subtends
this arc and this arc

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.020
subtends this angle.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.050
So a radian -- one radian -- is
the angle that subtends an arc

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.130
that's the length
of the radius.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.780
So the length of
this is also r.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.440
And this angle is one radian.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.140
i think that's messy.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.490
Let me draw a bigger circle.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.640
Here you go.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.860
And I'm going to do this
because I was wondering

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.780
why they do radians.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.300
We all know degrees.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.090
But actually when you think
about it it actually makes a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.100
reasonable amount of sense.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.873
So let me use the
line tool now.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.990
And let's say that this radius
is a length r and that this arc

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.460
right here is also length r.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.210
Then this angle, what's called
theta, is equal to one radian.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.220
And now it makes sense that
they call it a radian.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.440
It's kind of like a radius.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.100
So let me ask a question:
how many radians are

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.420
there in a circle?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.300
Well, if this is r, what is
the whole circumference

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.050
of a circle?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.540
It's 2 pi r, right?

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.050
You know that from the
basic geometry module.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.850
So if the radian is the angle
that sub tends an arc of r,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.650
then the angle that subtends an
arc of 2 pi r is 2 pi radians.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.970
So this angle is 2 pi radians.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.820
If you're still confused,
think of it this way.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.390
An angle of 2 pi radians going
all the way around subtends

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.650
an arc of 2 pi radiuses.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.500
Or radii.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.460
I don't know how to say
the plural of radius.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.110
Maybe it's radians.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.130
And I don't know.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.630
So why am I going through all
of this mess and confusing you?

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.580
I just want to one, give you an
intuition for why it's called

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.130
a radian and kind of how
it relates to a circle.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.890
And then given that there 2 pi
radians in a circle, we can now

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.980
figure out a relationship
between radians and degrees.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.920
Let me delete this.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.190
So we said in a circle,
there are 2 pi radians.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.970
And how many degrees
are there in a circle?

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.800
If we went around a whole
circle how many degrees?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.360
Well that's equal
to 360 degrees.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.520
So there.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.620
We have an equation that sets
up a conversion between

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.950
radians and degrees.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:19.390
So one radian is equal to
360 over 2 pi degrees.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.570
I just divided both
sides by 2 pi.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.040
Which equals 180
over pi degrees.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.080
Similarly, we could have
done the other way.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.000
We could have divided both
sides by 360 and we could have

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.530
said 1 degree -- I'm just going
to divide both sides but

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.970
360 and I'm flipping it.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.410
1 degree is equal to 2
pi over 360 radians.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.260
Which equals pi
over 180 radians.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.440
So then we have a conversion:
1 radian equals 180 over pi

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.220
degrees and 1 degree equals
pi over 180 radians.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.980
Amd if you ever forget
these, it doesn't hurt

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.740
to to memorize this.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.520
But if you ever forget it,
I always go back to this.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.810
That 2 pi radians is
equal to 360 degrees.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.450
Or another way that actually
makes the algebra a little

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.545
simpler is if you just
think of a half circle.

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:31.550
A half circle -- this angle
-- is a 180 degrees, right?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.120
That's a degree sign.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.810
I could also write degrees out.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.680
And that's also equal
to pi radians.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.250
So pi radians equal 180 degrees
and we can get to see the math.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:57.250
1 radian equals 180 over pi
degrees or 1 degree is equal

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.940
to pi over 180 radians.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.495
So let's do a couple of
problems were you'll get

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.540
the intuition for this.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.010
If I asked you 45 degrees --
to convert that into radians.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.410
Well, we know that 1 degree
os pi over 180 radians.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:32.910
So 45 degrees is equal to 45
times pi over 180 radians.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.850
And let's see, 45
divided by 180.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.360
45 goes into 180 four times so
this equals pi over 4 radians.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.600
45 degrees is equal to
pi over 4 radians.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.610
And just keep in mind, these
are just two different units

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.070
or two different ways
of measuring angles.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.590
And the reason why I do this is
this is actually the

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.700
mathematical standard for
measuring angles, although most

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.690
of us are more familiar with
degrees just from

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.030
everyday life.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.920
Let's do a couple
of other examples.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.690
Just always remember:
this 1 radian equals

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.400
180 over pi degrees.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.200
1 degree equals pi
over 180 radians.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.630
If you ever get confused,
just write this out.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.400
this is what I do because I
always forget whether it's

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.570
pi over 180 or 180 over pi.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.550
I just remember pi radians
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.840
Let's do another one.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:33.060
So if I were to say pi
over 2 radians equals

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.765
how many degrees?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.660
Well I already forgot what I
had just written so I just

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.565
remind myself that pi radians
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.930
Oh, my wife just got home, so
I'm just going to have to leave

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.670
the presentation like that
and I will continue it later.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.120
Actually, let me just finish
this problem and then I'll

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.270
go attend to my wife.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:12.140
But we know that pi radians is
equal to 180 degrees, right?

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:18.840
So one radian is equal to 180
over -- that's one radian -- is

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.660
equal to 180 over pi degrees.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.470
I just figure out the
formula again because

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.490
I always forget it.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.500
So let's go back here.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:33.160
So pi over 2 radians is
equal to pi over 2 times

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.510
180 over pi degrees.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.585
And that equals 90 degrees.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.830
I'll do one more example.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.915
Let's say 30 degrees.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.200
Once again, I forgot the
formula so I just remember

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:10.960
that pi radians is
equal to 180 degrees.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:19.150
So 1 degree is equal to
pi over 180 radians.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:27.220
So 30 degrees is equal to 30
times pi over 180 radians

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.320
which equals -- 30 goes
into 180 six times.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.160
That equals pi over 6 radians.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.630
Hopefully you have a sense of
how to convert between degrees

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.070
and radians now and even why
it's called a radian because

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.880
it's very closely related to
a radius and you'll feel

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.210
comfortable when someone asks
you to, I don't know, deal with

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.410
radians as opposed to degrees.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.671
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
