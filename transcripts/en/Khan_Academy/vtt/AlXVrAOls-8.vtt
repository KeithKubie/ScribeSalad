00:00:01.018 --> 00:00:03.919
- [Voiceover] So I've got a
vector field here, v of x y.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.233
Where the first component of
the output is just x times y,

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.057
and the second component is
y squared, minus x squared.

00:00:10.057 --> 00:00:12.766
And the picture of this
vector field is here.

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.006
This is what that vector field looks like.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.775
And what I'd like to do
is compute and interpret

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:19.595
the divergence of v.

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:23.762
So, the divergence of v,
as a function of x and y.

00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:28.815
And in the last couple of
videos I explained that

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:31.615
the formula for this, and
hopefully it's more than just

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:33.827
a formula, but something
I have an intuition for,

00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:36.904
is the partial derivative
of p with respect to x.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.670
By p, I mean that first component.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.837
So if you're thinking about
this as being p of x y

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:46.109
and q of x y.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.582
So I could use any letters
right, and p and q are common.

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:53.413
But the upshot is it's
the partial derivative of

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:56.250
the first component with
respect to the first variable.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.271
Plus, the partial derivative
of that second component,

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.582
with respect to that second variable, y.

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:06.157
And as we actually plug
this in and start computing

00:01:06.157 --> 00:01:09.338
the partial derivative of p
with respect to x of this guy,

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:10.571
with respect to x.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.641
X looks like a variable,
y looks like a constant.

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:15.558
The derivative is y, that constant.

00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:19.207
And then the partial derivative
of q, that second component,

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:20.629
with respect to y.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:21.957
We look here.

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:23.779
Y squared looks like a
variable and it's derivative

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.029
is two times y.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.184
And then x just looks like a constant

00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:29.717
so nothing happens there.

00:01:29.717 --> 00:01:32.433
So in the whole, the divergence
evidently just depends on

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:33.791
the y value.

00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:35.624
It's three times y.

00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:37.708
So what that should mean is
if we look at, for example,

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:40.300
let's say we look our points
for y equals zero, we'd expect

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.203
the divergence to be zero.

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:45.425
The fluid neither goes towards
nor away from each point.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:48.661
So y equals zero corresponds
with this x axis of points.

00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:50.946
So to give it a point here,
evidently it's the case

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:54.786
that the fluid kind of flowing
in from above is bounced out

00:01:54.786 --> 00:01:57.139
by how much fluid flows away from it here

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.092
and wherever you look.

00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:00.354
I mean, here its only
flowing in by a little bit,

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.947
and I guess it's flowing
out just by that same amount

00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:04.782
and that all cancels out.

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:08.949
Whereas, let's say we take
a look at y equals three.

00:02:10.524 --> 00:02:13.123
So in this case the
divergence should equal nine.

00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:15.956
So we'd expect there to be
positive divergence when y

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:17.228
is positive.

00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:20.801
So if we go up, and y is
equal to one, two, three.

00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:24.735
And if we look at a point
around here, I'm gonna

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:26.710
kinda consider the region around it.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.078
You can kinda see how the
vectors leaving it seem

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:30.119
to be bigger.

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.066
So the fluid flowing out of
this region is pretty rapid.

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:36.855
Whereas the fluid flowing
into it is less rapid.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:39.261
So on the whole, in a region
around this point, the fluid

00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:40.943
I guess is going away.

00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:43.043
And you look anywhere where y is positive

00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:45.739
and if you kind of look
around here, the same is true,

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.424
where fluid does flow into it, it seems.

00:02:48.424 --> 00:02:51.965
But the vectors kind of going
out of this region are larger.

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:54.399
So you'd expect on the whole
for things to diverge away

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.732
from that point.

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.927
In contrast, if you look at
something where y is negative,

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:03.199
let's say it was y is equal
to negative four, it doesn't

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.032
have to be three there.

00:03:04.032 --> 00:03:06.440
So there would be a
divergence of negative 12.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.832
So you'd expect things to
definitely converging towards

00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:10.849
your specific points.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.972
So you go down to, I guess I
said y equals negative four.

00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:17.328
But really, I'm thinking of
anything where y is negative.

00:03:17.328 --> 00:03:19.770
Let's say we take a
look at this point here.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.111
Fluid flowing into it
seems to be according

00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:22.981
to large vectors.

00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:24.984
So it's flowing into
it pretty quickly here.

00:03:24.984 --> 00:03:27.607
But when it's flowing out
of it, it's less large.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.925
It's flowing out of it in a
kind of a lackadaisical way.

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:34.125
So, it kinda makes sense,
just looking at the picture

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:38.055
the divergence tends to be
negative when y is negative.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.037
And what's surprising, What
I wouldn't have been able

00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:41.805
to tell just looking
at the picture, is that

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.587
the divergence only
depends on the y value.

00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:48.113
But once you compute everything,
it's only dependent on

00:03:48.113 --> 00:03:49.363
the y value here.

00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:52.099
And that as you go kind
of left and right on

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.599
the diagram there.

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:57.397
As we look left and right, the value of

00:03:57.397 --> 00:03:58.585
the divergence doesn't change.

00:03:58.585 --> 00:03:59.725
That's kind of surprising.

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.038
It makes a little bit of sense.

00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:03.748
You don't see any notable
reason that the divergence here

00:04:03.748 --> 00:04:05.179
should be any different than here.

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:09.346
But, I wouldn't have known that
they were exactly the same.
