As computer scientists, one of the most

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.471
powerful tools that's available to us, is

00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:11.990
the concept of an abstraction. And by an abstraction, we mean a well understood

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.750
interface, that hides all the details within a subsystem. Let's see how, in a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.370
computer system, the hierarchy of abstractions works,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.630
and where operating system fits, within this hierarchy.
