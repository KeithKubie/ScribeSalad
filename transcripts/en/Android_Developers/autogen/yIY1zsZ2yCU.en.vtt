hello my name is Bruno Oliveira and I'm
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.580
hello my name is Bruno Oliveira and I'm
an engineer in the play games team and -

in today's EV bytes episode we're going

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
in today's EV bytes episode we're going
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.250
in today's EV bytes episode we're going
to talk about a problem that comes up

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
to talk about a problem that comes up
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.019
to talk about a problem that comes up
very often in multiplayer games and that

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
very often in multiplayer games and that
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.580
very often in multiplayer games and that
is of course how do you choose who goes

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
is of course how do you choose who goes
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.570
is of course how do you choose who goes
first

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
first
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.970
first
remember that multiplayer is symmetrical

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
remember that multiplayer is symmetrical
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.009
remember that multiplayer is symmetrical
so no one is naturally special there's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
so no one is naturally special there's
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019
so no one is naturally special there's
no server or anything like that but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
no server or anything like that but
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880
no server or anything like that but
sometimes you need to choose one of the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
sometimes you need to choose one of the
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.470
sometimes you need to choose one of the
players to be to have a special role

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
players to be to have a special role
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.030
players to be to have a special role
like to be the judge of a match to make

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
like to be the judge of a match to make
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.380
like to be the judge of a match to make
the first move you already need to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
the first move you already need to
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.990
the first move you already need to
decide whose player one who's player two

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000
decide whose player one who's player two
 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.030
decide whose player one who's player two
and so on so how do you do this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
and so on so how do you do this
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.619
and so on so how do you do this
your first thought looking at the API

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
your first thought looking at the API
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.510
your first thought looking at the API
may be oh let me use the the rooms

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
may be oh let me use the the rooms
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010
may be oh let me use the the rooms
creator so the player who's good who's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
creator so the player who's good who's
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.360
creator so the player who's good who's
the creator of the room is gonna be the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
the creator of the room is gonna be the
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740
the creator of the room is gonna be the
judge or is gonna make the first move

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
judge or is gonna make the first move
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.950
judge or is gonna make the first move
etc that's generally a bad idea and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
etc that's generally a bad idea and
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420
etc that's generally a bad idea and
that's a bad idea because there's a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
that's a bad idea because there's a
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.680
that's a bad idea because there's a
funny thing that happens in automatch

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
funny thing that happens in automatch
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479
funny thing that happens in automatch
because automatically means I will we

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
because automatically means I will we
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.709
because automatically means I will we
get a whole bunch of rooms and put them

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
get a whole bunch of rooms and put them
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.750
get a whole bunch of rooms and put them
together into a single room so when you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
together into a single room so when you
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849
together into a single room so when you
have automatic lairs in the room there

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
have automatic lairs in the room there
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.410
have automatic lairs in the room there
will there will not necessarily be

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
will there will not necessarily be
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150
will there will not necessarily be
agreement on who was the rooms creator

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
agreement on who was the rooms creator
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.130
agreement on who was the rooms creator
so that's so that doesn't work as

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
so that's so that doesn't work as
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440
so that's so that doesn't work as
expected so you may think okay I'm gonna

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
expected so you may think okay I'm gonna
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.179
expected so you may think okay I'm gonna
use the player ID right so everyone has

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
use the player ID right so everyone has
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.469
use the player ID right so everyone has
a player ID I'm just gonna sort the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
a player ID I'm just gonna sort the
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.000
a player ID I'm just gonna sort the
player IDs and whoever has the lowest

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
player IDs and whoever has the lowest
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.260
player IDs and whoever has the lowest
priority is gonna be the first to play

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
priority is gonna be the first to play
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840
priority is gonna be the first to play
again that's a bad idea because when you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
again that's a bad idea because when you
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.280
again that's a bad idea because when you
have automatic players you don't have

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
have automatic players you don't have
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840
have automatic players you don't have
access to the pleiades of those

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
access to the pleiades of those
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.190
access to the pleiades of those
automatch players so that method doesn't

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
automatch players so that method doesn't
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740
automatch players so that method doesn't
work either okay what if you just use

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
work either okay what if you just use
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.600
work either okay what if you just use
participant IDs that's a slightly better

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
participant IDs that's a slightly better
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149
participant IDs that's a slightly better
idea because everyone has a participant

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
idea because everyone has a participant
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.100
idea because everyone has a participant
ID however that's still none not very

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
ID however that's still none not very
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590
ID however that's still none not very
good and why okay let's suppose you're

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
good and why okay let's suppose you're
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300
good and why okay let's suppose you're
doing something like this so you get

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
doing something like this so you get
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.890
doing something like this so you get
everyone's participant IDs which are

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
everyone's participant IDs which are
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.260
everyone's participant IDs which are
these funny strings you sort that list

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
these funny strings you sort that list
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210
these funny strings you sort that list
and then you pick that first player on

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
and then you pick that first player on
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.280
and then you pick that first player on
that list to be to start the game or to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
that list to be to start the game or to
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.780
that list to be to start the game or to
be the king or to have that special role

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
be the king or to have that special role
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550
be the king or to have that special role
sure that works and definitely

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
sure that works and definitely
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.020
sure that works and definitely
everyone's gonna agree on who has that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
everyone's gonna agree on who has that
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.240
everyone's gonna agree on who has that
special role but here's the problem so a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
special role but here's the problem so a
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.249
special role but here's the problem so a
participant ID is not really a random

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
participant ID is not really a random
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.810
participant ID is not really a random
string it actually has some structure to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
string it actually has some structure to
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.300
string it actually has some structure to
it it's encoded information so suppose

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
it it's encoded information so suppose
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.889
it it's encoded information so suppose
that I'm that last guy over there and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
that I'm that last guy over there and
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.870
that I'm that last guy over there and
I'm unlucky enough that in every single

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
I'm unlucky enough that in every single
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700
I'm unlucky enough that in every single
match that i play my participant ID

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
match that i play my participant ID
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950
match that i play my participant ID
begins with a Z so if if I'm not lucky

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
begins with a Z so if if I'm not lucky
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.469
begins with a Z so if if I'm not lucky
enough that happens then no matter how

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
enough that happens then no matter how
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940
enough that happens then no matter how
many matches I play I'll never get to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
many matches I play I'll never get to
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.139
many matches I play I'll never get to
play further so I never get to be the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
play further so I never get to be the
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.639
play further so I never get to be the
king you'll never get that special role

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
king you'll never get that special role
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.559
king you'll never get that special role
in the game so the game might be very

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
in the game so the game might be very
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510
in the game so the game might be very
very boring for me so we definitely

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
very boring for me so we definitely
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.580
very boring for me so we definitely
don't want that to happen so one of the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
don't want that to happen so one of the
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.940
don't want that to happen so one of the
ways you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950
ways you
 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.370
ways you
you can solve the problem he is your

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
you can solve the problem he is your
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.960
you can solve the problem he is your
sort the participant the list of

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
sort the participant the list of
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.970
sort the participant the list of
participant that he says before then he

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980
participant that he says before then he
 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.500
participant that he says before then he
picks the first player on that list but

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
picks the first player on that list but
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.610
picks the first player on that list but
that player is not gonna played the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
that player is not gonna played the
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.680
that player is not gonna played the
special role his only responsibility is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
special role his only responsibility is
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.120
special role his only responsibility is
going to be to randomly choose who's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
going to be to randomly choose who's
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.520
going to be to randomly choose who's
going to be the king or to play first

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530
going to be the king or to play first
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.860
going to be the king or to play first
after choosing that using some some sort

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
after choosing that using some some sort
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.870
after choosing that using some some sort
of like fair method all you have to do

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
of like fair method all you have to do
 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.610
of like fair method all you have to do
is then broadcast to the other players

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
is then broadcast to the other players
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.090
is then broadcast to the other players
that that selection and then everyone's

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100
that that selection and then everyone's
 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.160
that that selection and then everyone's
gonna agree that that player is gonna be

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
gonna agree that that player is gonna be
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.370
gonna agree that that player is gonna be
the king or the leader and and the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
the king or the leader and and the
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.470
the king or the leader and and the
choice was fair so no one had had the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
choice was fair so no one had had the
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.240
choice was fair so no one had had the
privilege of being the king many times

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
privilege of being the king many times
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.540
privilege of being the king many times
so and then everyone agrees and now all

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550
so and then everyone agrees and now all
 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.130
so and then everyone agrees and now all
we have to hope is that f zero to nine

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
we have to hope is that f zero to nine
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.600
we have to hope is that f zero to nine
is gonna be a wise ruler that's gonna

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610
is gonna be a wise ruler that's gonna
 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.979
is gonna be a wise ruler that's gonna
lead your game into an age of peace and

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
lead your game into an age of peace and
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.979
lead your game into an age of peace and
prosperity that was it for today's dev

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
