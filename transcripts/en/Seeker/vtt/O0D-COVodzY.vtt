00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.050
Happy 4th Birthday Weekend DNews!

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.710
To celebrate, let’s rewind to March 2014
when Trace and I captured the universe….

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.190
in a balloon.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.450
Hi there space physics fans!

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.450
Ian here.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.920
All this weekend we’re giving updates to
our first DNews videos, and the first video

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.210
I ever worked on was about the big bang and
gravitational waves.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:41.450
A 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.430
balloon to simulate spacetime, brilliant!

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.510
See, in early 2014, the science world was
going crazy over a discovery made by the BICEP2

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.610
telescope located at the South Pole.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.590
To recap, the telescope is used to watch out
for very slight changes in the polarization

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.960
of light from the Cosmic Microwave Background,
or CMB.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.910
The CMB is ancient radiation created by the
birth of the universe -- the echo from the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.910
Big Bang.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.690
At the time of our first video, BICEP2 had
announced the detection of a certain type

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.730
of polarization that we THOUGHT revealed observational
evidence of primordial gravitational waves.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.240
We’ve talked about this a lot on DNews,
but gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.100
Imagine dropping a pebble into a pond and
you’d see ripples going across the surface

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.100
of the water.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.110
The pebble represents energy, and the ripples
would be the gravitational waves.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.940
Primordial gravitational waves were created
from the energy of the big bang and should

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.620
be etched into the CMB, in theory.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.190
So when BICEP2 found this polarization, it
confirmed the existence of primordial gravitational

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.190
waves.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.780
It also appeared to explain our entire universe,
how it came to be AND provided strong evidence

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.090
of a quantum origin for gravity.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.090
So.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.090
Exciting.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.650
Actually, not so much.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.940
In the months following that video, the BICEP2
results started to fall apart and, long story

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.210
short, that primordial gravitational wave
signal wasn’t a gravitational wave signal

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.210
at all.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.799
Follow-up observations by the European Planck
space telescope proved that it was actually

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.180
galactic dust that was fooling BICEP2 into
thinking it was seeing these polarized wiggles

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.670
when, actually, there was nothing there.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.070
This was a big lesson to the BICEP2 scientists
not to make announcements so prematurely.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.120
Sorry Trace, Planck popped our balloon universe.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.290
Though these primordial gravitational waves
have yet to be found, we DID find another

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.240
type of gravitational wave generated by black
hole collisions happening RIGHT NOW in our

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.300
modern universe.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.620
Unless you’ve been living under a space-time
rock these last few months, you probably know

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.620
that 2016 has been an amazing year for physics.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.700
In February, physicists of the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory (or “LIGO”)

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.870
confirmed the first detection of gravitational
waves passing through the Earth.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.170
Though it didn’t confirm a quantum origin
for gravity or confirm certain models of the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.270
Big Bang, the discovery of gravitational waves
by LIGO proved Einstein was right ONCE AGAIN

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.360
and gave us a brand new way to actually “see”
massive objects, like black holes, crashing

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360
in the dark.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.459
Just last week, LIGO turned its detectors
back on to start a second run in the search

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.580
for gravitational waves.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.710
And more gravitational wave observatories
are going online and other existing instruments

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.550
are getting upgrades, including the European
Virgo Interferometer and the planned LIGO-India.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.560
The European Space Agency even has lofty plans
to launch a gravitational wave observatory

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.580
in space called the Evolved Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (or “eLISA”) in 2034.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.160
All of these efforts will culminate in an
exciting future for gravitational wave astronomy.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.170
Building more observatories on Earth AND in
space helps us pinpoint the locations of some

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.880
of the most energetic events in our universe.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.410
Many of these events, like black hole collisions
and spinning neutron stars, are invisible

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.040
to classic astronomy as they don’t produce
light.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.140
But “seeing” the gravitational waves they
produce, we can actually detect them.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.240
This opens up a whole new field of astronomy
that will reveal things that have, until now,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.270
been a dark mystery.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.650
Want to see how excited we were about the
original BICEP2 results?

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.240
You can watch Trace and I geek out in my first
ever DNews video:

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.530
Can you think of any other science “discoveries”
that actually turned out to be wrong?

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.150
Let me know in the comments below and don’t
forget to subscribe to DNews for new episodes

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.830
every day of the week.
