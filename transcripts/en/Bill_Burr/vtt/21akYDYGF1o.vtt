1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.010
All right.
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.240
It's time for a very special episode of the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:10.270
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcasts.
And I am sitting here,

4
00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:14.700
I can't believe this by the way.
I am sitting across from the,

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.000
the King of Boston comedy and a guy who,

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.830
uh,
I am still in awe of.
He basically is,

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.180
is on the Mount Rushmore of,
of,
of Boston comedy.
Started the whole scene there.

8
00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:32.080
So someone like me could pursue this dream.
No,
him,
no me.

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.200
Please welcome the legendary Steve Sweeney.

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.390
<v 1>Well,
it's tough to live up to that,
but um,
I got to show my respect.
Steve,</v>

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.290
come on.
You know,

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.550
this is amazing because I've done these shows with Joe,

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.810
Joe Rogan,
Marin and Greg Fitzsimmons and you,

14
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.310
and it's just,
you're all so successful.

15
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:56.860
And I was saying to God today in my prayers,
I said,
so that's the key,
Huh?

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.600
Open for me.
I get to watch you guys go by me.
But you know,

17
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:06.280
I think I know.
I,
you know what it was as I think we learned from you guys.
No,
no.

18
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:09.820
I think I know one of the keys to your success,
you probably heard this.

19
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.740
What is that your voice looking like?
Ron Howard.
Now what?
My voice.
Oh really?

20
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.150
Have you heard that?
No.

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.460
You've got a certain kind of voice that there's a little thing where you sound a

22
00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:22.780
little like Nick Depaulo,

23
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.870
but you don't sound like him and you've got this whole thing going.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.600
Not as good as him either.
It's funny.
Do you,

25
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.020
are you aware or do you think about how big you are right now?

26
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.120
<v 0>Uh,
no and no.
No I don't.
I don't,
and that's the key.</v>

27
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.530
I know I'm doing really well and,
but like,
uh,

28
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:49.240
I don't feel any different.
Okay.
The,
uh,
you know,

29
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.720
would say,
um,
you know what the deal,
when you go out,

30
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.770
you just listening to them and it's,
do they need more than any me to slow down?

31
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.790
Do I need to change subjects made they spent their money.

32
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:05.710
This is their night out.
They got to sit up,
put on a show.
And I don't,
you know,

33
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:10.090
I don't,
uh,
I,
well,
let me give you an example.
I came up with you guys.

34
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:13.570
If I was a fucking arrogant ass,
you guys would have given me shit.
So you got,

35
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:15.880
you guys basically raised me,
right?
So,

36
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.000
<v 1>well we,
we did,
we raised,
that's a funny way to put it.</v>

37
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.980
So right before I'm in your parking lot here and I called one of the women

38
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:26.530
that's in this movie.
It's the first time I've ever heard you pronounce in art.

39
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.850
Oh yeah.
Well I mean you've,
I know.
I know.
I know how to do it.
Yeah.
Um,

40
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.400
I was like,
it had here back then,
I might go back and caught second.
Jesus,

41
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.290
Bill Burns and artists.
Yeah.
Anyways,
so right before I came in here,

42
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.210
Jordan Popolo,
who's in my movie,
our movie,
she said,
Oh,

43
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.410
and she's gorgeous.
She said,
Oh,
I love bill burr.
Now.

44
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:55.240
No woman has ever said that about me.
Yeah,
they did.
No go.
Will you stop it?

45
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.310
They did get,
you guys were like,
dude,
you guys like,
you know what?

46
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.340
<v 0>When you guys came up,
it was also like,</v>

47
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.510
what was going on back then?
You gotta think when you guys came up,
man,

48
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.240
it was like,
that was like d day Man.

49
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.950
You guys stormed the beaches to establish that and then you combine the fact

50
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.990
that cocaine was,

51
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.520
doctors literally said cocaine is no more addictive than caffeine.

52
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.710
That's the information you were given.

53
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.580
If you got pulled over for drinking and driving the capa be like,
wait,

54
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.440
do you live?
I'll write down the street.
All right.
Just,
you know,
just get,

55
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.130
go straight home.
Like,
okay.
There was none of that.

56
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.690
There was no policing of behave.
Like,
you know,

57
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:39.850
back in the day you look at a guy like John Barnum and led Zepplin,

58
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.920
there would've been an intervention.
They would have been like,
okay,

59
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:45.130
this guy is a raging alcoholic and we need to do something.

60
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.230
It's just the information didn't exist and we had to learn from your generation

61
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.670
because you know,
it was fucking hilarious is when I started out,

62
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.290
uh,
like I s it felt like 80% of the headliners,

63
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.000
their opening line was like,
see now,
so I've been sober for eight months.
Yeah,

64
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.280
that's right.
Everyone was in a program,
everybody had cleaned.

65
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.730
I got there right as the party fucking ended and everybody was sweeping up on

66
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.120
and I felt like I missed it.
But then,
um,

67
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.260
I actually was kind of thankful for it because I'm a

68
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.260
<v 1>bit of a booze hound myself.
Taking a little sabbatical here.</v>

69
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.370
You shouldn't be more than a little thankful.
I,
I did,
I did a movie

70
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.160
I did a movie with,
called back to school.
All right,
right.
Rodney Dangerfield,

71
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.180
Sam Kennison.
I remember Robert Downey,
uh,

72
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.120
and the director at the Post Party,

73
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.570
the wrap party or whatever party it was.
Right.
You know,

74
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.220
there we were in a little room,
you know,
with the,
what do you call it,

75
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:46.980
the accoutrements of the,
of the day,
the accoutrements.

76
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:50.450
I liked how you'd say that.
The Colombian marching powder or whatever,

77
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:52.920
whatever you want to call it,
a couple of library pumps.
Oh yeah.

78
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:54.580
It was the library books.
And um,

79
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.460
I can remember another time I went to the William Morris Agency and the guy said

80
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.700
to me,
do you want to do some coke?
And I said,
wow,
Jesus.

81
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.030
<v 0>It's just to start the meeting.
By the way,
do you just walk in like,</v>

82
00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:12.450
was it like Lou grant when he would ask Mary Tyler Moore if you want a belt,

83
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:14.490
a scotch,
if she was having a tough day with somebody,

84
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:15.510
just break out an eight ball.

85
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.170
<v 1>Let me tell you something.
You want to look at a portrait of life,</v>

86
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.310
right?
Okay.
So right now,
here's my take on Los Angeles.
Cause I,

87
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:28.070
I've been here a few times now this year with this movie,
but I lived here,

88
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.580
by the way.
It's called Sweeney killing Sweeney.

89
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:33.910
It's on iTunes and it's on Amazon.
Okay.
So right now,

90
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:38.530
here's my take on Los Angeles,
uh,
the camping,

91
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.393
it's amazing.

92
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.060
This is the greatest place to camp out in the world because I see everybody's

93
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:46.910
camping out.
Wherever you go,
every sidewalk,
there's somebody sleeping,
right,

94
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.400
right.
You know what I'm saying?

95
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.070
It's a great city to be homeless as far as like the wallets,

96
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:55.700
everybody's camping out.
It's nice.
They like the outdoors.
Um,
but,

97
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.120
and then in San Francisco,
I'm at the Improv tonight,

98
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.310
so I'm trying not to them a little material on you.
Uh,
San Francisco.

99
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.680
I went there and you know,

100
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:11.300
I went to see all the golden gate bridge and all,
all the sites,
Telegraph Avenue.

101
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.080
But then I said,
let me when in Rome,
right.

102
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.820
Do as the,
you know,
people that live there that do.

103
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:24.800
So I took a shit on the sidewalk and I gotta tell you it was very liberating

104
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.080
anyway.
Um,
so I can remember,
I mean,

105
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.320
you've been in the business awhile now,
27 years,
if you can believe it.

106
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.770
So I'm gonna be 51 next month.
You look terrific.

107
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.260
Even if even if you didn't,
I would say that,
but so la works.
Yeah,
that's right.

108
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.350
Go Jesus.
You look good.
You look great.
You want some coke?
How bout,
how bout,

109
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.540
how bout this one?
I don't the people,

110
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:52.130
you mean it's more parameters than comedians?
Uh,

111
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.860
much more for actors and Comedians.

112
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.360
They're so positive that they've lost their personality.
Oh,
I know what I mean.

113
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.820
Or are you just start saying yes too many times?
Well,
it's like,

114
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.670
how are you doing?
Great.
You wouldn't believe how great I'm doing.

115
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.050
I'm studying with this guy.

116
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.770
I'm on food stamps and my teeth have fallen out and you know,

117
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:12.760
a lot of stuff that got a lot of irons in the fire and that's a good one.

118
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:16.640
I got irons in the fire.
I'm feeling good about who I am,
you know,

119
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.770
that kind of shit.
But anyway,

120
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:23.000
I remember being at the William Morris Agency was this big building and a guy in

121
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:26.240
the lobby like having a nervous breakdown and he's saying,

122
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.070
you tell him I'm not doing,
he's not doing me the favor.
I'm doing him the favor.

123
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.070
He's not doing me,
you know,
just the,
the fricking despair of it.
But I re,

124
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.240
you know,
this isn't this,
it's,
it's a really,
uh,

125
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.940
this is a hard place to get a handle on it,
if you will.
Now it's a very,
uh,

126
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.390
can you put your mic down a little so I can see you?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Sorry.

127
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.220
<v 0>It's a very like,
I can also sit up straight for once in my life.
Um,
oh,</v>

128
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.030
go crazy.
It's a very like,
uh,
I don't,
New York's a weird thing was,

129
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.980
is all this crazy energy while it's super lonely.
Um,
where did you grow up?

130
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.050
I grew up in,
uh,
the south shore of Boston when I was young guy.

131
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.430
I was up on the north shore.
I was born,
uh,
where did you live?

132
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.990
In the south shore and the north shore.
I was Peabody.
Peabody is beautiful PVD.

133
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:20.010
And then of course we move right over to the Linfield,
which was a little nicer,

134
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.390
but we didn't want to get dad do for a living.
A dentist.
Dentists.

135
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:27.680
So started in Peabody.
Yep.
And then we may made the big move.
Yeah,

136
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.050
we were in an apartment,
then we moved to a house and then we,
uh,

137
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.370
settled down in Canton,

138
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.570
Randolph area and Cobbs corner.

139
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.760
COBBS Cobbs corner.
Yeah.
Cops.
Sharon Stoughton.

140
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.530
Fucking Canton.
Canton still mammoth.

141
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.590
Matt that used to be there with the big elephant.
Hatland.

142
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.370
Don't forget about Hatland with the coupons.
Coleman sporting goods.

143
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.770
<v 1>Yeah.
How about Ponka Park Golf course?</v>

144
00:08:52.771 --> 00:08:55.980
The longest day you'll ever have in your life that was voted in

145
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.770
<v 0>sports illustrate the worst public golf course in the country at one point.</v>

146
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.550
It's up there.
It was,
yeah.
It was just,
it was a bunch of people,

147
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.630
Shit faced and golf carts that's doing burnouts in them and,
uh,

148
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.180
killing a 12 pack,
playing nine holes,

149
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.030
and then getting in a car and going back to fucking work.
It was,
it was,

150
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.600
and you know what's funny is that's when I used to caddy at a,

151
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.940
at Blue Hill country club.
Wow.
And,
um,
yeah,
that,
which was a nice course.

152
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:22.320
That was the private course and then,

153
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.540
then we would all go golfing up at like Punkin

154
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.610
<v 1>no,
I uh,
I went to a caddy camp when I was a kid from the north end.
I was,</v>

155
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.880
grew up in Charleston,
which was what you have in the north there.
Know the,
the,

156
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.340
my sister married a guy from the north end,
the films,
one of them.

157
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.830
So I was from Charlestown and I went to caddy camp and it was,

158
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:45.120
this place in New Hampshire was 48 Italians,
one French kid in me.
Right.

159
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.760
So they used to take turns beating the shit out of me,

160
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.200
and I learned how to fight.
I learned how to,
Oh,
it was fun.

161
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.460
<v 0>Actually.
You're not as
[inaudible] though.</v>

162
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.140
I feel like with the people that started Boston comedy,

163
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:04.180
there was like a height requirement because you're tall.
Lenny's tall,

164
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.750
Frank's tall.
You guys are all well over six feet tall.
Leary's tall.

165
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.880
I remember standing,
I'm like average item.

166
00:10:09.881 --> 00:10:12.550
I'm barely five 10 which probably is an average height anymore.

167
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.130
Certainly not when you go overseas to like Sweden.
Yeah,

168
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:16.420
I feel like a fucking shrimp over there.

169
00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:19.450
But you guys remember doing like comics come home and I was there.
Gavin,

170
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.660
you guys all like a foot taller than me.
I still felt like a little kid,

171
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.380
like a basketball team.
What was you had the boys.

172
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.150
You think that's what it is?
The voice.
Yeah.
Jesus.
Well,
no,
you got the voice.

173
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.550
You got the material.
What about my shit jokes,
man,

174
00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:35.980
those I always felt I had top shelf shit jokes.

175
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.030
I dance around the fecal metal before I would finally do,
remember

176
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.770
<v 1>Jim Morris.
Jim Morris was an impressionist.
He did.</v>

177
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.700
Ronald Reagan was the big deal.
All of these wonderful impressions,

178
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:50.640
but they would all end up taking a shit at the end of it.
His,

179
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:53.710
Ronald Reagan taking a shit,
his,
this other guy fit.

180
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.360
So No,
you're good with this shit jokes.

181
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.370
Do you know when I first time I saw you?
Yeah.
Uh,

182
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.860
I was absolutely fucking hammered and I,

183
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.400
<v 0>I had snuck into the next and I didn't even realize it was you and I was so</v>

184
00:11:09.401 --> 00:11:09.701
drunk.

185
00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:13.020
I was there for a minute and then they kicked me out and then I decided I was

186
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.100
gonna be a comedian.
This is like,
I saw you in the ladies.

187
00:11:15.101 --> 00:11:20.101
I can't believe I went into Nick's comedy stop in like 88 or 89 in the heyday

188
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.850
and I'm too shit faced to fucking remember.

189
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.710
And this is the club that I started out in and Nazi and all those guys were on

190
00:11:26.711 --> 00:11:29.350
the show because years later,
like in the drunken fog I was in,

191
00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:32.800
I remembered the faces.
But I saw you with the Nixon Randolph.

192
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:38.110
<v 1>Do you,
um,
go ahead.
But,
but do you actually like,</v>

193
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.020
did you ever have like a drinking problem?

194
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.310
<v 0>Um,
I got a little out of hand.
I was a,
I was a,</v>

195
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.870
a a binge drinker and where I got the bins on a,

196
00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:53.500
I was bourbon and Scotch like that.
And I,
and then had,

197
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.400
there was two [inaudible] two stupid things.
Yeah.
I'm a German,

198
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.630
mainly German and Irish.

199
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:01.690
I'm not doing that ancestry.com because I'm not putting my fucking DNA on the,

200
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.670
on the Internet.
That's dumb flux.

201
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.840
Never Bald road robots show up looking like me and come by and try and kill me.

202
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.160
Um,
I,
I brought it into my house is what I did.

203
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.980
And so then I didn't have to go out to get it.
So then it was there.

204
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:16.840
So then rather than becoming a weekend thing,

205
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.380
it started to become a nightly thing.
And then,
uh,

206
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.590
being in the writer's room on this show,
you,
I'd come home fried,

207
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.470
which show was the show calledF is for family.

208
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.360
And I would come home and I started using it as a way to decompress.
Nice.

209
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.170
And then growing up where I grew up,
I grew up,
what was a big jock town?

210
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.590
Sports town.
So it's one kid.
Yeah.
So it was like really competitive.

211
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.730
So I started looking at bottles,
like I can finish that in three nights.

212
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.950
I don't know why I would think that.
And I would just try to do a third,

213
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:48.460
a third and a third.
And I felt like some sort of only a Boston guy and be like,

214
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:52.990
nice,
good job.
And I felt it was like some sort of accomplishment.

215
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.730
So it was kind of like,
you know that deal.
Like what,
what,

216
00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:59.650
what makes you successful can also take you down.
It's like,

217
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:00.850
depends on what you applied it to.

218
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:05.851
When I was applying my drive to make it as a comedian with drinking and uh,

219
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.840
and I was in the back of my head was like,
dude,
what are you doing here?

220
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.570
So I just finally,
uh,
I don't know what happened.
It was funny,

221
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.870
it was November of last year and I literally looked at the guy was drinking with

222
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:19.270
going through it.
I'm never stopping.
I fucking love this shit.

223
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.930
The next day I woke up and like,
I'm not doing this anymore.
I've got a kid now.

224
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.800
I just don't want her to see me.
You know,
I'll go out and get a drink.

225
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:31.030
My wife at some point I'm taking a year off and then after that,
you know,
big,

226
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:34.180
if I'm on the road and I'm going to a sporting event or taking a year off from

227
00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:37.090
drinking.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's it.
All right.

228
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.680
Maybe go a definitely all of this year.
I also want to go birthday to birthday.

229
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.790
Like I'm turning 51 or like being,
I didn't have one fucking drop when I was 51.

230
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.840
I don't know if I'll be able to make that.

231
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.860
There'll be like a urine and your birthday.
June,
you can do it.
Um,

232
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.530
how long have you been sober?
Uh,
June 9th will be 27 years due to,

233
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.950
you literally got sober right as I,
I,
I started in March of 92.

234
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.600
But what were you like when you were drinking?
I'm a fun drunk,
European drunk.

235
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.590
I'm fun and I tell people I love him and then I fall asleep.

236
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.470
I could see that,
I can see that.
Um,
it all depends,
but sometimes when I,

237
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.650
when I would get at a sporting event,
going to be in my next movie,
Oh,

238
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.150
I've got a movie about Ireland,

239
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.270
but my bike trips in Ireland and you would be perfect with the red fucking bird

240
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:27.220
and the whole fucking thing.
You know what I mean?
[inaudible] fucking cunt.

241
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.190
You'll,
I don't know if I can,
I can't do that accent,
I don't think.
No,
no,
but,

242
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.350
but here's,
here's what I'd found when I drank.

243
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.980
I drank champagne.
I was like,
oh,
that's cool man.
It was late.

244
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.930
I was happy and a little light in the loafers.
Yeah,
I was fucking funeral.

245
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.450
I was dancing people around the room.
Yeah,
it was Gatsby.
Right,
right.

246
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.830
Few eloquent.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
no,
that was the cocaine.
Beautiful thoughts.

247
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.460
You know,
profound

248
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.750
<v 1>cocaine didn't take you to a dark place.
Pr.
Oh yeah,
of course it did.
But,
um,</v>

249
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.900
it's just sounded like Jackie Mason cocaine didn't take it to that way.

250
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.490
But anyway,
no,
I did that.
You know,

251
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:09.280
you know what happened to me was I do that shit and I'd write and I'd say,
Bill,

252
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.880
let's say this stuff is,
you know,
I just wrote this thing and you know,

253
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.470
I gotta tell you,
wow.
I mean,
I didn't know I was this deep.

254
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.420
You know what I mean?
And then you look at it,
look at looking at in the morning,

255
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.770
so the most obvious shit,
oh,
the sky's blue,
whatever.
Yeah.

256
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.190
So that's where that took me.
But the key,
the champagne,
I was fun.

257
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:36.110
But then when I took the Whiskey,
oh my God,
I was so fucking,
you know,
it was fun.

258
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.400
You know,
you know those guys.

259
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.150
<v 0>I don't know what it is about the brown stuff.</v>

260
00:15:39.151 --> 00:15:42.240
It makes a lot of people Serling oh Jesus.

261
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:45.720
And you could smell yourself and you fucking,
all of a sudden,

262
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.200
you know what I always thought was a mean fucking liquor was Jen.
Oh yeah,
Jen.

263
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.550
I think Jen,
I was afraid to drink,
first of all.

264
00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:56.650
I don't like that floral taste to it,
but I was just here.

265
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.400
It is like isn't this is shit where you never committed a crime and then you

266
00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:02.130
drink a bottle of this and you stab someone in an alley or are you,

267
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.610
well this gin and tonic,
you know,
I mean that makes you feel a little bit

268
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.230
<v 1>as well,
not so much tonic mode gene.
You know,
he feels right because you know,</v>

269
00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:12.300
you grow up in Charlestown in Canton or whatever.

270
00:16:12.301 --> 00:16:17.010
It's like no one has gin and tonic.
You know,
he'd say,
well let me try this now.

271
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.331
Dawn Gavin,
who,
you know,

272
00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:22.470
he was always angry at me because I never had my own drink and he,

273
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.160
he's very serious about his drinking,
you know?
Yeah.

274
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:29.560
Like I'd have a bloody Mary and then a champagne and a beer and all this and he

275
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.300
said choose a drink.
Jesus Christ,
no matter with you,

276
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.480
he'd get so pissed off.
Right.

277
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.290
<v 0>That I actually understand that.
Yeah.
Cause you know what it is,
is he's a pro.</v>

278
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.850
He's a professional drinker.
Yeah.
If you come in and you're like,
no,
your drink,

279
00:16:44.851 --> 00:16:48.180
you've got to know your drink.
That's what,
there's a whole etiquette in a bar.

280
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.460
If you come in during the day.
Yeah.

281
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.170
And you sit down and you're just low energy,
are you doing,
he just,

282
00:16:55.270 --> 00:17:00.270
you order a and has to be a man strength too and you order that fucking thing

283
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.860
know.
And then you don't have to,

284
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.530
in Boston at least you didn't even have to talk to the guy when you finished it.

285
00:17:04.531 --> 00:17:08.700
He was coming back because he knew that you were putting your work in and that

286
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.330
and and also that you weren't going to be a problem.
It was,

287
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.270
it was people like yourself that come in.
This guy,
he just did a line of coke.

288
00:17:15.271 --> 00:17:18.470
Now he's drinking champagne.
Is that a wine cooler?
Like,
you know what I mean?

289
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.900
You're a wildcard.
Like no one knows.
What is this guy going to fucking do

290
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.230
<v 1>the,
well,
the guy said to me,
do you remember the combat zone?</v>

291
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.880
Yeah.
It's now known as the theater district.
You know,
so

292
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.400
<v 0>people listening to combat zone used to be where all the drug pushers.
Uh,</v>

293
00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:38.610
the Pill is strip strip joints,
pussycat theater.

294
00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:40.200
There was a bar down there called Harry's,

295
00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:44.370
which I went into one night when I was underage to get served and they could die

296
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.270
the naked eye now for our main room,
it's spun Nessa,
you know,

297
00:17:48.271 --> 00:17:50.430
and then the girl would come on scratch anywhere near you.

298
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.680
Notice when you walked down there,
you have 10 guys coming up to you.
Yo,
Yo,
Yo,

299
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.420
Yo yo

300
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.130
<v 1>the uh,
so the girl would get off,
says Mercedes and now from Las Vegas,</v>

301
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:02.130
it's Mercedes.
And then you talk to us from Winthrop.
Yeah,

302
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:06.190
that's all Mauldin I got a bunker.
Hell,
I'm a single mother.

303
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.410
And then they start chilling shy two credits and they start telling you about

304
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:14.620
their life,
which I'm not here to hear about your life.
Anyway.
So I went there,

305
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.840
one of those joints at eight in the morning and a guy who was just like that
bar.

306
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:20.520
And it's a wonderful life.
You know,

307
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:24.600
when I like characters here and its place when people come to drink.

308
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.310
So the guy says to me,

309
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:29.160
he used to start and a finish and write eight in the morning.

310
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.300
Sometimes they bought them as a good lines and I said,

311
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.850
[inaudible] sounded like Keith Richards,
you know,

312
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.590
Oh fuck am I gonna get the Fuck Outta here?
I can remember that.
But

313
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.290
<v 0>Oh,
he told you to get the fuck out.
Oh yeah,
of course.
Cool.
I love that.</v>

314
00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:45.340
If you were just starting,

315
00:18:45.341 --> 00:18:48.220
he was okay with giving her a drink at eight in the morning,
but because,

316
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.200
<v 1>because you just,
you couldn't answer the question,
you know?
Right.</v>

317
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.830
Those are great bartender at Nick's comedy stop named Gino,

318
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.100
and he was serving drinks to this guy.
I'll never forget it.

319
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.930
And the guys drink was rum and coke and Gino said,
okay,

320
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:06.090
so I'm going to give this guy a rum and coke.

321
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.100
He's going to fall to the left off the stool.
And he did.
And then amazing.

322
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.760
<v 0>Yeah.
Well that's always been your thing,</v>

323
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:18.230
your fascination with like characters like,
yeah.
Like how you,
you definitely,

324
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.540
you pick up on that.
Like,
do you remember Bobby flank rest his soul who,
uh,

325
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.260
Bobby flank and I remember that his,
his big,

326
00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:28.190
his catch phrase was when you came in,
hey,
how you doing?
Shut that fucking door.

327
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.850
It was always shuts up.
Shut.
The fuck was always shut that fucking door.

328
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.420
He never said shut the door.
Really?
How you doing?
Great.

329
00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:37.340
Shut that fucking door every single time.

330
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.950
You don't must leave it open just to hear him say it.
It was like,

331
00:19:39.951 --> 00:19:44.000
it was like you were on like his own little sitcom.
And um,

332
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.020
he was such a nice guy to like all the guys that I started out with.
Me,
Dane,

333
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.700
Patrice,
Bobby Kelly,
Bob Miley,
uh oh good,
good.

334
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.380
All good guys.
You know that I al Del Benny,
Geez,
I'm getting so old.

335
00:19:57.381 --> 00:19:58.790
I'm trying to remember all the fucking names now,

336
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.740
<v 1>but,
but you know,
I,
I,
I'm kind of,
um,</v>

337
00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.740
language is interesting and,

338
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.700
and what it says is interesting about the person that you know,

339
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.320
speaks a certain kind of language.

340
00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:16.000
So I did the opening of the movie in Somerville and it was great.

341
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:19.960
I had all these mayors there was wonderful,
right?
And this guy from Charlestown,

342
00:20:19.961 --> 00:20:22.660
I see them outside after the movie,
right?

343
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.260
It's one of the great nights of my life.
He says,
what's no nothing.

344
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.830
<v 0>You know,
they ask you a question and they answer it in the negative.
What's no,</v>

345
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:34.920
nothing.
That's fucking great.
Yeah.
Why is,

346
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:38.310
what is it with Massachusetts in general at that?
There's that many,

347
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.140
there's so many characters in,
I hope it's still like that,

348
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.180
but I know is everything's getting homogenized.

349
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.810
And then I remember like that was a saying when I was coming up.
Ah,
you know,

350
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.380
Fitzy God,
dude,
that guy's a character.
He's a fucking character.
He's a character.

351
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:58.690
And like it didn't mean like,
to me that just meant like,
you know,
uh,
you know,

352
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.770
he was a good shit,
you know,
whatever.
But the older I got,

353
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.220
I would see like this guy literally is a character in like,

354
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.700
unlike out here in la where everybody is so self aware,

355
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.790
which you kind of have to be as a performer to kind of feed what it is that

356
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:14.940
you're doing.
Those people back there,

357
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.270
I have no idea the show that they're putting on.

358
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.110
Yeah.
Like I saw a guy out here actually actually put on a nice show.
I was,

359
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.000
I was talking about in my last podcast,
I was sitting,
um,
at a regular table,

360
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.590
me and my wife and my daughter and these two guys want to sit at a high top bar

361
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:33.071
table.
Okay.

362
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:36.610
And this guy was sorta like medium fat and there wasn't enough space for him to

363
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:38.230
get his belly in between the chair.

364
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.250
And he made like four different attempts to try to get up on the stool and he

365
00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:44.770
couldn't do it.
And he stood back and he was kind of looking at the,

366
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.340
the physics of it.
And I was,
it was literally like watching like a Chaplin movie.

367
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:52.480
It was like a silent film because there was no,
no lines.
Oh.
And I was joking.

368
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.990
All is missing was like the old lady playing the piano and the guy finally gets

369
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:58.750
in.
And of course there was no punch in the end where he likes spills his drink.

370
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:03.000
But,
um,
I remember seeing that and it's just like,
I,

371
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.040
you don't see that enough out here with people that are in the business because

372
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:13.060
I just think that uh,
there's this weird thing where you sort of eat yourself.

373
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.430
Let me ask you something.
Are you a good sleeper?
Uh,

374
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.010
Yanni and now that I'm not sure.
Yeah.
Now that I'm not drinking,
I,
so I,

375
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.810
I went by the other day and I was meeting some friends for dinner,
you know,

376
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:26.644
old friends.

377
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:32.970
So this guy is sleeping on the sidewalk and I what I said to myself as how as

378
00:22:34.071 --> 00:22:38.830
they do that,
right.
How do they have that kind of inner security to just say,

379
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.350
okay,
could you sleep on a sidewalk?

380
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.800
I mean I'd be up every five minutes thinking something was going to happen.

381
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.880
I'd have to be so hammered that yeah.
Cause I did that one time.

382
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:53.881
I slept on outside in the parking lot of an I hop waiting for it to open.

383
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.590
It was my graduation night.

384
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:59.050
Me and my friends all went and got fucking blind drunk.
Yeah.

385
00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.440
They were all driving of course.
Cause that's what you did back then.
And we were,

386
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:07.330
there was four of us in my buddy's 79 t bird and we got to this,
this fucking,

387
00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:11.380
I hop that was open 23 hours a day.
And when I won in Brighton,

388
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.360
I forget where it was off,
it was off of route one and one dog.

389
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.620
And there was one where they one hour they cleaned it up and we got there when

390
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:22.300
they were cleaning it up,
we were like,
what the fuck?

391
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.520
And I was just so I just wanted to lay down.

392
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:28.120
I was so tired and I went out and I laid down like between the parked cars,

393
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:31.230
his car.
You did?
Yeah.
And I laid down,
I remember I put my head on the,

394
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.530
on the asphalt and it hurts.

395
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:36.490
So I took my wallet out and I used that as the pillow like right on the back of

396
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:40.370
my head.
I just crossed my arms across my legs.
Oh my God.

397
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.620
The son woke me up in the sound of a family.

398
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.130
Oh go in.
And I woke up and all the,
like there was,

399
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.910
it was a two door coupe and uh,

400
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.350
both doors were wide open and we were just hammered drunk.
They might,

401
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.910
my two buddies were in the front seat passed out.

402
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.840
You know what they look like in Goodfellas when the two people get whacked in

403
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:02.690
the pink caddy.
They look like they were drunk and the,

404
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:06.230
my other buddy was laying across in the back seat and I was laying on the
ground.

405
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.180
Wow.
I had a lot of those.
I remember passing out somewhere down on the Cape,

406
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.140
on the side of a bluff leading down to the ocean.
Holy Shit.

407
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.020
Fucking hammered in this tall grass with like,
you know,
well,

408
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:20.120
they cut the grass until the grade gets so steep.

409
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:21.620
They weren't gonna bring up lawnmower down there.

410
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:26.420
We were just laying in the weeds and I just remember I woke up to this woman

411
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:31.250
being like,
and then the pilgrims came in and they leave.
Yeah.
And literally,

412
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:35.620
and I heard this girl go like,
oh mommy,
why are they sleeping now?
Is this phone?

413
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.990
Oh,
it was bad.
Yeah.

414
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.180
What happened was we were drinking and driving and my buddy got a flat and we

415
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:45.740
were so shit faced.
We needed to sober up to get the Jack and all of that shit.

416
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:50.060
And then the tour woke us up,
he had a VW Fox.

417
00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:54.230
And I remember we,
we,
uh,
I put the Jack and I put it,

418
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.870
I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't put it in under the frame.

419
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.320
I put it under his fee is like the,
the floor board or whatever.

420
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.380
And it just went like right through and I was like,
all right,
that's not it.

421
00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:05.300
Like trying to find a stud in the wall.

422
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.240
And I finally got it on the frame and we were able to get the thing off,

423
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:11.780
but I had to bring it back down cause we didn't loosen the lug nuts first.

424
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:11.931
You know,

425
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:14.270
you don't want to do that when it's in the air because the fucking wheel turns,

426
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.470
uh,
yeah,
I got it.
That'd be a great photo album.
You know,
every,

427
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:19.840
all the places I passed out in

428
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.580
<v 1>without them,
what it led to,
you know,
but you know,</v>

429
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:26.210
it's funny what goes on in your mind.
I remember,
uh,

430
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.250
I did Letterman in two days later,

431
00:25:28.251 --> 00:25:33.251
I was passed out in the bushes fucking fence because a mark Parenteau at this

432
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:34.754
party,
whatever.

433
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.810
And the guy was saying that guy was on Letterman the other night and he said,

434
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.200
the other guys said,
you know how when you pass out you can still hear voices?

435
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.880
Like you heard pilgrims?
He said that guy that fucking wine.
No.
And so I get up,

436
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.610
it was like humiliating if I was sober that Oh God.

437
00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.670
<v 0>So it didn't know any during any of those times during that whole time.</v>

438
00:25:56.671 --> 00:25:59.940
Was it because everybody was doing it that there was no thought of like,

439
00:25:59.941 --> 00:26:01.620
I kind of need the load down

440
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.160
<v 1>fix with doing it for Christ sakes,
you know?
Um,
but I,
I don't,</v>

441
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.540
yeah,

442
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.000
that there is that part of you that there's a part of you that says something

443
00:26:13.001 --> 00:26:15.110
not right about this shit.
Right.
But

444
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.130
<v 0>what about like paying taxes and shit?
I'm like,</v>

445
00:26:17.131 --> 00:26:20.750
all you guys get your wages garnished because I,
everybody goes,
I know I true.

446
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.670
They used to pay you in like give you the option cocaine or the money?

447
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.050
<v 1>No,
that was in Florida.
That was,
that was in Florida.</v>

448
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:29.180
I did a gig down in Tampa.

449
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

450
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.310
<v 1>Guy and like a guide said,
you know,</v>

451
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.760
<v 0>did you try it before?
You know,
I mean,
I didn't like this.</v>

452
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.420
This doesn't feel like two 15 or so.
I was just

453
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.980
<v 1>talk about not having</v>

454
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.790
<v 0>a business sense,
but the guy did a routine about it.</v>

455
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:51.900
A guy named Joey from Chicago.
He says,
Oh yeah,
I'll,
I'll say that to my landlord.

456
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.890
I'm going to pay you any of the money of coke.
What did,
what would you like?
Um,

457
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.750
yeah,
it was,
you know,

458
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:02.730
I w I did morning radio for five years at Cox and I talked to guys that lived

459
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:06.420
through it all and we'd look at each other and say,
not amazing was still alive,

460
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.220
you know.
But I gotta tell you this,
you lose a lot of people.
Yeah.

461
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.110
Come on up there.
Was there a,
no,

462
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.020
not as bad now because I actually work in the field.

463
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:19.560
You probably don't know that.
I work in jails.
I do substance abuse counseling,

464
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.150
but there's an epidemic of the opioid stuff.

465
00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:28.840
Does that going on out here?
It's going on all across the country.
I've actually,

466
00:27:28.841 --> 00:27:29.950
I've had a,

467
00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:36.490
I think three people either have lose somebody or have uh,

468
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.990
somebody that a kid they had to do an intervention on just in like the last
year.

469
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.430
And I lost a childhood friend to it from,
from back east or out here.

470
00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.630
He got off it and then he uh,
ah,
man,
it was brutal.

471
00:27:49.631 --> 00:27:51.790
He had a beautiful little five year old daughter.

472
00:27:51.791 --> 00:27:54.250
I was just thinking about her the other day that she's got to be close to

473
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.710
graduating high school now.
He died a while ago.
Um,
and uh,
and that guy,

474
00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:00.544
you know,

475
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.070
was one of the funniest people I've ever met because that's a funny thing.

476
00:28:03.071 --> 00:28:06.220
When I go back and I run into like my friends from high school,

477
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:10.300
they will all his funny as I was sitting,
a lot of them were funny.
Like,
like,

478
00:28:10.301 --> 00:28:13.740
just let like the balls they had,
the shit that they did.

479
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.940
<v 1>Well that's another thing,
like when you said character.
Yeah.</v>

480
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.900
That word like in Charleston and put guy was crazy.

481
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.580
That was a good thing.
Yeah.
Oh,
he's a crazy past that.
He'll do anything.

482
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

483
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:30.470
I always looked at it like there was people like when they come up to me like,

484
00:28:30.471 --> 00:28:33.300
dude,
I was fucking funny.
And then you,
why the fuck are you blah blah blah.

485
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:34.730
And it's like,
dude,
you gotta understand man.

486
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:39.580
Like I'm the guy that tells the story your the story.
Okay.
I,

487
00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:42.380
I,
you know,
I didn't,
you know,
pedestrian,

488
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:47.390
stupid juvenile shit,
but these guys did stuff where you would just like,

489
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.680
what tough.
I like to the point,
I still don't tell,
I tell him off air to you,

490
00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:56.000
but just some of the shit that I saw some of these guys do.
Um,

491
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.400
I mean there's one classic story when,
uh,
I'm not gonna,

492
00:28:58.401 --> 00:29:00.500
I'm not gonna name any names of where the fuck we were,

493
00:29:00.501 --> 00:29:04.010
but we went to a college party and two of my friends are going to,

494
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.920
cause I'm not naming anything.
Okay.
All right.

495
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.920
So it wasn't the college that I went to cause that's on my Wikipedia.

496
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.730
If you heard the story,
you know,
it wasn't the calls I went to.
Okay.
So what,

497
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.680
anyway,
uh,

498
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.520
two of my friends decide to leave and it was like an off campus apartment

499
00:29:19.521 --> 00:29:23.900
building and there was this party upstairs that they went to.
Okay.

500
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.530
And they leave and I swear to God,
like they came back 10 minutes later,

501
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:32.890
one of them had a separated shoulder and a bloody lip and the other one had a

502
00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:36.410
gash right on top of his head.
He had a flat top.
So you could see the blood,

503
00:29:36.411 --> 00:29:40.190
like a gash going from the,
like the top of his head right down to his forehead.

504
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.220
Oh my God.
And we will like to,
what the fuck?
What the fuck happened?
Right.
And,
uh,

505
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.093
they all,
we just,

506
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.290
we just walked through this part and everybody beat the shit out of us.

507
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.750
So we all fucking storm up there.
Right.
That's war fighting words.

508
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.630
And the dude leading us,
I swear to God,

509
00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:58.360
he was a bouncer and he had like a mouthpiece,

510
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.300
like a mouth guard and he would put this fuck it.

511
00:30:01.301 --> 00:30:03.320
There was a funny thing cause he,
cause he was exciting.

512
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.680
He very excited to go to square off with people when you put the mouth guard in

513
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.560
and we'd like psych them out.
Right.
Wow.
So he's leading us up there and sweet.

514
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.230
We march up the stairs and we hear the party and he knocks on the door in the

515
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:17.380
most innocent voice ever.
He goes,
excuse me,
is,
is there a party in there?

516
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.030
And they opened the door and like 12 angry men come in.
Right.

517
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:23.320
And just start swinging.
Dude,

518
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:25.570
I'd never forget because it was on those old brownstones,

519
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.840
just the sound of the wood floors of all that stuff around.

520
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:35.440
Yeah.
Just,
okay.
Goes down in about fucking 30 seconds.
Smoke clears.

521
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.830
And I'm sizing this up as drunk as I am.

522
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:43.831
And there's like fucking four guys and four women in there and like a board game

523
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.940
that's been like tipped over and stuff.

524
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.840
We're kind of like looking like what do we went to the wrong party.
Oh,

525
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.550
the real party.
Oh No,
they were just like on like a date night and,

526
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.850
and the will know.
Yes.
And the real party,

527
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.830
we didn't put it together until,
cause we like who fucking smashed a bottle.

528
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.490
We were idiots.
And then the real party was all the way upstairs.

529
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.080
And here's the funny thing,

530
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.810
they were locking the ironic thing,

531
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.300
they were rich kids and they sued both of my friends there.

532
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.490
They had like,
you know,
big time lawyer parents and they sued them and Oh,

533
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:23.470
I remember we,
I forgot part of the story.
My buddy,

534
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.600
we popped his shoulder back in and he went up there and he fucking threw a punch

535
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:32.620
with the same arm and missed,
popped it out again.
I'll never forget.

536
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:36.760
I remember seeing him at my feet flopping around like a fish.

537
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.450
He was in so much pain and afterwards we were like,
dude,
why the fuck did you,

538
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.500
why the fuck didn't you throw with your left and steady your right?
He goes,

539
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.430
he goes,
I wanted this arm to get its revenge.
So fucking like,

540
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.480
and that once again on,
wow,
that sounds like comedy.
But he was such a character.

541
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:56.350
Like he was,
he was serious.
Like,

542
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.700
and I just remember all my friends back then would just,
um,

543
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.900
looking back at them.
What character?
Like that fucking kid with the mouthpiece,

544
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:06.940
the fucking mouthpiece.
I never heard of that ever.

545
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.880
It wasn't like a full on one where he covers tea.
It was something he liked.

546
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.840
He liked bit down on like,
so if someone gave him like an uppercut,
his,

547
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.470
his teeth wouldn't smash together.
See the way you looking at me.

548
00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:21.280
I see you had a lot of fights.
Like you are a fighter.
Yeah,
no,

549
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:24.530
I enjoy these stories but,
but the,
the,

550
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.060
the part of the story where you went to the wrong party,
it was like,
oh my God.

551
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.400
But no,
I,
uh,
I had a fantastic fascination with all of this.

552
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.560
I got in my share of fights,

553
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:40.190
I would say my record was maybe two wins in three losses

554
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.140
<v 1>and yeah,
and then a break 23 to know you.
You weren't good at it?
No,
I,</v>

555
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.100
I was,
I did.
Okay.
I wasn't formidable,
but

556
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.840
<v 0>they did okay until about sixth grade and then all of a sudden everybody hit</v>

557
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:56.870
their growth spurt and I hit puberty late and then all of a sudden I needed to

558
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:59.450
get,
what is the worst feeling that I needed to,

559
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:03.140
I needed to fucking get funny fast.
You know,
you know what is there,

560
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.640
what is the worst feeling

561
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:09.370
<v 1>then you're in the sixth grade that makes you,
what,
1415 something?</v>

562
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:14.090
1314,
13 guy offers you out the beginning of the day.

563
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:18.770
So he's spending the whole dots.
And then there was bills.

564
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.130
Oh my God.
And I was like,

565
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.743
<v 2>okay.</v>

566
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.770
<v 1>It was the crowd that psych me out more.
I wasn't very good,</v>

567
00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:30.830
but weird thing happened to me.
Then I,
uh,

568
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:37.050
I lost the fear of taking a beaten and then I was good,
but,

569
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.510
well,
how did,
how does that happen?
Well if my father used to train fighters,

570
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.780
so anyway,
and he never taught me anything,

571
00:33:45.781 --> 00:33:49.080
but I took boxing in high school with this guy,
you eat Duffy and we,

572
00:33:49.081 --> 00:33:50.080
it was Boston English.

573
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.250
So it was a funny thing because he'd always say there's no such thing as a

574
00:33:53.251 --> 00:33:54.330
punched one fighter.

575
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:58.920
He saw it sounded like Mick and rocky and then when the bell would ring to

576
00:33:58.921 --> 00:34:01.180
change classic work.
Anyway,

577
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:05.850
so you get in the ring with this guy who was an old guy at the time and he would

578
00:34:05.851 --> 00:34:10.110
just pummel you.
He would just pummel you and then you find out,
okay,

579
00:34:10.111 --> 00:34:13.290
I can take it and you have the head gear.
But uh,

580
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.890
I used to love to like be a spectator or those things.

581
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.970
There were fights in Charleston that were unbelievable.
They were up there like,

582
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.540
what do you know the movie,
the quiet man,
John Wayne.

583
00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:29.070
He fights white from county to count on and on and on.

584
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.620
So in Charleston there were fights from courtyard to court,

585
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.130
yet to kids like Jackie McDougall,

586
00:34:35.131 --> 00:34:38.000
he had a left torque that would just knock people out in the seat bite.

587
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.670
And this guy,
Ronnie Pool.
And then there was this kid,
Paul Troy,

588
00:34:41.671 --> 00:34:43.950
he met on the bridge with this at Titan Kid.

589
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:47.700
And so that was north end verse Charles Stock for people not from Boston.

590
00:34:47.701 --> 00:34:51.480
You can just base it all the Italians and all the Irish.

591
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.770
And I was telling this,
I'm one of the other podcasts.
So there was a group fight.

592
00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.350
So you go over there and,
um,
being an Irish,
you know,

593
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.310
part of being Irish is that you don't have any emotions,
right?

594
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.500
Isn't that true?
And usually,
and you know that you got German and Irish,
so,

595
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.210
wow.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
There's a,
there's a joke in England is like,

596
00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:18.150
what's an English girl without a sense of humor,
a German,
you know,

597
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.290
they're just yes,
just for us.
So anyway,

598
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.380
you lined up with this kid from the north end and uh,

599
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.040
you just looking at them and they're so fucking unbelievable,
you know,

600
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.730
with the voice and the gestures and then know what they're gonna do.

601
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.440
I'm gonna take you a fucking here.
I'm gonna.
What are you fucking come me.

602
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:41.310
I'm gonna rip your fucking Irish whiskey based fucking everybody and you're just

603
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:43.710
kind of watching,
you know,
when you're an actor,

604
00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:47.340
which you are this part of your doing and part of watching and then you forget,

605
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.730
shit,
I'm in a flight,
I'm supposed to fight.
Right.

606
00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.480
<v 0>What are you thinking as you're going over that bridge?</v>

607
00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.290
Because this is just normal.
Charlestown know one.
I'll tell you something.

608
00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:59.860
I'm going to be honest with you.
Every time you go on into this,

609
00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.840
if you had Mike Tyson on your show.
No,
I think Rogan has,
I'm,

610
00:36:04.841 --> 00:36:08.890
I'm not as big as him.
No,
he said the same thing.
It's all fear.

611
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.200
It's all fear,
you know,
then,
then what happens?

612
00:36:14.201 --> 00:36:18.910
And then it starts and then you just survival.
Cause I,
cause I intimate.

613
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:19.803
That's when I,

614
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:24.250
I started like when you played the Boston Gardens,

615
00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.960
right as I have,
I did comics come home and I did,

616
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.010
uh,
yeah,
he had one of the best sense everyone.
So

617
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.030
<v 1>you're on your way up the stairs to the gardens,
right?
So this fear,
right?</v>

618
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.440
Did you feel afraid?
Nervous?

619
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.740
<v 0>Um,
what did I feel?
I felt,
uh,</v>

620
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.210
I didn't feel it on my show because they came to see me,
but on comics come home.

621
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.770
Yeah.
That's like Leary's thing and Neeley's thing.
So it's just like,

622
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.150
and everybody swinging for the fences,
so the later you go,
yeah,
it's,
yeah,

623
00:36:59.151 --> 00:37:01.880
I feel like pressure is what I feel.

624
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:06.840
<v 1>All right.
So,
well let me make two points there.
When I got on stage,</v>

625
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:09.510
it was like,
this is unbelievable.
No one's looking at me.

626
00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.570
They all look at the screens.
Have you noticed that weird?

627
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.860
Even the people down front?
Yeah.
They're looking at the screens.
So I said,
no,

628
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:17.850
I can relax this.

629
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.120
Nobody fucking looking at me even though there's 17,000 of them.

630
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:26.430
But that's the feeling,
you know what I mean?
But like,

631
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.580
I don't know why we're talking about this,
but because it's where I started.

632
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.910
But I think,
I think it's that,

633
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.410
I think it's that primal thing of like you could get killed,
you know,

634
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:39.000
and that's real.
You could get killed them.

635
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.720
<v 0>Okay.
That's,
and that's when I lost,
I lost my heart when,
when,</v>

636
00:37:41.721 --> 00:37:46.370
when guys want to guys got,
um,
past a certain size,

637
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.000
they got bigger and then like I started seeing blood and teeth getting knocked

638
00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:53.990
out shit and just people getting pummeled and coming back was swollen faces and

639
00:37:53.991 --> 00:37:57.790
I was just like,
Hey,
I wanted to,
I don't want to do that.
I didn't want to do.

640
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.750
And also I,
I,

641
00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.860
I was an angry enough kid where it's like I don't want to tap in.

642
00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.520
I don't want to become that.
I don't,
I number one was fear.

643
00:38:07.521 --> 00:38:12.230
I don't want that done to me.
But I also,
I just didn't want to like,
uh,

644
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.840
you know,
I just,
these guys and I was just like,

645
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.810
I was just playing fucking nerf football with this guy.
Here it is,

646
00:38:17.811 --> 00:38:21.650
three years later he starting to be able to grow sideburns and he has a court

647
00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:25.610
case and it's just like,
wow,
like what the fuck happened?
And like this guy,

648
00:38:25.611 --> 00:38:30.050
we would trade in football cards so can fucking eaten on that fucking stale gum

649
00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:32.720
that they gave you.
And then let's just this guy,
this guy has to go to court,

650
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.580
you know?
So it just became like,
you know,
it's funny,

651
00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:38.050
the great I was in though was really,

652
00:38:38.051 --> 00:38:41.620
we were like a cool grade lawyer where like the popular kids,
by the end of it,

653
00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:43.810
the popular kids were hanging out with the burnouts and the athletes,

654
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:45.850
everybody was just sorta just,
we will fund.

655
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.900
But the great above me in the grade below me were fucking lunatics.

656
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:52.960
They will own it.
That's what happened

657
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:58.030
<v 1>in Charlestown.
Yeah.
My generation,
they were okay.
Pretty much.</v>

658
00:38:58.850 --> 00:38:58.960
Uh,

659
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.960
well not exactly okay by terms of like society because Bubba Bubba for

660
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.100
Charlestown involvement below fucking bank,
Robyn armored cars,
the whole thing.

661
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.690
But let me ask you something that I've never asked anyone else,

662
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.280
cause this is how my mind works.

663
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:20.790
I'll think of an incident that happened many years ago and I'll say to myself,

664
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.840
I really should have given that guy a dope slap.
Do you ever think of that?
Yeah.

665
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.160
Yeah.
Like somebody insults you and you're just sort of remember it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

666
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:34.200
<v 0>No.
Uh,
but I've,
I've fortunately got to the,
but I always,</v>

667
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.370
but it always comes out best if you don't,
if you don't.
Yeah.

668
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.270
Well I remember there was a guy who was a fucking asshole to me.
Yeah.

669
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.920
My perception of the business.
Yeah.
Cause there's a lot in this.
So this,

670
00:39:45.921 --> 00:39:48.440
this was my,
uh,
and wild.

671
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:53.850
What he really did was he just made a wise ass comment and all I should have

672
00:39:53.851 --> 00:39:57.440
done was break his balls back.
Yeah.
But I didn't know too.
And I,

673
00:39:57.441 --> 00:40:02.430
I took it personal.
Yeah.
And uh,
he also fucking didn't pay me for a Gig.

674
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.880
So I redwood city one that,
uh,

675
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.140
I don't like cause people are gonna figure out who the fuck it is.
I'll tell Ya,

676
00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.900
I'll tell you off here.
All right.
Okay.
So I just remember I was just like,

677
00:40:12.901 --> 00:40:16.770
you know,
I fucked up mother fucker someday.
I'm gonna fuck you.
I'm Candace,

678
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.250
I'm going to get here and he's going to come up to me and act like he's my

679
00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:22.850
friend and I'm going to tell that guy to go fuck himself and blah blah.

680
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.880
So anyway,
the speech.
Yeah.
We all have this,
oh,
I'm going to,

681
00:40:26.881 --> 00:40:29.610
I'm going to fucking give him my on a piece of my mind.
Right.

682
00:40:29.611 --> 00:40:34.611
So I remember years later I booked an acting gig and I was doing all right.

683
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:39.840
And he came walking by and goes,
hey,
I heard about La Vegas.
Congratulations.

684
00:40:39.841 --> 00:40:42.810
Seriously man,
fucking congratulations.
I was just like,
oh yeah,
thanks a lot.

685
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.980
And he walked away and then it just dawned on me,
it was just like,
oh wait,

686
00:40:46.981 --> 00:40:50.820
that was the moment he was going to come up to me.
No,

687
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.640
I actually thought like,
Huh,
I don't even give a shit.
Oh Wow.

688
00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.440
And I learned something about life where I was just like,
you know,
I,

689
00:41:00.441 --> 00:41:05.010
I've had these moments where there's been this person that's,
you know,
in,

690
00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:08.790
in my mind is in front of me and is blocking my way to get through the next door

691
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:13.680
to move up.
And I just realized after awhile that like,

692
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.680
I don't need the fight.
This guy,
I just have to keep,

693
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.130
I got to go inward and just keep getting better and keep this guy,

694
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:25.380
this guy is not in my way.
Yeah.
He's not in my way.
I am doing my thing.

695
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.110
Okay.
And this guy's being a cunt,
but the,
the,

696
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.830
he's not going to be,

697
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.620
I just kept picturing myself just going up and up and up and up and up like a

698
00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:39.370
balloon and I'm just going to go right up and over this look,
I,
you know,
I'm not,

699
00:41:39.371 --> 00:41:44.371
I don't need to fucking sit here and because I would watch guys and I did a two,

700
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:49.220
but I would watch guys get derailed by that and all that energy that you could

701
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:52.070
be using to build up what you're doing.

702
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.320
You're plotting and scheming and bad mouth in and doing all of this shit and

703
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:03.680
then that guy is in your way.
But if you don't react to it,
then he's fighting a,

704
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:05.150
you know,
what do they call it?
A one way war,

705
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:08.810
one sided war or something like that.
Um,
yeah,
there was a Latino,

706
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.480
there was all those fucking guys when you came up,
those guys,

707
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:15.260
I try to get you to be loyal just to their club and if you worked at other club,

708
00:42:15.261 --> 00:42:17.690
I'm not fucking balloon.
It's like,
all right,
well then what are you paying me?

709
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.290
Yeah,
cause this is my nut every month.
Right.
You know,
I remember this,

710
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:24.950
this fucking jerk off,
uh,
down at the,
uh,
this,

711
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:29.780
I will say that down at the comedy connection,
uh,

712
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.500
and the comedy connection had the place in Boston,
which was the flagship,

713
00:42:33.501 --> 00:42:35.840
and then they had the one down in Providence,
the old bank.
Right.

714
00:42:35.841 --> 00:42:38.390
Which I think still exist.
New ownership too.

715
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:40.430
So I'm not shitting on the people that are there.
God bless them.

716
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:43.430
I hope they sell at all this shows this year.
Right?
So this is back in the day.

717
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.660
So I went down there and I was working with Rick Dalea Wright and Rick to Leah

718
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.050
hosts.
I go up and I middle,
um,

719
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:55.940
and then I forget who fucking million Billy Martin or somebody closed and a,

720
00:42:55.941 --> 00:42:59.360
so I go to get my check from them and I,
they gave me hosting money.

721
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.760
So for people listening,
you know,
the host gets paid,

722
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:04.430
this feature gets a little more than the headline.
It gets the lion's share.

723
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.420
So that they gave me hosts money and I,
you know,
as a feature,

724
00:43:08.421 --> 00:43:10.850
you do more time than the house so you should get more money.

725
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:15.080
So I called the guy up,
he's like,
Hey,
what's going on?
I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
I,
uh,

726
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.760
I,
I featured on that show down in providence.
You gave me a host money.
He goes,

727
00:43:19.761 --> 00:43:24.740
oh no,
no,
no,
no.
He goes,
you co hosted,
he like invented this term.

728
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.000
He said,
I cohosted so I got,
no,

729
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.910
he didn't cohosting would have been if me and Dalea went on stage at the same

730
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:34.100
time,
like the smothers brothers.

731
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.990
He fucking warmed them up and then brought me up and walked off and I did my

732
00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:42.920
fucking 20 minutes.
And so then after that,

733
00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:45.770
I never played the club again for awhile because he kept calling me up.

734
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.310
You available.
Of course.
I just kept saying,
I'm not available.
I'm not available.

735
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:50.540
That was a passive aggressive way.

736
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:52.790
I did it cause I was still nervous cause he's still booked Boston.

737
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:57.200
But then he said to me,
he goes,
what days are you available?
And I was like,

738
00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.960
all right,
I gotta bite the laws.
You're up.
Oh my God,

739
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.720
I'm fucking available this Thursday.
All right,

740
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:05.060
we're going to put you down in Providence.
I said,
what?
What do you got to?
Yeah,

741
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:07.750
go.
You got me co this is my big line.
Back then when I thought it was fun,

742
00:44:07.751 --> 00:44:09.710
I was like,
what do you got me cohost and for a twinkie?

743
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:14.300
And he kind of fucking laughed.
And then,
um,

744
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.060
cause I talked to Patrice about it.
I just stood my ground.
I was like,
dude,

745
00:44:17.061 --> 00:44:21.410
I can't go down there.
Yeah.
I just,
I'm not trying to be a jerk here,
but I can't

746
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.710
as,
as a,
as a feature,

747
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.220
I can't go down there and feature and then have you pay me host money.

748
00:44:28.221 --> 00:44:31.410
It's like you're managing a club.
What if they gave you waitress money?

749
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.460
<v 1>Right.
And said,
oh you co waitresses.
Exactly.
But,</v>

750
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:40.340
but it's interesting too because,
and then I didn't work for a while.
Yeah,

751
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.240
there you go.
There you go.
But you know,
I,

752
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:48.380
I try to like not tell the stories cause I get upset and keeps it alive.

753
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:50.280
But there's a guy who screwed me,

754
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:55.610
whose names rhymes with Third Reich and then there's first name rhymes,

755
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.780
rhymes with groom.
Anyway,
so,
uh,

756
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:05.040
I ended up suing them and I won and everything.
And you know,
I,

757
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:06.480
uh,
I'm like you though,

758
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:11.481
because there's a tendency when I relive the story to get all pissed off and I

759
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:15.990
think that's what kept me down a lot,
right?

760
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.460
It's those stories that I would tell myself.
And then one day,
and I also,

761
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:25.020
my drug of choice was telling people to go fuck themselves.
I,

762
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:29.310
I fantasized about it.
I love doing it.
I,
it's so fun in the moment.

763
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:34.020
The fallout sucks,
but it's so fun in the mall.
It's a,

764
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:40.020
yeah,
it is.
It's a wonderful thing,
you know,
like you get to do it.

765
00:45:40.021 --> 00:45:45.021
But my mind is so full of movies that it's always clean in a movie.

766
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.860
It doesn't come out like,
fuck you.
You know,
because when I get angry,

767
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.450
you were talking about fighting early.

768
00:45:51.451 --> 00:45:55.710
I lose all control and it becomes white and crazy.
And,

769
00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:00.330
and I did get to tell him to go fuck himself.
As a matter of fact.
And it,

770
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.480
it didn't give me the satisfaction that I was hoping I would,
you know.

771
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.170
So now like you,
I say life.
Life is two things.

772
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:11.440
Life is short and life's of gifts,
you know,
and you wake up everyday,

773
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.710
you got to pinch yourself where you are right now.
I mean,

774
00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.870
I mean not the outside things.
You've got a kid,
you've got a wife,

775
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.420
you go help them.
And that's the way I feel.
I mean,

776
00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:23.190
look at me fucking you shouldn't me,

777
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.450
I got to tell you something that I haven't told anybody and I'm going to be

778
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.770
shitting me.
What the fuck?
Look at me.
Oh fuck.
I'm alive.
Right.

779
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.270
But I gotta tell you something that I haven't told anybody

780
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:42.120
until this trip with this movie.
And uh,

781
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:46.530
and with Joe too,
you know,
with everything with this movie,
I really,

782
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:51.030
I would've spent the rest of my days thinking,
I just,
you know,

783
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:53.070
I did my thing in Boston and that was it.

784
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:58.080
And then the reception I've gotten from guys like you and guys coming up that I

785
00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:01.600
meant something to them.
My God.
Yeah.
But,
but I never knew that and I,

786
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:05.910
and I never thought about that and I never considered that.
So it's been like,

787
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:08.450
that's probably been the best part of this whole thing is like,
well,

788
00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:12.630
like when I went to the Improv,
because agents are always going to talk,

789
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:17.520
they're going to find something about you that will keep you in your fucking

790
00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:20.550
place,
you know?
And they'd say,
oh,
he's regional,
he's all this shit.

791
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.820
And that's what this movie's about,
by the way.
Uh,

792
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.480
but then when I see guys like yourself to so successful,

793
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:32.230
he's still even remember who I am and I'm not being falsely modest,

794
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.760
you know?
But,
but that's how I feel is like,

795
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.430
<v 0>because this is what you mean to me,
the fact I can't believe you,</v>

796
00:47:38.431 --> 00:47:41.450
you're on my podcast,
Adam,

797
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.670
that you talk to me like I'm a peer and this how big you are to me and the fact

798
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:50.170
that I actually have your cell phone number and then you called me the other day

799
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:53.320
going like,
so we still good for fucking noon on Wednesday.
And I was just like,

800
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:56.620
I just talked to Steve Sweeney.
Oh well you know what that is.
It's just like,

801
00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:00.610
it's,
it's the people that like,
uh,
cause you know,

802
00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:02.440
you don't just become a comedian.

803
00:48:02.441 --> 00:48:05.590
Like you could just end up working in a factory,

804
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:08.080
you can end up working at a bank or something like,
Oh man,

805
00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:09.580
I'm not saying shitting on those jobs,

806
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:12.430
but I'm just saying this is like something,
this is like a passion.

807
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.880
So when you guys building the scene in all of that made it possible.

808
00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:23.590
Because I literally thought if I wanted to be a comedian before I knew anything

809
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:27.160
that I had to move to la or New York,
like I,

810
00:48:27.161 --> 00:48:29.020
it just seemed like a million miles away.

811
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.170
And then somebody finally told me that you can just sign up for an open mic down

812
00:48:32.171 --> 00:48:36.370
the street.
And then I went in and then I got into this whole world of like,

813
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.340
and you know,
and then the history,
like who started this?
And it's like,

814
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:43.390
oh he's fucking five guys started that.
The thing hoe with a Chinese restaurant,

815
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.200
there were no clubs.
Yeah.
And it's like,
and they don't have day jobs now.

816
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:50.770
They just tell jokes,
Donovan,
Mike Donovan,
all of those guys.
And I was just like,

817
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:55.400
oh yeah,
but one of my favorite lines ever in anybody's act,

818
00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.340
it was a throw away line that Donovan used and it was so specific to Boston when

819
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:04.150
he was talking about some disgruntled guy at work and he was yelling,

820
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.350
he was given this boss Shit back,
give them the bosses like Eh.

821
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.170
So he was giving it back to me.
He goes,
hey,
I'll fucking blah blah.
He goes,

822
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:16.100
I'll take a fucking 20 minutes shit on the clock.
And I remember there was a guy,

823
00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:18.280
I worked in a warehouse and he did that every morning.

824
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.270
He would go in and they would be like the Roach croach would show up and he

825
00:49:22.271 --> 00:49:24.880
would eat something.
And then like clockwork,
a half an hour later,

826
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:30.090
he grabbed the herald of the globe and he would slowly walk to the bathroom and

827
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:35.020
he wasn't even shit and do,
he would just be sitting there.

828
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.580
How long does it take to take a shit?

829
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:41.050
He'd be in there for a fucking half hour every day and that's why he's still

830
00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.170
feel self thankful for this job because he,

831
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.950
it's like the days it'd become mundane.
He hated the job that,
that,

832
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:51.010
that the thing that he looked forward to,
we sit,

833
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.560
do you sit on a toilet that long,
your legs fall asleep.

834
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.950
He would fucking sit there and say,
when we would do,
we would start going in.

835
00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.570
We were going to give him like 10 minutes so the smell would go away and be
like,

836
00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:04.300
funny.
Yeah.
This Guy Joe Joe,
he's still taking that shit man.
And he'd be like,

837
00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.810
fucking,
his catch phrase was,
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.

838
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:10.540
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.
I had a job

839
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.250
<v 1>in a factory commerce rubber.
I'll never forget this.</v>

840
00:50:13.251 --> 00:50:16.940
It was a factory and the fumes I'm showing my lungs were all screwed up front.

841
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:21.950
Yeah.
But I was on an assembly line literally in front of a clock.

842
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.760
So you'd say to yourself,
I'm not going to look up.
I'm not going to look up.

843
00:50:25.761 --> 00:50:27.290
I'm not going to look up then.

844
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:31.400
Now I can look up cause I've waited so long and you think it's two hours.

845
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:32.600
It's like 10 minutes.

846
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:37.760
But you know I the way you feel about some of the guys that started,

847
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:42.100
I met Al Pachino and I was like,
because I'm an actor,
you know,

848
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.330
it's like this part of me talking on.

849
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.820
And then another partner talking to fucking Al Pachino.

850
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.720
I like when I worked with George Carlin,
you know,
and they was at like,

851
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:54.920
I never got to amazing.
Amazing.
Because he let you relax.

852
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.780
He helps you relax so you could,
and then when he respects your work,
it's like,

853
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:03.910
are you kidding me?
But I was,
I could see him like with his style,

854
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:08.630
liking your style.
Brilliant,
brilliant man.
Very,
very light.

855
00:51:08.631 --> 00:51:11.120
Very deep.
Same time he,

856
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.190
we took a car from Portland,

857
00:51:16.191 --> 00:51:20.780
Maine to Boston and he named all the constellations.
He was always like curious,

858
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:24.860
you know,
and I just love,
I would walk him,

859
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.420
go on stage.
You wrote in a car with George fucking car?
Oh yeah.
And,

860
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:35.180
uh,
he rented the car and I kept it a week late.
Mike Clark was saying,

861
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:38.930
you're going to bring that car back.
And I said,
well,
I'm still using it.

862
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:42.710
It's like,
you know what I mean?
He was paying for it.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
Eve,

863
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.820
I know what's wrong with me.
I was just,
I was kind of out of it,
you know?
Oh,

864
00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:51.080
you were partying?
No,
I was just sort of a flake,
you know,

865
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:54.590
and it wasn't focused.
And
um,

866
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.960
that goes a little beyond not returning a rental car.

867
00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:00.440
Flaking is being fucking an hour late for an appointment.

868
00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:05.000
And even the rent a car for a week.
I know he's very inconsiderate.

869
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:07.430
If I was in my right mind,
I wouldn't do it.
But,

870
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:11.780
and I don't know what came over me.
I couldn't get up.

871
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:15.260
I had a problem getting out.
That's why I guess I'm depressed,

872
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:22.070
you know?
You know what I've been thinking lately.
Maybe I'm bipolar.
Really.

873
00:52:22.071 --> 00:52:26.270
You don't strike me as that.
Well,
I can say that having no medical degree at all,

874
00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.570
you can say whatever you want.
It's like in Aa,
you know,

875
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.620
there's all kinds of people that give legal advice,
doctor's advice,

876
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:37.880
and they work as iron workers if I can plummet.
Yeah.
Dumper.
You know,
counseling,

877
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:41.990
family counseling.
Yeah.
Dump La.
[inaudible].
Yeah,
so I told her the other day,

878
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.470
there's plenty,
there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Well,
I want this fish.
Wow.

879
00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:50.090
Fuck that.
I'll never forget one thing or another.
Wife get up fucking another.

880
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:54.050
I remember one time I was on a retreat,
yoga retreat,

881
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.640
and I was feeling really open and connected and I'd said to a friend,
I said,

882
00:52:58.641 --> 00:53:00.590
I want to talk.
And he said,

883
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:04.970
not about that feel and shit as it so,
well

884
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.050
you're fighting.
Then he says,
you find yourself,

885
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.980
you find anybody else the FAC.
Oh yeah,
no,
it's so well done.

886
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.270
You attitude is like California sacks.
You ever been there?
No,

887
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:21.530
I don't fucking have to go there.
You know,
dude,
I have a friend of mine.
Yeah,

888
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:26.100
he calls me up.
He's from back east and he

889
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.280
<v 0>calls me because he misses me and he wants to talk to me,</v>

890
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:32.130
but he's so east coast,
he can't say it,

891
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:36.960
so he has to gay bash me for the first minute of the phone call.

892
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.060
Like I'll pick up the phone.
Hey Man,
what's going on?
Eh?
What's up?

893
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:43.740
[inaudible] I'm like,
yeah,
I'm out here in La.
Oh yeah,

894
00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:48.870
you sucking cock for a fucking pat.
He still does that.
I'm like,
AH,

895
00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:50.610
no.
I'm just,
uh,
just,

896
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:56.060
just driving down the street and for the whole first minute is just me rubbing

897
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:02.480
somebody balls are taking it in the ass to get somewhere and a,

898
00:54:02.481 --> 00:54:03.660
and I always just always say,

899
00:54:03.661 --> 00:54:07.230
it sounds like it's almost become like this running joke that he's just going to

900
00:54:07.231 --> 00:54:11.760
gay bash me and then be like,
yeah,
go.
Oh,
so you're saying you miss me?
I Dude,

901
00:54:11.761 --> 00:54:14.340
you know I love you.
You didn't watching the fucking Bruins,
dude.

902
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.190
It's fucking crazy,
right kid.
I think they're going to do it.

903
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:21.570
I got a buddy knows the Bruins were going to drink out of the fucking cup kid,

904
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:24.930
you know,
it just then just kind of goes into this thing.
But like,

905
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.850
so now it's this weird thing that when he does that,
yeah,

906
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:33.450
this is a kid you grew up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So when he does that now it's like,

907
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:34.831
as he's saying it,

908
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:38.520
I'm just laughing and I get this warm feeling like this is his way of saying I

909
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:40.470
love you and I miss you by saying,

910
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:43.140
are you sucking Dick out there to get to where the fuck you gotta be?

911
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.470
<v 1>I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's,</v>

912
00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:50.720
there's moments.
I remember at my mother's funeral,

913
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:55.910
this kid Teddy Ryan was there and Stevie text Sierra and Stevie techs here,

914
00:54:55.911 --> 00:54:59.090
this isn't my mother's funeral right now.
40 years earlier,

915
00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:03.710
Teddy Ryan had fumbled on the one yard line and Stevie Texiera said to him,

916
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:05.900
you didn't hold the ball the right way.

917
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:10.010
You know how you hold the ball and football.
I said,
I said,
I said,

918
00:55:10.011 --> 00:55:13.140
I thought that was so funny.
You know,
and my friend Richie say too,

919
00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.730
I grew up with,
every time he sees me he calls me cheap.

920
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:19.880
I'm the anybody know than the other.
But when we were like 12,

921
00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:22.370
he paid for something.
Hey,
can I go?
It's over.

922
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:24.530
Can I go to the bathroom and then we can continue?

923

<v 0>Yeah,

No compliments.

Feelings you fucking Cock sucker in fucking crack.

there's only two feelings.
Anger and rage.

I'm very proud of you.
You've done,

you know,
they,
they're proud of you.

939
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:21.830
And so when they say something,

940
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:24.070
it means more than you know,

<v 3>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

994
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:07.510
May 23rd,

995
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:11.510
2011 o g g a.
Um,

996
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:15.970
as you can tell I'm sick.
I got sick.
Huh?

997
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.290
You like that shit.

998
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:22.790
Do you feel better about your life in a little fucking area that you've carved

999
01:00:23.021 --> 01:00:25.380
out in it?
Ah,

1000
01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.620
does that make you look at Mr snuggle bear that you have hang up from your

1001
01:00:28.621 --> 01:00:31.000
fucking cubicle and make you feel better?
Well,

1002
01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:36.001
I hope it does feel like I didn't feel like shit.

1003
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:40.450
I just feel like my fucking throat,
it's just all raspy.

1004
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.510
I did eight shows at Caroline's comedy club.

1005
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.130
You probably wonder why bill,
why would one man do eight hours of comedy?
Well,

1006
01:00:48.131 --> 01:00:49.030
I'll tell you why.

1007
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:54.610
Because we fucking put him up for sale and everybody bought tickets and we

1008
01:00:54.611 --> 01:00:58.600
started adding more and those all sold out.
I felt like a big shot.
Oh,

1009
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.130
it was a fucking big shot,

1010
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:05.320
<v 2>but you know.
Ah,
fuck.</v>

1011
01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:06.830
Okay.

1012
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:10.060
<v 3>Is it going to be a rough one?
People?
I've been flying all over them.</v>

1013
01:01:10.061 --> 01:01:13.000
I've had six flights in the last 15 fucking days.

1014
01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:17.260
This last one was my final one.
I'm going on vacation,

1015
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.640
vacation,
vacation next week,

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:24.010
Glorious days.

1017
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:30.030
I'm going to go to Hampton beach and fuck in a New Hampshire.

1018
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:35.560
Got To get myself some fried dough.
I'm going to pick a tattoo off of the wall.

1019
01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:39.460
I'm going to slap my girl around and I'm going to do what you do on Hampton

1020
01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.470
beach.
Five fucking glorious days.

1021
01:01:41.471 --> 01:01:45.760
I'm sticking my toes in the water and that's what I'm doing.

1022
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:49.150
That's what I'm doing.
You know what I'm going to do?

1023
01:01:49.151 --> 01:01:52.540
I'm just gonna keep repeating shit on this podcast so I could somehow make it be

1024
01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:56.590
a fucking hour long.
I'll just sing everything I just said,
you know,

1025
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.080
so I can make it an hour long.

1026
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1027
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.000
<v 3>I'm Jessica to sing everything I just said,</v>

1028
01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:09.460
ah,
fuck.
Ah,
Jesus.
This is,

1029
01:02:09.461 --> 01:02:14.200
these are the days I wish I had an assistant.
Hey,
you know,
what do you,

1030
01:02:14.201 --> 01:02:18.940
what do you,
what's been going on in your week,
Mike?
Oh,

1031
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.950
fuck it too.
I,
um,
um,

1032
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.030
the married guy on this show and then he throws it back to me.

1033
01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.600
Artaud I don't know how you'd do it.
I'll look at them.
They're opposites.

1034
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.880
Just like Mike and Mike,
one guy's in the bleachers,
the other guy are,

1035
01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:34.950
he's fucking right near the action.

1036
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.860
And then the bleacher guys always more real,
you know.
Oh,
look at me.

1037
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:42.630
I'm so fucking real.
Rarely.

1038
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:46.860
Like you're not fucking taking your dick out and jerking it,
deploying your fat.

1039
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:51.300
Fuck,
I'm not buying it for a second.
You're not more real.

1040
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:55.620
You just have poor dietary choices.
All right,

1041
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.620
your tub of shit.
Um,

1042
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:01.650
that had nothing to do with those two guys had to do with the fact that I need

1043
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:05.100
to get my fucking energy going.
If I'm going,
if I'm going to do a podcast,

1044
01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:08.280
I'm going to,
I've got one more show people.
I had eight Caroline's,

1045
01:03:08.281 --> 01:03:10.770
I got one right now.
Let me plow through this crap.

1046
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.330
What are we going to talk about this week?

1047
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:16.590
What in God's name we're going to talk about this week.
I have no fucking idea.

1048
01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:18.990
How about Lance Armstrong?
Why don't we talk about that?

1049
01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:21.183
<v 5>You know</v>

1050
01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:26.110
what the fuck did lance do?

1051
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:31.230
<v 3>The guy passed 500 drug tests like 10 fucking years ago.</v>

1052
01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.570
It's over.
How are you going to catch him now?

1053
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.060
You know you're going to catch them.
Douche bag of the week is fucking team made.

1054
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:42.690
It goes on 60 minutes in his fucking ratting them out.

1055
01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.510
Do you know much pussy that guy's gotten in his lifetime?

1056
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:51.400
Cause he knows Lance Armstrong and now all of a sudden the pussy trades over

1057
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.860
policy train is fucking over.
So now what he's doing,
he's,

1058
01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:58.000
he's playing the last car he has to play.

1059
01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.590
Just like the fucking chick on the side.
Who knows you're married,

1060
01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.510
thinks you're going to leave your wife.

1061
01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:08.290
And then that one fateful day when she realizes not only you're not going to

1062
01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:09.124
leave,

1063
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:13.740
you're not going to give her any money to go pay for a fucking shoes.

1064
01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.390
So she plays her last God damn car.

1065
01:04:16.391 --> 01:04:19.370
She goes on TV and she chose our,

1066
01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.590
I've been sucking his dick for the last 10 fucking years.

1067
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:26.400
Becomes a best selling author,
you know,

1068
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.990
gets her name etched in right next to fucking Ernest Hemingway

1069
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.413
<v 5>like she's</v>

1070
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.900
<v 3>anywhere near that guy's level.
Probably sells even more books.</v>

1071
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.240
All the dump constant.
This fucking society.
Can I use that word?

1072
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:43.500
I didn't want to shit on this country.

1073
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:45.983
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1074
01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:48.970
<v 3>Yeah.
What the fuck is what?
This ass off.
I didn't even,</v>

1075
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.080
I only saw the beginning of the interview.
They're saying that you know,

1076
01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:53.580
because he was forced

1077
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.730
<v 5>under oath.</v>

1078
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:59.460
<v 3>Under oath.
He's been forced to some shit.</v>

1079
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.600
I don't know what it is that he has to tell the truth.
No yet doubt.

1080
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:05.660
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1081
01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:08.510
<v 3>they weren't there.
I didn't see,
I never saw him do it.</v>

1082
01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:10.533
<v 5>Sergeant.</v>

1083
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.080
<v 3>That's it.
What do you want me to do?
I'm not making up anything.</v>

1084
01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:18.820
What a fucking asshole that guy is.
That guy's a fucking all right.

1085
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.920
This has nothing to do with Lance Armstrong.

1086
01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:24.340
This has to do with France not liking our foreign policy.

1087
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.490
That's what it has to do with it has to do with them in general,

1088
01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:30.160
not liking Americans and has to do with them in general.

1089
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:34.730
Being rude comments to anybody goes over to the Paris to buy a fucking croissant

1090
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.480
.
They gotta be assholes,

1091
01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.313
<v 2>you know,</v>

1092
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.890
<v 3>been going after this guy forever cause he's over there winning the Tour de</v>

1093
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:48.550
France.
They can't fucking handle it.
That are drugged up.

1094
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:52.300
Guy Is beating your drugged up guy.
What are you going to do?

1095
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:54.910
You gonna take his fucking titles away and who are you going to give them too?

1096
01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:57.111
You know,

1097
01:05:57.111 --> 01:06:01.520
you can't ride a bike 30 miles an hour up a fucking mountain without being on

1098
01:06:01.521 --> 01:06:04.760
something for a month straight.

1099
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:10.570
I could see if he had to get medicine for somebody that you loved and they were

1100
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:11.261
going to die,

1101
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:14.590
I think you could have a burst of adrenaline and you could fucking do that.

1102
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:19.570
All right?
But you can't do it for a month.
Look,

1103
01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:24.370
all these fucking guys are,
take it something in every God damn sport.
All right?

1104
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.940
All you need to do is just go stretch,

1105
01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:31.960
workout a little bit and go and go play some touch football.
All right?

1106
01:06:31.961 --> 01:06:36.160
In your 20s and 30s and let me know how you feel the next fucking day you're

1107
01:06:36.161 --> 01:06:39.340
going to feel absolutely fucking horrific.
All right,

1108
01:06:39.341 --> 01:06:42.880
these guys play it at a professional level.
How?

1109
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.710
How do you play NFL football?

1110
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:51.100
How do you play that for fucking 15 goddamn tape?
You're playing tackle football.

1111
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:55.330
Really?
How about you youngsters out there?

1112
01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:57.481
Have you done that?

1113
01:06:57.481 --> 01:07:01.380
If you'd done that dumb move yet in your early twenties you still think you're

1114
01:07:01.381 --> 01:07:04.170
in your teens or whatever and you're thinking and to go out and go play tackle

1115
01:07:04.171 --> 01:07:08.640
football.
You can't fucking do it.
These guys play it at a professional level.

1116
01:07:08.641 --> 01:07:10.590
They get hit by guys like Ray Lewis.

1117
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.540
Then they got to get up off the ground and continue to play and then they got a

1118
01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:19.800
fucking practice on Tuesday and do it again.
15 more fucking times.

1119
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:24.230
What are you gonna take?
A Fred Flintstone vitamin and an aspirin.

1120
01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.700
They're all on drugs.

1121
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:30.080
There's sacrifice in their bodies to entertain us.

1122
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:35.070
It's fucking ridiculous.
I can't believe his fucking tee.

1123
01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:38.190
I would never do that shit.
I would never fucking do that to somebody.

1124
01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.770
You're under oath.
Am I okay?
What do you want to know?

1125
01:07:43.771 --> 01:07:46.950
He's the greatest guy ever.
Thanks to him.

1126
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.910
I got to be on a championship fucking team.
He put shit in his body.

1127
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:56.880
He didn't even know what the fuck it was.
Also,
we could win.
Oh,

1128
01:07:56.881 --> 01:08:00.720
the French pussy.
We got
MERCI.

1129
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:05.250
Boku Lance Armstrong
going on 60 minutes.

1130
01:08:05.251 --> 01:08:07.210
I always saw the first two minutes of a typical meal.

1131
01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:08.160
I haven't watched the whole thing,

1132
01:08:08.370 --> 01:08:12.690
but was he like acting like it was a struggle to rat him out?

1133
01:08:12.691 --> 01:08:16.810
I really don't want to do this,
but I have to,
you know,

1134
01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.120
probably happen.
They probably confiscated as hard drive.
Right.

1135
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.190
And they found some sort of freaky shit.

1136
01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.870
They got something or they sent some hor around the way,
you know?

1137
01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.010
And he's in the fucking fruit section in the guide Dan Grocery store,

1138
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:35.450
and she comes over and starts rubbing his balls right.

1139
01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:40.700
Bags them in some fucking hotel room in our apartment.
They got all the video.

1140
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.610
They got him.
All right.
What's it going to be?

1141
01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:47.510
Your family and your marriage or are you gonna Throw Lance under the bus?

1142
01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:49.623
<v 5>Come on.</v>

1143
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:53.310
<v 3>I know.
It's hard.
It's okay if you cry,
do the right thing,</v>

1144
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:56.540
but booking you on 60 minutes next week.
Go out there and go,
fucking ran out.

1145
01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:59.540
Your friend ran out,
your friend,

1146
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.530
your friend guy gets you all their policy.

1147
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:08.240
You know people who in seven years of one in the Tour de France.

1148
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:12.830
Okay.
Taught a fraud.
Right?
The tall they flow.

1149
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:17.690
Okay.
The people in his little fucking pack,

1150
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:23.890
they probably got more pussy than Goddamn American soldiers who liberated that

1151
01:09:24.341 --> 01:09:28.160
country and get Hitler the fuck out of there.
Okay.
Do you understand that?

1152
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:35.540
Because the American soldiers,
they were probably there.
You know the bike race,

1153
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.020
there was seven years of dominance,
seven years of pussy,

1154
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:40.663
<v 5>right?</v>

1155
01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.150
<v 3>The American soldiers on the other hand,
they kicked those motherfuckers out.</v>

1156
01:09:46.151 --> 01:09:48.460
That was it.
They didn't do it seven years in a row.

1157
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:53.200
God knows you're probably there seven days before some big fucking meet handed.

1158
01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.490
Douchebags said something stupid in one of those French broads,

1159
01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.370
grabbed her tits or whatever.
And then the whole fucking thing was over.

1160
01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.330
He ruined,
he ruined it.
He ruined it for everyone else.

1161
01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:10.240
Douche bag of the week.
That fucking that fucking cunt

1162
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.740
on Lance Armstrong's,
he went on 60 minutes and ratted him out.

1163
01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:20.140
You know psycho was all these years watching the goddamn frogs over there trying

1164
01:10:20.141 --> 01:10:23.680
to prove that this guy was a bad guy and they just couldn't fucking do it and

1165
01:10:23.681 --> 01:10:28.570
then he retires.
Then I'm like,
it's over.
The door is closed.
It's fucking over

1166
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.100
those.
I,
you know what I will give it.
I will give the French people this.

1167
01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:36.430
You are some persistent sons of bitches,
you know?

1168
01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:40.960
Is it all the time you save every morning not putting deodorant on that you

1169
01:10:40.961 --> 01:10:42.550
actually focused on this case,

1170
01:10:42.551 --> 01:10:46.720
that you will finally able to get this guy to fucking roll over on his friend?

1171
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:51.870
Is there anything more fucking tragic than watching a friend tell on another

1172
01:10:52.931 --> 01:10:57.760
friend?
Just fucking kid wasn't raised right.

1173
01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.733
<v 5>All right.</v>

1174
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:02.960
<v 3>I swear to God,
if that was my son,</v>

1175
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:08.430
<v 5>I don't know what I would do.
I don't know what I would do.</v>

1176
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.410
<v 3>I would just,
I would just,
why are you doing this to him?
He did it.</v>

1177
01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.560
I don't give a fuck if he did it.
That's not what this is about.

1178
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:21.620
You think those other preps weren't doing it?

1179
01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:26.900
Do the Germans run at Bryant ride a bike in that race?
They too,
don't they?
Yeah.

1180
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.550
What is their fucking track record?

1181
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.670
Half the fucking women in East Germany could bench press the entire fucking USA

1182
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:40.380
cycling team.
You mother fucker.

1183
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:44.160
Do you know what happened to me and your mother when we went to Paris that time

1184
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.270
we were all excited.
We wanted to see the Mona Lisa.

1185
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:53.250
They treated us like dirt.
Get Out of my sight.

1186
01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.410
You've shaved me.
You've shaved our name.

1187
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.780
Oh,
don't give me that.
You went on TV like a badge.

1188
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.710
Running your fucking mouth.
Get Out.
Fuck.

1189
01:12:07.711 --> 01:12:09.390
I knew there was something wrong with you.

1190
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.330
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1191
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:13.730
<v 3>I was sick of riding a bicycle when I was eight.</v>

1192
01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.170
First Time I fucking saw pick up that chick's dress.
That was it.

1193
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.650
It's all booze and policy.
While it was funny,

1194
01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:25.460
it was until I met you stay out of this.
It's just mad stuff.

1195
01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.670
You fucking wet to get off.
You went on TV.

1196
01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:30.190
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1197
01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:33.580
<v 3>and you've read it out your friend.
What the fuck did I to allow those times?</v>

1198
01:12:33.581 --> 01:12:34.840
I sat you down

1199
01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.290
and I told you no matter what happens,
you never tell on your friend.

1200
01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.433
<v 2>All right,</v>

1201
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.210
<v 3>handle that is shit yourself.</v>

1202
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:48.710
All right,

1203
01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:52.500
now go grab your fucking bike with your goddamn bitch as training wheels and get

1204
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.700
the fuck out of my sight.

1205
01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:55.570
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1206
01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:58.720
<v 3>Don't call me till the super bowl.
That's how I'd handle that one.</v>

1207
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:04.040
I Dunno why I give a shit.
Why do I give a fuck about a God damn bike race?

1208
01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.173
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1209
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.770
<v 3>I root for fucking people who do dumb shit.
What the fuck is with my computer?</v>

1210
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.000
Here we go.
All right,
so anyways.
Oh by the way,

1211
01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:17.790
people are probably wondering how the hell I got so God damn sick.

1212
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.093
<v 2>You know</v>

1213
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.290
<v 3>who gets a fucking head cold in the middle of May?</v>

1214
01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:27.100
I'll tell you who somebody out there busting their ass.
All right.

1215
01:13:27.101 --> 01:13:30.010
That's when you know you're working hard when you still get colds in the summer

1216
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:34.630
and this summer or is it the spring?
I think it's still the spring.
Right?

1217
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.050
With global warming.
Does it bump it up a little bit?

1218
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:40.933
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1219
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:43.820
<v 3>No,
I fucking,
I've been flying all around.</v>

1220
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.920
I taped that episode of Glee out there and fucking New Mexico and I knew I was

1221
01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:50.210
going to get sick.
These fucking guy.

1222
01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.570
You are the amount of Shit I'm going to get when you see the fucking outfit.

1223
01:13:53.571 --> 01:13:57.920
They had me,
I swear to God they had me in this half shirt thing.
All right.

1224
01:13:57.921 --> 01:14:02.540
It's a comedy.
It's a fun,
just bracing you for it.
But it was windy.

1225
01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:06.440
We were outside doing this whole fucking routine and I s I was getting the

1226
01:14:06.441 --> 01:14:11.441
chills and I knew I was going to get sick and then I jumped on another and flew

1227
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:15.100
to New York to do the fucking,
uh,
Keralites.
Right.

1228
01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1229
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:20.650
<v 3>So I'm on west coast time.
I land,
I got to get up at six in the morning,</v>

1230
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:23.350
which is three o'clock my fucking body clock time.

1231
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.290
I run my mouth on the radio,
I go back,
quick nap or whatever,

1232
01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:31.540
whatever the fuck I gotta do.
And then I do the shows.

1233
01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.760
Then you wake up the next day you do it again.

1234
01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.140
They do two more shows already go to bed

1235
01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:42.410
and then you wake up and you're fucking sick.

1236
01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:47.440
Happens every goddamn time I was taking my vitamins or vitamins.

1237
01:14:47.751 --> 01:14:52.260
Is that,
was that what they say in England?
Oregano or a gun?
No.

1238
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.230
Um,
all right.
What are we going to talk about this week?

1239
01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.590
Let's,
let's get into some advice people.

1240
01:15:00.591 --> 01:15:02.660
This is definitely going to be a short one.
All right.

1241
01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.750
Thank God for that fucking Douche or the week.

1242
01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:09.650
And I think I would've wrapped it up by now.
Oh,

1243
01:15:09.651 --> 01:15:13.700
let's talk fucking hockey man.
Two to Bruins lightening.

1244
01:15:13.701 --> 01:15:17.870
I hope you guys are watching the series.
It's been fucking awesome.
Um,

1245
01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:22.070
big shout out to all my friends on Twitter who are from Tampa.

1246
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:25.100
You guys seem to enjoy it.
A lot of the things that I was sending out last week.

1247
01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:34.160
Fuck um,
yeah.
TAPPC has an awesome team.

1248
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.040
So the only card I have I can play is just to shit on Tampa.

1249
01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:42.110
And for some reason these Goddamn idiots on Twitter or taking the bait,

1250
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:46.640
you know till hates Tampa.
He really fucking hates it.

1251
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:51.320
I don't give a fuck about tamp.
I just want to annoy you.
You know,

1252
01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.400
cause you annoy me.

1253
01:15:52.401 --> 01:15:57.350
The fact that you are such a non hockey fucking city and you have such a great

1254
01:15:57.351 --> 01:15:58.184
team.

1255
01:15:59.190 --> 01:15:59.310
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1256
01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:02.400
<v 3>Honestly,
how many you had to look up Steve?
I Zimmerman when he came to town,</v>

1257
01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.450
you know?
Oh you read next down there.

1258
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:10.320
What's the Hell's that Goddamn Jew?
Calm it down here.

1259
01:16:10.321 --> 01:16:13.950
What the fuck's he knew about hockey shit.
You might as well.

1260
01:16:13.951 --> 01:16:18.420
Fuck now he's,
he's a former NHL player.

1261
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:23.670
Hall of Famer.
Oh,
all right.
I thought he was a,
I'm sorry.

1262
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:31.020
Now what is that Stanley Cup is,
was that originally as spit tune?

1263
01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.720
Is that what it was?
I know what a lot of you guys are probably thinking.

1264
01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.820
You're probably thinking why is he doing a redneck southern accent?

1265
01:16:38.821 --> 01:16:42.420
This is Florida.
Yeah,
that's what most of Florida is.

1266
01:16:42.421 --> 01:16:46.860
There's Miami and then there's the rest of it and the rest of it is a fucking

1267
01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:52.200
hellhole other than nature ever go everglades have beautiful beaches,

1268
01:16:52.201 --> 01:16:56.400
are gorgeous,
you know,
trees,
the animals,
the birds,
all that shit down there.

1269
01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.180
Absolutely gorgeous.
But I'll tell you if you're not in Miami,
man,

1270
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:01.873
all right.

1271
01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:07.020
I never been out of the Florida keys for my hurt when I heard it's all gay guys

1272
01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:08.700
and people running from the law.

1273
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:13.820
You know people live in on houseboats and shit,
right?

1274
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.610
Isn't that where they found that guy who shut that Versace dude,

1275
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:21.440
wasn't he down there?
He key combined both people.

1276
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:26.500
He was gay andF and a felon.
I'm fucking a,

1277
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:31.120
yeah,
terabytes.
It's just a,
you know,

1278
01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:33.740
I dunno.
I Dunno what I'm talking about.
But anyways,

1279
01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:38.690
this series has been fucking tremendous.
Making me age or whatever.

1280
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.780
And then every time I think Tampa is way better than we are.

1281
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.860
All of a sudden we look unstoppable and then Magali Shit,

1282
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.450
we're up through three.

1283
01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:50.810
We're going to be up three games to one and we could just score three fucking

1284
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:55.550
goals.
That's the magic number for the Bruins.
Anytime they go up three games,

1285
01:17:55.551 --> 01:17:59.930
three goals or whatever,
I don't know what they do.
They just fucking rest.

1286
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:04.400
Sit back on that.
What's chill for awhile?
This is boring.

1287
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.320
Let's make it exciting.
They fucking blew the Goddamn leak.

1288
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:11.630
I can tell you this right now.
I feel good though.

1289
01:18:11.631 --> 01:18:15.890
They're going to come back to Boston.
All right,
today.
All right.

1290
01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:18.200
We're going to kick them right in the content as I want to do.

1291
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.260
Just like we didn't gain three that actually missed because I was working.

1292
01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:24.530
That's my prediction.
We're going to,

1293
01:18:24.531 --> 01:18:28.730
we're going to win another one of those two to one games,
one of those games.

1294
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.480
All right?

1295
01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.950
That's what's happening and then we'll go down to Tampa and then they're going

1296
01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.370
to win it,
right?
They're going gonna win that game.

1297
01:18:34.371 --> 01:18:37.220
After we go up a couple of goals.
Oh Shit.

1298
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:40.970
Are we going to close them out down in that strip mall that they play in now

1299
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:44.510
they're going to come back.
Then for game seven,
it's going to be anybody's

1300
01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.213
<v 2>okay.</v>

1301
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:48.890
<v 3>I'm going to guess first goal wins that one,</v>

1302
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.070
unless it's the broads.

1303
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.120
I have no faith in our ability to hold the fucking league lead.
I just don't.

1304
01:18:56.810 --> 01:19:01.340
And since last week,
my prediction was San Jose in Tampa,

1305
01:19:01.341 --> 01:19:04.430
in the finals,
and I thought Tampa was going to win the whole fucking thing.

1306
01:19:04.431 --> 01:19:07.280
All of a sudden Vancouver woke up in that play into their potential.

1307
01:19:07.281 --> 01:19:10.010
So now I'm an owl.
Call Vancouver.
Look at me.

1308
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:13.250
I'm just like one of those guys on ESPN.
Every other time you see me,

1309
01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.670
I'll pick at somebody else so that I could be like,
dude,
what?

1310
01:19:16.671 --> 01:19:20.430
I say what I what dude?
I fucking called it.

1311
01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:26.210
I totally fuck had called it.
Um,
all right,

1312
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.880
so let's plow ahead.
Let's get to the advice.

1313
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:33.800
I hope my voice isn't as annoying as it sounds to me.
Uh,

1314
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.370
advice.
Ah,
man,
this is a fucking brutal one.

1315
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1316
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:42.880
<v 3>Oh,
by the way,
for all you,
Jesus freaks out there.
He fucking blew you off again.</v>

1317
01:19:42.881 --> 01:19:47.320
How does that feel?
Huh?
Once again,

1318
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:52.160
once again,
they sent out the fliers.

1319
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:55.610
Everybody was ready,
you know,

1320
01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:01.870
and what happened?
He just,
he just be fucking blow it off again.

1321
01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:06.580
How many times this is like fucking watching Charlie Brown try and kick the

1322
01:20:06.581 --> 01:20:07.050
football.

1323
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:11.010
How many times can fucking Lucy pull it out and he lands on his Goddamn back?

1324
01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:15.090
How many times are you guys going to sit there and think this dude is coming

1325
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:19.350
back?
You know what's wrong with you?

1326
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:21.440
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1327
01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.910
<v 3>Um,
he's not coming back.
I gotta admit I get a little scared every time.</v>

1328
01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.970
Like what is he going to be?
I just don't,

1329
01:20:28.971 --> 01:20:31.520
I just don't fucking believe in any of that.

1330
01:20:31.521 --> 01:20:35.900
I don't believe that there's this guy who's fucking mad at me for what?

1331
01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.540
For what?
I've been going to therapy,
that type of shit.

1332
01:20:40.541 --> 01:20:42.400
I'm starting to realize to stuff that I did.

1333
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:46.150
A lot of it was because some shit that's some fucking cunt did to me when I was

1334
01:20:46.151 --> 01:20:50.200
a kid.
So that fucked my brain up.
That's my fault.

1335
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.860
Today you're going to get mad cause I went to a fucking titty bar and a bunch of

1336
01:20:53.861 --> 01:20:58.450
whores are in there that you made
you made them.

1337
01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:00.670
That's,

1338
01:21:00.670 --> 01:21:04.000
that's where the whole thing breaks down from me or I gotta be this fucking

1339
01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:06.160
unbelievable,
great person.
Like

1340
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:12.470
if you wanted us to be fucking great people,
why didn't you make as great people?

1341
01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.360
I think he's fucking bored.
He wanted to see,

1342
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:22.780
he wants like choice.
All right.
I'll give him the choice to do the right thing,

1343
01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:23.311
the wrong thing,

1344
01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:26.900
and then I'm going to sit there and watch it because if I don't buy,

1345
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:28.410
just make everybody great.

1346
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:32.250
Everybody's going to be standing around like those little fucking Weirdo things

1347
01:21:32.251 --> 01:21:36.340
at the end of the Grinch.
Paulden hands around a Christmas tree home.

1348
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.200
<v 6>Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,</v>

1349
01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.610
<v 3>CRISPR.
Whatever the fuck they say.
Who the hell would want to live like that?</v>

1350
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:50.250
<v 5>Know?
I like the Grinch.</v>

1351
01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.670
<v 3>I want to go.
I wouldn't be in business with the guy.</v>

1352
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:55.920
Good trust the fucker like that.

1353
01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:02.030
But you don't want to hang out with them in a bar.
Yeah,

1354
01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.370
it'd be like credentialing.
Gonna check over there.

1355
01:22:03.371 --> 01:22:05.440
What do you think about her and just listened to him go off on her.

1356
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:09.760
Just sit there and laugh,
you know,
is he just disappears into hate.

1357
01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.100
Then you look over one of your friends,
you know,
you shoot them that look,

1358
01:22:12.101 --> 01:22:16.570
we put your eyebrows up like let's get good.
She's getting good.

1359
01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:21.550
So once again,
he didn't show up.
He didn't fucking show up.
And then what?

1360
01:22:21.551 --> 01:22:25.330
All the Bible thumpers got to run around and started just in their speeches.

1361
01:22:25.331 --> 01:22:28.720
We'll see what I was saying.
What are fuck.

1362
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:34.343
<v 5>Okay.
Just Christ.</v>

1363
01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:35.920
<v 3>You know,</v>

1364
01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.800
most of the Times having a beard is fucking awesome because you don't have to

1365
01:22:38.801 --> 01:22:42.400
fucking shave every day.
That's the great thing about having a beard.

1366
01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.120
Bad time is when you got to blow your fucking nose

1367
01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:51.670
just ends in your mustache.
It's fucking disgusting.
All right.

1368
01:22:51.671 --> 01:22:53.400
What am I talking about?
Yeah.
What?
Oh wait,

1369
01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.440
it's anybody go to one of those churches where the guy,
yeah,
if you do,

1370
01:22:56.441 --> 01:23:00.160
you're not listening to this,
you know,
allowed to write cause I'm the devil.

1371
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:06.970
It's your fucking grow up.
Anyways,
let's ahead here.
He didn't show up.

1372
01:23:06.971 --> 01:23:08.140
You know,
he wasn't going to show.

1373
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:10.783
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1374
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:14.280
<v 3>You know,
it's weird.
Do you want to get saved?
The only reason,</v>

1375
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:16.930
the only way I want to get saved is if I actually get to,

1376
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:18.880
once I get saved and brought up on a cloud,

1377
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.890
is if I get to look down and watch Jesus just fucking,
you know?

1378
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:25.480
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.360
<v 3>It just take it people out.
I want,
he's going to kill all of us.</v>

1380
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:32.580
Is that how they're going to do it?
I don't know these stories.

1381
01:23:32.581 --> 01:23:36.210
I don't read that book.
Isn't that what he's going?
He's going to come back.

1382
01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:39.700
Was coming back like a thief in the night.

1383
01:23:42.710 --> 01:23:44.790
D for the night.
Let me see if I can piece this together.

1384
01:23:44.791 --> 01:23:47.760
Some of the expressions I've heard people say it's coming back like a thief in

1385
01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:48.540
the night.
Okay.

1386
01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:51.030
And that's when he's going to sneak and take your loved ones and leave you

1387
01:23:51.031 --> 01:23:51.864
behind.

1388
01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.513
<v 2>Right.</v>

1389
01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:59.010
<v 3>Jesus Christ.
It's so fucking childish.
They're preying on your year,</v>

1390
01:23:59.011 --> 01:24:03.990
your goddamn fear as a kid of being left alone at the mall,
mob dad,

1391
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:07.650
cheeses,
I don't buy it.

1392
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:12.210
I don't buy anything where they sell it to me.
Out of fear.

1393
01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:13.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1394
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.950
<v 3>Unless you were talking condoms.
All right.
Here we go.
Advice for this week.</v>

1395
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:21.060
Derek Bell
Dare Billy Boy Lee.

1396
01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:24.750
I'm 34 years old and I've been married.
Uh,

1397
01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.400
we'll call her Melinda,

1398
01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:30.270
my wife for about five years.

1399
01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.300
We met on an online,

1400
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.840
online dating website and immediately felt a special bond.

1401
01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:38.490
We dated for three years,

1402
01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.240
but I knew she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with after the

1403
01:24:42.241 --> 01:24:45.990
first week.
Anyway,
we have two kids,

1404
01:24:45.991 --> 01:24:50.520
twins who are both girls will cook granulations.
It's a great story so far.

1405
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.950
Where could this go wrong,
wrong.
My sister was watching them for us.
One night.

1406
01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.670
My wife decided to take me to my favorite steak house.

1407
01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:05.790
She seemed like she really wanted me to have a great time and thought I was

1408
01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:08.700
going to get,
I don't want,
I thought I was going to get lucky afterwards.

1409
01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:13.760
Little did I know that she was going to tell me her biggest secret near the end

1410
01:25:15.061 --> 01:25:17.130
of our meal.
She looked at me and said,
Jim,

1411
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:23.270
I've got to tell you something that's not a joke and something that may,

1412
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:24.620
that may anger you.

1413
01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:29.660
I thought she was going to tell me that she had a tell me something about the

1414
01:25:29.661 --> 01:25:31.190
bills is some shit about,

1415
01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:32.780
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1416
01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:36.170
<v 3>Ah,
Jesus.
I lost my space that she was going to tell me.</v>

1417
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.140
What did you think,
Bill?
What did you think?

1418
01:25:40.141 --> 01:25:42.540
I thought she was going to tell me something about the bills.

1419
01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:46.050
There's something about the sh or some shit about the kids.
Nope,

1420
01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:51.120
she looks at me and right after she said that she goes,

1421
01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.440
I'm gay with Mandy,
our neck,
our neighbor.

1422
01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:57.620
Oh my God.

1423
01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:59.813
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1424
01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:00.733
<v 3>Oh,</v>

1425
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:06.970
and what happened that your fancy heavy fork slammed down onto the plate when

1426
01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:12.560
you dropped it.
Then everybody turned around and looked at you.
Bill,

1427
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:15.800
I have no idea what to do because of the kids and because of what everyone will

1428
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:18.650
say if I tell them I had a gay wife,

1429
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.910
I'm thinking about packing up and going to Iceland or some shit,
but no,

1430
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:25.960
that won't work.
Uh,

1431
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:28.820
Melinda told me she wanted to stay married,

1432
01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:33.020
but on certain nights we could just bang around with other people.

1433
01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.390
She is afraid of what others will think.
I would never even consider that.

1434
01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:43.100
And I'm really confused on what to do.
Help me.
All right,
dude,

1435
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:45.320
I want to try to help you out here,
okay?
Uh,

1436
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:49.040
what she's doing is she's gradually ending the marriage.

1437
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:51.223
Okay?

1438
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.680
She's not ready to just fucking come out and say she's gay and go live a gay

1439
01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:57.711
lifestyle.

1440
01:26:57.711 --> 01:27:02.711
So she's telling you first and now she wants you to keep it a secret and allow

1441
01:27:04.191 --> 01:27:08.810
her to go outside the relationship to go fuck around with the girl next door.

1442
01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.660
Now you didn't even mention is she married to somebody else,

1443
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:14.580
<v 5>you know,
I don't know.</v>

1444
01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:20.200
<v 3>So you gotta look out for yourself here.
This isn't what you want.</v>

1445
01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:22.630
I'm going to guess,
right?

1446
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.280
You don't want to have a wife who's a gay twice a month,

1447
01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.450
she's gay.
Let her go fucking bigay,

1448
01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.693
<v 5>you know,</v>

1449
01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.610
<v 3>but you,
you don't have to be involved in that.
You,
you don't want,
you know,</v>

1450
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:41.110
that's not what the fuck you looking for here.
That's why,
you know,

1451
01:27:41.111 --> 01:27:45.220
so you gotta tell her she's going to walk over.

1452
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.620
I think you got,
and I know this kids and all that type of stuff,

1453
01:27:49.621 --> 01:27:53.250
but what the fuck are you supposed to do?
They might not get it right now.

1454
01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.580
They're going to get it at some point when they get old enough,

1455
01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:00.880
they going to understand the adult choice that you had to make because I

1456
01:28:00.881 --> 01:28:03.040
understand it's their mom.
So it's going to be painful.

1457
01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:07.420
What you guys could do is be like,
all right,
why don't we,
uh,

1458
01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:11.770
just live in the same town or the same area so you can still be involved with

1459
01:28:11.771 --> 01:28:13.330
the kids.
There's no big deal.
You know,

1460
01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:18.450
try to make it as easy as possible and then respect her wishes to keep it quiet.

1461
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:25.750
You know?
Let her tell people that's,
I really believe that,
like,
you know,

1462
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.310
is upset as you are.
Don't go around fucking telling that because that's a,

1463
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:36.650
I dunno,
people are assholes when it comes to that shit.
So,

1464
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:39.310
but you gotta look out for yourself here.
Do too.
You've got to,

1465
01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:42.520
you've got to get out of that.
You got to get out of that.

1466
01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:46.960
Because what's going to happen is she's gradually going to become more and more

1467
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:51.610
gay and less and less the chick you fucking married and then one day you're

1468
01:28:51.611 --> 01:28:52.990
going to be sitting there.
It's,

1469
01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:56.320
she's going to be dressed like fucking Archie bunker,
you know?
Ah,

1470
01:28:56.321 --> 01:28:59.980
that'd be all right to bring fucking Mrs.
Who's the water over here?

1471
01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:04.890
You know they're going to be sitting there watching some show on choppers,
right?

1472
01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.300
And then what the fuck are you going to do?

1473
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:10.290
What if you happen to come home with one of your buddies and it just be like,

1474
01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:12.930
he's going to be like,
why does your fucking wife,

1475
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.530
when did she start dressing like squigy Laverne and Shirley,

1476
01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.540
I have,
sorry,
I've just fucking around.
I had to make a funny,

1477
01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:23.820
this is a depressing thing here.
All right,

1478
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:27.270
so good thing you're only 34 years old.

1479
01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:32.580
Let's get some positive here.
All right.
Now the good thing,

1480
01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:36.780
she didn't wait till you 50 fucking four and you realize your whole marriage was

1481
01:29:36.781 --> 01:29:41.100
a lie.
You only lost a few years of your life here.
You still got two great kids.

1482
01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:46.560
All right?
You got a story to tell.
All right,

1483
01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.500
that could actually get you some pussy.
As you getting back on your feet,

1484
01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:54.480
they'll feel bad for you.
You know,
maybe they'll even try and prove how much,

1485
01:29:54.481 --> 01:29:57.660
how heterosexual they aren't giving an extra good fucking blow job.

1486
01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.250
And uh,
then something else good in there.
Oh,
and then another good thing is,

1487
01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:06.090
is the girl,
she's fucking around with hot and it does,

1488
01:30:06.091 --> 01:30:07.680
she occasionally like some Dick.

1489
01:30:07.681 --> 01:30:12.450
Maybe you could get a fucking three some for the road
threesome for the road.

1490
01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:18.020
Sounds like a fucking an old country song trailer for sale or rent.

1491
01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:25.340
My fucking wife is gay are thank
Ah,

1492
01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:30.450
go on a fucker friend as a make her lick my bowls.

1493
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:36.090
Come on in kids.
I've,
we got something to tell you.
Your mom is gay

1494
01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:42.060
and uh,
she's licking my balls.
I whatever.
I can't fucking sick

1495
01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.440
dude.
That sucks.
You got to get out of it.
All right?
You've got to get out of it.

1496
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:48.840
She's gradually breaking up with you.
It's completely,

1497
01:30:48.841 --> 01:30:53.841
she doesn't have the courage yet to tell people that she's gay.

1498
01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.360
All right,
and you've got to work on it.
You've got to respect her time table,

1499
01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.320
but you can't,
you can't let her use you.
All right?
She's already been using,

1500
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:04.770
she'd been fucking around behind your back.
All right,
you're walking,

1501
01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.880
just come up with some sort of story,
you know,

1502
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:12.810
and then you guys both stick with it then don't be like fucking that con Tus

1503
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:16.740
rent ratting out Lance Armstrong right now.
Just keep your mouth shut.

1504
01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.380
And when she wants to come out and say it,
look,

1505
01:31:19.570 --> 01:31:22.200
and if people are judging you like,
Oh wow,
I can't believe you know,

1506
01:31:22.201 --> 01:31:25.200
you guys are breaking up.
What about the kids?
And Blah,
blah,
blah.

1507
01:31:25.201 --> 01:31:28.140
Let them judge you or whatever though.
All your big apology,

1508
01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.660
a big fucking apology when they,

1509
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:33.990
when she finally comes out and says what the secret is.

1510
01:31:33.991 --> 01:31:38.940
So whatever that be everyone then there,
then you'll look like the martyr,
right?

1511
01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:43.860
I Dunno dude,
my heart goes out to you.
Ah,
that sucks.

1512
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:46.470
That really fucking sucks.
But uh,
you got to get out of that.

1513
01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.200
You got to get out of that.
All right,
good luck to you,
sir.
All right.
Next one.

1514
01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:55.080
Bill.
Dearest.
We'll,
you're,

1515
01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:59.770
my son is a good kid,
respectful and thoughtful,

1516
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:01.720
and never had trouble at school.

1517
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:05.080
You sound like a parrot of somebody's kid who just did something really bad.

1518
01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.730
My kids are good.
He's respectful at Datto.
Naira gets in trouble.

1519
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:14.890
I don't know where he got that.
Rosie,
um,

1520
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:17.410
never gets in trouble at school or on the playground.

1521
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:22.300
He plays Little League Baseball and as 11 years old as he best friends with a

1522
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:25.690
dolphin,
this is sounds like an all American kid.
Uh,

1523
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:30.750
last year I had a disagreement with his baseball coach who brought in a ringer

1524
01:32:31.901 --> 01:32:36.490
from another league to play in a local tournament.
Wow.

1525
01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:37.443
This took a lifter.

1526
01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:42.280
The coach used the ringer in all the key positions for every inning while many

1527
01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:43.750
of the other kids suppose smoked,

1528
01:32:43.770 --> 01:32:47.080
spent most of the game resting after a few games.

1529
01:32:47.081 --> 01:32:51.010
I spoke to the coach and let them know that I thought it was unfair how the

1530
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:55.330
house league kids were being passed over for the ringer.
His reply was,

1531
01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:00.310
that's the way I do things and lineups are my decision.
Uh,

1532
01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:05.230
in the subsequent tournament games by kid was punished from my outspoken

1533
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:08.230
complaint by becoming the unofficial bench warmer.

1534
01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.990
Obviously this was upsetting to my kid.

1535
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:16.800
Do what is wrong with fucking adults that you do that to a kid.

1536
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:21.470
I could see going,
hey,
this is my team.
This is how I'm running it.

1537
01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:24.950
But to then take it out on his kid who didn't say anything,
what a Douche.

1538
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:31.180
You know,
when his head,
he thinks he's the next fucking,
uh,
chuck Tanner.

1539
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:34.660
I'm sorry.
I know Earl weaver.
I have no idea.
Um,

1540
01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:38.350
I brought a complaint forward to our leagues President State and I felt this

1541
01:33:38.351 --> 01:33:41.440
coach was unfair.
Oh,
so you,
well now we're making it worse.

1542
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:45.970
If he's friends with that guy,
you bitch too.
Uh,

1543
01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:50.440
I suggested that he was unfit for coaching at the league.
Should reconsider,

1544
01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.130
uh,
his placement.
Unfortunately,

1545
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:59.190
the president quit before the ruling on the matter and the new president chose

1546
01:33:59.191 --> 01:34:00.750
to sweep it under the rug.

1547
01:34:01.410 --> 01:34:05.910
The new baseball season began a month ago at new teams or forms Ford,

1548
01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:10.830
my boys first gave back was it gets his last years coach.

1549
01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:12.030
At the end of the game,

1550
01:34:12.031 --> 01:34:16.440
during the head shake by sun shook everyone's hands except for the old his hand.

1551
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.180
What am I son told me about this?

1552
01:34:18.181 --> 01:34:21.180
I did not tell him that his decision was right or wrong,

1553
01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:24.810
but I understood it and I supported it.
Was this bad parenting?

1554
01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:29.020
Is this bad sportsmanship?
No,

1555
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:33.970
no,
it isn't.
It's not.
It's not.

1556
01:34:33.971 --> 01:34:38.971
You know why one thing have everybody's an adult do unite.

1557
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:40.570
You're talking about a kid here.

1558
01:34:40.571 --> 01:34:45.100
This guy's fucking with kids for zone goddamn ego trip and he punished your kid

1559
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:48.190
who did do anything.
So fuck him.

1560
01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:53.350
You kids all are going to be a kid once you know those,

1561
01:34:53.351 --> 01:34:57.650
those exciting moments and during the games when there's pressure that builds

1562
01:34:57.651 --> 01:35:02.100
character,
you know,
and also,
you know,

1563
01:35:02.101 --> 01:35:04.740
if it goes wrong,
it ruins a childhood.
So maybe did help you.

1564
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:09.570
I'm just saying what I'm saying.
That's why sports is the shit.

1565
01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:14.070
It's fucking great.
It's great.
Eddie,
Eddie,
he robbed them of that.

1566
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:18.390
You paid the fee.
Fuck this guy.
No,
it's not bad sportsman ship.

1567
01:35:18.391 --> 01:35:20.730
But I think you're a hell of a dad that you're actually question again.

1568
01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:24.090
And then you also was,
you didn't say it was right or wrong.
You say,

1569
01:35:24.091 --> 01:35:27.000
understood why you did it.
Not Dude,
you're fucking solid.

1570
01:35:27.001 --> 01:35:28.680
Don't even worry about it.
All right.
Two weeks later,

1571
01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:32.550
I was approached by two members of the executive board of our league who asked

1572
01:35:32.551 --> 01:35:36.330
me to speak to my son about shaking everyone's hand.

1573
01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:39.450
At the end of every game though,
this is classic sports.

1574
01:35:39.451 --> 01:35:42.060
They never see the first hit.
They always see the retaliation.

1575
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:46.380
So he's getting caught for retaliate.
Obviously his old coach had complained.

1576
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:49.470
Yeah,
dude,
I bet if you yanked down his sport,

1577
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.810
like biker bike pants to coach is still where those members,

1578
01:35:52.811 --> 01:35:55.530
those are the bike shorts,
that bicycle shorts.

1579
01:35:55.531 --> 01:35:57.990
There was the shorts at all coach war.
They,

1580
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.460
they were made by a company called bike.
Uh,
but if you yanked those doubt,

1581
01:36:01.461 --> 01:36:06.270
he's got a fucking vagina.
This guy's a cunt.
He really is.

1582
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:11.740
Uh,
where the hell am I said obviously the culture could play.
And I was shocked,

1583
01:36:11.741 --> 01:36:15.100
but said that I would give it some thought.
The two teams will meet again soon.

1584
01:36:15.101 --> 01:36:15.761
What should I do?

1585
01:36:15.761 --> 01:36:19.330
Should I tell my son to shake his old his hand or should I tell the executive

1586
01:36:19.331 --> 01:36:23.200
board to piss off and worry about parenting their own kids?
Um,

1587
01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:26.830
it is possible for the league to suspend my son.
They have not threatened this,

1588
01:36:26.831 --> 01:36:31.040
but I consider it,
but I need to consider the possible Rick for Kushans.

1589
01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:34.540
I'm a big fan of don't know why,
but I respect your opinion.

1590
01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:37.360
All right,
dude.
You know what you're dealing with.

1591
01:36:37.361 --> 01:36:42.040
You're dealing with a guy who's a fucking power happy,

1592
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.823
<v 4>okay?</v>

1593
01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.050
<v 3>He's a psycho.
You know,
he gets off on this shit.</v>

1594
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.200
He gets off on the power of telling you this is my lineup.

1595
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:56.240
Sit down and I'm going to sit your kid.
Your kid doesn't fucking shake my head.

1596
01:36:56.241 --> 01:36:57.920
He feels like you got one up on him.

1597
01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.680
So now he's going to go down there and he's got to get off.

1598
01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:02.240
He's not about sportsmanship.

1599
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:05.720
He's going to get off on the fact that he's going to make your seed reach out

1600
01:37:05.721 --> 01:37:08.690
and shake his fucking hand.
He'll probably fill up a little bit.

1601
01:37:08.691 --> 01:37:12.110
The fucking pervert.
You know what?
Fuck this guy.

1602
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:13.700
That's what my gut says.

1603
01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:18.890
But that's not how the world works out in the world comes like this wind.

1604
01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.630
So there's only one solution here.
You got to go fuck with his car.

1605
01:37:24.490 --> 01:37:26.870
DOPP kit up.
Totally gets that.
Uh,

1606
01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:33.360
I don't know.
I,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

1607
01:37:33.361 --> 01:37:34.194
I really don't.

1608
01:37:38.110 --> 01:37:42.790
You know what?
Tell him to shake his head like he's a lady.

1609
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:44.740
Like he,
you know,
sons,
the man

1610
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.650
when he goes to shake it out,
just fucking,

1611
01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.650
just either have the way he shakes it.
Earl just say,

1612
01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:03.430
just have him say something.
Does that make you happy sweetheart?

1613
01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:08.240
Just sub that where you kind of call it.
I'm a fucking sits.

1614
01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:11.470
Just something you get.
There you go.
All right.

1615
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:17.880
And every time he goes back to complain or whatever,
you got to,
yeah,

1616
01:38:17.881 --> 01:38:21.840
that's it.
That's what you gotta do is the guy,
uh,

1617
01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.190
is the guy fat.
Maybe could say something.
Hey,
great game.

1618
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.920
They have fatty.
Hey there.

1619
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:35.040
Fudgy guy can fatties does two mean,
I don't know what,

1620
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:38.760
there's something having to do the handshake so you don't piss off the board

1621
01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:42.030
play,
go play his fucking game.
All right.

1622
01:38:43.410 --> 01:38:47.700
And you just have him say something or,
or shake it,
grabbed the guy's hand.

1623
01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:50.210
Hold it like it's like he's a date.
Like the,

1624
01:38:50.211 --> 01:38:53.520
he's the dainty fucking pussy that he is.
That really annoys me.

1625
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:58.470
You know what I'm thinking right now?
I'm thinking about that fucking that guy,

1626
01:38:58.920 --> 01:38:59.100
uh,

1627
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:03.750
who they always bring back on survivor who ended up crying when he finally got

1628
01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:07.130
taken off.
Anybody watch it this past season,
I actually got sucked into her.

1629
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:11.550
That Dude Boston,
rob played the best fucking game I've ever seen.

1630
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:14.430
Manipulated the whole fucking game.

1631
01:39:14.431 --> 01:39:18.840
And in the end he gave people the choice of a fucking lunatic and an absolute

1632
01:39:18.841 --> 01:39:21.690
airhead.
And even though they all fucking hated him,

1633
01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:25.470
the other two people were so goddamn unworthy of it.

1634
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:28.320
They had to give it to him and he won.
It was fucking brilliant.

1635
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:31.950
I'm sure a lot of people could think to do something like that,

1636
01:39:31.951 --> 01:39:35.940
but to actually pull it off
was ridiculous.

1637
01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:41.540
And the fucking air had chick was the linchpin and that was the whole thing.

1638
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:42.660
That's why he made it,

1639
01:39:42.661 --> 01:39:47.661
because they should have all turned on rob on the last fucking round and they

1640
01:39:48.181 --> 01:39:51.310
didn't house fucking great.
That was great.
Yeah.

1641
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:55.230
Boston rob told he's not fucking around kit,
you know,

1642
01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:01.050
fucking wife wanted.
He wanted his fucking 2 million.
All is dope,

1643
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.380
you know.
But does he go down and get us a fucking

1644
01:40:06.490 --> 01:40:11.250
Boston Kaaba no,
no duties.
Keep it all for himself.
Selfish.
Fuck Dude.

1645
01:40:12.190 --> 01:40:16.340
Um,
all right.
Youtube videos for the week.
Oh,
what am I,

1646
01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.520
I'm 40 minutes said,
guys,
this is,
this is just going to be a short one.

1647
01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:21.890
It's going to be short.

1648
01:40:21.891 --> 01:40:25.160
Just like the fucking Dick on that Douche fucker with their kid and the little

1649
01:40:25.161 --> 01:40:26.660
league.
What an asshole.

1650
01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.250
What a fucking asshole.

1651
01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.930
What's his game?
Maybe some of my listeners can come up with something.
Hey guys,

1652
01:40:38.590 --> 01:40:43.120
what?
Say You fucking contribute to the podcast.
You want to do that?

1653
01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:49.570
Why don't you do that?
Give this poor bastard who's his out.

1654
01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.470
He can tell the way he wrote it.
You can tell my fucking voices.

1655
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:55.780
Chug a B could tell the way he wrote that.
That guy's a good dad.

1656
01:40:56.170 --> 01:40:57.190
He's also a good person.

1657
01:40:57.191 --> 01:41:00.300
He's actually looking at this shift from 360 degrees as the guy got my,

1658
01:41:00.301 --> 01:41:03.610
a bad guy or whatever.
Give this guy some suggestions on what his kid could do.

1659
01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.880
He's got to shake his fucking hand.
I don't want the kid to get suspended.

1660
01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:08.633
<v 5>All right.</v>

1661
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:13.780
<v 3>Um,
I dunno what else to tell them.
It help.</v>

1662
01:41:13.781 --> 01:41:18.220
If you could send me a description of what this guy looks like,
you,

1663
01:41:18.221 --> 01:41:20.620
there's something you got to do.
There's gotta be some,
you know,

1664
01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.150
you got to go passive aggressive here,

1665
01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:26.140
even though I can't stand passive aggressiveness,
but this guy's being a bitch.

1666
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.940
So maybe this is the time you get to fight fire with fire.
I don't know what,
um,

1667
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:32.830
alright.
Underrated.
Overrated for the week.

1668
01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:36.910
<v 5>Um,
all right.</v>

1669
01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.240
<v 3>Underrated Captain Kirk of the roots,
quests,</v>

1670
01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:47.100
love and Jack White are the three most underrated musicians of this generation.

1671
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:52.350
Uh,
I'd go with Captain Kirk and quests.
Love,
but what's his face?
Uh,

1672
01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:55.920
Jack White gets plenty of,
uh,
accolades.

1673
01:41:56.250 --> 01:42:00.850
They did a goddamn documentary
with Jimmy page,

1674
01:42:00.851 --> 01:42:04.570
the edge and now him aren't they saying he's basically the Jimmy page or the

1675
01:42:04.571 --> 01:42:06.250
edge of this era?
If they do that

1676
01:42:07.730 --> 01:42:08.563
<v 5>now</v>

1677
01:42:08.850 --> 01:42:10.770
<v 3>I know fucking though.
Anyway,
so it's too bad.</v>

1678
01:42:10.771 --> 01:42:15.771
Pop Stars get all the attention because most people don't appreciate how fucking

1679
01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:18.690
great Jack White is.
All right?
You know what?

1680
01:42:18.691 --> 01:42:22.470
I need to dispel this fucking myth or at least what I feel is a myth.

1681
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:26.130
People,
if you like quote unquote good music,

1682
01:42:26.190 --> 01:42:30.120
stop paying attention to pop music and going,
Oh God,

1683
01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:35.550
what is wrong with this country?
What is wrong with the culture?
It's 13,

1684
01:42:35.551 --> 01:42:36.151
14,

1685
01:42:36.151 --> 01:42:41.151
15 year old girls are buying Justin Bieber album's okay.

1686
01:42:41.341 --> 01:42:46.080
There's really no reason to sit there tearing your fucking hair out,

1687
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:50.370
ask acting like 30 35 year old people are buying this shit.
They're not.

1688
01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.580
If they are,
they're buying it for their kids.
All right?

1689
01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:57.930
There's always going to be pop culture.
Pop culture is not destroying music.

1690
01:42:58.410 --> 01:43:02.160
It just gives you something to bitch about.
It makes your bad luck cooler.

1691
01:43:02.490 --> 01:43:07.130
So quit your fucking whining.
God,
I'm so fucking sick of that.

1692
01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:10.640
Every what happened in music,
it's always been like that.

1693
01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.740
Oh yeah,
the 60s it was so real with the monkeys and the partridge family.

1694
01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:23.240
Telly Savalas put out a fucking album in the 70s all right?

1695
01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:26.630
It's always been awful and unbelievable.

1696
01:43:26.690 --> 01:43:30.380
So listen to the unbelievable shit.
But you know,

1697
01:43:30.381 --> 01:43:33.650
just know that kids are listening to that kids.

1698
01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:35.270
You know that they're allowed to have music.

1699
01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.630
They're allowed to have Leif Garrett,
Shaun Cassidy,

1700
01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:44.480
fucking Britney spears,
Justin Bieber,
all of them.
They're not for you.

1701
01:43:44.481 --> 01:43:49.310
They're not saying you have to listen to all these fucking cunts on youtube who

1702
01:43:49.311 --> 01:43:52.940
go to these great musicians sites.
Always have to bring up Justin Bieber.

1703
01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:54.890
Is it sad?

1704
01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:58.160
The Justin Bieber BB reselling the hundred million records and this guy,

1705
01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.520
you'll easily pucky bubbly.
Now it isn't.
This is sad.

1706
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:07.430
It's not sad.
Alright?
He's fucking 18 years old.
All right.

1707
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:10.040
And he's appealing to 13 year old checks.

1708
01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:12.473
<v 5>Good Fam.</v>

1709
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:16.650
<v 3>You know,
he made a zillion bucks.
Good for him.</v>

1710
01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:21.210
He's not affecting your fucking music.
And if they took him away,

1711
01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:25.680
they wouldn't go and listen to your fucking jam band.
They're 13 year old girls.

1712
01:44:25.681 --> 01:44:28.380
They're not gonna do it.
They're just gonna like,
look for the next fucking guy.

1713
01:44:29.970 --> 01:44:31.740
All right.
Anyways,

1714
01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.940
what really ruined music was fucking downloading shit for free.

1715
01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.200
That's what ruined it.
I think the Internet and all that shit,
it just,

1716
01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:44.310
it's splintered.
The whole thing.
And there's no more superstars anymore.

1717
01:44:44.970 --> 01:44:48.570
I'm not saying the old system was great.
He used to get raped in a lot of ways.

1718
01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:54.440
Still a music was justification for them charging us $18 for a fucking CD when

1719
01:44:55.981 --> 01:44:58.950
it only costs them a dollar to make it,
they may have a ton of fucking money.

1720
01:44:58.951 --> 01:45:03.300
They raped all of us for two generations,
right?
Or two decades.

1721
01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:07.350
So I dunno,
but without judging,
downloading,

1722
01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:12.040
either way that the whole advent of downloading shit for free is really what,
uh,

1723
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:15.300
I think destroyed it.
But anyway,
so let's,
let's plow ahead.

1724
01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:20.320
Take your pick between any of the six white stripe albums to rake on tour

1725
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:22.060
albums.
I don't want to say that.
Oh,

1726
01:45:22.061 --> 01:45:24.990
the two dead where their albums and you'll see the guy belongs in the

1727
01:45:24.991 --> 01:45:28.710
conversation with the all time.
Great.
We'll do it.
I don't know how you missed it.

1728
01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:33.840
There's a documentary out there called it might get loud and he gets just about

1729
01:45:33.841 --> 01:45:37.080
as as many props as you could possibly get there.

1730
01:45:38.710 --> 01:45:39.543
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1731
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.391
<v 3>anyways,</v>

1732
01:45:40.391 --> 01:45:44.110
my dad grew up on the Beatles and Zeplin swears that Jack White is better than

1733
01:45:44.111 --> 01:45:46.300
all of them.
All right.

1734
01:45:46.330 --> 01:45:49.330
Well I would swear that your dad took LSD a little too much.

1735
01:45:49.331 --> 01:45:54.040
If he thinks the Jack White is better than the fucking Beatles.
All right.

1736
01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:57.760
Or even Zap for that matter.
All those apple,
don't,
you know,

1737
01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:03.280
they got a lot of covers in there fucking catalog.
So I don't know.
Jack White,

1738
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:08.190
he's writing his own songs,
isn't he?
Yeah.
Oh geesh.
Um,

1739
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:13.090
too bad.
Maroon five Green Day Nickleback and Coldplay will always outsell him.

1740
01:46:13.091 --> 01:46:17.410
See,
this is where it always goes because they cater their music to the radio.

1741
01:46:18.610 --> 01:46:23.590
Well that's their prerogative.
Green days.
A fucking great band,

1742
01:46:23.591 --> 01:46:27.460
by the way.
It's a fucking great bed.
Nickelback yeah.

1743
01:46:28.150 --> 01:46:31.360
Coldplay.
Yeah,
I get that.
I get that,
you know,

1744
01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:34.510
they write those songs here at one time were like,
oh that wasn't bad.

1745
01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:35.980
And they'd hear it again and like,
oh my God,

1746
01:46:35.981 --> 01:46:38.430
I want to kill everyone who made that song.
Uh,

1747
01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:40.780
although Coldplay's not nearly as bad as Nickelback.

1748
01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:43.613
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1749
01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.990
<v 3>but all I can say is get used to it.</v>

1750
01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.840
Cause those bands are always going to be around and those bands will always

1751
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:51.970
<v 5>the,
the,
the,</v>

1752
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:56.630
<v 3>the better beds.
And there's no reason to get mad at it because you know,</v>

1753
01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.930
most of the people who buy fucking music or in their teens aren't they?

1754
01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:05.720
So that's what the fuck they listened to.
All right.
Jesus,

1755
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:10.430
let me come down off of my fucking Goddamn my soapbox here.

1756
01:47:12.130 --> 01:47:15.650
Um,
but I will go,
I will say I saw that dude captain Kirk play live.

1757
01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:20.800
He's fucking unbelievable and a quest lovers obviously the shit.

1758
01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.820
And I think Jaguar,
he ties up.
So everybody that you pick,

1759
01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.400
they're a obviously a obviously agree with.
Uh,

1760
01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:32.540
all right.
And now what are we up to?
47 minutes,

1761
01:47:33.170 --> 01:47:35.810
47 minutes,
people.
I don't know what else to talk about.
Oh,

1762
01:47:35.811 --> 01:47:39.440
I know what I'm going to talk about.
What the fuck is my newspaper here?

1763
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:44.210
This is at the risk of burning some potential material.

1764
01:47:44.211 --> 01:47:49.211
This is something you can look forward to watching me go off on in the future.

1765
01:47:49.641 --> 01:47:54.620
On stage.
All right,
hang on a second.
I gotta blow my God damn nose again.
Hold on.

1766
01:47:54.621 --> 01:47:58.370
Hold on.
Let's go eat a pastry.

1767
01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:08.730
Fuck
yeah,

1768
01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:11.300
we had to get it out of the mustache.
Um,

1769
01:48:14.170 --> 01:48:18.460
anyways,
so everybody saw what happened almost Schwartzenegger this week,
right?

1770
01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:23.530
So Time magazine has a,
uh,

1771
01:48:25.150 --> 01:48:29.080
it has an article out there says sex lies arrogance.

1772
01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:32.380
What makes powerful men act like pigs?

1773
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:36.240
<v 5>Okay,
so</v>

1774
01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.980
<v 3>I look at the,
who wrote it?</v>

1775
01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.630
It's written by a lady.

1776
01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:48.090
How fucking funny is that?
Sex lies.
Arrogance.
What Po?

1777
01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:50.200
What makes powerful men act like pigs?

1778
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:55.470
A woman is going to tell the world why guys act the way they act.

1779
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:59.050
Do you realize how fucked up?

1780
01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:06.140
At what point are men going to make a fucking stand here with this?
Okay.

1781
01:49:06.141 --> 01:49:10.070
I don't want to come off like a chauvinist pig here and you just giving away.

1782
01:49:10.071 --> 01:49:12.560
Every guy should have wrote this article.

1783
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:18.440
He could've had so much more fucking insight.
What the fuck does a woman know?

1784
01:49:19.190 --> 01:49:24.080
She doesn't know.
And the whole thing is just thick.
The whole thing is written

1785
01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.840
bye in the,
in the female's point of view,

1786
01:49:28.841 --> 01:49:32.710
which is the only thing you understand is being that woman who got cheated on.

1787
01:49:34.670 --> 01:49:39.110
So there's this woman's scorn vibe under the whole article,

1788
01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:43.100
but there's no information in here.
I learned nothing.
I was really good.

1789
01:49:43.101 --> 01:49:48.010
I learned nothing as a guy and she's fucking wrong on most of her points.

1790
01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:53.820
One of the great things they like to say is that
a men of power,

1791
01:49:53.821 --> 01:49:57.030
the reason why they cheat is because they feel entitled.

1792
01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.470
They feel they're entitled.
I'm not going to burn the bit,

1793
01:50:01.471 --> 01:50:04.290
but that is something that's so not even true.

1794
01:50:04.770 --> 01:50:08.460
And what kills me is some fucking broad like this.

1795
01:50:08.461 --> 01:50:11.250
Nancy Gibbs would sit there and argue with me

1796
01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.720
being a lady,
a lady.
Do you understand what you're doing there?

1797
01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:22.780
You're basically telling me that you know how my brain works better than I do.

1798
01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:26.660
I was watching her or the reason why I bought this fucking article cause I was

1799
01:50:26.850 --> 01:50:30.870
sitting,
I was watching it on television.
I saw the art and the obviously I like,

1800
01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.490
I'll fucking magnet.
I'm drawn to this.
I'm like,
Oh,
I like this topic.

1801
01:50:34.491 --> 01:50:35.450
I want to hear about this.

1802
01:50:36.170 --> 01:50:40.190
And then Nancy gives comes on and she's talking to a guy.

1803
01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:41.970
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

1804
01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:45.080
<v 3>Katie's going really always.
That was I was,
I was okay.
Like</v>

1805
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:50.470
it's a shadow.
It's just,
it's fucking terrific.
That would be like me.

1806
01:50:50.471 --> 01:50:55.090
Like here's something for you.
Here's his like,
like women.

1807
01:50:55.210 --> 01:50:58.960
You never get to know what it's like to have a dick.
All right,
so stop it.

1808
01:50:59.050 --> 01:51:00.430
Stop trying to write articles.

1809
01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:03.490
Tries to up to act like you're in our heads and you know what we're thinking.

1810
01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.460
You don't.
You're always going to be observed.
You've got to be an observer.

1811
01:51:06.670 --> 01:51:09.610
You sitting on the grassy knoll what to do?
Where do the shots come from?

1812
01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:12.820
You have no fucking idea.
You just coming up with your theories,

1813
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.880
the nerve or you to get to cover a fucking Time magazine with this horse.
Shit.

1814
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:22.570
Just a bunch of horse shit.
They got one over there.
Let's see this ship.
Uh,

1815
01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:25.260
the turning points,
this is from another lake.

1816
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:27.670
They are two people write about this shit.
Elaine,

1817
01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:32.530
I can't even read a fucking last name.
Eyes,
CEO,
Lino,
whatever.

1818
01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.900
Frances having it's Anita Hill moment.

1819
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.950
When the law professor testified before the Senate committee in 1991 that a

1820
01:51:38.951 --> 01:51:43.120
former boss,
Clarence Thomas,
had sexually harassed her.
He denied everything,

1821
01:51:43.130 --> 01:51:45.100
was elevated to the Supreme Court.

1822
01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:49.840
Notice how the fucking angry cunt leaves out the fact that he was acquitted.

1823
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:51.490
The guy was acquitted.

1824
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:53.663
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1825
01:51:53.710 --> 01:51:57.310
<v 3>She makes it seem like he was accused of that stuff and because of that he will</v>

1826
01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:02.260
because of that attention,
he was elevated to the Supreme Court.
But anyways,

1827
01:52:02.261 --> 01:52:04.480
hearings were attorney,
but hearings were terming point.

1828
01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:09.660
Women suddenly said that the mad men style of behavior they had been putting up

1829
01:52:10.421 --> 01:52:14.590
with at work for so long,
the leering,
the inappropriate touching,

1830
01:52:14.591 --> 01:52:18.160
the sexual banter was not acceptable.
Do you understand that?

1831
01:52:18.161 --> 01:52:20.680
She's not talking about the 1960s there.

1832
01:52:20.890 --> 01:52:25.570
She's talking about 1991 I'm not saying that that shit wasn't happening,

1833
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:29.530
but you know I was in the workforce.
They're all right.

1834
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.270
People weren't walking around going,
hey,

1835
01:52:31.271 --> 01:52:36.271
touch grabbing people's asses at work in 98919901991 they weren't,

1836
01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:40.900
I mean generally speaking warrant,

1837
01:52:40.901 --> 01:52:44.620
but this lady just fucking goes the mad men style,

1838
01:52:44.621 --> 01:52:49.370
which is from the 1960s Madison Avenue.
Hey Sweetie,

1839
01:52:49.371 --> 01:52:51.680
go make me a fucking sandwich.
That era,

1840
01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:56.240
completely ignoring all the bullshit that happened in the late sixties seventies

1841
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:59.660
right through the fucking eighties and the 80s they were talking about women

1842
01:52:59.661 --> 01:53:03.830
wearing their fucking little power suits and power ties and all that fucking

1843
01:53:04.330 --> 01:53:09.190
horseshit.
This is all just one of these classic things where you just,

1844
01:53:09.191 --> 01:53:11.110
you just,
you have your angle and then you just,

1845
01:53:11.111 --> 01:53:15.040
you just write the whole fucking article.
It's complete horse shit.
Um,

1846
01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.570
what the hell is the coordinator wanted to read?
I don't even know.

1847
01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:25.270
All right,
let me tell you something,
Nancy.
Let me tell you something,
Elaine.

1848
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:30.220
Those guys don't do that shit cause they feel entitled.
They don't.

1849
01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:33.070
All right.
They don't.

1850
01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.390
And if you want to know why come out to a comedy club cause I'm not burden the

1851
01:53:37.391 --> 01:53:39.610
fucking material.
I'll talk about it a little bit.
Yeah,

1852
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.430
I'll talk about real quick.
All right.

1853
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:49.000
What it is is women don't understand what it's like to have a dick.

1854
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:51.850
They just don't get it.
Okay?

1855
01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:56.520
The fucking thing tells us what to do.
You know,

1856
01:53:57.490 --> 01:54:00.630
and right now they're rolling their eyes because they don't understand the sex

1857
01:54:00.631 --> 01:54:04.230
drive that we have.
How could they,
they got a vantage.

1858
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.050
All right?
And the thing is,

1859
01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:12.520
there's no information out there to help people to help guys out.
Method.

1860
01:54:13.450 --> 01:54:17.980
All guys get is no information about being a guy in general.
Hey,

1861
01:54:17.981 --> 01:54:22.450
keep it in your pants.
That's the sexual advice we get.
That's what we get.

1862
01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.300
Fuck it.
You got Kosmal.

1863
01:54:24.301 --> 01:54:27.130
There's reams of shit talking about all the folds in your vagina.

1864
01:54:27.131 --> 01:54:30.340
Every goddamn month we get,
Hey,
keep it in your pants.

1865
01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:34.390
That's the kind of advice guys get.
You go to jail.
Hey,
don't drop the soap.

1866
01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.590
That's it.
That's all you get.
We get little fucking four sentences.

1867
01:54:38.591 --> 01:54:40.720
And that's how we're supposed to fucking navigate through life.

1868
01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:45.610
So you're born with a deck,
you've got this ridiculous fucking sex drive.

1869
01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.340
The only thing that fucking keeps it in check is the fact that women won't fuck

1870
01:54:51.341 --> 01:54:54.190
you.
You got to figure out,
you got to talk them into it.

1871
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:55.420
You go through dry spells.

1872
01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.310
That's the only thing that prevents a guy from fucking 24 hours a day is other

1873
01:55:00.311 --> 01:55:03.460
women making it difficult for us to get laid.

1874
01:55:05.370 --> 01:55:08.040
But then what happens is when you become an a position of power,

1875
01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:12.180
these cuts flip the fucking table and will suck your Dick under your fucking

1876
01:55:12.181 --> 01:55:14.880
Goddamn desk while your wife's sits across from you.

1877
01:55:15.450 --> 01:55:17.190
So now the governor has taken off.

1878
01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.870
You've never had to control your sexual urges because it was always done for
you.

1879
01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.690
You like a spoiled kid.
Now you're fucking famous.

1880
01:55:24.810 --> 01:55:27.390
She got all these broads coming at you.
You don't know what to do

1881
01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:31.620
because you never really noticed how much you've been being led around by your

1882
01:55:31.621 --> 01:55:35.190
Dick.
Now,
I'm not saying every powerful guy out there is an angel.

1883
01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:37.080
There's not this.
Definitely some pigs out there.

1884
01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:41.000
There's definitely some guys out there who do feel entitled but to just painted

1885
01:55:41.010 --> 01:55:45.210
with that broad fucking stroke of a brush and have a fucking woman sitting there

1886
01:55:45.211 --> 01:55:49.470
telling me it's you.
You don't know what you're talking about lady.

1887
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:54.700
All right
you have to,
I just fucking blows my mind.

1888
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:57.110
Blows my fucking mind that they,

1889
01:55:57.111 --> 01:56:00.440
they put two people on this assignment and they were both women.

1890
01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:05.090
Was that some political correct fucking thing?
Cause they were worried that guys,

1891
01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:08.840
we're going to say what the fuck I'm saying that basically their husbands would

1892
01:56:08.841 --> 01:56:13.841
be our fucking everything that moved if women wanted to fuck the way we want it

1893
01:56:13.911 --> 01:56:17.290
to,
I don't know.

1894
01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:21.700
And not to mention most people can handle power and that includes broads.

1895
01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:25.810
Okay.
So you get some guy in a powerful position.

1896
01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:30.310
Is Egos already going to go through the fucking roof and then you combine that

1897
01:56:30.311 --> 01:56:35.311
with the fact that basically half of the free world will now fuck him.

1898
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:42.040
Any supposed to somehow rein that in and is only piece of advice is keep it in

1899
01:56:42.041 --> 01:56:45.460
your pants.
You know,
I don't,
I dunno.

1900
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:47.160
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.000
<v 3>Dave,
I that gets really embarrassing,</v>

1902
01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:53.170
the Time magazine with this fucking superficial that they,
they just basically

1903
01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:00.300
they tee,
I mean it was like psych 101
how they broke it down.

1904
01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:02.000
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
<v 3>Even there's shit on,
on a Arnold Schwartzenegger about how he,</v>

1906
01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:09.530
he likes fucking around with girls that aren't beautiful.
You know,

1907
01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:13.860
they said it was cause he was intimidated by beautiful women and Blah,
blah,
blah,

1908
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:15.710
blah,
blah.
See,
they're women.
They don't,

1909
01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:19.580
they don't get the difference between hooking up with a hottie and hooking up

1910
01:57:19.581 --> 01:57:23.240
with the plain Jane girl who's going to try harder,
okay.

1911
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:25.040
As opposed to the fucking chick who's,

1912
01:57:25.041 --> 01:57:29.210
who's got 0% body fat and just thinks she's God's God damn gift.

1913
01:57:29.810 --> 01:57:33.440
You've seen that,
right?
You go to a titty bar,
the hottest one there does,

1914
01:57:33.441 --> 01:57:37.100
she tries hard is that fucking one in the middle?
She doesn't,

1915
01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:40.520
and after awhile,
you know what?
You start looking at those hot,
he's going,

1916
01:57:40.521 --> 01:57:45.290
you know what?
They're fucking more trouble than they're worth.
All right,

1917
01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:49.370
I want my dick sucked to completion.
Who am I going with?

1918
01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:54.830
The supermodel looking chick.
Oh,
the chick who's just happy to be there

1919
01:57:56.170 --> 01:58:01.150
fucking morons.
I,
I don't know.
All right.

1920
01:58:01.151 --> 01:58:02.290
Somehow I made an hour.

1921
01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:09.970
Oh Geez.
Oh Jesus.
What are we doing here?
You guys want to hear?
Uh,
did I did,

1922
01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:14.800
I did my dates last week,
right?
Did I,
did I have those up there?
What do I go?

1923
01:58:14.801 --> 01:58:16.690
You know what?
I'm actually,
I've got a couple of weeks off here.

1924
01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:20.620
I've got a couple of weeks off here and I'm not doing God damn shit.

1925
01:58:20.621 --> 01:58:25.330
I'm not going to though.
I'm not going to the,
uh,
airport.

1926
01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:29.320
I'm not doing shit.
My fucking nose is running.

1927
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:33.340
I usually end up doing another rant here,
but I got nothing.
All right guys,

1928
01:58:33.341 --> 01:58:36.340
you gotta help me out here.
It's fucking May.
I'm drinking goddamn day quilt.

1929
01:58:36.341 --> 01:58:39.550
What do you want from me?
Well,
we'd like another 10 minutes.
What?

1930
01:58:39.551 --> 01:58:41.560
Go fuck yourselves.
It's not all right.

1931
01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:45.100
This has been the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

1932
01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:49.090
May 23rd,
2011 I hope you guys enjoyed it.

1933
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:52.360
I like to think it was a decent one.
A little bit raspy.

1934
01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:54.993
<v 2>Fuck.</v>

1935
01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:56.930
<v 3>You know,
sub did,
did I buy the wrong tissues?</v>

1936
01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.700
My nose is going to be all fucking raw.

1937
01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:01.220
It's gotta be redder than my God damn beard.

1938
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:03.743
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1940
01:59:05.611 --> 01:59:10.560
I will have the schedule for when my episodes of glee are going to air.
And,
uh,

1941
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:12.650
so sharpen your fucking fingers,
cause I don't,

1942
01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:14.100
I'm going to get trashed for those,
but uh,

1943
01:59:15.110 --> 01:59:18.620
<v 8>they're coming up.
Um,
and that's it.
That's the podcast this week.</v>

1944
01:59:18.621 --> 01:59:20.660
God bless all of you to go fuck yourself.
I'll talk to you.

1945
01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:21.773
