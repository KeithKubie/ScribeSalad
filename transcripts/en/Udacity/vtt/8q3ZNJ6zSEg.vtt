00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:06.048
The line that runs down the middle dividing all of these even functions in half

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:10.514
is the y axis. So they have symmetry across the y axis. Just by looking we can

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:14.364
tell that they don't have symmetry across the x axis. In fact, none of these

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:18.523
even functions even have any points that lie below the x axis. So that means

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:22.183
that none of the points on them that lay above it, will have corresponding

00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:26.020
points that there reflected across from. Now, these last two choices might look

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.437
a little bit complicated, but taking your time and thinking through them you can

00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:33.661
figure out which one's true, if either one. Saying that f of negative x Is equal

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.695
to f of x, is basically saying that two points lie on a graph. This is the same

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:43.880
as saying that if we have the point x, y, or x, f of x, then we'll also have the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.455
point negative x, y. This is saying that when you plug in the negative version

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:52.550
of some x value, you get the same y value since the value of the function is the

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.877
same at those two x coordinates. We already saw in the last quiz that this is in

00:00:56.877 --> 00:01:02.533
fact true of even functions. So this also applies. The last answer does not,

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:08.422
since having it be true would mean that this third one couldn't be true.
