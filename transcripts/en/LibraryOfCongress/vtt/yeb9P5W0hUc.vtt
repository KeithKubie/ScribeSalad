          (APPLAUSE) welcome.

00:07:08.405 --> 00:07:12.410
Welcome to the library of 
Congress. It's 

00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:21.920
the world's largest library. 84 
-- 862 -- it's also 

00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:27.105
home to historyic recordings and
 movies, and the 

00:07:27.106 --> 00:07:29.300
library of Congress for the 
first time is 

00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:34.156
celebrating a very interesting 
era in music.

00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:37.997
          I happen to live 
through it.

00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:43.487
          And we had a 
presentation on fashion and 

00:07:43.488 --> 00:07:49.396
the 70's and I kept saying that 
is an oxymoron.

00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:53.324
          One of the best things
 about living 

00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:57.907
through it and reviewing the 
fashion and the record

00:07:57.908 --> 00:08:02.183
recordings is we could have 
crazy fashion because we 

00:08:02.184 --> 00:08:06.363
had such great music -- we were 
all thinner because 

00:08:06.364 --> 00:08:13.267
we danceed all night, and we 
really have cribbed, I 

00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:16.949
think in our generation and some
 of my colleagues 

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:22.762

00:08:22.763 --> 00:08:24.763

national products, she has hand 
crafted mirrored 

00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:15.017

 here on derbiday. 
We're going to start with a 

00:13:47.768 --> 00:13:51.292
question -- Omega 
national products makes some of 

00:13:51.293 --> 00:13:53.872
the best mirrors in 
will world, can you give us a 

00:13:53.873 --> 00:13:57.110
little bit of an 
explanation about its origin.

00:13:57.111 --> 00:14:00.703
          I can open help you 
with that. We've been 

00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:04.793
making mirrors since 1946 when 
the company was found

00:14:04.794 --> 00:14:09.500
founded and it was made by hand,
 hand crafted and at 

00:14:09.501 --> 00:14:16.208
that time most mirrors were.  We
 no longer commute 

00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:21.926
mercury but we can make them on 
antique mirror, 

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:25.576
regular mirror, all from the art
 democratic ohistory

00:14:25.577 --> 00:14:29.973
ohistories of furniture and wall
 covers and the best 

00:14:29.974 --> 00:14:33.684
thing to say is because we make 
it in America, 

00:14:33.685 --> 00:14:39.232
because our company is so family
 oriented we take 

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:42.921
great pride in our work and 
craftmanship.

00:14:42.922 --> 00:14:46.762
          Thank you, can you 
explain the tie in in 

00:14:46.763 --> 00:14:50.611
1950's and democratic ofurniture
 around desire for 

00:14:50.612 --> 00:14:53.896
everyone to have their furniture
ed mirrored?

00:14:53.897 --> 00:14:58.283
          We talked about this 
above but a lot of 

00:14:58.284 --> 00:15:03.017
the very wealthy wanted all of 
these replica 

00:15:03.018 --> 00:15:07.399
furniture pieces, and then it 
was just a lot more 

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.501
affordable to have it mirrored 
rather than have half 

00:15:10.502 --> 00:15:15.520
of the solid wood and exotic 
wood that came from 

00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:22.064
other countries. Then we had 
some mirrored furniture 

00:15:22.065 --> 00:15:25.560
for tabletops and the art 
democratic otables, 

00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:28.301
occasion a.m. tables, really -- 
I'm trying to think 

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:34.883
-- I'm so sorry -- but I think 
everybody loves to go 

00:15:34.884 --> 00:15:39.417
into the ring where it's expand
ed and when have you 

00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:44.317
a mirrored room, it just sort of
 -- antique mirror 

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.817
sort of takes away from some of 
the mirrored image 

00:15:47.818 --> 00:15:51.346
and makes it a softer look for 
people, and it's kind 

00:15:51.347 --> 00:15:55.013
of elegant and I think it shows 
a richness.

00:15:55.014 --> 00:15:58.001
          Thank you. Now let's 
get a little bit into 

00:15:58.002 --> 00:16:02.700
disco balls balls. Who wants to 
explain to us the origin 

00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:10.258
of the disco ball?
          It didn't start in 

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:12.259
Louis individual 
Kentucky, I can tell you that --

00:16:13.266 --> 00:16:16.816
 I really wish it 
did but it didn't and we weren't

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:20.966
 alive when it 
started. It started over in 

00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:25.594
Europe and then in 20's 
you can see disco balls in old 

00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:31.453
photographs of speak 
easyies and ballrooms and 

00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:33.454
incorporating with the

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.162
tian 
dehere's and then it came over 

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:42.519
to America in the 
early 20's but we didn't start 

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.355
actually 
manufacturing those until the 60

00:16:45.356 --> 00:16:51.074
's. We were making 
flexible wall covering and a 

00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:54.645
flexible mirror cover
covering and that's whateo land 

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:58.043
da does, and a 
company approached us and asked 

00:16:58.044 --> 00:17:02.139
if we would do 
various sizes or unique shapes, 

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.123
different kind of 
substrates and that's when we 

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:08.974
started making though 
around 1960.

00:17:08.975 --> 00:17:13.290
          What was the largest 
size of the disco 

00:17:13.291 --> 00:17:16.257
ball you've ever made and oddest
 one.

00:17:16.258 --> 00:17:24.103
          I did a ten football 
for Coke Cola, and 

00:17:24.104 --> 00:17:29.586
the oddest thing would be a 
saddle.

00:17:29.587 --> 00:17:37.270
          And a four feet -- how
 did you cover a 

00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:39.547
saddle? Did someone actually sit
 on it?

00:17:39.548 --> 00:17:44.404
          It was for display in 
a bar.

00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:50.673
          Wow.
          I -- how you started 

00:17:50.674 --> 00:17:53.344
getting into making 
them -- 

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:57.026
          The company that 
approached us and I don't 

00:17:57.027 --> 00:18:00.161
have that information but they 
approached us because 

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:04.865
we were making -- taking two 
feet by two feet glass 

00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:11.284
sheets, they would silver them 
and we would put a 

00:18:11.285 --> 00:18:15.534
glass -- went we started doing 
that like cylinders 

00:18:15.535 --> 00:18:17.958
and different curveed walls 
that's when the company 

00:18:17.959 --> 00:18:21.939
was approached, we were making 
wastebaskets, 

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.631
accessories, bathroom 
accessories, and the company 

00:18:25.632 --> 00:18:31.108
came by and said we would like 
to you mass produce, 

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:33.316
and at that time there were 
three people in this 

00:18:33.317 --> 00:18:35.892
department, one person covering 
balls, one person 

00:18:35.893 --> 00:18:40.721
making the Self-s and one person
 scoring the glass, 

00:18:40.722 --> 00:18:44.685
and those people grew into 28 
people within five 

00:18:44.686 --> 00:18:49.096
years, making an average of 25 
balls per person per 

00:18:49.097 --> 00:18:52.939
day. So at that time we really 
became the most 

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.941
revereed in America as far as 
making disco balls and 

00:18:57.942 --> 00:19:03.891
they went global. No point 
intended -- we make 

00:19:03.892 --> 00:19:07.733
mirrored globes because disco 
balls were called 

00:19:07.734 --> 00:19:12.310
disco balls until disco. And we 
still call them 

00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:16.035
mirrored balls today.
          You still make 

00:19:16.036 --> 00:19:21.376
furniture as well now, and 
antique mirrors and disco balls?

00:19:21.377 --> 00:19:25.221
 We actually make 
the glass and sell it through 

00:19:25.222 --> 00:19:28.504
distribution, through 
cabinet companies. I actually 

00:19:28.505 --> 00:19:35.484
have a disco ball desk 
and credenza and I love it. I 

00:19:35.485 --> 00:19:38.173
said you can't throw 
that away.

00:19:38.174 --> 00:19:44.449
          Can you describe how 
you make a disco ball

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.835
ball?
          You have a aluminum 

00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:52.837
shelf, it's hallow on 
the inside, it has a hook on one

00:19:53.373 --> 00:19:57.010
 end, for the 
hanging -- you take the

00:20:01.365 --> 00:20:05.056
 (inaudible) you put it 
around the middle, fifty-five it

00:20:05.058 --> 00:20:07.747
 on there, and put 
glue on the

00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:17.116
 ball -- it's that simple.
          Simple she says. How 

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:20.568
long does it take for 
to you make one of these balls? 

00:20:20.571 --> 00:20:23.234
          &gt;&gt; A 12-inch would 
probably take about 15 

00:20:23.235 --> 00:20:26.884
minutes.
          What was the longest 

00:20:26.885 --> 00:20:29.801
time it took?
          The ten footer was 

00:20:29.802 --> 00:20:34.613
like two or three days.
          Can you talk a little 

00:20:34.614 --> 00:20:38.752
bit about the trends 
and the decorative arts in the 

00:20:38.753 --> 00:20:43.865
70's and 80's and how 
the balls were involveed in 

00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:46.054
cultural?
          I think a lot of 

00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:49.421
people could probably 
tell us the same. If you can 

00:20:49.422 --> 00:20:52.394
remember like I can 
remember in the 70's, you can 

00:20:52.395 --> 00:20:55.396
remember, we had 
customers come in even before my

00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:58.831
 time at the company
company, they covered shoes with

00:20:59.387 --> 00:21:03.777
 disco ball material
material, we've had a bikini, 

00:21:03.778 --> 00:21:07.474
we've had just call 
kinds of different shapes, like 

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:12.723
she said, a lot of 
companies wanted to brand their 

00:21:12.724 --> 00:21:16.489
product and catch 
the eye of the public, and 

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.490
everyone thought it was 
so much fun. Every time you walk

00:21:18.705 --> 00:21:23.542
 into a ballroom or 
a high school promise, anything 

00:21:23.543 --> 00:21:26.673
that was -- that's 
from that day when you were 

00:21:26.674 --> 00:21:30.220
having the best time 
with family, friends, everybody

00:21:30.381 --> 00:21:35.440
's getting together, 
dancing, who doesn't love to 

00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:39.352
dance? Seriously, who 
doesn't feel happen when they 

00:21:39.353 --> 00:21:42.544
dance? I feel that 
disco ball brought that wow 

00:21:42.545 --> 00:21:46.295
person out of them, 
saying I'm going to uninhibited 

00:21:46.296 --> 00:21:48.726
right now and have V 
fun -- 

00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:51.403
          And skating 
relationships.

00:21:51.404 --> 00:21:53.832
          &gt;&gt; That's right. It's 
all a lot of fun 

00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:58.764
when you think about a disco 
ball. When someone's 

00:21:58.765 --> 00:22:03.389
hanging somebody wants to get 
underneath there and 

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.390
dance.
          Was there

00:22:07.474 --> 00:22:12.709
 a specific movie that brought 
our disco ball to start? John 

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.477
tray Volta.
          &gt;&gt; How did that happen

00:22:15.478 --> 00:22:18.083
? 
          We had a New York 

00:22:18.084 --> 00:22:22.894
representative, and he 
promoted our product for like 

00:22:22.895 --> 00:22:28.999
studio 54 and for 
Saturday night fever. We know 

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.543
soul train, the disco 
ball was shared with Johnny 

00:22:33.544 --> 00:22:37.715
Carson's studio, 
although I never saw it on 

00:22:37.716 --> 00:22:41.210
Johnnie Carson's show, 
but yeah, I think that movie. 

00:22:41.213 --> 00:22:47.765
And also we have other 
Vegas shows, that was a TV show,

00:22:48.009 --> 00:22:53.179
 we've had a lot of 
movie and production companies 

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.690
using it.
          And you're the only 

00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:59.538
company now that makes 
disco ball in the United States?

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:02.514
          As far as we know 
we've been the only 

00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:08.227
company, but we know of no other
 retrodisco ball 

00:23:08.228 --> 00:23:10.659
manufacturer.
          Where do companies get

00:23:11.628 --> 00:23:14.904
 disco balls if they 
don't go to your company? 

00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:17.023
          &gt;&gt; 
          Through distributors, 

00:23:17.024 --> 00:23:20.167
there's some in 
Texas and New York.

00:23:20.168 --> 00:23:22.168
          &gt;&gt; 
          They would go oversees

00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:26.658
 as well -- 
          Yeah, that companinged

00:23:26.659 --> 00:23:33.475
 our company -- once 
they receiveed -- once over sea 

00:23:33.476 --> 00:23:37.821
companies learned how 
to make a disco ball and more 

00:23:37.822 --> 00:23:42.108
checkly but not 
efficiently they just swapped 

00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:44.109
quality or

00:23:45.327 --> 00:23:47.057
 for 
quantity, which is is a shame, 

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:51.742
helps us in a way 
because they keep coming back --

00:23:52.141 --> 00:23:57.745
 although I had a 
customer say I need a new disco 

00:23:57.746 --> 00:24:02.564
ball motivate tor-- 
when it's made by us it's going 

00:24:02.565 --> 00:24:05.703
to last.
          Are there -- I think 

00:24:05.704 --> 00:24:08.926
of those big disco 
balls with the stars coming out 

00:24:08.927 --> 00:24:13.783
of them -- how does 
that work when have you some 

00:24:13.784 --> 00:24:17.927
famous movie star with 
balls that open up, do you make 

00:24:17.928 --> 00:24:22.477
them open up? No, 
the only thing I remember about 

00:24:22.478 --> 00:24:24.478
a star is Madonna

00:24:26.197 --> 00:24:26.228
.
          (APPLAUSE).

00:24:29.304 --> 00:24:33.849
Riding on that big disco ball --
 yeah, 

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.971
that's what I was thinking -- 
and it didn't break? 

00:24:36.972 --> 00:24:42.674
No, I make them good. Wow.
          What makes your balls 

00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:48.056
so unique? I think 
it's because it is a retrodisco 

00:24:48.057 --> 00:24:51.737
ball. It is that 
traditional disco -- you have 

00:24:51.738 --> 00:24:56.281
production companies 
for movies, Vegas they have 

00:24:56.282 --> 00:25:01.477
their own production 
companies that have made disco 

00:25:01.478 --> 00:25:09.243
balls with screens -- 
we make the traditional retro

00:25:09.244 --> 00:25:12.921
disco balls.
          Who is ordering disco 

00:25:12.922 --> 00:25:18.243
balls now? We have 
believe it or not, restaurants, 

00:25:18.244 --> 00:25:21.314
we sell to 
distribution, so we don't always

00:25:21.626 --> 00:25:25.858
 know where our 
disco balls go. We did open up 

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:31.034
some sales when NBC 
came in and interviewed us 

00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:36.477
because there was a 
strong interest -- Yolanda thank

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.752
 has gained global 
attention because everyone loves

00:25:40.115 --> 00:25:43.957
 her story, the 
longevity, the fact that she 

00:25:43.958 --> 00:25:47.503
loves what she's doing 
-- believe me, you cannot 

00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:52.554
imagine how fast she works
works. You can't imagine how 

00:25:52.555 --> 00:25:57.751
tedious she can be -- 
we make those clothes, she cuts 

00:25:57.752 --> 00:26:01.679
all the facets and 
puts then on the globe and 

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.009
they're beautiful, we 
have colored gones, custom made 

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.849
globes that have 
sand blasted company names on 

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:14.542
them it's tremendous 
what she does, hang on to the 

00:26:14.543 --> 00:26:18.374
hooks, she's really 
quite the craft person.

00:26:18.375 --> 00:26:21.382
          Thank you. You're 
welcome. 

00:26:21.383 --> 00:26:23.383
          (APPLAUSE).

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.626
You travel around the country or
 go to 

00:26:28.627 --> 00:26:34.740
other seminars or on TV do you 
run into other disco 

00:26:34.741 --> 00:26:37.278
ball that's you've made years 
ago? Yeah, several 

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:39.279
times

00:26:41.123 --> 00:26:45.270
. 
          It's all inline, and 

00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:50.201
then the -- 
          What is your 

00:26:50.202 --> 00:26:54.788
impression of how disco 
culture influence the American 

00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:56.789
pop culture over the 
years? 

00:27:00.887 --> 00:27:04.167
I think so too -- I think what 
happened -- 

00:27:04.168 --> 00:27:07.727
you probably all remember this 
too -- for a while in 

00:27:07.728 --> 00:27:11.564
the 60's people weren't dancing 
together, they were 

00:27:11.565 --> 00:27:15.092
doing all their thing, you can 
dance all by yourself

00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:18.960
yourself, when disco came back 
in and the partners 

00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:22.546
and ballroom dancing, the 
elegance of that and then 

00:27:22.547 --> 00:27:25.180
all of a sudden it got really --
 you got gymnast 

00:27:25.181 --> 00:27:29.595
sticks in there, you really had 
some talented people 

00:27:29.596 --> 00:27:32.429
come out and dancing and I think
 it's a wonderful 

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.316
art to watch.
          Well, thank you. And 

00:27:35.317 --> 00:27:41.121
now it's time for a 
surprise that Yolanda and Tony 

00:27:41.122 --> 00:27:43.846
have at the library 
of Congress. 

00:27:51.235 --> 00:27:55.639
Dr. Hayden -- your partner in 
crime. 

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:01.887
The one I mentioned we didn't 
coordinate this. But 

00:28:01.888 --> 00:28:07.478
we both knew what to wear. Great
 minds think alike. 

00:28:07.479 --> 00:28:09.479
Oh.

00:28:15.105 --> 00:28:18.094
Can you present it -- who's 
office is this 

00:28:18.095 --> 00:28:23.659
going to go in? That's what I 
asked. I -- do you got 

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:30.372
it? A real Yolanda disco ball 
with the library of 

00:28:30.373 --> 00:28:33.519
Congress on it. Yeah, it's -- 
that paint will 

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.015
someday on there.
          As you know I'll never

00:28:36.158 --> 00:28:37.888
 forget the belly 
dance.

00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:42.439
          You can see the belly 
dance. Where is it? 

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.836
Right here. It's four piece 
pieces together, it has 

00:28:46.837 --> 00:28:53.511
the cloth back, and we are 
sharing this sort of 

00:28:53.512 --> 00:28:57.051
people want to come and see how 
we make those. Can 

00:28:57.052 --> 00:29:01.043
you hold it? This is trying to 
give you the old 

00:29:01.044 --> 00:29:03.044
disco feel. 

00:29:08.733 --> 00:29:10.454
Thank you so much. Do you have 
it?

00:29:10.455 --> 00:29:13.005
          Well thank you for 
having us.

00:29:13.006 --> 00:29:15.006
          Thank you so much. 

00:29:23.564 --> 00:29:26.512
And it's for those of 
you that can't see it says 

00:29:26.513 --> 00:29:32.160
library of Congress with 
a logo here -- with a little 

00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:33.194
insignificant kneea on 
the side.

00:29:33.195 --> 00:29:36.498
          It's not that heavy --
 I mean it's heavy 

00:29:36.499 --> 00:29:40.723
-- it's not that heavy. It only 
weighs about 18 

00:29:40.724 --> 00:29:46.130
18 pounds. And Robert's holding 
it. If.

00:29:46.131 --> 00:29:49.669
          And you'll be giving 
demonstrations? 

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:54.243
Giving demonstrations? On how to
 cover a disco ball? 

00:29:54.244 --> 00:29:58.063
Well, we don't have any 
materials with us, I'm sorry

00:29:58.064 --> 00:30:00.459
sorry.
          Okay, you don't want 

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.361
to giveaway your 
trade secrets.

00:30:02.362 --> 00:30:06.927
          Thank you so much. I 
just want it thank 

00:30:06.928 --> 00:30:13.061
Yolanda and Tony for coming here
, once again on 

00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:17.628
their favorite day in Louisiana
ville Kentucky, the 

00:30:17.629 --> 00:30:19.629
Kentucky

00:30:20.977 --> 00:30:22.977
 derbi. 
          (APPLAUSE)

00:30:35.611 --> 00:30:37.177
 I thank all of you. As you know

00:30:37.178 --> 00:30:41.417
this is just the beginning of 
disco at the library 

00:30:41.418 --> 00:30:43.857
of Congress. So we hope you'll 
participate in some 

00:30:43.858 --> 00:30:48.595
of the other programs today. And
 I have to give a 

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:51.548
sneak preview. I'll be changing 
into different 

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:56.113
outfits.
          So, stay tuneed. Thank

00:30:56.114 --> 00:30:58.114
 you so much.

00:31:44.749 --> 00:31:47.739
          Hello everyone, it's 
such an honor to be 

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.698
here today in the presence of 
the disco ball -- that 

00:31:52.699 --> 00:31:58.438
iconic center piece for 
generations of us that were 

00:31:58.439 --> 00:32:00.549
danceing to.
          What I want to express

00:32:02.162 --> 00:32:07.630
 particular pleasure 
in the colors that sign through 

00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:11.627
in the fragmented 
mirrored glass. I want to 

00:32:11.628 --> 00:32:16.732
reflect some of the way in 
which the world's diverseity in 

00:32:16.733 --> 00:32:19.311
all the fragments is 
reflected in it.

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:23.185
          But first I want it 
take a quick moment to 

00:32:23.186 --> 00:32:26.395
thank some of the people that I 
couldn't be up here 

00:32:26.396 --> 00:32:32.685
without, particularly,wil who is
 a former colleague 

00:32:32.686 --> 00:32:37.390
of mine, who does a lot of 
interesting film work, 

00:32:37.391 --> 00:32:40.865
filming dancers around the world
 and was very much a 

00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:47.042
part of this project, and all 
the people working the 

00:32:47.043 --> 00:32:50.030
background, John doing audio and
 vision, everyone 

00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:54.983
here at the library and Congress
 -- and for the 

00:32:54.984 --> 00:33:00.041
invitation, it is an honor and 
I'm humbleed for the 

00:33:00.042 --> 00:33:03.228
opportunity to speak here today.
          Okay, about a third of

00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:06.516
 the ways through 
her track hold up on her 

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:08.517
fascinating

00:33:09.553 --> 00:33:13.042
 album released 
about a year ago, Beyonce 

00:33:13.043 --> 00:33:21.322
emerges on a -- from a 
scene on water on betrayal and 

00:33:21.323 --> 00:33:25.436
hopelessness. She in 
turns with a stock voice over, I

00:33:25.844 --> 00:33:30.411
 try to change. 
Close my mouth more, we hear the

00:33:30.507 --> 00:33:34.705
 weird sounds of 
audio reverse and reverb en

00:33:34.706 --> 00:33:39.349
companying this kind of 
manifesto. Is it a baptism, is 

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:44.357
it a drowning? Death? 
Rebirth? Perhaps it's death 

00:33:44.358 --> 00:33:52.607
because she pro claims I 
swallowed a sword. But then she 

00:33:52.608 --> 00:33:55.139
said immediately I 
was baptizeed in the river.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:00.430
          As it shifts into 
music two golden doors 

00:34:00.431 --> 00:34:06.518
open, perhaps a modern temple 
and she enters the 

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:11.783
music video as a singer -- water
 no longer drowning 

00:34:11.784 --> 00:34:16.496
her breaks through the door 
released like a rebirth.

00:34:32.408 --> 00:34:36.126
Getting to the many levels of 
what beian 

00:34:36.127 --> 00:34:39.553
say is doing is an extremely 
difficult to do, her 

00:34:39.554 --> 00:34:45.522
works are increaseingly 
sophisticated with endless 

00:34:45.523 --> 00:34:50.100
numbers of registers, this was 
about a women's 

00:34:50.101 --> 00:34:55.522
journal of self-knowledge and 
healing but they're so 

00:34:55.523 --> 00:35:03.428
to carebene practice practices, 
motherhood, film, 

00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:08.990
literature, daughter's of the 
dysin 1992, it indexes 

00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:11.580
so much of a bigger world, even 
that

00:35:15.453 --> 00:35:21.096
 ro beta ca vel
velly dress, the Aruba goddess 

00:35:21.097 --> 00:35:26.933
of love and fertility
fertility. Mother in the sweet 

00:35:26.934 --> 00:35:30.763
waters in Nigeria.
          Not only do we find 

00:35:30.764 --> 00:35:35.143
that reference in the 
dress but also in her recent 

00:35:35.144 --> 00:35:39.781
appearance as a pretty 
woman at the GRAMMYs. What the 

00:35:39.782 --> 00:35:45.274
dress signifyies is 
the flowing water following the 

00:35:45.275 --> 00:35:47.275
great goddess of

00:35:49.989 --> 00:35:54.924
place in the world, here 
I want to show it in that 

00:35:54.925 --> 00:36:01.138
Nigerian region, she's on 
the left where she's depicted as

00:36:01.882 --> 00:36:06.594
 a mirror made. On 
the left our lady of charity as 

00:36:06.595 --> 00:36:12.122
the ocean goddess in 
Havana, this was to celebrate 

00:36:12.123 --> 00:36:19.210
her 400 anniversary.
          It's known to heal the

00:36:19.406 --> 00:36:23.800
 sick and bring song 
and dance and fratilt and 

00:36:23.801 --> 00:36:29.938
prosperity. She is the 
protector of the poor and mother

00:36:30.036 --> 00:36:36.147
 of all orphans. It 
is clear that Beyonce say brings

00:36:36.543 --> 00:36:41.110
 down to her own 
living legacy. In 2015 she 

00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:47.669
donated 7 million for the 
apartments of a homeless shelter

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:52.374
 in Houston -- 
provides drug screening case 

00:36:52.375 --> 00:36:59.076
management and so on, 
and last month she initiated a 

00:36:59.077 --> 00:37:02.184
scholarship program 
for student films, these are the

00:37:02.906 --> 00:37:07.031
 formation scholars.
          But I want to draw 

00:37:07.032 --> 00:37:10.017
attention to something 
else, there's more going on than

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:13.267
 these realm 
interventions. 

00:37:16.426 --> 00:37:21.220
Beyonce takes the mother's 
susceptibility deeper -- we see 

00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:27.341
this in first two 
baptisms and what's interesting 

00:37:27.342 --> 00:37:30.639
about this is she 
focuses on the image as being 

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.177
able to tell a story. 
This is visual storytelling 

00:37:34.178 --> 00:37:38.017
instead of looking at 
the lyrics we're looking at the 

00:37:38.018 --> 00:37:44.278
image gray. Images 
one might say speak. And they 

00:37:44.279 --> 00:37:47.824
speak in ways that are 
not catchable in words. What I 

00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:51.217
want to show today 
it's not just images that speak 

00:37:51.218 --> 00:37:55.764
but also sounds, 
sound and rhythms, they speak. 

00:37:55.765 --> 00:37:58.501
So I want to draw 
particular attention to Beyonce

00:37:59.763 --> 00:38:02.904
's ongoing perception 
with African

00:38:06.593 --> 00:38:09.442
 rhythms -- these take us into 
the 

00:38:09.443 --> 00:38:13.106
global framework for her music.
          But let's go back a 

00:38:13.107 --> 00:38:17.268
few years, to that 
moment in the middle of the 

00:38:17.269 --> 00:38:24.497
Obama years when beian 
say was still rising in her 

00:38:24.498 --> 00:38:28.306
stature, ranging from 
the Super Bowl to the singer of 

00:38:28.307 --> 00:38:31.788
the National Anthem 
at the principle inauguration. I

00:38:32.034 --> 00:38:36.875
 want to play a song 
from that period, to remind us 

00:38:36.876 --> 00:38:38.876
of that time. 

00:38:46.435 --> 00:38:48.435
          (MUSIC)

00:40:04.919 --> 00:40:06.646
.
          I'll stop the song 

00:40:06.647 --> 00:40:11.737
there, to a striking 
image where I'll return. In 2011

00:40:11.738 --> 00:40:16.282
 it was called run 
the world girls. Musically 

00:40:16.283 --> 00:40:18.283
speaking we can talk 
about

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.576
 electric function, soul, and 
elements of near 

00:40:24.577 --> 00:40:28.851
disco. The meaning of the song 
is what perhaps is 

00:40:28.852 --> 00:40:33.102
least argued about, it is 
official according to the 

00:40:33.103 --> 00:40:41.185
account of promoting female em
pourlett. In her words 

00:40:41.186 --> 00:40:44.172
I think of saying the things 
that women want to say 

00:40:44.173 --> 00:40:46.846
but sometimes are not confident 
to say, I'm going to 

00:40:46.847 --> 00:40:50.994
continue to write the song 
that's give women 

00:40:50.995 --> 00:40:54.281
strength. And all the way across
 of the spectrum, 

00:40:54.282 --> 00:41:00.008
there's a basic agreement that 
this is about female 

00:41:00.009 --> 00:41:03.815
empowerment. It was also the 
song that woke up the 

00:41:03.816 --> 00:41:11.010
final mission of the Atlantis, 
and it initiateed a 

00:41:11.011 --> 00:41:14.934
period where I work of people 
beginning to study 

00:41:14.935 --> 00:41:21.705
this phenomenal called Beyonce. 
There was a syllabus 

00:41:21.706 --> 00:41:26.647
that connected her to black 
message for social 

00:41:26.648 --> 00:41:31.443
change, and Beyonce say.
          So the message of the 

00:41:31.444 --> 00:41:33.641
song seems quite 
clear but let's go to the music,

00:41:33.796 --> 00:41:35.512
 what's going on in 
the music?

00:41:35.513 --> 00:41:38.615
          And here, I want to 
draw attention to the 

00:41:38.616 --> 00:41:41.892
fact that a couple of days ago I
 gave a talk about 

00:41:41.893 --> 00:41:47.948
the way in which American music 
from fun and soul to 

00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:52.403
mow town and disco and so on is 
deriveed in large 

00:41:52.404 --> 00:41:56.714
measure from African music, pro-
african American 

00:41:56.715 --> 00:41:59.539
music and African

00:42:02.692 --> 00:42:05.515
 Caribbean, -- today I want to 
tell 

00:42:05.516 --> 00:42:09.281
that story would call the social
 life of a sound by 

00:42:09.282 --> 00:42:13.110
looking at some of the details 
of Beyonce's song.

00:42:13.111 --> 00:42:15.373
          Let's start with

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:23.016
 bell pattern --
          Where does that come 

00:42:23.017 --> 00:42:27.725
from? It's a block 
party invitation, a summons to 

00:42:27.726 --> 00:42:33.845
come to an event and 
has that strange recorder Mickey

00:42:33.855 --> 00:42:41.650
 mouseing it. And as 
the music enters it erupts into 

00:42:41.651 --> 00:42:45.892
the supreme being, 
Beyonce is alive also drawing on

00:42:46.895 --> 00:42:48.653
 a standard cab ray 
move.

00:42:48.654 --> 00:42:54.875
          But the track itself 
is track upon the 

00:42:54.876 --> 00:43:01.010
floor from an album called guns 
don't kill people, 

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:07.803
lay sers do.
          A white D J from floor

00:43:07.809 --> 00:43:12.334
, and he is -- he 
was first became more popularize

00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:18.616
ed when he wrote 
paper planes for MI A which is

00:43:21.755 --> 00:43:25.146
 the sock from slum 
dog millionaire.

00:43:25.147 --> 00:43:29.690
          This was in 2010 
before Beyonce decideed to 

00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:34.952
use it for the center track for 
girls run the world.

00:43:34.953 --> 00:43:38.933
          To give you some 
examples how it was 

00:43:38.934 --> 00:43:44.673
circulating -- here is the 
rendition of it called 

00:43:44.674 --> 00:43:46.674
upon me. 
          (MUSIC)

00:44:05.124 --> 00:44:07.124
.
          Sorry to cut did T off

00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:12.380
 but we need to 
cover a bit more ground. This is

00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:17.456
 directly related to 
the typical sound to gentleman 

00:44:17.457 --> 00:44:24.333
makeian music, called 
version or my colleague, Michael

00:44:25.316 --> 00:44:29.061
 calls the rhythm 
method. This way there's a dance

00:44:29.068 --> 00:44:33.556
 track that 
circulates among different D J's

00:44:33.566 --> 00:44:37.997
 and they repurpose 
it in different contacts or rape

00:44:38.005 --> 00:44:38.976
 over it in 
different ways.

00:44:38.977 --> 00:44:45.089
          The tradition of re
purposeing existing tech 

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:50.052
technology, weather face the 
turn table, had a long 

00:44:50.053 --> 00:44:56.010
legacy in Jamaica. I want to 
push it further to 19

00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:59.455
19th century, we listen closely 
to the track, it 

00:44:59.456 --> 00:45:05.269
was -- it also had a drum 
influence, and it was 

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:11.406
probably mediateed by a D J 
called after fro Jack, 

00:45:11.407 --> 00:45:18.669
and he was drawing on a dance 
style. It's known as 

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:24.641
ca check o, it's played at 45 
beats per minute and 

00:45:24.642 --> 00:45:30.861
it has draws on the tradition 
style inflected with 

00:45:30.862 --> 00:45:32.985
marching rhythms in the colonial
 time.

00:45:32.986 --> 00:45:37.255
          This is interesting 
because during this 

00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:41.676
time you had black bands playing
 in military bands 

00:45:41.677 --> 00:45:45.529
as part of the colonial regime 
but they shifted it 

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:50.078
in a way to reflect their own 
music. That's where it 

00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:55.046
comes in we might call it.
          Here's a typical track

00:45:55.896 --> 00:46:02.689
 of the bubbleing 
music -- and this is D J Chucky,

00:46:02.735 --> 00:46:07.328
 probably one of the 
most prominent D J's.

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:09.329
          (MUSIC)

00:46:23.062 --> 00:46:25.845
.
          Now let's go to 

00:46:25.846 --> 00:46:30.193
Johannesburg in South 
Africa. Here I'm going to show 

00:46:30.194 --> 00:46:34.435
you a short clip 
called real actions -- in this 

00:46:34.436 --> 00:46:38.440
case this is probably 
our most group at the moment -- 

00:46:38.441 --> 00:46:41.831
I'll tell you more 
about them. Let's watch how they

00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:44.861
 move. 

00:46:47.002 --> 00:46:49.662
          (VIDEO) 

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:03.467
As you see, this is quite low 
stepping but 

00:47:03.468 --> 00:47:08.175
quick low to etground kind of 
urban street culture 

00:47:08.176 --> 00:47:16.522
that has origins in South Africa
 -- quick steps steps

00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:20.360
 je 
met federal lines -- the word 

00:47:20.361 --> 00:47:25.065
itself means to badel 
like a duck, and if you move 

00:47:25.066 --> 00:47:33.167
like a duck you'll move 
like flat footed tap and glide 

00:47:33.168 --> 00:47:36.295
with the buttocks out
out. Often dance moves follow 

00:47:36.296 --> 00:47:43.683
the metaphors of daily 
life, called meta, meta, which 

00:47:43.684 --> 00:47:46.677
means putting butyron 
bread.

00:47:46.678 --> 00:47:55.569
          Beyonce's coronograph,
 she went across the 

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.570
border to another

00:47:59.613 --> 00:48:05.516
 -- shaking the body. This is 
another of what they're doing 

00:48:05.517 --> 00:48:10.887
and in some ways 
looked down by being a 

00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:14.214
derivative itself.
          Here is the connection

00:48:14.222 --> 00:48:18.306
 between what 
Beyonce found on a You Tube clip

00:48:18.313 --> 00:48:22.561
 and then the 
relationship that takes to the 

00:48:22.562 --> 00:48:24.320
corrography in the 
video. 

00:48:24.321 --> 00:48:26.321
          (VIDEO) 

00:48:32.995 --> 00:48:36.613
It's a slightly little different

00:48:36.614 --> 00:48:38.608
referal but we'll get to that 
the other one in a 

00:48:38.609 --> 00:48:40.609
minute.
                    (VIDEO) 

00:49:33.485 --> 00:49:38.185
Okay, I'm cutting it a little 
short so we can get into this in

00:49:38.596 --> 00:49:41.579
 much more detail. I 
want to show you one small 

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:45.574
detail in the dance, 
there's many different styles 

00:49:45.575 --> 00:49:52.503
some are called we 
were style, there's few Tuesdaya

00:49:52.507 --> 00:49:56.805
, and they're doing 
more of the style where the arms

00:49:56.959 --> 00:50:02.669
 are wrapped tightly 
around the torso -- this was

00:50:05.784 --> 00:50:07.784
 tricky and Beyonce say 
had the

00:50:10.044 --> 00:50:12.583
 dancers felony out because they
 couldn't get 

00:50:12.584 --> 00:50:16.418
the relaxed feeling together. 
Real actions were not 

00:50:16.419 --> 00:50:20.247
that happy about this, they 
thought that toe few, 

00:50:20.248 --> 00:50:27.799
toe few butyrtheir culture done,
 that this was not 

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.539
the original dance, they existed
 a certain kind of 

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.349
pride from someone as great as 
Beyonce. But now I 

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:40.195
want to make one brief -- what 
about the imagery, 

00:50:40.196 --> 00:50:45.156
the bulls, the hyena and the 
lion, where do they 

00:50:45.157 --> 00:50:50.562
come from? This striking scene 
which is hidden from 

00:50:50.563 --> 00:50:56.486
the chain on her right hand, 
it's the capital of 

00:50:56.487 --> 00:50:59.811
Georgia which was not 
controversial because the 

00:50:59.812 --> 00:51:06.580
Israelis had just shut down that
 region. What do the 

00:51:06.581 --> 00:51:12.062
has evenna's mean -- they're 
like invocations of 

00:51:12.063 --> 00:51:15.751
advertising for colonial 
European tourism back in 

00:51:15.752 --> 00:51:21.590
the days of Rhodesia.
          One might say maybe 

00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:23.591
because they're

00:51:24.721 --> 00:51:30.149
 -- 
here's what he has to say about 

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.979
them --
          (VIDEO) 

00:51:59.235 --> 00:52:05.687
But the true reference is the ar
artis particular photo 

00:52:05.688 --> 00:52:12.758
journalism of Peter Hugo, a 
South African photographer who 

00:52:12.759 --> 00:52:16.342
trophies people 
around the world, blind people, 

00:52:16.343 --> 00:52:19.173
aids victims in 
their cough minutes and so on. 

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:25.161
This is edgey 
photography and Beyonce say has 

00:52:25.162 --> 00:52:34.574
this imagery -- the 
one you see here, performed with

00:52:35.677 --> 00:52:41.090
 hyena's and other 
animals to entertain crowds to 

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:45.968
make music with them 
and sell traditional medicines. 

00:52:45.969 --> 00:52:48.178
 Here's a few more 
of these striking images.

00:52:48.179 --> 00:52:51.523
          What's interesting 
about them in south 

00:52:51.524 --> 00:52:56.580
Africa there's been a long 
history of critical 

00:52:56.581 --> 00:53:01.144
realism in South Africa 
documentary that dates back 

00:53:01.145 --> 00:53:06.533
to the Bangladesh club, 
photographers who were 

00:53:06.534 --> 00:53:11.956
involveed and go into dangerous 
regions to take 

00:53:11.957 --> 00:53:19.027
photographers, Kevin Carter 
committed suicide, he 

00:53:19.028 --> 00:53:26.748
took an image of Ethiopian child
, he found himself 

00:53:26.749 --> 00:53:30.270
in controversial and a few 
months later he was dead.

00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:36.306
          Trying to private 
advertise -- I approach 

00:53:36.307 --> 00:53:40.068
photographer with a keen aware
ness and pointing the 

00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:43.207
camera at anything.
          Just to be clear a 

00:53:43.208 --> 00:53:46.900
year before the release 
of girls return the world, there

00:53:46.901 --> 00:53:53.015
 was an exhibition 
of permanent error, 2009 to 2010

00:53:53.016 --> 00:53:57.015
 which was driving 
home the darker side, looking at

00:53:58.032 --> 00:54:02.283
 a picture -- where 
he was looking at the way in 

00:54:02.284 --> 00:54:08.579
which digital circulate
circulates in the world, one of 

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:14.519
the deep sadness of 
digital life span, they begin in

00:54:14.521 --> 00:54:19.938
 Africa -- often 
under very severe conditions and

00:54:20.178 --> 00:54:24.778
 find their way back 
when we dump our waste back in 

00:54:24.779 --> 00:54:29.509
Africa. Here you see 
the toxic waste dump where 

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.734
people are trying to 
extract living out of this 

00:54:32.735 --> 00:54:37.271
misguided policy of 
shipping millions of tons of 

00:54:37.272 --> 00:54:38.842
obsolete materials in 
that direction.

00:54:38.843 --> 00:54:45.782
          When his response was 
raised, said he was 

00:54:45.783 --> 00:54:51.034
not sure if it fit N into the 
song but felt the 

00:54:51.035 --> 00:54:54.490
hyena men might be looking for 
conversation for some 

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.296
of their efforts in that 
production.

00:54:56.297 --> 00:55:00.602
          I want to make one 
final point before 

00:55:00.603 --> 00:55:05.549
closing for today because it's a
 purely musical 

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:09.952
point, we spoke about the way 
the drum that's were 

00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:14.514
brought in was referenceing this
 ca lip so style, we 

00:55:14.515 --> 00:55:20.219
got to the African Caribbean 
world, what you -- what 

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.770
you find in the large scale 
media, the next step, 

00:55:23.771 --> 00:55:27.746
where did that come from -- I 
want to draw attention 

00:55:27.747 --> 00:55:31.706
to these pattern that's are 
being drawn on that goes 

00:55:31.707 --> 00:55:33.707
like this --

00:55:36.732 --> 00:55:40.965
 forward pattern, if I put a 
beat to it 

00:55:40.966 --> 00:55:46.783
would be something like this -- 
          Okay -- that is very 

00:55:46.784 --> 00:55:51.451
strikingly, if you 
speed up that pattern a little 

00:55:51.452 --> 00:55:54.517
bit you get precisely 
that open track.

00:56:09.543 --> 00:56:12.284
Okay. Now where does that sound 
come from? 

00:56:12.285 --> 00:56:18.952
We know it as being associated 
with the song -- I 

00:56:18.953 --> 00:56:22.938
want to return it back to the 
origins which is back 

00:56:22.939 --> 00:56:27.188
in Africa, the way you feel that
 pattern in Africa 

00:56:27.189 --> 00:56:30.020
is just a little bit different 
-- instead of -- you 

00:56:30.021 --> 00:56:36.004
play it this way -- now you will
 hear in some ways 

00:56:36.005 --> 00:56:39.737
all I'm doing is play ago 
pattern a little bit more 

00:56:39.738 --> 00:56:45.407
slowly but in fact, I'm put play
ing it in a 

00:56:45.408 --> 00:56:47.691
different pulse -- if I'm play
ing this one and it's 

00:56:47.692 --> 00:56:49.692
going -- and the other one --

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:58.362
 the one is going -- 
one two, one, two, one two, -- 

00:56:58.363 --> 00:57:01.916
one two, three, one 
two three, one two three --

00:57:05.887 --> 00:57:09.439
 one two three, one two 
three, one two three, one two 

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.972
three, and it's the 
change or transformation of time

00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:17.528
 in three's to 
benigny time that I would like 

00:57:17.529 --> 00:57:21.395
to note in my closing 
arcs -- where does this pattern 

00:57:21.396 --> 00:57:24.513
come from? It's hard 
to find a region in Africa where

00:57:24.817 --> 00:57:27.639
 it doesn't play a 
role -- but I'm going to play 

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:33.456
you one of the typical 
bell pattern that's is associate

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:37.309
ed with a bell 
instrument with two tones, and 

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:43.980
is part of an 
ensemble and here's the way in 

00:57:43.981 --> 00:57:47.288
slow motion that that 
particular bell pattern sounds.

00:57:47.289 --> 00:57:49.289
          (MUSIC)

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:57.944
.
          Seven strokes before 

00:57:57.945 --> 00:58:03.986
it begins again. One, 
two, three, four five, six, 

00:58:03.987 --> 00:58:08.471
search one --
          Okay, if I play a 

00:58:08.472 --> 00:58:11.002
second part, and I'm 
going to have to demonstrate 

00:58:11.003 --> 00:58:16.702
this quickly -- here is 
the bell pattern -- I play all 

00:58:16.703 --> 00:58:20.412
the spaces in between 
that which is what your ensemble

00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:23.521
 will do -- 

00:58:30.375 --> 00:58:34.610
That is what will become the 
pattern as it 

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:39.010
crosses over into the African 
carebene.

00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:43.300
          Within this particular
 ensemble it's 

00:58:43.301 --> 00:58:47.859
embedded. One way in which we 
find a transformation 

00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:52.265
taking place is that instead of 
adhereing that time, 

00:58:52.266 --> 00:58:56.514
we hear it in beanery time, 
what's striking about 

00:58:56.515 --> 00:58:59.823
the African version is you can 
hear that pattern in 

00:58:59.824 --> 00:59:05.396
any of many ways -- if I play it
 again I'm going to 

00:59:05.397 --> 00:59:08.452
beat out different quote, 
unquote drum beats against 

00:59:08.453 --> 00:59:10.453
it.

00:59:20.859 --> 00:59:28.091
Or -- -- or --
          Or -- 

00:59:33.909 --> 00:59:37.498
Okay. What's interesting about 
it is it's 

00:59:37.499 --> 00:59:43.464
organized in such a way that it 
can train our bodybodys 

00:59:43.465 --> 00:59:46.610
in any of different time 
signatures at the same time

00:59:46.611 --> 00:59:49.431
time.
          The structure of it is

00:59:49.878 --> 00:59:52.263
 long, long short, 
long, long short -- a little bit

00:59:52.825 --> 00:59:56.113
 like the structure 
of the white notes on the piano,

00:59:56.268 --> 01:00:01.212
 where you have tone
tone, half tone, tone tone tone,

01:00:01.226 --> 01:00:05.793
 half tone -- and 
it's the ambiguity -- it's lost 

01:00:05.794 --> 01:00:10.479
when it moves over 
into the African Caribbean and 

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:15.077
begins something more 
shoe honored in benignry time, 

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:19.308
it's the small lust 
when we look more depth into 

01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:24.208
what's at stake 
globally into all these music 

01:00:24.209 --> 01:00:30.254
that's take us 
sometimes to sad places such as 

01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:33.132
the toxic waste dump 
site and the time signature 

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:37.332
that's a little less 
than it was in its origin. Okay,

01:00:38.352 --> 01:00:40.062
 thank you very much
much. 

01:00:40.063 --> 01:00:42.063
          (APPLAUSE).

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:21.019
Hello?
          Are you out there?

01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:33.814
My name is bill Bernstein, I'm a

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:38.206
photographer, and I'm beyond 
honored to be here at 

01:01:38.207 --> 01:01:40.326
the library of Congress in 
Washington D.C..

01:01:40.327 --> 01:01:46.602
          And I wanted to thank 
Dr. Hayden, I think 

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:49.432
Dr. Hayden's here but thank you 
for opening up the 

01:01:49.433 --> 01:01:53.437
library of Congress to this kind
 of crazyiness.

01:01:53.438 --> 01:01:58.160
          It's refreshing, I 
think.

01:01:58.161 --> 01:02:05.214
          I wanted to just talk 
about my experience 

01:02:05.215 --> 01:02:09.781
with the disco culture.
          I photographerred 

01:02:09.782 --> 01:02:14.785
disco from 1977 to 1979, 
and

01:02:18.364 --> 01:02:22.180
 I was thrown into this culture,
 I'll give a 

01:02:22.181 --> 01:02:24.844
little background about myself. 
I was born in the 50

01:02:24.845 --> 01:02:31.726
50's, I was one of the Woodstock
 generation, the 

01:02:31.727 --> 01:02:34.269
first bug cultural phenomena 
that I remember as a 

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:39.111
kid is when the beetles came 
over to the America on 

01:02:39.112 --> 01:02:42.907
the Ed Sullivan show and that 
for me kind kind of 

01:02:42.908 --> 01:02:47.955
changed everything. I got a 
musician, I got a set 

01:02:47.956 --> 01:02:52.021
oflag wig drums and played in a 
rock band in high 

01:02:52.022 --> 01:02:56.571
school. I guess my culture as a 
young man was kind 

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:59.708
of the hippie culture, although 
I wasn't a 

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:04.836
full-fledged hippie, but that 
was kind of where I 

01:03:04.837 --> 01:03:07.395
came from.
          So, we were, you know,

01:03:07.794 --> 01:03:14.795
 anti-war, we were 
mostly white, middle class, long

01:03:14.802 --> 01:03:19.650
 haired, suburban, a 
lot of us, I got

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:25.911
 tear gassed in the mallike 
right 

01:03:25.912 --> 01:03:29.867
down the extrastreet here in 
1970 when I was protest

01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:35.547
protesting the war, anyway, 
after I got out of 

01:03:35.548 --> 01:03:37.942
College I decideed to become a 
photographer, and this 

01:03:37.943 --> 01:03:41.538
was in the 70's and the first 
place that would hire 

01:03:41.539 --> 01:03:44.928
me I guess was the village voice
 in New York City.

01:03:44.929 --> 01:03:49.639
          And this was in about 
1976.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.459
          And so, I was 
photographerring a lot of 

01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:01.616
street photography and portraits
 thanks kinds of 

01:04:01.617 --> 01:04:07.010
thing. One night I was assigned 
to go to studio 54 

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:09.828
to photographerphotography

01:04:14.618 --> 01:04:22.063
 Jimmy Carter's' mother, 
and I had never been to studio 

01:04:22.064 --> 01:04:25.550
54 before and I had 
no interest in going -- I had a 

01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:31.451
curiosity but I was 
not a big fan of disco music, 

01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:35.958
and at that time, my 
rock station in New York over 

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:37.982
night turned from rock 
to all disco.

01:04:37.983 --> 01:04:41.842
          And a lot of people 
were a little bit 

01:04:41.843 --> 01:04:44.516
confused and not happy with that
.

01:04:44.517 --> 01:04:48.163
          So I was he will well 
aware of the fact 

01:04:48.164 --> 01:04:52.362
that disco was happening and I 
saw Saturday night 

01:04:52.363 --> 01:04:56.322
fever which came out in 1977, 
and it was a phenomena 

01:04:56.323 --> 01:05:04.162
that was occurring, and I 
consider myself a photo 

01:05:04.163 --> 01:05:07.685
journalist, a portrait 
photographer and a culture 

01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:11.121
anthropologist, I like to get 
involveed in different 

01:05:11.122 --> 01:05:13.270
cultures, and look at them and

01:05:17.515 --> 01:05:20.780
 photograph them -- 
disco was its own culture.

01:05:20.781 --> 01:05:25.330
          I was sent to studio 
54, and this is what 

01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:28.467
it looked like for me outside --
 it was a very 

01:05:28.468 --> 01:05:32.579
difficult place to get into -- 
it opened up in 77, 

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:36.320
and it was always -- they 
started the vel vet rope 

01:05:36.321 --> 01:05:39.570
policy where people would stand 
outside and be 

01:05:39.571 --> 01:05:44.269
chosen based on -- I'm not 
exactly sure what -- but 

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:49.939
I know if you were a celebrity 
you had a good chance 

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.514
getting in, I didn't all but you
 had a good chance.

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:56.049
          So this is what I saw 
the first night that 

01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:03.333
I got there. And when I walked 
inside this is what I 

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.334
encountered. 

01:06:11.283 --> 01:06:13.247
And I never seen anything like 
this 

01:06:13.248 --> 01:06:15.969
before -- when I was shooting on
 the street or a 

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:18.972
portrait I would have the person
 all to myself, so 

01:06:18.973 --> 01:06:27.201
this was the word -- the word 
paparazzi was the word 

01:06:27.202 --> 01:06:30.679
back in 1977 and here they are 
and they're on top of 

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.436
each other, to me, as a 
photographer this was more 

01:06:34.437 --> 01:06:37.897
being a shot than what they were
 shooting.

01:06:37.898 --> 01:06:43.551
          But that's what they 
were shooting, that 

01:06:43.552 --> 01:06:48.712
ice Mrs. Carter, sitting next to
 Andy war hole and 

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:51.638
that's the shot that the village
 sent me to get 

01:06:51.639 --> 01:06:54.628
which I got.
          Then after the event 

01:06:54.629 --> 01:06:58.783
was over that I would 
-- I would stay because I didn't

01:06:58.784 --> 01:07:02.217
 know if I could 
ever get back in again.

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:10.560
          So, I bought ten rows 
of film from a 

01:07:10.561 --> 01:07:14.407
photographer, from one of those 
guys, and I 

01:07:14.408 --> 01:07:21.407
basically hung out in the shadow
s up in the balance 

01:07:21.408 --> 01:07:25.079
doe, so I didn't get kicked out 
and we waited for 

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.415
the regular crowd to come in. 
Put all the talk table

01:07:28.416 --> 01:07:31.361
tables away abcleaned up and the
 regular crowd came 

01:07:31.362 --> 01:07:34.343
in.
          And, this is really 

01:07:34.344 --> 01:07:38.438
one of the very first 
pictures that I took that night 

01:07:38.439 --> 01:07:43.861
in 77, this was in 
December of 77. Studio 54 had 

01:07:43.862 --> 01:07:47.698
opened I think about a 
month or two before that -- 

01:07:47.699 --> 01:07:55.896
studio 54 was open from 
77 to 79. Which is like -- two 

01:07:55.897 --> 01:07:56.502
and a half years, 
something like that.

01:07:56.503 --> 01:07:59.496
          When I tell people 
that they can't believe 

01:07:59.497 --> 01:08:02.472
it because they think it was 
opened for ten years, 

01:08:02.473 --> 01:08:05.903
but it was a very, very short 
period of time. When 

01:08:05.904 --> 01:08:11.420
it was owned by city and Erin, 
who were the original 

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:16.281
creates of studio 54.
          This is the first 

01:08:16.282 --> 01:08:19.000
picture that I took 
after you are took this shot for

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:22.809
 the village voice.
          And I was take this 

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.795
picture, I think this 
is the only real frame that I 

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:28.927
got. I got a couple of 
pictures of heme from the back 

01:08:28.928 --> 01:08:31.768
and then I asked if I 
could shoot them and I shot this

01:08:32.059 --> 01:08:36.473
 and then went on to 
shoot something else. It really 

01:08:36.474 --> 01:08:42.501
stuck in my mind 
because it reminded me of a pre

01:08:42.543 --> 01:08:47.987
war Berlin Cabernet 
ray -- I remember seeing the 

01:08:47.988 --> 01:08:52.395
review Cabernet ray, 
the gender biological weaponsing

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:56.333
, under tone, gay 
earn tone, and

01:08:59.933 --> 01:09:05.032
 said omasochistic, a lot of 
things 

01:09:05.033 --> 01:09:07.476
popped into my mind when I 
photographerred this 

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:10.462
couple. I started looking around
, this was later 

01:09:10.463 --> 01:09:16.922
that night, and I would see all 
these images of this 

01:09:16.923 --> 01:09:21.285
prewar Berlin Cabernet ray sort 
of thing.

01:09:21.286 --> 01:09:24.657
          This is a group that 
was -- they came in 

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:26.934
all together and through the 
course of the night 

01:09:26.935 --> 01:09:30.645
they would dance together, guys 
would dance with the 

01:09:30.646 --> 01:09:34.631
guys, sometimes the two guys 
would sandwich the girl 

01:09:34.632 --> 01:09:36.752
on the dance floor.
          I didn't know who was 

01:09:36.753 --> 01:09:40.207
who or what was what 
with them, but they were like 

01:09:40.208 --> 01:09:43.340
this group that hung 
out together. And there were in 

01:09:43.341 --> 01:09:46.655
this own little 
bubble. And I kept an eye out on

01:09:46.658 --> 01:09:51.163
 them.
          When they got on the 

01:09:51.164 --> 01:09:54.100
couch like this, I 
was across the floor, I thought 

01:09:54.101 --> 01:09:57.092
that was an 
interesting picture, so I sort 

01:09:57.093 --> 01:10:01.246
of hopeed I could get 
across the floor with my camera 

01:10:01.247 --> 01:10:03.924
without them moving, 
without them getting up and 

01:10:03.925 --> 01:10:08.318
leaving, which I did, 
and I walked over and snapped a 

01:10:08.319 --> 01:10:09.890
couple of shots and 
that was it.

01:10:09.891 --> 01:10:13.731
          And people can asked 
me if this was posed. 

01:10:13.732 --> 01:10:17.467
It was not posed at all. They 
were posing but not 

01:10:17.468 --> 01:10:20.162
for me. They were posing before 
I got there. 

01:10:20.163 --> 01:10:23.406
          And it's like almost 
like they felt like 

01:10:23.407 --> 01:10:25.831
as I watched them that night 
that they were the star

01:10:25.832 --> 01:10:32.089
stars of the evening.
          And they had this ora 

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:35.543
about them, and they 
were in this little bubble.

01:10:35.544 --> 01:10:41.074
          I those at the very 
beginning when I went 

01:10:41.075 --> 01:10:46.873
to studio 54 not to photograph 
celebrityies, it was 

01:10:46.874 --> 01:10:49.302
an early decision, and the 
reason I did that was a 

01:10:49.303 --> 01:10:52.142
couple of reasons -- first of 
all, everybody was 

01:10:52.143 --> 01:10:56.537
shooting at celebrityies, and 
that's what 

01:10:56.538 --> 01:11:00.375
photographers were doing at 
places like studio 54, 

01:11:00.376 --> 01:11:02.716
and they were all kind of 
getting the same shot.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:08.079
          So I thought, if I 
want to shoot a 

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.930
celebrities, I want them in my 
studio with myelitis

01:11:11.931 --> 01:11:16.066
myelitissing and I want to talk 
to them and interact

01:11:16.067 --> 01:11:19.143
interact, and get a picture, get
 something that I 

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:22.639
want to get.
          And not just sort of 

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.167
snap a picture of 
them sitting on a couch.

01:11:24.168 --> 01:11:28.959
          So I decided that I 
didn't want to shoot 

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.512
celebrityies, but I thought what
 was more interesting 

01:11:33.513 --> 01:11:37.514
were the people that went there.
          And the people who 

01:11:37.515 --> 01:11:39.515
liveed the disco life. 

01:11:42.615 --> 01:11:46.060
And I started to see things also
 -- this looks like 

01:11:46.061 --> 01:11:52.425
a transgender woman with a sort 
of straight Wall 

01:11:52.426 --> 01:11:56.989
Street banker type guy, and I 
started to realize 

01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:59.266
there was something really 
interesting going on at 

01:11:59.267 --> 01:12:03.407
disco -- I wasn't exactly sure 
what it was -- it 

01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:06.418
wasn't Chris tall clear in my 
mind but I felt 

01:12:06.419 --> 01:12:11.208
there's something really 
interesting here from a 

01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:13.501
being frisk point of view and a 
culture point of 

01:12:13.502 --> 01:12:18.185
view. And it was this freedom of
 expression, this 

01:12:18.186 --> 01:12:25.719
openness, acceptness, inclusion,
 I I've never seen 

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:31.145
before -- what was happening was
 -- what was 

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:35.303
happening is during the 60's and
 early 70's it was 

01:12:35.304 --> 01:12:37.304
the

01:12:38.362 --> 01:12:43.080
 women's right's movement, the L
GBT movement, all 

01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:49.045
of these movements sort of came 
together at the same 

01:12:49.046 --> 01:12:53.286
time disco happened and disco 
was the place for all 

01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:57.226
of these different movements to 
go and have one 

01:12:57.227 --> 01:12:59.511
regular describe as a victory 
dance.

01:12:59.512 --> 01:13:05.542
          So, they were all 
there in union sen 

01:13:05.543 --> 01:13:11.094
having their victory dance.
          I never seen anything 

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:13.980
like this.
          I'm coming from the 

01:13:13.981 --> 01:13:16.741
Woodstock generation.
          If you go back and 

01:13:16.742 --> 01:13:20.056
stake a look at the 
movie Woodstock, you can 

01:13:20.057 --> 01:13:22.875
probably counsel on one 
hand how many African Americans 

01:13:22.876 --> 01:13:26.720
there are in the 
audience. There they're all 

01:13:26.721 --> 01:13:30.859
mostly white, white hair
haired middle class kids. Most 

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:35.265
of the entertainers 
were African American or 

01:13:35.266 --> 01:13:38.812
Hispanic, but the audience 
itself was not like this kind of

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:42.502
 inclusion. You 
didn't see that many transgender

01:13:43.362 --> 01:13:46.257
s in the Woodstock 
movie.

01:13:46.258 --> 01:13:51.615
          So, this was all 
completely new to me -- 

01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:56.064
it was just -- I was just -- my 
eyes were bug you go 

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:58.896
out of my head by what I was see
ing.

01:13:58.897 --> 01:14:04.972
          It seemed like a place
 of freedom of 

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:10.274
expression -- and be who you 
want to be.

01:14:19.485 --> 01:14:22.414
And it was young, old, and this 
was a 

01:14:22.415 --> 01:14:26.717
particular interesting character
, named roller 

01:14:26.718 --> 01:14:32.576
regiona, and and she had this 
gown, I guess it is -- 

01:14:32.577 --> 01:14:37.283
and the glasses and the hat and 
this magic wand, and 

01:14:37.284 --> 01:14:40.118
roll 
roller skates.

01:14:40.119 --> 01:14:42.971
          And he was affix chew 
in

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.052
 green itch 
village, you would see him all 

01:14:48.053 --> 01:14:51.246
the time roller 
skating around and he would 

01:14:51.247 --> 01:14:52.212
bless you where his wand
wand.

01:14:52.213 --> 01:14:54.752
          And he was affix cure 
at

01:14:59.433 --> 01:15:05.883
 the big discos,?  
^ Is disco Sally. Who was I 

01:15:05.884 --> 01:15:10.146
believe in her mid-70's 
-- she was a lawyer and her 

01:15:10.147 --> 01:15:13.306
husband was a lawyer and 
her husband died and she was 

01:15:13.307 --> 01:15:16.940
left alone and heart 
broken and never been to a disco

01:15:17.797 --> 01:15:22.908
 but some friends 
said come on out let's go do 

01:15:22.909 --> 01:15:27.994
studio 54 and she went 
and absolutely loveed it and she

01:15:28.058 --> 01:15:32.583
 became a regular.
          People used to usually

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:41.037
 young African 
Americans or Hispanic muscular 

01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:45.743
young guys, she would 
wrap her legs around them and 

01:15:45.744 --> 01:15:46.830
they would spin her 
around.

01:15:46.831 --> 01:15:52.344
          Again, this is really 
just the freedom of 

01:15:52.345 --> 01:15:54.345
expression. And

01:15:56.814 --> 01:15:59.336
 a safe place to be and a safe 
haven.

01:15:59.337 --> 01:16:02.874
          This is a contact 
sheet. I don't know how 

01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:05.612
-- I can't really see you people
, I don't know how 

01:16:05.613 --> 01:16:09.159
many people know what a contact 
sheet is.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.566
                    (APPLAUSE)
Yeah? Good. That's heatening to 

01:16:14.567 --> 01:16:19.367
know. When I started shooting 
that's what we had to 

01:16:19.368 --> 01:16:26.499
deal with, I would go out at 
night with my cannon A 

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:32.065
1 and I would shoot with try axe
 film, which was the 

01:16:32.066 --> 01:16:37.283
fastest film of its day, it was 
400 A S A, I needed 

01:16:37.284 --> 01:16:40.169
fast film because these clubs 
are dark -- I'm 

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:46.126
looking out here now, some clubs
 were dark as this 

01:16:46.127 --> 01:16:49.365
but there were flashing lights 
so I would have a 

01:16:49.366 --> 01:16:53.218
moment to focus my camera but it
 was a difficult 

01:16:53.219 --> 01:16:55.792
shooting situation that took me 
a long time to 

01:16:55.793 --> 01:16:58.471
figure out.
          But when I was 

01:16:58.472 --> 01:17:04.598
seriously shoot ago lot for 
this project I would go out to 

01:17:04.599 --> 01:17:07.032
about 4 in the 
morning and I would come back 

01:17:07.033 --> 01:17:12.055
and take my ten, 15 
rows of film, I put it on my 

01:17:12.056 --> 01:17:16.100
table and I would go to 
sleep and I would have an 

01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:20.934
assistant that would come 
at 10 in the morning and develop

01:17:21.093 --> 01:17:25.211
 the film and hang 
it up to dry and I would rise at

01:17:25.813 --> 01:17:29.204
 about 4 in the 
afternoon and have a really 

01:17:29.205 --> 01:17:33.485
strong cup of coffee or 
two and I would make a contact 

01:17:33.486 --> 01:17:36.032
sheet and sit and 
look at it and see if I got 

01:17:36.033 --> 01:17:39.154
anything the night 
before, because it's not like 

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:42.294
being able to shoot 
and look at the back of your 

01:17:42.295 --> 01:17:46.002
camera and say that's 
good. You had to wait and look 

01:17:46.003 --> 01:17:49.451
at the contact sheet.
          So that was the 

01:17:49.452 --> 01:17:54.673
process that I went 
through to shoot. And honestly, 

01:17:54.674 --> 01:17:59.692
I don't miss it.
          It's much easier to 

01:17:59.693 --> 01:18:02.502
shoot digitally.
          Another thing -- at 

01:18:02.503 --> 01:18:08.311
the disco, in this if 
I can time period was evolution 

01:18:08.312 --> 01:18:12.184
of the technology of 
the sound system. 

01:18:17.421 --> 01:18:21.439
If you remember when the beetles

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.391
played at Shea stadium, the 
sound they played, the 

01:18:24.392 --> 01:18:28.168
speakers they played through 
were the bull horn 

01:18:28.169 --> 01:18:31.626
that's they would announce the 
next batter, that was 

01:18:31.627 --> 01:18:35.079
the technology of the day.
          Well, this is now ten 

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.775
years later, and the 
speaker system was incredible 

01:18:39.776 --> 01:18:45.239
and the mixing devices 
and the amplifyiers were very 

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:53.126
high tech. This is the 
only female D J that I 

01:18:53.127 --> 01:18:57.265
photographed or found in New 
York city during that period. 

01:18:57.673 --> 01:19:01.635
I'm not saying there 
weren't others that I didn't 

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:05.226
find but at one of the 
major discos, this is the only 

01:19:05.227 --> 01:19:07.763
one, a place called 
civil.

01:19:07.764 --> 01:19:13.012
          It's pretty much a men
's club, and I think 

01:19:13.013 --> 01:19:17.742
it still is to some extent today
 although I met some 

01:19:17.743 --> 01:19:22.973
amazing female D J's in the last
 few years, so 

01:19:22.974 --> 01:19:24.129
they're kind of breaking through
.

01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:27.672
          This is the speakers 
-- I mean, they're 

01:19:27.673 --> 01:19:34.660
huge -- and this is -- this 
would be one sort of set 

01:19:34.661 --> 01:19:38.204
of speakers here and in some of 
the clubs they would 

01:19:38.205 --> 01:19:40.784
have these speakers lineing the 
wall.

01:19:40.785 --> 01:19:49.480
          So, when they played 
the disco beat, the 

01:19:49.481 --> 01:19:52.966
base especially, it would really
 rock your insides. 

01:19:52.967 --> 01:19:57.967
And you would like get physical 
high just, even if 

01:19:57.968 --> 01:20:01.810
you had done no drugs and walked
 in off the street, 

01:20:01.811 --> 01:20:05.203
if you were standing in that 
room for a while your 

01:20:05.204 --> 01:20:08.783
insides would start to shake and
 you would get high 

01:20:08.784 --> 01:20:12.402
just from being there, so you 
add the drugs and 

01:20:12.403 --> 01:20:15.531
alcohol to this and it was you 
know, a pretty 

01:20:15.532 --> 01:20:17.532
amazing scene.

01:20:20.018 --> 01:20:24.579
So, after studio 54, I decided 
that this 

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:30.389
is interesting. And I wanted to 
see what else was 

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:35.659
going on. This is 77, 78, I want
ed to see what else 

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:41.242
was going on in Manhattan and 
the five burrows. So I 

01:20:41.243 --> 01:20:46.169
went to 2001 odyssey where 
Saturday night fever was 

01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:51.656
filmed. And it wasn't exactly 
the most -- it was in 

01:20:51.657 --> 01:20:55.362
bay ridge Brooklyn, and it 
wasn't exactly the up 

01:20:55.363 --> 01:20:58.829
scale Manhattan disco, it was 
like a local disco.

01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:03.544
          This is the floor that
 was in the movie. 

01:21:03.545 --> 01:21:08.630
It was actually built by Robert 
stying wood and his 

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:11.377
production people -- but it stay
ed in

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:17.034
 2001 odyssey 
after they left. And when the 

01:21:17.035 --> 01:21:22.042
building was torn down 
sometime later, some private 

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.018
collector bought this 
floor, and I don't know where it

01:21:24.019 --> 01:21:29.418
 is, but somewhere, 
probably in California, in L A 

01:21:29.419 --> 01:21:32.412
in somebody's 
basement is this floor and he 

01:21:32.413 --> 01:21:34.395
has parties on 
Saturday night.

01:21:40.359 --> 01:21:43.190
This is really one of the most 
famous club

01:21:43.191 --> 01:21:46.168
clubs of its time. I don't know 
if all of you know 

01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:49.161
of it --
          (APPLAUSE).

01:21:49.162 --> 01:21:53.703
          This was agamassing 
club, amazing club, 

01:21:53.704 --> 01:21:57.703
and I think -- those of who knew
 about it then were 

01:21:57.704 --> 01:22:01.247
all over it but people are just 
beginning to find 

01:22:01.248 --> 01:22:04.692
out about paradise garage, and 
it had a couple 

01:22:04.693 --> 01:22:08.791
things going for it.
          It was members club. 

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:14.905
They didn't serve 
alcohol, they serveed juice and 

01:22:14.906 --> 01:22:20.175
fruit. But people 
brought their own poppers, 

01:22:20.176 --> 01:22:24.723
alcohol, and grass, and 
it was plenty to get stoneed on 

01:22:24.724 --> 01:22:27.160
when you were there. 
          But the great thing 

01:22:27.161 --> 01:22:30.844
about this club, is 
this guy.

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.845
          (APPLAUSE).

01:22:35.873 --> 01:22:38.794
Larryle van -- I don't have 
enough time to 

01:22:38.795 --> 01:22:43.644
talk about him -- it's a whole 
lecture in itself 

01:22:43.645 --> 01:22:48.766
because this guy -- this guy 
really created modern D 

01:22:48.767 --> 01:22:54.335
J's in a lot of ways, and I've 
spoken to a lot of D 

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:58.424
J's today and everybody looks at
 him as being pretty 

01:22:58.425 --> 01:23:01.406
much the imagine know survey tor
of a lot of 

01:23:01.407 --> 01:23:05.112
different styles.
          And he played ever 

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:08.942
kind of music that he 
wanted tonight most of the clubs

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.782
 they were handed 
music by record companies and 

01:23:12.783 --> 01:23:16.693
say this is the great 
hot one to play -- Larryy would 

01:23:16.694 --> 01:23:21.554
look at it and go, 
I'll listen to it -- he would 

01:23:21.555 --> 01:23:26.044
play rock and roll, 
rhythm and blues, month town -- 

01:23:26.045 --> 01:23:28.311
pretty much 
everything. I wasn't there that 

01:23:28.312 --> 01:23:34.321
night but one night 
he really liked pat Ben tar song

01:23:34.328 --> 01:23:37.910
 love is a 
battlefield, he liked that song 

01:23:37.911 --> 01:23:43.250
so he would play it 
ten times a row, and he really 

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:46.783
likeed it and he had a 
way of hypnotizeing his audience

01:23:47.345 --> 01:23:51.033
, they loveed him. 
They used to calm him his play

01:23:51.756 --> 01:23:57.469
ing Saturday mass. 
They would go at Saturday mass, 

01:23:57.470 --> 01:24:00.137
started Saturday and 
ended way late Sunday.

01:24:00.138 --> 01:24:04.754
          So, this volumes that 
have been written 

01:24:04.755 --> 01:24:06.968
about him -- well worth reading 
about.

01:24:06.969 --> 01:24:10.583
          This is what the dance
 floor looked like 

01:24:10.584 --> 01:24:16.692
at pair dies garage.
          Mostly Hispanic and 

01:24:16.693 --> 01:24:20.099
African American, 
although, the thing about these 

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:25.484
clubs is that if a 
white person walk inside there, 

01:24:25.485 --> 01:24:28.873
if Austrians gender 
woman walked in there, if 

01:24:28.874 --> 01:24:32.873
anybody walked in in it 
with wouldn't have been a 

01:24:32.874 --> 01:24:38.538
problem, but most clubs 
had their group but it had that 

01:24:38.539 --> 01:24:42.387
inclusiveness to it.
          This was another one 

01:24:42.388 --> 01:24:45.521
of my most favorite 
club that's a lot of people 

01:24:45.522 --> 01:24:52.360
never heard of it -- 
it's called give give's barber 

01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:57.623
room, it's where 
twists started and after the 

01:24:57.624 --> 01:25:03.891
pepper ment lounge 
closed it changed to

01:25:06.892 --> 01:25:15.409
 give give's bar -- they had 
disco bats performing. It was a 

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:18.253
mixed crowd. All 
kinds of people went there.

01:25:18.254 --> 01:25:27.358
          There it is too.
          And this is a picture 

01:25:27.359 --> 01:25:30.890
that sort of became 
famous from my book.

01:25:30.891 --> 01:25:35.883
          It's -- this is a 
transgender, pre-op 

01:25:35.884 --> 01:25:40.404
transgender named Ava, that I 
saw so many times when 

01:25:40.405 --> 01:25:46.125
I went there that we finally sat
 down and had a long 

01:25:46.126 --> 01:25:51.644
conversation. A middle class 
Jewish boy like myself 

01:25:51.645 --> 01:25:56.894
sitting to a pre-op transgender 
woman, it was an 

01:25:56.895 --> 01:26:00.498
amazing experience, and I just 
learn address lot 

01:26:00.499 --> 01:26:04.734
just by doing this. It opened up
 my mind a lot.

01:26:04.735 --> 01:26:11.306
          It became a place 
where if you were out of 

01:26:11.307 --> 01:26:15.120
towner you would stop in and go 
to this bar.

01:26:15.121 --> 01:26:20.124
          Another club called 
Chris codisco.

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:25.538
          Pretty much a gay club
 but again, became 

01:26:25.539 --> 01:26:28.921
so popular that it became one of
 those let's stop 

01:26:28.922 --> 01:26:32.397
there before we go home at 4 in 
the morning. And 

01:26:32.398 --> 01:26:37.015
that can was the D J booth in 
the back there.

01:26:37.016 --> 01:26:40.876
          I wanted to hit all of
 these clubs. The 

01:26:40.877 --> 01:26:44.780
other club is the mud club.
          A political applause. 

01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:52.139
This was considered 
an anti-disco. They didn't like 

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.224
studio 54. They were 
political.

01:26:54.225 --> 01:26:58.579
          They didn't like the 
commercialism. But it 

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:02.510
became very, very popular and 
they had a velvet rope 

01:27:02.511 --> 01:27:07.627
outside after a while too. 
          So, this is a famous 

01:27:07.628 --> 01:27:10.455
bathroom at the mud 
club. I won't go into the 

01:27:10.456 --> 01:27:14.845
stories but just trust me 
it's a famous bathroom.

01:27:14.846 --> 01:27:22.737
          This is a place called
 hue ray's -- anti-

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:28.797
anti-disco. I went to roller 
disco, it was big, it 

01:27:28.798 --> 01:27:31.639
was sweat and competition and a 
lot of fun and if 

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.762
you were a good skater, you 
would put on your skates 

01:27:34.763 --> 01:27:40.564
and head out for the disco in 
Brooklyn and showed 

01:27:40.565 --> 01:27:44.279
everybody your moves.
          And again, it didn't 

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.141
matter if you were 
white, African American, 

01:27:46.142 --> 01:27:50.546
whatever, it was a 
competition and it was fun.

01:27:50.547 --> 01:27:56.361
          I was a little nervous
 going here because 

01:27:56.362 --> 01:27:59.799
it was a part of Brooklyn I 
didn't know and it was 

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:03.490
mostly African American, but the
 miniwalked in I was 

01:28:03.491 --> 01:28:06.353
completely at ease and at home.

01:28:11.184 --> 01:28:15.314
So, a couple of things happened 
in 1979 

01:28:15.315 --> 01:28:22.733
that changed the disco scene. 
And I sort of say 

01:28:22.734 --> 01:28:26.642
sometime that's it ended disco, 
but that's not 

01:28:26.643 --> 01:28:31.523
exactly true and there's a 
writer Tim Lawrence that 

01:28:31.524 --> 01:28:35.445
wrote about life and death on a 
New York dance floor 

01:28:35.446 --> 01:28:41.023
about disco from the 80's -- I 
think 80 to 83, and 

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:47.365
he describes the fact that it 
kept going and 

01:28:47.366 --> 01:28:51.534
creative and the disco that I 
knew and experienced 

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:56.802
in my opinion was over in 1979, 
1980. The first 

01:28:56.803 --> 01:29:03.774
thing has happened was studio 54
, coke, spoon and 

01:29:03.775 --> 01:29:09.629
moon, they were closed down by 
ICE, and IRS -- Steve 

01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:13.455
and an were skimming the cash 
registers and taking 

01:29:13.456 --> 01:29:17.279
the money and putting it in the 
ceiling panels of 

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.734
the office. They would come down
 every couple of 

01:29:20.735 --> 01:29:25.538
hours and take cash out of the 
drawers. Steve would 

01:29:25.539 --> 01:29:28.813
wasn't the most sober person, 
every time I saw him 

01:29:28.814 --> 01:29:32.814
he would go, who are you again 
-- and I met him all 

01:29:32.815 --> 01:29:36.658
the time.
          Bill Bernstein from 

01:29:36.659 --> 01:29:41.766
the voice -- oh, yeah.
          So, Steve was being 

01:29:41.767 --> 01:29:46.816
interviewed and he 
said, if the IRS knew how much 

01:29:46.817 --> 01:29:50.412
money we really made 
they would shut us down.

01:29:50.413 --> 01:29:54.558
          And so, guess what 
happened about two days 

01:29:54.559 --> 01:29:58.407
later?
          And they went to jail.

01:29:58.408 --> 01:30:01.659
 And that place was 
shut down.

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:07.356
          It opened up under 
some new ownership. To 

01:30:07.357 --> 01:30:13.935
me it was never the same.
          There was culture 

01:30:13.936 --> 01:30:18.746
backlash against music, 
culture, the rock and rollers 

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:22.599
wanted their music 
back and they got sick of disco 

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.552
music and there was 
a racial over tone to it that is

01:30:30.392 --> 01:30:36.140
 pretty much clearly 
there but it was -- there was a 

01:30:36.141 --> 01:30:38.141
rarely over tone, 
but

01:30:41.649 --> 01:30:45.633
 disco became unpopular, and 
became sort of a 

01:30:45.634 --> 01:30:48.751
dirty word.
          So, that happened.

01:30:48.752 --> 01:30:56.286
          And then, in I believe
 it was 1981, the 

01:30:56.287 --> 01:31:01.090
New York Times published an 
article saying that 

01:31:01.091 --> 01:31:04.933
there was an AIDS epidemic, and 
that it was spread

01:31:04.934 --> 01:31:09.642
spreading. And everybody knew 
something was going on 

01:31:09.643 --> 01:31:14.052
-- they called it the gay cancer
, but they 

01:31:14.053 --> 01:31:17.779
officially declareed it an 
epidemic, so what happened 

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:22.150
was people didn't know anything 
when AIDS was first 

01:31:22.151 --> 01:31:26.450
announceed, and so they were 
afraid if you're talking 

01:31:26.451 --> 01:31:30.141
to somebody and they 
accidentally spit a little and 

01:31:30.142 --> 01:31:34.411
it goes in your eye you could 
get AIDSes or if they 

01:31:34.412 --> 01:31:37.479
were sweating and you touched 
them or shook their 

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:40.503
hand, so nobody knew anything. 
There was no 

01:31:40.504 --> 01:31:44.081
information.
          And Ronald Reagan came

01:31:44.504 --> 01:31:47.327
 into power at that 
point and he didn't want to deal

01:31:47.895 --> 01:31:52.045
 with AIDS for the 
first two years in office, his 

01:31:52.046 --> 01:31:56.845
administration. It 
really affected the whole scene.

01:31:56.848 --> 01:31:59.985
          And those three things
 in my opinion 

01:31:59.986 --> 01:32:04.537
really accounted for shutting 
down or changing, I 

01:32:04.538 --> 01:32:09.941
should say, the whole disco 
world that I knew.

01:32:13.942 --> 01:32:16.926
Real quickly, what happened was,
 these 

01:32:16.927 --> 01:32:23.608
pictures ended up in a box, have
 somewhere, and they 

01:32:23.609 --> 01:32:25.874
ran in the village voice once in
 a while but 

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:32.182
basically I put them away in 
1979, and in 2003 I got 

01:32:32.183 --> 01:32:37.101
a call from a guy named David 
hill who is a producer

01:32:37.102 --> 01:32:40.962
producer, he said there's a re
newed interest in this 

01:32:40.963 --> 01:32:44.234
period, would you like to do a 
coffee table book, so 

01:32:44.235 --> 01:32:47.632
I said yeah, absolutely.
          So he found a publish

01:32:48.343 --> 01:32:53.292
er, real art press in 
London, and Tony Norman and 

01:32:53.293 --> 01:32:58.144
David and I started put
putting this book together. And 

01:32:58.145 --> 01:33:02.858
-- this is 2015 -- I 
railed realizeed as we were 

01:33:02.859 --> 01:33:07.662
doing this that it became 
crystal clear to me what I had 

01:33:07.663 --> 01:33:13.079
here, because in 2015 
the equal marriage amendment 

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:19.048
passed, the mag, the 
confederate flag came down in 

01:33:19.049 --> 01:33:22.102
the South, transgender
transgenders were allowed in the

01:33:22.121 --> 01:33:27.078
 military, it was 
like this sea change during that

01:33:27.747 --> 01:33:30.026
 year of cultural 
awareness and

01:33:33.173 --> 01:33:35.144
 acceptance and inclusion and I 
thought 

01:33:35.145 --> 01:33:38.672
to myself what I captured here 
was really like the 

01:33:38.673 --> 01:33:44.982
beginning -- like it was like a 
small micro cosmic 

01:33:44.983 --> 01:33:48.646
of the world that we're 
beginning to see today.

01:33:48.647 --> 01:33:51.766
          I feel that in 
cultural movements like 

01:33:51.767 --> 01:33:57.748
this that you take two steps 
forward and one step 

01:33:57.749 --> 01:34:01.436
backwards. And I think we might 
be taking step 

01:34:01.437 --> 01:34:02.855
backwards right now a little bit
 --

01:34:02.856 --> 01:34:05.468
          (APPLAUSE).
          But I believe in my 

01:34:05.469 --> 01:34:11.955
heart that inclusion 
and.acceptance is a natural way 

01:34:11.956 --> 01:34:14.231
of being as a human 
being --

01:34:14.232 --> 01:34:16.232
          (APPLAUSE).

01:34:20.513 --> 01:34:23.505
And I think we're going to move 
forward in 

01:34:23.506 --> 01:34:26.314
our culture again. So thank you 
very much. 

01:34:26.315 --> 01:34:28.315
          (APPLAUSE).

01:34:34.561 --> 01:34:36.561
Thank you.

01:35:50.671 --> 01:35:55.485
Hi, my name is he will listen --
 I wrote a 

01:35:55.486 --> 01:36:02.914
book called hot stuff -- and I 
first of all, want to 

01:36:02.915 --> 01:36:06.295
thank the incredibly competent 
staff here at the 

01:36:06.296 --> 01:36:10.297
library of Congress, they've 
been appreciate.

01:36:10.298 --> 01:36:15.406
          I would like to linger
 for a moment of 

01:36:15.407 --> 01:36:21.133
what I consider to be the irony 
of this event, an 

01:36:21.134 --> 01:36:24.377
event that really Frankly seemed
 highly, would have 

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:29.077
seemed highly unlikely until 
maybe even about ten 

01:36:29.078 --> 01:36:32.474
years ago, the idea that the 
library of Congress 

01:36:32.475 --> 01:36:35.905
would be staging this event, un
thinkable.

01:36:35.906 --> 01:36:38.176
                    (APPLAUSE).

01:36:42.418 --> 01:36:45.534
For those of you who are too 
young to 

01:36:45.535 --> 01:36:51.131
remember this, disco really 
wasn't meant to be a 

01:36:51.132 --> 01:36:54.224
subject of books and films and 
conferences where 

01:36:54.225 --> 01:36:59.219
participants would grapple with 
its meaning and 

01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:03.316
affect. Disco was supposed to 
have been buryied some 

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:08.329
36 years ago. And it's actually 
true that by 1981 

01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:13.848
all across America, road 
stations were ditching 

01:37:13.849 --> 01:37:18.415
disco in any other format in 
very many places across 

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:22.955
the country, actual disco start
ed to shut down to be 

01:37:22.956 --> 01:37:29.691
replaceed by anything else.
          In 1981, Grammy awards

01:37:29.692 --> 01:37:34.256
 drop it's 
short-lived disco category after

01:37:34.627 --> 01:37:41.821
 it just established 
it. Goryia Gaynor easy will Sue 

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:47.842
has been the only 
recorded awarded best disco 

01:37:47.843 --> 01:37:52.688
recording. Record labels 
went about shutting down their 

01:37:52.689 --> 01:37:57.392
disco divisions if 
they had one. And soon, the 

01:37:57.393 --> 01:38:03.953
record jackets of the 
club single that's your D J 

01:38:03.954 --> 01:38:12.024
played, changed as well.  
I was a D J in an arbor Michigan

01:38:12.027 --> 01:38:13.281
 --
          (APPLAUSE).

01:38:13.282 --> 01:38:16.035
          So gone were the draw
ings of platform 

01:38:16.036 --> 01:38:20.829
shoes and all those other other 
signifyiers of disco 

01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:26.147
and they were replaceed of
biographics that were 

01:38:26.148 --> 01:38:28.148
supposed to

01:38:29.375 --> 01:38:32.671
 create new ways. It had to be 
rebranded 

01:38:32.672 --> 01:38:37.064
and hence, forth it you became 
known as dance music.

01:38:37.065 --> 01:38:45.058
          But a funny thing 
happened to the musical 

01:38:45.059 --> 01:38:48.460
gravy yard, disco percented --

01:38:52.703 --> 01:38:53.953
 persistented --
          (APPLAUSE).

01:38:53.954 --> 01:38:59.580
          Thank you. This new 
dance music employed a 

01:38:59.581 --> 01:39:07.936
last -- predictable beat but it 
sounded an often a 

01:39:07.937 --> 01:39:13.210
lot like disco. Madonna, prince,
 Michael Jackson cut 

01:39:13.211 --> 01:39:19.709
disco tracks, if if their record
 companies avoided 

01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:23.564
ever calling it dais disco. Fast
 forward today and 

01:39:23.565 --> 01:39:28.832
you tell me that Lauren green 
white doesn't have a 

01:39:28.833 --> 01:39:33.533
look to disco.
          Disco continues to 

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:39.498
exact its avenge 
through contemporary music and 

01:39:39.499 --> 01:39:42.331
events like today.
          I would like to focus 

01:39:42.332 --> 01:39:47.032
on some of the 
cultural work that disco did -- 

01:39:47.033 --> 01:39:50.737
there is a paradox 
that I think is at the heart of 

01:39:50.738 --> 01:39:55.284
the disco A it's 
this. Disco in the classical 

01:39:55.285 --> 01:39:58.423
period was lyrical 
liver slight. Even part of disco

01:39:59.533 --> 01:40:05.345
 could not argue 
that its lyrics were especially 

01:40:05.346 --> 01:40:10.755
meaningful, get down 
tonight, bookie down, and yet 

01:40:10.756 --> 01:40:18.047
disco pass ad cultural 
and social -- it's at paradox 

01:40:18.048 --> 01:40:24.262
that it suggested to 
me that sometimes music isn't 

01:40:24.263 --> 01:40:30.923
explicit political, it 
might strike some as treat, can 

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.924
never the less do

01:40:37.919 --> 01:40:41.248
 we are family -- it 
was the song that could all get 

01:40:41.249 --> 01:40:44.353
people out on the 
dance floor, but it was also the

01:40:45.137 --> 01:40:48.047
 song that kept 
Nelson Mandela going when he was

01:40:48.448 --> 01:40:53.451
 in the prison.
          I'm not knocking songs

01:40:53.998 --> 01:41:00.992
 such as Ohio and 
public enemy and black steal, 

01:41:00.993 --> 01:41:06.795
but the a song may not 
be political to get people 

01:41:06.796 --> 01:41:10.637
moving and even thinking 
differently. What disco offers 

01:41:10.638 --> 01:41:16.046
us is a study in the 
ways that music can be easyily 

01:41:16.047 --> 01:41:19.344
understand as a social 
process. Through it we learn how

01:41:19.591 --> 01:41:23.740
 to experience our 
own feelings, our own desires, 

01:41:23.741 --> 01:41:26.611
and sometimes our own 
bodies.

01:41:26.612 --> 01:41:31.686
          And this isy why when 
thinking music it's 

01:41:31.687 --> 01:41:34.118
important to acknowledge that 
music not only reflect

01:41:34.119 --> 01:41:36.685
reflects what's happening 
politically

01:41:39.835 --> 01:41:42.817
, socially, it 
enacts change. And speaking of 

01:41:42.818 --> 01:41:46.753
change, I want to 
turn to this first slide -- here

01:41:47.048 --> 01:41:54.186
, I've quoted know 
na Hendricks who was the 

01:41:54.187 --> 01:41:56.467
songwriter --
          (APPLAUSE).

01:41:56.468 --> 01:42:02.146
          Who was a member of 
patella bell and blue 

01:42:02.147 --> 01:42:06.412
bells and was the person within 
that group who was 

01:42:06.413 --> 01:42:11.247
most strongly in favor 
converting that group into

01:42:19.088 --> 01:42:22.465
maremma law -- here's 
is a girl group into something 

01:42:22.466 --> 01:42:28.639
far less conventional
conventional, more chaotic and 

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:34.567
wild, but the same 
could be same disco affected 

01:42:34.568 --> 01:42:38.672
listeners and dancers.
          Let's hear a little 

01:42:38.673 --> 01:42:40.673
bit. 

01:42:42.825 --> 01:42:44.825
          (MUSIC)

01:43:14.247 --> 01:43:16.247
.

01:43:30.019 --> 01:43:32.019
          (APPLAUSE).

01:43:38.431 --> 01:43:43.585
Yeah. You know, if you're 
talking about 

01:43:43.586 --> 01:43:45.637
Beyonce say's feminism which I 
think is a great 

01:43:45.638 --> 01:43:54.366
topic, you have to give I think 
credit due to knowna 

01:43:54.367 --> 01:44:01.015
Hendricks and shacka can, you 
have to give 

01:44:01.016 --> 01:44:06.874
properties to really props to 
them because they are 

01:44:06.875 --> 01:44:11.247
among the most important 
feminist voices of the 1970

01:44:11.248 --> 01:44:13.248
1970's.
          There are other people

01:44:13.975 --> 01:44:17.119
 that I have put up 
here -- this is

01:44:29.499 --> 01:44:34.164
 hospitale rock the third -- the
 wink

01:44:34.165 --> 01:44:37.295
wink, wing, nod, nod, homosexual
 personality which 

01:44:37.296 --> 01:44:42.252
was on a fair amount and front 
an early disco group 

01:44:42.253 --> 01:44:45.703
and was the D J in Saturday 
night fever.

01:44:45.704 --> 01:44:47.977
                    (APPLAUSE).

01:44:54.197 --> 01:44:58.506
He was a reluctant disco star, 
he didn't 

01:44:58.507 --> 01:45:01.900
like disco initially.
          And then of course the

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.173
 village people.
          And this was before 

01:45:05.174 --> 01:45:10.338
the village people 
were quite processed, and quite 

01:45:10.339 --> 01:45:13.716
souple addictable.
          I focus on these 

01:45:13.717 --> 01:45:18.673
slides disco artists who 
are really unconventional but 

01:45:18.674 --> 01:45:21.676
it's important to 
acknowledge a lot of critics and

01:45:22.068 --> 01:45:25.204
 listeners thought 
that disco was regressive, 

01:45:25.205 --> 01:45:29.369
actually, they thought 
disco was attacked for being too

01:45:29.919 --> 01:45:32.896
 gay and too 
straight, too black and too 

01:45:32.897 --> 01:45:36.236
white, over sexed and 
asexual,

01:45:39.377 --> 01:45:42.259
 leisure class -- and so, disco 
for the 

01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.985
person who is trying to 
understand and make sense of 

01:45:44.986 --> 01:45:50.958
it, it represented anything but 
a stable sig five

01:45:50.959 --> 01:45:54.358
fiveifier -- it was really a 
moving target. How it K 

01:45:54.359 --> 01:45:58.661
that be? In my book hot stuff 
which I called hot 

01:45:58.662 --> 01:46:03.125
stuff for several reasons, one 
was there were two 

01:46:03.126 --> 01:46:09.363
book end songs -- I called it 
hot stuff because I 

01:46:09.364 --> 01:46:13.647
wanted to discover disco's hot
ness, ending of racial 

01:46:13.648 --> 01:46:18.505
rules and gender and sexual 
conventions. I argue 

01:46:18.506 --> 01:46:23.945
that disco broadened the contour
s in three areas, 

01:46:23.946 --> 01:46:27.743
first of all, disco evolveed out
 of the the work of 

01:46:27.744 --> 01:46:30.755
African American musicians and 
produceers who were 

01:46:30.756 --> 01:46:35.764
experimenting with lavish 
significant -- 

01:46:35.765 --> 01:46:40.345
sophisticated arrangement. So 
much so, that some 

01:46:40.346 --> 01:46:45.082
critics and listeners thought 
disco didn't sound 

01:46:45.083 --> 01:46:51.094
soul full or black. Secondly, 
male sexuality shifted 

01:46:51.095 --> 01:46:57.240
with disco and gay men became 
newly visible, largely 

01:46:57.241 --> 01:47:01.764
through the dissemination of 
disco culture, it 

01:47:01.765 --> 01:47:10.341
shifted as a feminine si -- it 
gives away to amotio 

01:47:10.342 --> 01:47:15.278
style to anyone who was 
inaugural ball -- to the 

01:47:15.279 --> 01:47:21.547
village peopleFeminism critique,
 remember the 1970's 

01:47:21.548 --> 01:47:27.368
the decade of -- critique of 
three way sex -- I 

01:47:27.369 --> 01:47:32.444
shouldn't have to explain that 
-- feminism of three 

01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:36.329
minute sex found its voice in 
disco. It played 

01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:40.018
itself out with black female 
performers who broke 

01:47:40.019 --> 01:47:42.442
with long standing 
representational strategies that

01:47:45.876 --> 01:47:50.840
Long before Madonna 
put on those breastplates, this 

01:47:50.841 --> 01:47:55.955
had already been 
done by Sarah dash in the center

01:47:56.090 --> 01:48:00.655
.
          When you're thinking 

01:48:00.656 --> 01:48:05.506
about representation 
and obsession with respect

01:48:05.929 --> 01:48:09.068
ability which is kind of 
understandable, think of mow 

01:48:09.069 --> 01:48:13.057
town and the girl group
groups and their gowns and white

01:48:13.299 --> 01:48:16.435
 gloves -- so when I 
think about disco, one of the 

01:48:16.436 --> 01:48:19.760
things I think is 
important about it is that the 

01:48:19.761 --> 01:48:22.548
only way that you can 
make sense of how we get from 

01:48:22.549 --> 01:48:27.097
Diana Ross in the 1960
1960's, to little Kim in the 90

01:48:27.098 --> 01:48:31.851
's is to take on 
board how disco validateed 

01:48:31.852 --> 01:48:35.902
female dire, the most 
famously was Donna summers was 

01:48:35.903 --> 01:48:37.630
love to love you baby
baby.

01:48:37.631 --> 01:48:42.590
          I don't know what all 
that noise is that's 

01:48:42.591 --> 01:48:44.860
out there.
          So these changes that 

01:48:44.861 --> 01:48:49.424
I've outlined were 
experienced as liberateing by 

01:48:49.425 --> 01:48:54.115
some but also 
controversial, was disco a 

01:48:54.116 --> 01:48:56.116
reputation

01:48:57.137 --> 01:49:00.545
 of racial 
profileing or turning A and B 

01:49:00.546 --> 01:49:04.236
music beige, was it

01:49:13.662 --> 01:49:21.423
it best understood as 
parody as conventional masculine

01:49:21.983 --> 01:49:27.729
ity. Was it liberate
liberating of home homosexuality

01:49:28.117 --> 01:49:33.220
 or regressive and 
stigmatizing of sissyness.

01:49:33.221 --> 01:49:37.224
          And what about women? 
Disco filled the air 

01:49:37.225 --> 01:49:42.172
as one singer called women's 
love rights -- this was 

01:49:42.173 --> 01:49:44.906
the social and legal policy that
 would ensure a more 

01:49:44.907 --> 01:49:50.733
level playing field for women 
lagged way behind the 

01:49:50.734 --> 01:49:54.878
sexual revolution.
          Disco's promotion of 

01:49:54.879 --> 01:49:59.828
expressiveness seemed 
to some people to run the risk 

01:49:59.829 --> 01:50:04.079
06 exacerbatesing women
women's vulnerability. And it 

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:08.623
has to be said that 
disco would not prove to be 

01:50:08.624 --> 01:50:14.508
anymore conducive of the 
empowerment of female performers

01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:17.175
 -- here I'm working 
about the working conditions.

01:50:17.176 --> 01:50:20.965
          I said I wanted to 
talk in more specific 

01:50:20.966 --> 01:50:25.267
termings about the culture 
cultural work and I want 

01:50:25.268 --> 01:50:27.556
to turn into the relationship of
 gay men in 

01:50:27.557 --> 01:50:31.408
particular to disco.
          Even before disco 

01:50:31.409 --> 01:50:33.409
became dices co, gay 
male

01:50:35.448 --> 01:50:39.239
 sociability began to shift as 
clear night light 

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.240
was the

01:50:44.157 --> 01:50:47.209
 reverb ration -- it first 
registered above 

01:50:47.210 --> 01:50:54.336
ground, rather than in exclusive
 unmarked clubs 

01:50:54.337 --> 01:50:59.117
visible by only the lines out in
 front of them. The 

01:50:59.118 --> 01:51:06.529
bars where these were most King
ly felt was a halfa 

01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:11.801
run dive in New York City called
 the stonewall in, 

01:51:11.802 --> 01:51:18.032
of June 1969. It is said by many
, many historians 

01:51:18.033 --> 01:51:22.654
would agree, that it kick 
started the gay liberation 

01:51:22.655 --> 01:51:26.040
movement in America.
          Now scholars have 

01:51:26.041 --> 01:51:29.976
puzzleed over the 
stonewall up rising, that it 

01:51:29.977 --> 01:51:34.128
happened when it did, 
and that it seemed to trigger 

01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:38.331
this big movement.
          Some historians argued

01:51:39.817 --> 01:51:41.924
 that at the time of 
the rebellion, there was already

01:51:42.221 --> 01:51:44.221
 what was called a

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:55.015
active for almost two 
decades, with a DC activists 

01:51:55.016 --> 01:51:59.437
being a leading figure 
in it. Research has shown that 

01:51:59.438 --> 01:52:03.272
sexualmy norths had 
taken to the streets before 

01:52:03.273 --> 01:52:09.257
stonewall, in one case 
in L A at a bar -- others argued

01:52:11.834 --> 01:52:15.769
 if gaze and lesbian
lesbians were open to movement 

01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:19.269
make was because of 
their participation in bar 

01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:22.201
culture.
          I want to make a 

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:27.716
different but related 
argument, and it's what went on 

01:52:27.717 --> 01:52:32.672
outside the 
stonewall in some 48 years ago 

01:52:32.673 --> 01:52:36.110
built on changes 
already underway inside the 

01:52:36.111 --> 01:52:39.160
stonewall in.
          The stonewall, was a 

01:52:39.161 --> 01:52:47.110
gay dancing bar. As 
late of 1969, was unusual in New

01:52:47.111 --> 01:52:49.644
 York.
          Most of the cityies 

01:52:49.645 --> 01:52:54.169
gale gay male bars did 
not permit dancing while the 

01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:58.050
stonewall had two dance 
floors. Testimony from stonewall

01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:02.414
 regulars you such 
as the bar dance floors, the 

01:53:02.415 --> 01:53:05.810
room in the back which 
was frequented by African 

01:53:05.811 --> 01:53:07.811
American and

01:53:08.855 --> 01:53:11.849
 Puerto Rico 
street kids under mind the 

01:53:11.850 --> 01:53:18.670
sexual and impression, 
the characterizeed other most 

01:53:18.671 --> 01:53:22.405
gay bars.
          In the back room Judey

01:53:22.494 --> 01:53:27.138
 Garland was already 
a thing of the past, as soul 

01:53:27.139 --> 01:53:32.154
music Blaired on their 
jukebox, and the dancing there 

01:53:32.155 --> 01:53:34.155
was not too date. 

01:53:36.861 --> 01:53:39.850
The 
culture that existed in the back

01:53:40.252 --> 01:53:44.241
 room articulateed 
the desire of gay desire. You 

01:53:44.242 --> 01:53:48.798
can look across the 
room, you could see a sexy guy, 

01:53:48.799 --> 01:53:51.380
you could infancy 
size about getting involved but 

01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:54.203
you couldn't go over 
and ask him to dance.

01:53:54.204 --> 01:53:57.594
          Another regular at the
 bar credits the 

01:53:57.595 --> 01:54:02.852
stonewall with making him 
confront his own sexual 

01:54:02.853 --> 01:54:07.425
tightness -- so the stonewall 
was itself a site of 

01:54:07.426 --> 01:54:13.027
transformation, form ago strong
er connection of 

01:54:13.028 --> 01:54:17.692
going out and coming out. 
Foraging a relationship 

01:54:17.693 --> 01:54:20.515
between cultureize edlysure and 
what would become gay 

01:54:20.516 --> 01:54:25.089
liberation, and association that
 disco would build 

01:54:25.090 --> 01:54:30.054
upon.
          By the time music 

01:54:30.055 --> 01:54:35.514
writer Vince wrote about 
what he called party music, in 

01:54:35.515 --> 01:54:41.407
the fall of 73, in 
rolling stone magazine, gay men 

01:54:41.408 --> 01:54:44.542
have been dancing in 
discos for three years, it would

01:54:45.090 --> 01:54:49.421
 take another year 
before billboard magazine kept 

01:54:49.422 --> 01:54:53.228
track of hot dance 
clubs as it called it, and two 

01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:56.923
more before the major
majors began taking the music 

01:54:56.924 --> 01:55:00.334
seriously.
          When one considers the

01:55:00.635 --> 01:55:04.315
cology text in which 
gay disco took shape, dancing 

01:55:04.316 --> 01:55:11.318
had been restricted, 
it's nearly impossible to dis

01:55:11.319 --> 01:55:14.844
aggregate dancing from 
politics, even if there had been

01:55:15.389 --> 01:55:22.220
 no D VJ's leading 
dancers off the dance floor and 

01:55:22.221 --> 01:55:26.064
onto the streets to 
protest -- this did happen in 

01:55:26.065 --> 01:55:32.987
New York City -- it 
was still an act of defiance for

01:55:33.058 --> 01:55:34.545
 gaze and lesbian 
beans.

01:55:38.453 --> 01:55:40.906
With gay liberation would change
 our 

01:55:40.907 --> 01:55:46.998
culture radically. It would also
 turn gay social

01:55:46.999 --> 01:55:50.556
socialability and gay 
subjectivity, how they 

01:55:50.557 --> 01:55:57.258
understood themselves. As it 
shift it from feminine 

01:55:57.259 --> 01:56:01.954
si -- how did disco participant?
 First non-stop 

01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:06.720
music -- silence was not 
tolerateed which is why 

01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:11.580
disco featureed the segways that
 fooled you to 

01:56:11.581 --> 01:56:15.123
thinking you were dancing to the
 last song, not the 

01:56:15.124 --> 01:56:18.674
new one.
          A break with the past 

01:56:18.675 --> 01:56:22.622
-- a break with 
those nights when a flashlight 

01:56:22.623 --> 01:56:27.480
or a red light 
brought the music and danceing 

01:56:27.481 --> 01:56:29.481
to a halt. 

01:56:32.624 --> 01:56:37.531
.
          And a good disco sound

01:56:37.539 --> 01:56:45.285
 system was like as 
one person put it, an audio or

01:56:49.446 --> 01:56:54.551
 beganism -- 
          The result that gay 

01:56:54.552 --> 01:56:58.788
men began fashioning 
their bodies as dancing machines

01:56:58.790 --> 01:57:05.054
. The owner of one 
of man hat and's trendsingy

01:57:08.207 --> 01:57:14.932
 gay bars -- he said he 
engineered the dancing bear 

01:57:14.933 --> 01:57:18.262
chested -- I quoted, 
there was no A C and I made sure

01:57:18.422 --> 01:57:22.879
 the windows were 
closed so it would heat up and 

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:24.663
they had to take off 
their shirts.

01:57:24.664 --> 01:57:31.514
          This practice of 
dancing half naked 

01:57:31.515 --> 01:57:33.515
quickly spread.

01:57:36.786 --> 01:57:38.786
What is that? 

01:58:06.376 --> 01:58:08.376
So, I'll keep talking.

01:58:21.438 --> 01:58:24.864
Okay, much, much better.
          That was definiteening

01:58:25.278 --> 01:58:26.605
 me and probably you 
too.

01:58:26.606 --> 01:58:31.568
          Okay, so this buff 
body, it was about file

01:58:31.569 --> 01:58:36.729
file, but it was critical to the
 recon figuring of 

01:58:36.730 --> 01:58:39.488
gay identity and desire. Before 
gay men had been as 

01:58:39.489 --> 01:58:45.154
one person put it gay club -- 
hush puppiesers after 

01:58:45.155 --> 01:58:51.456
the same prey, rather than ally
ies or patterns -- now 

01:58:51.457 --> 01:58:54.737
gay men became the embodiment of

01:58:57.853 --> 01:59:02.368
 covetable masculine
masculinity, and infancy 

01:59:02.369 --> 01:59:05.360
advertising object of 
desire for one another were 

01:59:05.361 --> 01:59:07.361
brothers, was the 
feeling,

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:13.456
 where are the men we've been 
looking for -- 

01:59:13.457 --> 01:59:15.881
not the trade that might beat 
you up.

01:59:15.882 --> 01:59:21.842
          Now, I think the macho
 turn is one of the 

01:59:21.843 --> 01:59:30.404
most sit and least study shifts 
-- in his mol -- or 

01:59:30.405 --> 01:59:35.205
the -- this is his novel but the
 narrator poppedders 

01:59:35.206 --> 01:59:39.763
that the possibility that the 
macho look has taken 

01:59:39.764 --> 01:59:43.610
over, but it occurs to him that 
maybe it's a send up

01:59:43.611 --> 01:59:48.174
up, an a turn on, I would argue 
that gay macho 

01:59:48.175 --> 01:59:52.311
operates in multiple registers 
with the meaning 

01:59:52.312 --> 01:59:58.565
shifting according to context.
          An author of a 

01:59:58.566 --> 02:00:03.865
wonderful blog, concedes 
that the gay macho can be silly 

02:00:03.867 --> 02:00:07.545
in and of itself. 
Gay men seem to behave more 

02:00:07.546 --> 02:00:11.333
decently toward each 
other. Now what he identified 

02:00:11.334 --> 02:00:18.680
and I'm quoting as -- 
which had been so much a part of

02:00:18.725 --> 02:00:21.685
 sensibilities.
          Others agree and point

02:00:21.736 --> 02:00:25.298
 to macho was 
liberateing for the way it 

02:00:25.299 --> 02:00:30.723
challenged this automatic 
association of homosexuality 

02:00:30.724 --> 02:00:36.172
with female anyone si.
          At the time a number 

02:00:36.173 --> 02:00:38.409
of gay writers 
question the

02:00:41.484 --> 02:00:45.638
 it was being achieveed. He had 
mon white 

02:00:45.639 --> 02:00:55.454
warned our old fears of sys 
sissyness -- are now locate

02:00:56.003 --> 02:00:59.377
ed 
through our persecution of the 

02:00:59.378 --> 02:01:03.551
transvestite.
          The homosexuality was 

02:01:03.552 --> 02:01:06.685
destigmatizeed in 
these years, it was at the 

02:01:06.686 --> 02:01:14.129
expense of a feminine si, 
which was disavoid that the drag

02:01:15.337 --> 02:01:19.490
 queens that were on 
the front lines were relegateed 

02:01:19.491 --> 02:01:22.662
to the margins of the 
movement,

02:01:27.499 --> 02:01:34.967
 they would face harassment.
          It did prove daunting,

02:01:35.816 --> 02:01:39.254
 particularly drag 
queens found themselves shoveed 

02:01:39.255 --> 02:01:45.773
to the very sidelines 
of gay life. Even gay's camp 

02:01:45.774 --> 02:01:50.894
style, the 
identification like Broadway 

02:01:50.895 --> 02:01:55.590
musicals which 
suggested that

02:01:59.182 --> 02:02:01.487
 transsend can't the strength to

02:02:01.488 --> 02:02:07.988
endure the status quo -- now 
that gay masculineity no 

02:02:07.989 --> 02:02:15.381
longer signaled -- and this 
shift sideline, whole 

02:02:15.382 --> 02:02:20.483
categories of gay existence, as 
many people came to 

02:02:20.484 --> 02:02:27.776
see antique in this new world.
          This macho term was 

02:02:27.777 --> 02:02:31.914
participantly unapted 
by gay --

02:02:37.306 --> 02:02:41.379
 Dennis atman, said our biggest 
failure was 

02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:45.675
the inability to foresee the 
extent in which a new 

02:02:45.676 --> 02:02:49.771
gay culture would emerge and 
build on male/female 

02:02:49.772 --> 02:02:53.762
differences.
          Another unapted result

02:02:54.064 --> 02:02:56.485
 of disco has to do 
with class and race.

02:02:56.486 --> 02:03:01.864
          Now, no doubt, sub
cultures tend toward the 

02:03:01.865 --> 02:03:04.604
tribal. And the culture of gay 
disco was no

02:03:09.547 --> 02:03:15.983
about far to ready that 
gay disco constituted entirely 

02:03:15.984 --> 02:03:20.783
this democratic -- 
but it is clear to me at least 

02:03:20.784 --> 02:03:24.484
that A list gay disco
discos, those that required a 

02:03:24.485 --> 02:03:30.774
good amount of money 
to join, had a problematic 

02:03:30.775 --> 02:03:39.418
effect. I mean, it could 
be very difficult to get passed 

02:03:39.419 --> 02:03:43.111
the doorman in 
certain clubs, close to im

02:03:43.112 --> 02:03:46.251
possible if you were a 
women. Bet

02:03:51.082 --> 02:03:53.650
 mid-letter was denied --

02:03:56.764 --> 02:04:02.452
          So, you know, at the 
same time, there was 

02:04:02.453 --> 02:04:07.566
the sense of brotherly love, as 
I've indicated, it 

02:04:07.567 --> 02:04:12.686
had a distinct downturn. It was 
the pull towards a 

02:04:12.687 --> 02:04:18.407
greater class and racial 
homogeneity --

02:04:23.074 --> 02:04:26.089
 made for gay 
club that's were increasingly 

02:04:26.090 --> 02:04:29.359
segletted along class 
and race lines.

02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:35.308
          So the racial and 
class crossings that had 

02:04:35.309 --> 02:04:39.055
for so long characterizeed gay 
communeityies --

02:04:42.884 --> 02:04:43.722
 that 
began to fade.

02:04:43.723 --> 02:04:47.300
          Something else I think
 that gay liberation

02:04:47.301 --> 02:04:49.241
liberationist didn't get quite 
right with the 

02:04:49.242 --> 02:04:53.232
relationship of new gay commune
ityies toityies to commerce, as 

02:04:53.233 --> 02:04:56.929
it happens, the beneficiary of

02:05:01.172 --> 02:05:03.929
 -- it was not gay 
liberation, it was the discos 

02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:09.199
and bathhouse that's 
emerged that really became the 

02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:10.583
kind of glue for 
communeity.

02:05:10.584 --> 02:05:17.094
          Now, despite discos, 
the possible down 

02:05:17.095 --> 02:05:21.543
side, again that could be debate
ed, the commercialism 

02:05:21.544 --> 02:05:25.662
of disco culture, it was 
nonetheless that gay men of 

02:05:25.663 --> 02:05:31.799
the 70's comarterred a course 
that made them feel

02:05:36.038 --> 02:05:40.279
 was on the disco 
dance floor, so many bodies 

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:46.861
becoming one that gay 
men created an sexual powerful 

02:05:46.862 --> 02:05:49.687
feeling of solidarity
solidarity.

02:05:49.688 --> 02:05:55.408
          What I say might seem 
counter intuitive -- 

02:05:55.409 --> 02:05:57.409
the

02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:04.401
 (inaudible) seems to enabled 
communal aspiration 

02:06:04.402 --> 02:06:09.309
as Michael Warner has argued 
rather than impedeing it

02:06:09.310 --> 02:06:15.521
it.
          When gay manmen began 

02:06:15.522 --> 02:06:17.658
to fall sick and die 
of AIDS --

02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:24.720
 those discos became their real 
support 

02:06:24.721 --> 02:06:27.232
communicationity.
          And I'm going to end 

02:06:27.233 --> 02:06:28.792
here.
          Thank you. 

02:06:28.793 --> 02:06:30.793
          (APPLAUSE).

02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:59.419
          (APPLAUSE).
          Hello everyone. I hope

02:08:59.973 --> 02:09:02.259
 everyone is getting 
excited for the rest of today. 

02:09:02.647 --> 02:09:06.492
There's a lot of 
awesome stuff going on and we 

02:09:06.493 --> 02:09:09.646
really appreciate you 
being here throughout the 

02:09:09.647 --> 02:09:17.311
symposium. I'm one of the 
produceers of museum. I come 

02:09:17.312 --> 02:09:23.305
from a conduct torFrench 
horn player, art's administrator

02:09:23.315 --> 02:09:26.468
 pedigree, and it's 
with great pleasure that we're 

02:09:26.469 --> 02:09:29.558
gathering here on 
stage to do a bit of a 

02:09:29.559 --> 02:09:33.253
discussion and open it occupy 
for your questions and we have 

02:09:33.254 --> 02:09:39.268
Martin anallis and 
bill back on stage that have 

02:09:39.269 --> 02:09:43.331
given wonderful 
lectures, giving a range of 

02:09:43.332 --> 02:09:46.470
different element that's 
go into dance culture, from the 

02:09:46.471 --> 02:09:48.899
disco era and

02:09:53.297 --> 02:09:54.703
 -- 
          I would like to ask 

02:09:54.704 --> 02:09:58.549
you where is disco now 
compareed to where it was ten 

02:09:58.550 --> 02:10:01.688
years ago in terms of 
culture memory?

02:10:01.689 --> 02:10:06.240
          In terms of cultural 
memory? I think 

02:10:06.241 --> 02:10:09.569
everything has changed. One of 
the things that I was 

02:10:09.570 --> 02:10:13.069
very struck by when I first 
began writing about 

02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:17.315
disco, I think it was 1994, I 
published an article 

02:10:17.316 --> 02:10:21.523
in the L A weekly, and oh my 
goodnesses, some of the 

02:10:21.524 --> 02:10:27.580
letters to the editor were so 
vicious. I was shocked

02:10:27.581 --> 02:10:29.859
shocked.
          And I was used to 

02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:37.665
disco hateers. Disco, 
although I was a DJ, an arbor 

02:10:37.666 --> 02:10:41.618
was a punc town and 
those lines were very much drawn

02:10:41.625 --> 02:10:47.466
 in the 70's and 80
80's. When my book came out in 

02:10:47.467 --> 02:10:51.941
2010 was an entirely 
different environment, for the 

02:10:51.942 --> 02:10:55.034
most part young 
people don't know about disco 

02:10:55.035 --> 02:10:58.191
phobia or when it was 
the biggest cultural joke of the

02:10:59.603 --> 02:11:02.146
 20est century. So I 
think everything has shifted and

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:10.253
 disco permeates 
popular music. Disco never died.

02:11:10.254 --> 02:11:13.907
 I think it's -- I 
think it's entirely different 

02:11:13.908 --> 02:11:19.331
now, and to answer you 
fully would take too much time, 

02:11:19.332 --> 02:11:24.038
but I think it is 
true that in some sense the 

02:11:24.039 --> 02:11:29.707
culture wars in the U.S.
U.S., people usually focus on 

02:11:29.708 --> 02:11:31.969
abortion, let's say 
affirmative action, but I think 

02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:38.640
the ER A in the 70's 
and beyond I think disco was 

02:11:38.641 --> 02:11:40.532
very much a part of the 
cultural wars.

02:11:40.533 --> 02:11:45.799
          Martin can you say on 
disco and other 

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:49.074
countries and how they're 
similar or how they're 

02:11:49.075 --> 02:11:53.292
different?
          Yeah, especially with 

02:11:53.293 --> 02:11:58.426
relation to the 
contemporary question -- disco 

02:11:58.427 --> 02:12:02.249
changed and perhaps 
out of some embarrassment

02:12:05.296 --> 02:12:08.240
 of character and so on and 
associations with gay subculture

02:12:08.389 --> 02:12:14.359
s and so on which 
helped to marginalize it as kind

02:12:14.835 --> 02:12:19.063
 of a movement, but 
then it begins transformed into 

02:12:19.064 --> 02:12:22.045
the dance music.
          We can't imagine the 

02:12:22.046 --> 02:12:27.858
last 30, 40 music 
without dance music being front 

02:12:27.859 --> 02:12:33.284
and center, whether 
it's transmusic, house music, 

02:12:33.285 --> 02:12:39.391
and on and on, the 
genre's pro-live rated in some 

02:12:39.392 --> 02:12:42.828
sense but disco 
provided that moment for all of 

02:12:42.829 --> 02:12:46.527
it.
          And the folks that I 

02:12:46.528 --> 02:12:49.953
mentioned in in my 
presentation -- I might have 

02:12:49.954 --> 02:12:52.177
lost sound --
          Yeah -- 

02:12:52.178 --> 02:12:55.900
          But the folks that I 
mention inside my 

02:12:55.901 --> 02:13:00.037
presentation such as the music 
in South Africa, 

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:07.265
which is a music that's run on 
automated digital 

02:13:07.266 --> 02:13:10.303
machinery, the technology that 
came into the 

02:13:10.304 --> 02:13:13.945
mainstream at that point. The TR
33 drum machine for 

02:13:13.946 --> 02:13:18.806
example, is as being a place 
where you can organize 

02:13:18.807 --> 02:13:22.646
rhythms using a different way of
 interfaceing with 

02:13:22.647 --> 02:13:26.177
your machines, it was no longer 
embodied work 

02:13:26.178 --> 02:13:33.629
usually doing by a white male --
 now you have a drum 

02:13:33.630 --> 02:13:37.565
machine -- in South Africa is 
one of the first music 

02:13:37.566 --> 02:13:42.982
to which you can now purely 
dance. And the music 

02:13:42.983 --> 02:13:49.957
also generates -- and sort of 
feedback loop between 

02:13:49.958 --> 02:13:53.352
continents produceed it, it's 
the house music that 

02:13:53.353 --> 02:13:58.917
slowed down this time and slow 
down music that is 

02:13:58.918 --> 02:14:03.474
ricocheting with American 
elements and then being re

02:14:03.475 --> 02:14:08.592
reAfricannizeed in other spaces.
          Early disco, although 

02:14:08.593 --> 02:14:15.528
disco was although 
attacked as plastic music for 

02:14:15.529 --> 02:14:18.074
plastic people, one of 
the correct isms that was made 

02:14:18.075 --> 02:14:23.342
-- early disco did 
not use synthesizeers or drum 

02:14:23.343 --> 02:14:29.292
machines, but in the 
early years, it wasn't a feature

02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:33.457
 they used.
          Question for bill is 

02:14:33.458 --> 02:14:41.405
how is the disco era 
and disco culture, in how its 

02:14:41.406 --> 02:14:44.441
portrayed in moving 
images -- has there been

02:14:48.261 --> 02:14:54.095
 how studio 54 portrayed -- 
where the pure disco CD's from 

02:14:54.096 --> 02:14:58.048
the 90's.
          I haven't seen the 

02:14:58.049 --> 02:15:01.484
movie 54, but there's a 
TV show called the get down, 

02:15:01.485 --> 02:15:07.158
which is a disco based 
show, and I watched about two or

02:15:07.474 --> 02:15:11.311
 three episodes and 
I couldn't watch it anymore. It 

02:15:11.312 --> 02:15:13.582
was so packaged for 
commercial TV.

02:15:13.583 --> 02:15:16.881
          And it's

02:15:19.952 --> 02:15:23.711
 had some of the limits of the 
disco that I remember, but it 

02:15:23.712 --> 02:15:25.712
was

02:15:27.235 --> 02:15:32.033
 that particular 
time was so unique, and like I 

02:15:32.034 --> 02:15:35.889
said, before there 
was so many factors that 

02:15:35.890 --> 02:15:42.563
contributeed to that perfect 
storm, that you cancer really --

02:15:42.782 --> 02:15:46.003
 you can't do that 
again, for example -- you 

02:15:46.004 --> 02:15:48.531
couldn't create a disco 
again, because it's a different 

02:15:48.532 --> 02:15:50.532
time.

02:15:55.355 --> 02:15:57.797
And the issues and people are 
different. I 

02:15:57.798 --> 02:16:00.381
haven't seen anything currently 
that really really 

02:16:00.382 --> 02:16:05.331
captures the essence of what I I
 saw during that 

02:16:05.332 --> 02:16:08.466
period.
          One question for all 

02:16:08.467 --> 02:16:10.751
of you which is going 
to be very

02:16:14.032 --> 02:16:16.857
 pragmatic for the library of 
Congress -- 

02:16:16.858 --> 02:16:21.817
what are the roles of archives 
and museums in terms 

02:16:21.818 --> 02:16:25.663
of provideing access that could 
happen about an era 

02:16:25.664 --> 02:16:30.059
or a musical movement such as 
disco and is there 

02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:34.460
significance that the library of
 Congress promoting 

02:16:34.461 --> 02:16:37.340
disco, does that do something 
for the study of disco 

02:16:37.341 --> 02:16:40.886
or is more important that local 
public libraryies are 

02:16:40.887 --> 02:16:43.575
doing something related to it --
 I would like to 

02:16:43.576 --> 02:16:46.141
open the floor on that kind of 
topic.

02:16:46.142 --> 02:16:49.690
          I would love to have 
it happening at all 

02:16:49.691 --> 02:16:53.248
levels, I think it's wonderful 
that the library of 

02:16:53.249 --> 02:16:57.236
Congress has put this event on, 
I think it's tear if 

02:16:57.237 --> 02:17:00.923
I can. But I know in my own 
research what was really 

02:17:00.924 --> 02:17:08.058
important to me was going to 
England actually, and 

02:17:08.059 --> 02:17:11.451
using some libraryies in England
 where I was able to 

02:17:11.452 --> 02:17:17.456
look at the mucus press, because
 the music press in 

02:17:17.457 --> 02:17:22.689
Britain actually was much more 
systemic to this new 

02:17:22.690 --> 02:17:25.811
sound than to say reallying 
stone or some of the 

02:17:25.812 --> 02:17:28.811
American music press so, in my 
own research it was 

02:17:28.812 --> 02:17:32.500
really importance.
          I mean, it's 

02:17:32.501 --> 02:17:37.607
fascinating -- I don't do a 
lot of archival work in disco 

02:17:37.608 --> 02:17:42.541
but from the project 
that I alludeed to today in my 

02:17:42.542 --> 02:17:44.752
presentation, I'm look 
at the global

02:17:48.751 --> 02:17:51.716
 biography of music and sounds 
from 

02:17:51.717 --> 02:17:57.583
Africa and taking up dance music
 forms in the West 

02:17:57.584 --> 02:18:01.079
and classical music forms that's
 broadly speaking 

02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:04.066
where my project is to find out 
how this actually 

02:18:04.067 --> 02:18:07.515
happens historically, I have 
been dependent on 

02:18:07.516 --> 02:18:11.596
libraryies mainly in Europe but 
also here, that 

02:18:11.597 --> 02:18:17.173
indicated what kind of contact 
was there, what was 

02:18:17.174 --> 02:18:21.336
ethical transcriptions, what 
letters were written 

02:18:21.337 --> 02:18:26.847
through a exposeer and say an 
African -- and the 

02:18:26.848 --> 02:18:29.018
movement of tape and cassette 
and vinyl and 

02:18:29.019 --> 02:18:35.280
computers, all this media that 
carryies imprints of 

02:18:35.281 --> 02:18:39.703
what might have happened.
          Reconstructing history

02:18:40.184 --> 02:18:45.440
 is a no means feet 
-- it is assumeed by some of us 

02:18:45.441 --> 02:18:48.585
that have liveed 
through certain period, it needs

02:18:48.586 --> 02:18:51.173
 to leave traces and 
documents, and I think library

02:18:51.317 --> 02:18:55.420
ies are essential, even 
if they don't seem very 

02:18:55.421 --> 02:19:00.984
populated spaces it takes 
the research to bring it back, 

02:19:00.985 --> 02:19:03.115
libraryies have been 
essential.

02:19:03.116 --> 02:19:06.497
          The only thing I can 
comment on that is 

02:19:06.498 --> 02:19:12.358
there was an article in German 
rolling stone in 

02:19:12.359 --> 02:19:16.300
November, and I had it translate
ed by my German 

02:19:16.301 --> 02:19:19.292
friend and they used pictures 
from my book to 

02:19:19.293 --> 02:19:24.716
illustrate it, and writer 
described how back in the 

02:19:24.717 --> 02:19:30.674
early Nazi days, there was kind 
of what was the 

02:19:30.675 --> 02:19:36.952
disco of today in a sense that 
the youth who are 

02:19:36.953 --> 02:19:44.319
maybe politically apathetical, 
or apolitical, they 

02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:50.462
would meet under ground and they
 would dance, and it 

02:19:50.463 --> 02:19:53.734
was kind of a rebellion sort of 
thing but they would 

02:19:53.735 --> 02:19:56.409
do that and then talk a little 
bit about what we're 

02:19:56.410 --> 02:19:59.153
going to do and the politics and
 the things that 

02:19:59.154 --> 02:20:02.461
were going on. But it was really
 like a celebration 

02:20:02.462 --> 02:20:05.274
of just being not part of what 
was happening in the 

02:20:05.275 --> 02:20:07.559
world -- it was like a private 
event.

02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:13.205
          So, he was trying to 
sort of trace back 

02:20:13.206 --> 02:20:16.366
what happened in New York, to 
that early

02:20:19.883 --> 02:20:22.876
 1939 era.
          I would say also, just

02:20:23.019 --> 02:20:26.760
 to add this, I mean
mean, since the early adopters 

02:20:26.761 --> 02:20:32.757
of disco music were 
marginalizeed groups, it's 

02:20:32.758 --> 02:20:36.829
especially important that 
we have documentation, and it 

02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:39.265
makes specially 
difficult too.

02:20:39.266 --> 02:20:42.642
          How would you document
 your DJ sets if you 

02:20:42.643 --> 02:20:46.343
were to do it all over again?
          That would be easy 

02:20:46.344 --> 02:20:49.327
actually -- yeah. It's 
not difficult.

02:20:49.328 --> 02:20:52.620
          &gt;&gt; You use sound cloud
 --

02:20:52.621 --> 02:20:55.860
          &gt;&gt; I don't myself -- 
believe me, I hardly 

02:20:55.861 --> 02:20:59.445
have the time. But I have some 
of of those set 

02:20:59.446 --> 02:21:04.960
that's are written down, and I 
had beats per minutes 

02:21:04.961 --> 02:21:08.254
chart, and so -- I didn't do 
this for a very long 

02:21:08.255 --> 02:21:12.361
time, it was only for a few 
years, so I have a 

02:21:12.362 --> 02:21:15.800
pretty good sense of what I 
would segway, and I 

02:21:15.801 --> 02:21:19.890
practiced a lot, I was not a 
natural born mixer, so 

02:21:19.891 --> 02:21:24.192
making that segway from one song
 to next which was 

02:21:24.193 --> 02:21:28.034
so critical you had to do it 
seamlessly -- I would 

02:21:28.035 --> 02:21:33.605
practice a lot and make tape for
 friends and I have 

02:21:33.606 --> 02:21:37.955
some of those tapes.
          With your photography 

02:21:37.956 --> 02:21:41.392
how do you archive 
it or do you -- you have to do 

02:21:41.393 --> 02:21:45.798
that or else you're 
not going to be disseminateing 

02:21:45.799 --> 02:21:49.196
-- are you thinking it 
in the archival sense of where 

02:21:49.197 --> 02:21:53.336
it's going to go or 
just a working kind of archive?

02:21:53.337 --> 02:21:57.507
          It's a body of work 
that's now complete, 

02:21:57.508 --> 02:22:03.549
obviously, and the book that was
 produceed -- the 

02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:05.576
photographers, is volume of that
 work.

02:22:05.577 --> 02:22:10.692
          And it was trying to 
cover as much as we 

02:22:10.693 --> 02:22:14.122
could in a short space.
          I have

02:22:17.770 --> 02:22:22.331
 4 or 500 rows of film, and two 
or 

02:22:22.332 --> 02:22:24.609
three other volume that's could 
be produceed from 

02:22:24.610 --> 02:22:28.365
there and they would have 
different feelings to them

02:22:28.366 --> 02:22:30.878
them, different covering 
different subject matter.

02:22:30.879 --> 02:22:37.403
          But, it's all just on 
my computer at this 

02:22:37.404 --> 02:22:41.953
point. And I do get requests 
from different people 

02:22:41.954 --> 02:22:46.652
for different purposes, articles
 and -- do you have 

02:22:46.653 --> 02:22:51.063
a picture of the club, that kind
 of thing.

02:22:51.064 --> 02:22:56.170
          So, it's ji sitting 
there at this point.

02:22:56.171 --> 02:23:01.034
          Cool. Just add 
something -- since we're 

02:23:01.035 --> 02:23:04.173
talking about documentation and 
archives and so on 

02:23:04.174 --> 02:23:08.318
and the challenge that the 
archive presents and non-

02:23:08.319 --> 02:23:11.328
non-archive. Just to amplify 
your point in relation 

02:23:11.329 --> 02:23:15.019
to some of the work that I'm 
doing, is not just 

02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:19.091
marginalizeed communeityies but 
in geographically 

02:23:19.092 --> 02:23:23.658
remote spaces, music tradition 
that's don't have a 

02:23:23.659 --> 02:23:29.475
record or a history of 
documentation by notation or 

02:23:29.476 --> 02:23:33.172
other modes of transmission -- 
sometimes more 

02:23:33.173 --> 02:23:36.704
effective than notation -- it's 
not saying it's 

02:23:36.705 --> 02:23:39.283
better it's just a different 
document that survives 

02:23:39.284 --> 02:23:43.833
a few more days of time. That 
challenges another 

02:23:43.834 --> 02:23:48.108
layer of particularly if you're 
trying to access 

02:23:48.109 --> 02:23:51.528
deep history.
          With some of the stuff

02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:55.544
 I was tracing, if 
you look at the Wikipedia page 

02:23:55.545 --> 02:24:02.606
or the mainstream 
media or the big media -- the 

02:24:02.607 --> 02:24:06.858
way in which the 
stories of these big songs is 

02:24:06.859 --> 02:24:11.143
full of information, 
so we've experienced ourselves 

02:24:11.144 --> 02:24:15.809
as being information 
edge, cornucopia all over and 

02:24:15.810 --> 02:24:21.782
there's primitive part 
of redundancy, memory 15 years 

02:24:21.783 --> 02:24:26.390
or so -- on the 
Beyonce page you may not be able

02:24:26.392 --> 02:24:30.642
 to find for that 
sock -- you won't be able to 

02:24:30.643 --> 02:24:36.305
find that many 
references that go beyond their 

02:24:36.306 --> 02:24:39.769
major label, you 
have to do additional work and 

02:24:39.770 --> 02:24:43.690
you can't enter it on 
the Wikipedia page because it 

02:24:43.691 --> 02:24:47.120
will throw you off -- 
it's got its rules. And you 

02:24:47.121 --> 02:24:50.511
can't get all the way to 
Africa because at this point 

02:24:50.512 --> 02:24:53.955
most of that 
information is just not known 

02:24:53.956 --> 02:24:57.337
even by the people 
producing the music so you have 

02:24:57.338 --> 02:24:58.352
a really deep 
challenge.

02:24:58.353 --> 02:25:01.502
          The other day I was 
talking in the 

02:25:01.503 --> 02:25:06.069
institution about some of this 
in relation of the 

02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:10.155
mathics practices in southern 
Africa, which was wipe

02:25:10.156 --> 02:25:12.156
wiped out as it happened. 

02:25:16.108 --> 02:25:22.074
You would after the lesson 
wipe off the record -- the rest 

02:25:22.075 --> 02:25:27.092
we have copyright -- 
emerging at the time -- so 

02:25:27.093 --> 02:25:30.331
different rules of the 
game mean that's the challenges 

02:25:30.332 --> 02:25:36.701
rough of the archive 
are real and as we move into a 

02:25:36.702 --> 02:25:40.314
global era where the 
copyright regime is in some 

02:25:40.315 --> 02:25:44.216
sense the dominant one 
we need to do serious 

02:25:44.217 --> 02:25:47.281
constructive work. We depend 
on the archives.

02:25:47.282 --> 02:25:51.310
          The library of 
Congress is the home of the 

02:25:51.311 --> 02:25:56.938
U.S. copyright office and so 
many of our music holds 

02:25:56.939 --> 02:26:02.285
is where we have the copyright 
deposit of I will 

02:26:02.286 --> 02:26:05.050
survive or other things like 
that and going back to 

02:26:05.051 --> 02:26:10.043
the late 1870's -- in your 
unique professional world

02:26:10.044 --> 02:26:14.297
world, in relation to each other
, what is the 

02:26:14.298 --> 02:26:19.321
important role of copyright and 
how does it differ 

02:26:19.322 --> 02:26:22.560
based on the medium that's 
you're seeking -- Alice 

02:26:22.561 --> 02:26:27.654
if you're sampling it -- sample
ing as a DJ, how 

02:26:27.655 --> 02:26:30.983
cognizant are you of the 
copyright situation O bill, 

02:26:30.984 --> 02:26:36.667
when you're managing your 
collection of photographs, 

02:26:36.668 --> 02:26:39.345
are you very flexible with their
 use, or something 

02:26:39.346 --> 02:26:44.056
that you stick close to and then
 for Martin do you 

02:26:44.057 --> 02:26:49.003
maybe place barriers with 
copyright for your own 

02:26:49.004 --> 02:26:53.472
scholarship -- you don't have to
 answer those and 

02:26:53.473 --> 02:26:58.584
just jump on copyright wherever.
          Copyright is really 

02:26:58.585 --> 02:27:02.505
important for 
photography and even copyright, 

02:27:02.506 --> 02:27:05.655
it doesn't protect 
people from using my images, 

02:27:05.656 --> 02:27:08.174
especially with the 
Internet, that's the big problem

02:27:08.335 --> 02:27:11.174
 for me. All the 
image that's I have in this body

02:27:11.316 --> 02:27:15.873
 of work for disco 
are copyrighted through the 

02:27:15.874 --> 02:27:18.853
library of Congress, but 
I have the software program that

02:27:19.005 --> 02:27:23.970
 shows me in the 
world is using images and it's 

02:27:23.971 --> 02:27:28.725
astonishing, all over 
the world, announceing some club

02:27:28.729 --> 02:27:34.236
 opening will be one 
of my pictures -- so, there's 

02:27:34.237 --> 02:27:36.355
not much that I can do 
about it. 

02:27:36.356 --> 02:27:41.091
          The way I see it, if 
it's being used for a 

02:27:41.092 --> 02:27:44.299
real commercial money making 
usage, then I can 

02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:49.153
actually go after them and let 
them know, take it 

02:27:49.154 --> 02:27:54.576
down or pay me something.
          But, copyrighting, I 

02:27:54.577 --> 02:27:58.718
know there's been 
some changes in terms of traffic

02:27:58.967 --> 02:28:01.661
 copyrighting lately
lately, and I'm not really up on

02:28:01.811 --> 02:28:06.654
 it, but I know it's 
become much more difficult and 

02:28:06.655 --> 02:28:10.341
harder for 
photographers and I would like 

02:28:10.342 --> 02:28:13.794
to see that easeed 
down.

02:28:13.795 --> 02:28:19.701
          Well, copyright, I 
mean, it's been decades 

02:28:19.702 --> 02:28:24.748
since I was teaching, so, I mean
, I guess

02:28:28.562 --> 02:28:31.957
 I had 
problems when I was writing 

02:28:31.958 --> 02:28:39.380
books getting the 
ability it quote lyrics and 

02:28:39.381 --> 02:28:42.092
obviously you know in 
today's world you cannot quote 

02:28:42.093 --> 02:28:44.363
very much, and that's 
kind of a drag.

02:28:44.364 --> 02:28:46.629
          On the other hand, you
 know somebody who 

02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:52.143
writes, it pains me when I go 
online and I see 

02:28:52.144 --> 02:28:55.586
somebody has downloaded my whole
 book, whether it's 

02:28:55.587 --> 02:29:00.383
the Janice book or the disco 
book or any other book, 

02:29:00.384 --> 02:29:04.237
can we do something about this, 
maybe for a week but 

02:29:04.238 --> 02:29:09.642
it will come back up. So 
copyright --

02:29:09.643 --> 02:29:11.925
          I'm going to switch 
the question a little 

02:29:11.926 --> 02:29:17.034
bit to the content of some of 
the work rather than 

02:29:17.035 --> 02:29:20.012
the problems I have encountered 
which are similar to 

02:29:20.013 --> 02:29:22.628
both of you and I think it's the
 central issue of 

02:29:22.629 --> 02:29:26.613
our time. We have a kind of 
micro economy which is 

02:29:26.614 --> 02:29:30.841
deeply fueled by new technology
ies in music 

02:29:30.842 --> 02:29:35.386
exacerbated by the MP3 effect by
 Napster, which 

02:29:35.387 --> 02:29:43.523
means the geneie of the form 
came out of the bottle 

02:29:43.524 --> 02:29:47.211
and became free and a period of 
time were the 

02:29:47.212 --> 02:29:52.754
commodity debates rational sound
 are free and the 

02:29:52.755 --> 02:29:58.402
concept that's have become 
expensive. So, a huge 

02:29:58.403 --> 02:30:02.564
increase in prices in music 
concert watching -- 

02:30:02.565 --> 02:30:05.953
          Because that's how 
artists can make their 

02:30:05.954 --> 02:30:08.695
money now.
          &gt;&gt; That's right. The 

02:30:08.696 --> 02:30:14.081
way -- in this pre
precopyright age where you have 

02:30:14.082 --> 02:30:16.919
to become the 
contributor -- this is the 

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:20.081
fascinating problem -- I 
would take the work that I 

02:30:20.082 --> 02:30:23.859
presented is a number of 
serious copyright issue that's 

02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:27.283
emerge, and in many 
artists being used along the way

02:30:27.444 --> 02:30:34.554
, it's a corporate 
endeavor which is practice in 

02:30:34.555 --> 02:30:38.546
the industry, the 
authors are not the one that's 

02:30:38.547 --> 02:30:42.358
are necessarily 
properly money advertise inside 

02:30:42.359 --> 02:30:48.937
that arrangement. 
You have Peter Hugo as a 

02:30:48.938 --> 02:30:55.481
photographer, he makes an 
appearance in his work --

02:30:59.141 --> 02:31:03.685
 people are less aware of 
queer transfigure from New 

02:31:03.686 --> 02:31:08.797
Orleans, doing some 
social work by drawing attention

02:31:08.804 --> 02:31:12.801
 to these intense 
beautiful and powerful sub

02:31:12.802 --> 02:31:17.832
cultures but at the same 
time, the sample of the voice is

02:31:17.846 --> 02:31:21.187
 left unmon 
advertiseed. So you have this 

02:31:21.188 --> 02:31:24.894
difference but the 
political economy under cuts 

02:31:24.895 --> 02:31:28.175
against the grain of 
the deeper message of those 

02:31:28.176 --> 02:31:30.706
songs.
          So in the song I 

02:31:30.707 --> 02:31:32.707
presented was paid

02:31:36.283 --> 02:31:39.252
 -- it 
didn't start there -- that's why

02:31:39.564 --> 02:31:42.971
 I was giving you 
the layers, the irony, everybody

02:31:42.979 --> 02:31:47.370
 that was not the 
artist got a piece of the pie 

02:31:47.371 --> 02:31:51.505
but the through artist 
at the source, there's always a 

02:31:51.506 --> 02:31:55.792
source behind the 
source but we can push it a 

02:31:55.793 --> 02:31:58.579
little further -- the 
respect for the proper demands 

02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:04.982
of the author concept 
is very often in a crisis today,

02:32:05.013 --> 02:32:08.889
 and we feel it.
          The copyright office 

02:32:08.890 --> 02:32:13.140
has put together a 
really fun thing which is a 

02:32:13.141 --> 02:32:17.394
westbound page dedicated 
to exploreing copyright through 

02:32:17.395 --> 02:32:24.643
disco, and it's 
copyright.gov/disco, you can 

02:32:24.644 --> 02:32:29.184
explore the catalog to 
see what types of registration 

02:32:29.185 --> 02:32:35.311
came in, you will see 
that gloria Gaynor did not write

02:32:37.844 --> 02:32:41.124
 I will survive.
          Tonight you can get a 

02:32:41.125 --> 02:32:45.409
fun introduction of 
copyright, you get a present out

02:32:45.412 --> 02:32:49.515
 of your photo and 
the basics of copyright process 

02:32:49.516 --> 02:32:52.342
and how important it 
is to creators.

02:32:52.343 --> 02:32:55.484
          Make us all more aware
 of that process.

02:32:55.485 --> 02:32:59.734
          So before we open it 
up to Q&amp;A -- I would 

02:32:59.735 --> 02:33:03.034
like to ask one more question --
 where do you see 

02:33:03.035 --> 02:33:08.595
disco's reception in ten years 
compareed to where we 

02:33:08.596 --> 02:33:10.596
are now?

02:33:17.543 --> 02:33:20.263
I think, certainly one of the 
things that 

02:33:20.264 --> 02:33:24.221
I found fascinating of what's 
happened -- we started 

02:33:24.222 --> 02:33:27.938
talking about the cultural 
memory around disco, and 

02:33:27.939 --> 02:33:32.966
I think certainly, one of the 
things that I was 

02:33:32.967 --> 02:33:35.752
struck bias I was writing my 
book is the extent 

02:33:35.753 --> 02:33:41.001
disco had been treated as a kind
 of joke in its time 

02:33:41.002 --> 02:33:47.125
had become for both queer 
artists and artists who in 

02:33:47.126 --> 02:33:51.906
some respects allyies, everybody
 from the pet shop 

02:33:51.907 --> 02:33:59.527
boys to lady gaga and beyond, 
that disco had become 

02:33:59.528 --> 02:34:03.889
understood not as a kind of 
regressive political and 

02:34:03.890 --> 02:34:07.875
musical move but rather as trans
guesssive because of 

02:34:07.876 --> 02:34:12.581
the dissociations with gay 
liberation, and this real 

02:34:12.582 --> 02:34:15.552
break with the past of 
repression.

02:34:15.553 --> 02:34:19.248
          I think it's very hard
 to know what the 

02:34:19.249 --> 02:34:25.070
future is.
          And how disco is going

02:34:25.812 --> 02:34:29.080
 to be understood 
ten years down the line, but I 

02:34:29.081 --> 02:34:34.868
do think that 
probably this vilification and 

02:34:34.869 --> 02:34:38.174
demonization of disco 
is probably behind us.

02:34:38.175 --> 02:34:42.057
          Great.
          I think that -- I 

02:34:42.058 --> 02:34:46.576
don't think that the 
perception of disco from that 

02:34:46.577 --> 02:34:52.080
era is ever going to 
really change. I think it is 

02:34:52.081 --> 02:34:55.782
what it is. But I think 
the music itself has evolveed 

02:34:55.783 --> 02:34:59.953
certainly -- after New 
York it went to Chicago and 

02:34:59.954 --> 02:35:07.260
became house music, and 
went to Detroit, it's EDM and I 

02:35:07.261 --> 02:35:14.183
can what happened in 
my case was in early 2000 this 

02:35:14.184 --> 02:35:20.811
record producer who 
produces what's contemporary ED 

02:35:20.812 --> 02:35:26.119
DM umusic, all of a 
sudden these younger people 

02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:30.926
realize this comes from 
disco, so I think that there's a

02:35:32.345 --> 02:35:36.194
 new respect for 
disco in a sense, as being the 

02:35:36.195 --> 02:35:40.433
source of a lot of 
the new music that's out there 

02:35:40.434 --> 02:35:45.440
today. And, yeah, I 
think that's changed a little 

02:35:45.441 --> 02:35:47.441
bit of the

02:35:49.546 --> 02:35:53.545
 feeling of 
the kind of sillyiness of what 

02:35:53.546 --> 02:35:57.643
we think of as disco 
back then. But I think it's 

02:35:57.644 --> 02:36:04.785
evolveed. Martin do you 
have any thoughts? 

02:36:04.786 --> 02:36:08.104
          Beside of occurring 
kind of retro--

02:36:14.595 --> 02:36:17.270
 speak 
busy music history as becoming 

02:36:17.271 --> 02:36:20.719
retrothat looks back 
and picks up pieces and he's not

02:36:21.832 --> 02:36:24.566
 excited about that, 
he thinks it's eating on the 

02:36:24.567 --> 02:36:28.811
seats of culture.
          But I think I would 

02:36:28.812 --> 02:36:33.541
take the line that has 
been suggested by both of the 

02:36:33.542 --> 02:36:37.612
previous speakers in 
the following sense, in some 

02:36:37.613 --> 02:36:42.626
sense disco kind of 
went out in the way to these 

02:36:42.627 --> 02:36:45.292
multiply multiplypel dance forms

02:36:45.293 --> 02:36:50.007
-- if we look at the shifting of
 time, the that

02:36:50.008 --> 02:36:55.661
thattening of harmonic space is 
such that anicut the 

02:36:55.662 --> 02:36:58.951
functional principal of cords 
moving in traditional 

02:36:58.952 --> 02:37:04.065
ways, think Donna summer, the 
extended space, the 

02:37:04.066 --> 02:37:08.249
fact of what was once a high hat
 in the off beat 

02:37:08.250 --> 02:37:14.974
that became a dominant sound of 
mainstream dance 

02:37:14.975 --> 02:37:21.450
music as well as IDM and IDM -- 
in terms of the 

02:37:21.451 --> 02:37:24.703
grammar beactually find that's a
 perspective toll 

02:37:24.704 --> 02:37:28.939
moment that in one sense could 
argue generateed an 

02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:34.210
after life which is much bigger,
 and the question of 

02:37:34.211 --> 02:37:39.785
the focal point of a historical 
emanating moment, I 

02:37:39.786 --> 02:37:46.061
think is hard to contest.
          I think it really did 

02:37:46.062 --> 02:37:49.733
shift pop music, 
musical architecture in very 

02:37:49.734 --> 02:37:55.160
important ways, and I 
suspect it's going to continue 

02:37:55.161 --> 02:37:58.144
to have an influence 
-- there's nothing to indicate 

02:37:58.145 --> 02:38:00.723
this is changing any 
time soon.

02:38:00.724 --> 02:38:04.355
          Fascinating -- the 
time is here for you to 

02:38:04.356 --> 02:38:07.640
ask the experts, so to speak -- 
there are microphone

02:38:07.641 --> 02:38:10.062
microphones at the front of the 
aisle on either side

02:38:10.063 --> 02:38:13.453
side, if you wouldn't mind 
walking up to the 

02:38:13.454 --> 02:38:17.570
microphones and sharing your 
question, and as soon 

02:38:17.571 --> 02:38:21.078
as you have asked your question 
you're free to 

02:38:21.079 --> 02:38:24.285
return to your seat.
          I have a question for 

02:38:24.286 --> 02:38:26.561
bill -- I first saw 
the body of work you were 

02:38:26.562 --> 02:38:33.100
sharing at a different 
institution, New York museum of 

02:38:33.101 --> 02:38:35.514
sex where it had 
been installed in a separate 

02:38:35.515 --> 02:38:39.194
room with a bar and 
everything, can you talk about 

02:38:39.195 --> 02:38:42.502
how that show you 
came about and what the purpose 

02:38:42.503 --> 02:38:47.360
of that was or --
          &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. There's

02:38:48.877 --> 02:38:54.280
 I guess about a 
year ago I got a call -- I live 

02:38:54.281 --> 02:38:58.388
in New York, from 
the curator of the museum of sex

02:38:58.398 --> 02:39:02.125
 on 5th avenue and 
27th street, and they were 

02:39:02.126 --> 02:39:08.798
looking for something 
to cover the disco era, and they

02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:13.115
 came across my book
book. The thing they looked boo 

02:39:13.116 --> 02:39:16.828
my book was the fact 
that they didn't want to focus 

02:39:16.829 --> 02:39:19.035
on celebrityies celebrityies, 
they 

02:39:19.036 --> 02:39:25.138
wanted to focus more on the 
culture of disco. So 

02:39:25.139 --> 02:39:30.107
they asked if they could use one
 of my pictures as a 

02:39:30.108 --> 02:39:34.812
subway add, and there was some 
discussion at some 

02:39:34.813 --> 02:39:40.615
point turning this into a 
exhibition. They ran the 

02:39:40.616 --> 02:39:43.361
add and we had later discussions
 and talked about 

02:39:43.362 --> 02:39:47.047
what we would do. And my general
 idea was that it 

02:39:47.048 --> 02:39:52.310
would be great if you could 
create a space which 

02:39:52.311 --> 02:39:56.625
they had actually, where you 
could walk in off the 

02:39:56.626 --> 02:40:02.984
street in 2017 back to 1997 and 
be in the -- have a 

02:40:02.985 --> 02:40:07.830
feeling of a disco in that time,
 and so that was 

02:40:07.831 --> 02:40:10.370
kind of where the starting point
 of it all.

02:40:10.371 --> 02:40:17.204
          So they did a terrific
 job creating the 

02:40:17.205 --> 02:40:21.061
lighting and rework the the 
entire room. There is a 

02:40:21.062 --> 02:40:25.032
bar there and they do serve 
drink from that era like 

02:40:25.033 --> 02:40:33.686
Long Island iced tea and at 1970
's prices too -- and 

02:40:33.687 --> 02:40:39.095
the exhibits were free too -- 
it's a good excuse to 

02:40:39.096 --> 02:40:43.795
go to the museum of sex. Most 
people don't want to 

02:40:43.796 --> 02:40:47.951
go -- it's free, and they picked
 out a selection of 

02:40:47.952 --> 02:40:54.884
my images that really describe 
about six or seven 

02:40:54.885 --> 02:40:58.749
different clubs, and they also 
added some picture 

02:40:58.750 --> 02:41:00.518
that's aren't in the book 
because of the sexual 

02:41:00.519 --> 02:41:03.419
nature of them, because I wanted
 to describe that 

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:06.412
part of it because it's a museum
 of sex.

02:41:06.413 --> 02:41:09.252
          And the literature 
really describes each 

02:41:09.253 --> 02:41:12.230
one of the clubs and how it 
started and who started 

02:41:12.231 --> 02:41:14.231
it and who went there --

02:41:17.485 --> 02:41:22.033
 and it's become very 
popular -- it was supposed to go

02:41:23.051 --> 02:41:27.438
 up until February 
and then they extended it 

02:41:27.439 --> 02:41:30.543
million the end of the 
year. If anyone is in New York 

02:41:30.544 --> 02:41:31.996
it's really a fun 
thing to do.

02:41:31.997 --> 02:41:36.007
          Sir?
          Hello. Thank you for 

02:41:36.008 --> 02:41:39.531
being here. My 
question obviously disco is 

02:41:39.532 --> 02:41:43.223
importance and that's 
why we're here. I feel like one 

02:41:43.224 --> 02:41:46.361
of the main theme 
that's coming out of this is 

02:41:46.362 --> 02:41:51.359
that disco created this 
inclusion andem appointment and 

02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:56.872
that's what made it 
important, but then it lends 

02:41:56.873 --> 02:42:03.005
itself to modification 
-- this is more of an open ended

02:42:03.008 --> 02:42:04.719
 question but I 
think it's one of the things 

02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:11.142
behind backlash against 
disco, and I wondered if the pan

02:42:11.179 --> 02:42:18.081
el has thoughts on 
inclusion empowerment and easy 

02:42:18.082 --> 02:42:20.366
demodification.
          I think you were asked

02:42:21.374 --> 02:42:23.374
 about

02:42:27.038 --> 02:42:32.759
the reasons of disco 
sort of the whipping boy, right?

02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:35.397
 I think it's 
interesting because I think it's

02:42:35.404 --> 02:42:40.999
 true certainly 
people that were in the gay 

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.546
movement political 
movement, assumed that it would 

02:42:45.547 --> 02:42:51.856
be communeity centers
centers, gay communeity centers 

02:42:51.857 --> 02:42:55.762
and gay communeity 
dances held in those centers and

02:42:55.925 --> 02:42:58.750
 the activities out 
of the centers that would become

02:42:59.756 --> 02:43:04.720
 the glue for gay 
men and their communeityies. And

02:43:05.174 --> 02:43:09.012
 I said in fact it 
turned out to be the bathhouses 

02:43:09.013 --> 02:43:16.569
and the discos. 
Dennis atman one of the gay 

02:43:16.570 --> 02:43:20.959
activists said he found 
it ironic and disappointing that

02:43:22.111 --> 02:43:29.355
 as gay men, I think 
also lesbians became freeer, 

02:43:29.356 --> 02:43:36.286
they also became more 
reliant on business institutions

02:43:36.289 --> 02:43:39.339
.
          I think that's true. 

02:43:39.353 --> 02:43:43.281
On the other hand, 
you have another bay writer, 

02:43:43.282 --> 02:43:49.097
this person from 
Britain, a cultural study 

02:43:49.098 --> 02:43:55.869
scholar, as early as 1979 
was making the argument that in 

02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:58.394
some of 
circumstances capital cultural 

02:43:58.395 --> 02:44:05.719
production, disco can 
produce an even transGreg result

02:44:06.293 --> 02:44:10.862
. So scholars debate 
commodification and have been 

02:44:10.863 --> 02:44:16.564
doing it for decades. 
They've been doing it since the 

02:44:16.565 --> 02:44:21.219
1920's. It turns out 
it would suggest there was a lot

02:44:21.374 --> 02:44:26.942
 wrong in the 1920's 
unincluding the income and 

02:44:26.943 --> 02:44:32.364
equality -- and because 
we've exceeded it but it's true 

02:44:32.365 --> 02:44:37.622
for people of color 
and women, people who in some 

02:44:37.623 --> 02:44:42.926
respects wereen the 
margin culturally, 

02:44:42.927 --> 02:44:46.584
commodification whether it was 
happening in the movies or the 

02:44:46.585 --> 02:44:49.987
spread of movies or 
the persuade of department 

02:44:49.988 --> 02:44:55.109
stores could have -- this 
may seem counter intuitive but 

02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:59.084
could be useed in ways 
to be understood to be 

02:44:59.085 --> 02:45:03.061
liberatory to those groups. A 
lot of scholar September really 

02:45:03.062 --> 02:45:05.887
debating this. Ad 
good question.

02:45:05.888 --> 02:45:10.752
          Also, I think I want 
to make two sort of 

02:45:10.753 --> 02:45:13.944
additional points about that, 
one is I'm not sure 

02:45:13.945 --> 02:45:20.405
that all forms of 
commodification are at some low 

02:45:20.406 --> 02:45:24.108
with some social project, when 
it comes to -- I'm 

02:45:24.109 --> 02:45:30.984
speculating a little bit, but 
these gay liberations, 

02:45:30.985 --> 02:45:32.985
it's deeply

02:45:34.364 --> 02:45:38.310
 in social and cultural icons 
and symbols symbols 

02:45:38.311 --> 02:45:42.173
that are on television and 
online, modern family and 

02:45:42.174 --> 02:45:46.748
stuff, that played a role, it 
wasn't just on the 

02:45:46.749 --> 02:45:52.291
pickle fence, picketingalgory, 
it was happening in a

02:45:57.381 --> 02:46:02.404
 I think the history 
of music, the role of automay 

02:46:02.405 --> 02:46:07.005
have technologyies has 
put people out of work. We have

02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:15.595
 -- music is the van 
guard of this. So back to the TR

02:46:18.010 --> 02:46:22.036
 -- in the context 
of house music became the way to

02:46:27.674 --> 02:46:32.081
 get up the party, 
and became surfacessha are like 

02:46:32.082 --> 02:46:34.082
yours, where people

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:43.043
if I form and headed 
to the technologyies where we're

02:46:43.454 --> 02:46:48.215
 going to put people 
out of work. I think it's a 

02:46:48.216 --> 02:46:52.164
tricky question, -- 
          I would also add that 

02:46:52.165 --> 02:46:57.266
one of the reasons 
that so many rock and rollers he

02:46:57.673 --> 02:47:03.247
 sented disco of 
course is that very many of 

02:47:03.248 --> 02:47:06.069
their clubs and bars 
were turned into discos and they

02:47:06.070 --> 02:47:10.088
 had no work.
          And that was a real 

02:47:10.089 --> 02:47:15.189
complaint. And an 
understandable grievance.

02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:20.439
          I'm up here in the 
back -- way up in the 

02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:22.861
back because I can't get down to
 the microphones 

02:47:22.862 --> 02:47:26.248
down there -- my question is for
 Alice, and I wanted 

02:47:26.249 --> 02:47:33.426
to ask about the phenomena of 
grace Jones and the 

02:47:33.427 --> 02:47:36.936
gay communeity during the disco 
era and if you have 

02:47:36.937 --> 02:47:41.930
any commence busy that 
particularly in reference to 

02:47:41.931 --> 02:47:45.315
the paradise garage which was a 
big meeting place 

02:47:45.316 --> 02:47:52.175
during the disco era that grace 
gone Jones was 

02:47:52.176 --> 02:47:57.254
practically royalty.
          Grace Jones a very 

02:47:57.255 --> 02:48:02.382
important figure, she 
turned up at studio 54 too -- 

02:48:02.383 --> 02:48:04.383
but the garage was

02:48:09.367 --> 02:48:13.905
important discos in New 
York City and it was important 

02:48:13.906 --> 02:48:18.838
because it resisted 
quite deliberately that

02:48:24.034 --> 02:48:32.116
 kind of exconclusionism that 
was in some discos. Again, the 

02:48:32.117 --> 02:48:37.239
people who -- medical 
was one of the those people that

02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:42.341
 I had in my talk 
were quite deliberate in trying 

02:48:42.342 --> 02:48:48.208
to make a space that 
really truly was inclusive and I

02:48:48.209 --> 02:48:51.585
 think grace Jones 
was a really importance figure 

02:48:51.586 --> 02:48:55.435
because whatever her 
own sexual desires, wherever 

02:48:55.436 --> 02:48:58.422
they went, I don't know 
anything about, but she was 

02:48:58.423 --> 02:49:02.988
certainly somebody who 
in the way that she presented as

02:49:05.408 --> 02:49:10.670
 queer, and so, she 
-- she could be understood, she 

02:49:10.671 --> 02:49:13.342
could be understood 
as arch ally, so I think she was

02:49:13.908 --> 02:49:18.457
 a very important 
figure, again, as I think the 

02:49:18.458 --> 02:49:20.893
women of label were as 
well.

02:49:20.894 --> 02:49:26.699
          I wanted to make a.
comment and add on to 

02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:29.126
the stuff you were talking about
 -- one of them is 

02:49:29.127 --> 02:49:33.532
that the disco era that music 
has been recycleed over 

02:49:33.533 --> 02:49:36.981
and over again, and one of the 
other things is the 

02:49:36.982 --> 02:49:39.990
musicians of that time they're 
still out there and 

02:49:39.991 --> 02:49:45.494
touring, we need to make sure we
 don't forget, the 

02:49:45.495 --> 02:49:49.327
gloria Gaynors, the bee jees 
were doing some stuff 

02:49:49.328 --> 02:49:53.200
before, some of the brothers 
started doing and some 

02:49:53.201 --> 02:49:57.576
of the musicians of that time 
are still touring, 

02:49:57.577 --> 02:50:05.119
that music is still alive -- the
 DJ's and young rap

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:10.052
rappers and musicians of today 
are sampling 

02:50:10.053 --> 02:50:13.361
tremendously of that era. So 
comment on what you're 

02:50:13.362 --> 02:50:17.205
saying where is the music going 
to -- I don't think 

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:21.599
it's going to ever die, someone
's always going to do 

02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:25.601
a 70's theme party, that's going
 on, it's an easy go 

02:50:25.602 --> 02:50:29.548
to, if you wanted to do to theme
 party -- it's 

02:50:29.549 --> 02:50:32.827
always going to be around but 
maybe change in some 

02:50:32.828 --> 02:50:37.127
instances but it's all going to 
be the core, 70's 

02:50:37.128 --> 02:50:41.382
music that core disco is always 
going to be there 

02:50:41.383 --> 02:50:44.924
and what it's going to be in the
 future?

02:50:44.925 --> 02:50:51.977
          In terms of rap, so 
much of the rhythmic 

02:50:51.978 --> 02:50:58.893
architecture of early rap was 
the sample used in the 

02:50:58.894 --> 02:51:04.613
first big crossover rap record.
          By grand master flash 

02:51:04.614 --> 02:51:07.844
or by the sugar hill 
gang -- I stand corrected.

02:51:07.845 --> 02:51:14.813
          It's absolutely true 
and inscapeable.

02:51:26.613 --> 02:51:32.892
Yes, exactly. Exactly.
          My question is having 

02:51:32.893 --> 02:51:36.772
liveed through all of 
that music and it's about the 

02:51:36.773 --> 02:51:41.284
beat, it distinguishes 
it and it's great for me to come

02:51:41.287 --> 02:51:46.948
 to this, for me it 
was all merging into one.  I was

02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:50.863
 going one time hear
hearingth wind and fire, the 

02:51:50.864 --> 02:51:52.864
next thing

02:51:54.235 --> 02:51:56.598
 -- the 
distinguish between the disco 

02:51:56.599 --> 02:52:00.444
until I came here, I 
knew who I liked, I would see 

02:52:00.445 --> 02:52:05.330
knowna Hendricks and 
all of them, but I didn't see 

02:52:05.331 --> 02:52:10.111
that clear distinction 
-- so that's why I agree with 

02:52:10.112 --> 02:52:13.253
her too I don't think 
it will ever go away, I just 

02:52:13.254 --> 02:52:17.250
think it kind of evolve
evolves as you said. But what 

02:52:17.251 --> 02:52:21.344
you mentioned a little 
bit -- but is it the base -- I 

02:52:21.345 --> 02:52:23.621
hear the base in 
everything -- but that's me.

02:52:23.622 --> 02:52:28.492
          So, what would you say
 is specifically the 

02:52:28.493 --> 02:52:33.481
beat in disco that distinguishes
 it from fung Dellic

02:52:33.482 --> 02:52:37.280
Dellics or anybody else? 
          That's a great 

02:52:37.281 --> 02:52:40.092
question. What really is 
disco.

02:52:40.093 --> 02:52:42.858
          I think the

02:52:45.998 --> 02:52:52.096
 fun was pretty important and 
that was deriveed from mow town.

02:52:52.097 --> 02:52:55.436
          I hear -- I see the 
different singers but 

02:52:55.437 --> 02:53:00.625
I'm trying -- 
          I think there are some

02:53:00.753 --> 02:53:04.591
 distinctions and 
this derive from the music 

02:53:04.592 --> 02:53:11.175
coming from Philadelphia 
-- and they were creating soul 

02:53:11.176 --> 02:53:17.238
music that was silky
silkier, there were different 

02:53:17.239 --> 02:53:20.764
instruments being used 
-- instead of the tropical bone 

02:53:20.765 --> 02:53:24.922
they would use the 
hop, they would use different 

02:53:24.923 --> 02:53:29.645
sounds and and they 
were going for a more deliberate

02:53:29.652 --> 02:53:32.769
ly sophisticated 
sound. That's why I was saying 

02:53:32.770 --> 02:53:36.161
in some sense you can 
understand what they were doing 

02:53:36.162 --> 02:53:40.754
as an active of 
rebellion against the nothing 

02:53:40.755 --> 02:53:46.129
that soul music had to 
sound a particular way. One of 

02:53:46.130 --> 02:53:49.563
my favorite quotes is 
from marry Wilson from the 

02:53:49.564 --> 02:53:53.503
supremes, I was confamily 
-- the supremes were always 

02:53:53.504 --> 02:53:59.064
being criticized noting 
being soulful enough -- why is 

02:53:59.065 --> 02:54:04.333
it that I have to 
sound like Aretha Franklin -- 

02:54:04.334 --> 02:54:06.190
why can't there be 
diverseity.

02:54:06.191 --> 02:54:12.419
          I think disco did 
amplify mow town music 

02:54:12.420 --> 02:54:15.731
in the sense that month town was
 deliberately 

02:54:15.732 --> 02:54:20.883
working to try to get out of 
what had once been 

02:54:20.884 --> 02:54:27.497
called the -- felt by white 
Americans but not in a 

02:54:27.498 --> 02:54:31.897
way that in my view that 
compromised that music. 

02:54:31.898 --> 02:54:37.165
That music was soulful.
          Mow town was soulful 

02:54:37.166 --> 02:54:40.610
and disco music was 
soulful. But I think it's very, 

02:54:40.611 --> 02:54:44.995
very difficult -- to 
try to actually what was disco, 

02:54:44.996 --> 02:54:50.110
what is disco -- one 
of the things that I argue in 

02:54:50.111 --> 02:54:53.967
hot stuff is it's 
curious to me the extent to 

02:54:53.968 --> 02:54:59.061
which we try to create 
very narrow sort of categories 

02:54:59.062 --> 02:55:03.779
for disco and what 
constitutes it for disco and 

02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:09.456
it's not true for rock 
music. You say pupping rock is 

02:55:09.457 --> 02:55:14.912
considered rock music
music, you can say blues rock, 

02:55:14.913 --> 02:55:18.201
country rock, it's 
considered rock, no one is try

02:55:18.209 --> 02:55:22.233
ing to coordinate it 
off and put it in its own box. 

02:55:22.690 --> 02:55:27.098
For disco, it's 
assumed that David Bowie 

02:55:27.099 --> 02:55:30.080
sustained wasn't disco, but 
at the time it was heard and 

02:55:30.081 --> 02:55:35.654
discussed as disco. 
What about PI oh -- which played

02:55:36.773 --> 02:55:41.615
 at studio 54 -- 
that was disco.

02:55:41.616 --> 02:55:48.716
          Blondey was disco, 
Madonna was disco. Lord

02:55:48.717 --> 02:55:53.465
Lords of green light sound disco
 to me. I take the 

02:55:53.466 --> 02:55:57.956
action pansive view.
          To the question of the

02:55:57.973 --> 02:55:59.973
 beat --

02:56:01.388 --> 02:56:04.067
 there's one 
thing I would want to pull out 

02:56:04.068 --> 02:56:06.908
and draw attention to 
is how the beat is organized. 

02:56:07.607 --> 02:56:12.986
And I think there's 
prominence again to open high 

02:56:12.987 --> 02:56:15.439
hat between the 
documents beat so when you tune 

02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:18.434
boo a song that 
doesn't have many cord changes 

02:56:18.435 --> 02:56:22.989
it takes on hip not
nottic character -- it almost --

02:56:23.536 --> 02:56:26.535
 you can't quite 
tell if it's speeding up or slow

02:56:26.829 --> 02:56:30.221
ing down, 
accelerating effect within that 

02:56:30.222 --> 02:56:35.987
environment. And 
that begins a dominant feature 

02:56:35.988 --> 02:56:39.074
of how the beat gets 
organized and then that gets 

02:56:39.075 --> 02:56:45.592
pulled into a prominent 
way, almost a -- one might want 

02:56:45.593 --> 02:56:48.892
to make a 
speculative case how that relate

02:56:50.322 --> 02:56:58.247
s to subculturals. 
We think of Shaka Kahn, 1974, 

02:56:58.248 --> 02:57:01.673
tell me something good
good, that's taking fung to a 

02:57:01.674 --> 02:57:08.077
new level and the in 
between beat, so we have these 

02:57:08.078 --> 02:57:12.614
moment that's give us 
syntax for disco.

02:57:12.615 --> 02:57:15.049
          Written by Stevie 
Wonder wasn't it?

02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:19.901
          I'm not sure? I think 
so. The interesting 

02:57:19.902 --> 02:57:21.902
thing about

02:57:22.930 --> 02:57:24.930
 Shaka Kahn's group, they did 
not

02:57:27.529 --> 02:57:29.812
 -- they 
developed some strange names for

02:57:29.954 --> 02:57:34.857
 what they did but 
saw themselves at the 

02:57:34.858 --> 02:57:37.985
intersection of fung and rock, 
as did label.

02:57:37.986 --> 02:57:40.334
          Time for one last 
question.

02:57:40.335 --> 02:57:44.797
          I wanted to make a 
comment -- when

02:57:48.195 --> 02:57:51.158
 dop 
became rock and roll, it was the

02:57:51.716 --> 02:57:56.715
 advent of the 
guitar, and you would clearly 

02:57:56.716 --> 02:58:01.858
say when Bob Dylan 
went electric, that was a huge 

02:58:01.859 --> 02:58:07.102
movement. Did 
anything in disco reach that? 

02:58:09.094 --> 02:58:13.219
Bow didly has his own 
beat, and I don't think it was 

02:58:13.220 --> 02:58:16.203
the heartist who are 
trying to define themselves, it 

02:58:16.204 --> 02:58:19.184
was the radio 
stations -- radio stations 

02:58:19.185 --> 02:58:26.871
decided what they were 
going to play, and as disco was 

02:58:26.872 --> 02:58:32.533
in its hey day, the 
eagles were still being played 

02:58:32.534 --> 02:58:36.238
on other radio 
stations, selling trillions of 

02:58:36.239 --> 02:58:40.085
records, so it's the 
market place, and it's where you

02:58:41.093 --> 02:58:46.033
 get broadcast in 
the marketplace, so someone DJ 

02:58:46.034 --> 02:58:48.034
might say,

02:58:50.207 --> 02:58:54.208
 -- I'm 
sorry to play I don't want to 

02:58:54.209 --> 02:58:58.957
play PIL -- where 
where we can download and stream

02:58:59.384 --> 02:59:01.562
 and do whatever we 
want to do but until that happen

02:59:01.829 --> 02:59:07.190
ed people were 
prisons of a certain radio 

02:59:07.191 --> 02:59:09.971
station and what was 
there and what they were paying.

02:59:09.972 --> 02:59:12.637
          &gt;&gt; I'm going to take 
issue with you at 

02:59:12.638 --> 02:59:16.795
this.  Because here's the thing 
-- people were 

02:59:16.796 --> 02:59:20.034
always saying about disco, it 
was something that was 

02:59:20.035 --> 02:59:24.444
basically cooked up in the back 
room by these major 

02:59:24.445 --> 02:59:27.600
label guys.
          &gt;&gt; No, I worked at 

02:59:27.601 --> 02:59:32.438
Atlantic records, I was 
director of publicity of all of 

02:59:32.439 --> 02:59:35.094
that, and it was 
money -- people were in the it 

02:59:35.095 --> 02:59:38.387
for the money. What's 
hot, what's new -- 

02:59:38.388 --> 02:59:41.690
          But people, the idea 
that music -- the 

02:59:41.691 --> 02:59:45.939
outside of the commercial is a 
dilution, I think. 

02:59:45.940 --> 02:59:50.485
But let's talk about the very 
early days of the 

02:59:50.486 --> 02:59:56.064
music of disco. The first big 
disco hit was

02:59:59.142 --> 03:00:03.688
 Barry 
white's love unlimited orchestra

03:00:03.842 --> 03:00:07.996
 -- 1973 -- radio 
did not break that song. In fact

03:00:07.997 --> 03:00:11.831
, his label was 
completely uninterested in 

03:00:11.832 --> 03:00:15.772
promoteing that song. What 
happened was two very enterprise

03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:21.185
ing DJ's were 
visiting somebody at Barry white

03:00:21.931 --> 03:00:26.923
's label and there 
was a dead album box, they had 

03:00:26.924 --> 03:00:33.128
these bins of dead Al 
bums -- and these DJ's find 

03:00:33.129 --> 03:00:36.835
Barry white's album 
there, and they played it in the

03:00:36.973 --> 03:00:42.547
 clubs and it was 
the first time that a single had

03:00:42.950 --> 03:00:48.502
 been broken in the 
clubs and then it went to --

03:00:48.503 --> 03:00:52.047
          &gt;&gt; I would be very 
careful saying first 

03:00:52.048 --> 03:00:56.747
time -- you claim something 
being a first disco 

03:00:56.748 --> 03:01:02.089
record, they've been arguing for
 50 years what's the 

03:01:02.090 --> 03:01:05.138
first rock and roll record.
          &gt;&gt; I'm saying it's the

03:01:05.543 --> 03:01:09.850
 first disco record 
to become a huge hit --

03:01:09.851 --> 03:01:11.408
          &gt;&gt; 
          I would have to see 

03:01:11.409 --> 03:01:14.658
the documentation --
          &gt;&gt; 

03:01:14.659 --> 03:01:17.937
          You can buy her book.
          I wanted another

03:01:21.787 --> 03:01:24.053
 point.
          We don't have time -- 

03:01:24.054 --> 03:01:28.043
disco is an 
important topic that deserves 

03:01:28.044 --> 03:01:33.744
scholarly attention. 
So this is a whole body of work 

03:01:33.745 --> 03:01:37.860
just craving to be 
unearthed and these are some of 

03:01:37.861 --> 03:01:42.037
the pioneers in 
distinct that work. If you're a 

03:01:42.038 --> 03:01:44.949
grad student or 
undergrad even and you want to 

03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:51.942
do a cool paper, come 
to library Congress, who was 

03:01:51.943 --> 03:01:57.283
making money off of 
them, versus people doing the 

03:01:57.284 --> 03:02:03.324
creative work, who is 
ripping off the to thes, how is 

03:02:03.325 --> 03:02:05.425
bill protecting his 
photos. There's so much study in

03:02:05.741 --> 03:02:12.154
 this area of study, 
and kind of me, the way that 

03:02:12.155 --> 03:02:16.812
popular musical genres 
are becoming more of the hot 

03:02:16.813 --> 03:02:19.937
thing in scholarship. 
There's only so much that we can

03:02:20.255 --> 03:02:24.531
 do -- well no, I'm 
not going to say that because 

03:02:24.532 --> 03:02:32.186
I'll get in trouble -- 
there's a of other music genres 

03:02:32.187 --> 03:02:35.579
that need that 
attention, that discourse that 

03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:38.590
we find out what was 
really going on -- I grew up 

03:02:38.591 --> 03:02:43.162
with disco, I heard it 
from my parents listening to 

03:02:43.163 --> 03:02:45.163
their records and then 
I got my

03:02:48.518 --> 03:02:51.662
 subscription -- and I have one 
and two -- 

03:02:51.663 --> 03:02:56.513
and then you get a certain 
perception of what you 

03:02:56.514 --> 03:03:01.468
grow up and what's in the media 
-- it's not 

03:03:01.469 --> 03:03:07.192
necessarily of all that was 
going on and bill's book 

03:03:07.193 --> 03:03:10.561
sheds light on that which is 
fantastic. And if you 

03:03:10.562 --> 03:03:14.424
want to go back and see the film
 54, you can compare 

03:03:14.425 --> 03:03:19.816
that to what the actual primary 
source document 

03:03:19.817 --> 03:03:22.958
revealed. There's a lot of fun 
stuff to do -- if 

03:03:22.959 --> 03:03:27.393
you're not a researcher, just 
come and hang out and 

03:03:27.394 --> 03:03:30.755
he can 
explore because that's what 

03:03:30.756 --> 03:03:34.207
we're here for all 
people, regard will of your 

03:03:34.208 --> 03:03:39.861
interest, academic, high 
school student, if you're home 

03:03:39.862 --> 03:03:44.410
patrolling Twitter 
you'll find interesting stuff at

03:03:44.413 --> 03:03:47.408
 library of Congress
Congress.

.
          (MUSIC)

03:15:58.295 --> 03:16:00.295
.

03:16:03.950 --> 03:16:08.903
Okay, here's the pitful part, 
we've been 

03:16:08.904 --> 03:16:12.608
practicing that for weeks.
          We really have.

03:16:12.609 --> 03:16:17.144
          Welcome everybody to 
disco -- at the 

03:16:17.145 --> 03:16:19.145
library

03:16:20.247 --> 03:16:23.442
 of Congress, thank you Nicholas
 brown for 

03:16:23.443 --> 03:16:25.716
all your hard work.
          (APPLAUSE).

03:16:33.094 --> 03:16:34.966
Thank you for all the work 
you've do not 

03:16:34.967 --> 03:16:36.967
to make this possible.

03:16:41.906 --> 03:16:45.343
So, Dr. Hayden, we're products 
of the 70's

03:16:45.344 --> 03:16:52.876
70's, we started out at as 
librarians in the 70's 

03:16:52.877 --> 03:16:55.715
and still here.
          We went to library 

03:16:55.716 --> 03:17:00.117
school in the 70's and 
made this through and Robert 

03:17:00.118 --> 03:17:03.095
started a career at 
library of Congress and I went 

03:17:03.096 --> 03:17:06.952
to teach and public 
libraryies and here we are 40 

03:17:06.953 --> 03:17:12.223
something years later 
together as partners, so we're 

03:17:12.224 --> 03:17:13.935
thankful.
                    (APPLAUSE).

03:17:13.936 --> 03:17:22.879
          Now, we also were 
talking about 70's 

03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:24.702
fashion, you'll notice what 
we're wearing. 

03:17:24.703 --> 03:17:28.456
          This is as far as we 
can go now.

03:17:28.457 --> 03:17:34.299
                    Wait until 
tonight, does she have an 

03:17:34.300 --> 03:17:36.300
outfit -- 
          Let's just say there's

03:17:36.530 --> 03:17:40.081
 going to be more 
hair. I couldn't grow it back 

03:17:40.082 --> 03:17:45.027
then, by the time I 
grew it the 70's were over.

03:17:45.028 --> 03:17:47.762
          What we're seeing is 
the fashion in the 70

03:17:47.763 --> 03:17:51.862
70's when we looked back at some
 of the photos and 

03:17:51.863 --> 03:17:57.582
we said oh my God, it's an 
oxymoron, fashion and the 

03:17:57.583 --> 03:18:03.238
70's, however, you could excuse 
the fashion because 

03:18:03.239 --> 03:18:06.531
of the music -- 
          It's true. And tell me

03:18:06.934 --> 03:18:10.531
 what was your 
favorite disco song of the era?

03:18:10.532 --> 03:18:13.505
          The one that still 
stays with me and 

03:18:13.506 --> 03:18:17.763
that's why they were playing 
while we came out, we 

03:18:17.764 --> 03:18:21.760
are family. It symbolizes so 
much in term there's 

03:18:21.761 --> 03:18:24.733
all kinds of family and it 
brings everybody together

03:18:24.734 --> 03:18:29.307
together, so I was really 
pleased to select it this 

03:18:29.308 --> 03:18:31.964
year to be put into the national
 registry. 

03:18:31.965 --> 03:18:33.965
          (APPLAUSE).

03:18:36.698 --> 03:18:40.387
Now, you should know before I 
got here 

03:18:40.388 --> 03:18:45.505
Robert was part of the selection
 process, and he got 

03:18:45.506 --> 03:18:47.334
to select your favorite disco 
song.

03:18:47.335 --> 03:18:51.186
                    Three 
guesses -- I will survive.

03:18:51.187 --> 03:18:53.471
                    (APPLAUSE).

03:18:59.284 --> 03:19:04.735
One of the exciteing things that
 we can 

03:19:04.736 --> 03:19:07.372
place wonderful song that's have
 a great legacy like 

03:19:07.373 --> 03:19:12.638
this on the national recording 
registry, and it's 

03:19:12.639 --> 03:19:15.622
something that you can 
contribute to as well. All 

03:19:15.623 --> 03:19:22.928
you have to do is go to to our 
website LSD.gov and 

03:19:22.929 --> 03:19:25.434
search recording registry and 
make suggestions to 

03:19:25.435 --> 03:19:28.882
what you would like to see on 
that registry.

03:19:28.883 --> 03:19:31.942
          Think about it because
 it's not just song 

03:19:31.943 --> 03:19:35.473
that's maybe were the top 20, 
there's song that's 

03:19:35.474 --> 03:19:38.416
resonate with you and we want to
 also use the 

03:19:38.417 --> 03:19:42.787
registry to introduce people to 
music and 

03:19:42.788 --> 03:19:46.226
significant works of art, and 
just culture, so think 

03:19:46.227 --> 03:19:49.610
of any song or any recording 
that you would like us 

03:19:49.611 --> 03:19:53.317
to consider. And we would love 
to have it.

03:19:53.318 --> 03:19:57.862
          Think about today as 
being a window as 

03:19:57.863 --> 03:20:04.943
into the entire selection of 
music in the library of 

03:20:04.944 --> 03:20:07.700
Congress and it's an amazing 
collection and I hope 

03:20:07.701 --> 03:20:10.665
you take the opportunity to 
explore it.

03:20:10.666 --> 03:20:14.511
          So speaking of the I 
will survive, the 

03:20:14.512 --> 03:20:17.092
reason we're really here today 
is because of the 

03:20:17.093 --> 03:20:24.600
music and the persona really of 
the legend dare 

03:20:24.601 --> 03:20:26.500
Gloria Gaynor. 
          (APPLAUSE).

03:20:26.501 --> 03:20:31.716
          You warns to talk 
about us all -- I feel 

03:20:31.717 --> 03:20:35.720
like we're at the academy awards
.

03:20:35.721 --> 03:20:43.251
          I do -- her him song I
 will survive was 

03:20:43.252 --> 03:20:50.666
recorded into the national 
registry in 2016 -- 

03:20:50.667 --> 03:20:52.751
letterle general dare career 
spans pri years.

03:20:52.752 --> 03:20:57.518
          Looks better.
          And has never lost 

03:20:57.519 --> 03:21:00.755
sometime. We have the 
privilege of being backstage and

03:21:00.905 --> 03:21:05.156
 we were showing her 
some treasures from our 

03:21:05.157 --> 03:21:09.997
collection, the original 
manuscript -- and she started 

03:21:09.998 --> 03:21:15.521
seeing summertime -- 
and was quite a moment. 

03:21:15.522 --> 03:21:20.535
          And she then looked at
 the score, and this 

03:21:20.536 --> 03:21:22.973
is in George garnish

03:21:26.187 --> 03:21:30.591
 -- hand, one of my favorite 
songs, our love is here to stay,

03:21:30.891 --> 03:21:34.749
 and then she 
started to hum that. Robert had 

03:21:34.750 --> 03:21:38.587
a moment.
          Yeah. 

03:21:38.588 --> 03:21:43.841
          I was -- it was really
 wonderful. And one 

03:21:43.842 --> 03:21:46.670
of the things that she will be 
talking about today 

03:21:46.671 --> 03:21:52.346
is her second book we will 
survive, true stories of 

03:21:52.347 --> 03:21:55.090
encouragement, inspiration and 
the power of song.

03:21:55.091 --> 03:21:57.610
          And joining her on 
stage to discuss her 

03:21:57.611 --> 03:22:01.607
book and her career is a person 
you invite to your 

03:22:01.608 --> 03:22:04.434
home every morning -- I know my 
mother does, and 

03:22:04.435 --> 03:22:09.144
there are very few things that 
you can do to 

03:22:09.145 --> 03:22:13.545
sometimes either impression your
 parents or to show 

03:22:13.546 --> 03:22:18.128
them their efforts were worth it
, I was able to let 

03:22:18.129 --> 03:22:23.126
her stand by and meet the co
anchor of ABC's good 

03:22:23.127 --> 03:22:29.061

Gaynor. I'm telling you, 
you have just inspireed me and 

03:23:30.969 --> 03:23:34.482
countless others and 
I've been looking forward to 

03:23:34.483 --> 03:23:38.786
sitting and chatting 
with you and getting people to 

03:23:38.787 --> 03:23:44.001
know more of you -- 
you grew up with music -- tell 

03:23:44.002 --> 03:23:48.786
us about it.
          My mother sang,

03:23:54.056 --> 03:23:57.600
 my father sang as well but 
my father did sing professional

03:23:57.602 --> 03:24:00.078
ly for a time, as a 
matter of fact, he was the 

03:24:00.079 --> 03:24:07.786
opening act for an act 
back then called stepping -- 

03:24:07.787 --> 03:24:12.891
          What was that again?
          Stepping -- and

03:24:22.845 --> 03:24:26.158
 it was just in the 
neighborhood -- they would sing 

03:24:26.159 --> 03:24:29.125
and on the street 
corners and in front of the 

03:24:29.126 --> 03:24:33.624
house and wherever they 
could -- when I was growing up 

03:24:33.625 --> 03:24:37.953
-- where I grew up, 
these bands would collect on the

03:24:38.337 --> 03:24:43.504
 street corns during 
the summer and start playing 

03:24:43.505 --> 03:24:49.301
Congo go drums appears 
singing and dancing and as I 

03:24:49.302 --> 03:24:53.424
grew up as a teenageer 
going to high school I was very 

03:24:53.425 --> 03:24:55.425
sad inned that the

03:24:59.671 --> 03:25:03.390
everywhere.
          Isn't that sad what 

03:25:03.391 --> 03:25:05.508
you grew up with you 
feel that's the world.

03:25:05.509 --> 03:25:09.518
          That's the world.
          Yeah,ing exactly. When

03:25:10.131 --> 03:25:12.916
 did you realize 
that disco was going to be its 

03:25:12.917 --> 03:25:16.048
own genre?
          I realizeed that when 

03:25:16.049 --> 03:25:20.016
I was still singing 
rhythm and blues and jazz. I was

03:25:20.259 --> 03:25:23.856
 performing up and 
down the East coast and a lot in

03:25:24.107 --> 03:25:30.940
 New York City and 
in cab cab rays -- the disco 

03:25:30.941 --> 03:25:37.539
music started coming out 
and Barry white

03:25:44.747 --> 03:25:47.900
 -- Barry white I was called the
 King 

03:25:47.901 --> 03:25:53.168
of disco -- they were in the 
club, in the cab ray 

03:25:53.169 --> 03:25:57.394
clubs that I was working in they
 started to move 

03:25:57.395 --> 03:26:00.937
chairs and make dance floors and
 have -- there would 

03:26:00.938 --> 03:26:05.250
be a closet, they would open the
 door, cut the top 

03:26:05.251 --> 03:26:09.345
after half of it off, put a 
Planck across the bottom 

03:26:09.346 --> 03:26:15.609
half of it and that was where 
the can DJ turn table 

03:26:15.610 --> 03:26:18.763
set was set and there was your 
disco tech.

03:26:18.764 --> 03:26:21.982
          Just like that.
          Just like that. And 

03:26:21.983 --> 03:26:26.845
somebody got the idea 
to build disco techs, build 

03:26:26.846 --> 03:26:31.405
establishments that were 
specifically for who wanted to 

03:26:31.406 --> 03:26:34.080
come in and dance. 
This is when I realizeed this is

03:26:34.548 --> 03:26:40.201
 going to happen. 
This is a market that doesn't 

03:26:40.202 --> 03:26:42.642
have any music at the 
moment, has

03:26:47.329 --> 03:26:50.403
 -- I think I'm going to supply 
them.

03:26:50.404 --> 03:26:54.306
          Yes you did. You most 
certainly did and 

03:26:54.307 --> 03:26:57.402
we're glad you did.
          Fulfill a need.

03:26:57.403 --> 03:27:01.815
          How did you go about 
-- I will Sue, 

03:27:01.816 --> 03:27:06.812
creating that, writing that?
          I didn't write it at 

03:27:06.813 --> 03:27:11.663
all.
          I was in performing in

03:27:11.697 --> 03:27:15.675
 New York and fell 
backwards over a monitor during 

03:27:15.676 --> 03:27:20.017
a performance, jump
jumped back up, finished my show

03:27:20.333 --> 03:27:28.698
, went back home, 
woke up the next morning being 

03:27:28.699 --> 03:27:31.630
from the waste down 
-- but only paralyzeed for that 

03:27:31.631 --> 03:27:33.313
period of time and 
then a while after I got to 

03:27:33.314 --> 03:27:38.078
hospital, whatever they 
did they relieved the work and 

03:27:38.079 --> 03:27:42.220
the paralysis was 
gone -- I don't remember 

03:27:42.221 --> 03:27:47.899
anything but saying did 
they serve lunch yet?

03:27:47.900 --> 03:27:51.437
                    Priorities.
          From March until July 

03:27:51.438 --> 03:27:56.308
because they were 
trying everything they could, 

03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:58.858
traction and spinal 
tap, it was scary -- there was 

03:27:58.859 --> 03:28:03.899
no such thing as an M
MRI, so they were trying to find

03:28:04.302 --> 03:28:06.549
 out what was going 
wrong and what they could do so 

03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:12.796
they gave me surgery 
on my spine and had a fusion, 

03:28:12.797 --> 03:28:14.347
bon graph from my hips 
and all of that.

03:28:14.348 --> 03:28:18.888
          So when I was in the 
hospital, I was like 

03:28:18.889 --> 03:28:23.755
what do you mean by about this? 
What are we going to 

03:28:23.756 --> 03:28:28.173
do -- the record company said 
they were not going to 

03:28:28.174 --> 03:28:31.843
renew my contract, people going 
around saying the 

03:28:31.844 --> 03:28:34.526
queen is dead -- I was praying 
-- I hasn't parade 

03:28:34.527 --> 03:28:41.408
for a long time -- so I was like
 praying -- I got a 

03:28:41.409 --> 03:28:43.952
Bible and started reading and I 
all right the 

03:28:43.953 --> 03:28:46.359
hospital quite confident that 
God was going to do 

03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:47.933
something but I didn't know what
.

03:28:47.934 --> 03:28:52.332
          While I was at home, a
 few weeks later the 

03:28:52.333 --> 03:28:55.672
record company said they were 
not going to end my 

03:28:55.673 --> 03:28:59.174
contact and they want medicine 
to go to California 

03:28:59.175 --> 03:29:04.425
and record a song that the 
record company President 

03:29:04.426 --> 03:29:07.424
had chosen. I wanted to know 
what -- 

03:29:07.425 --> 03:29:12.376
          You remember B slide 
-- 

03:29:12.377 --> 03:29:15.919
          Yes, if you didn't 
clap, Salus ask the 

03:29:15.920 --> 03:29:17.920
person next to you. 

03:29:20.471 --> 03:29:25.176
The B side was called substitute
substitute, I said what is going

03:29:25.492 --> 03:29:29.360
 to be the A side -- 
I said what is going to be the B

03:29:29.363 --> 03:29:32.311
 side, they said 
well, what kind of songs do you 

03:29:32.312 --> 03:29:36.703
like -- I said I 
like songs that are meaningful 

03:29:36.704 --> 03:29:40.405
that touch people's 
hearts, have good melodyies, 

03:29:40.406 --> 03:29:47.832
people can sing along -- 
we said -- we recorded this song

03:29:47.839 --> 03:29:51.221
 two years ago, they 
hell I will survive for two 

03:29:51.222 --> 03:29:53.207
years waiting for the 
right person.

03:29:53.208 --> 03:29:55.162
          And you were the right
 person.

03:29:55.163 --> 03:30:00.430
          Yes. And I just looked
 up and said thank 

03:30:00.431 --> 03:30:03.427
you.
          Because when I read 

03:30:03.428 --> 03:30:07.977
the lyrics I realizeed 
this was a timeless lyric, I 

03:30:07.978 --> 03:30:12.285
said this is a human
humanless lyric, are you stupid 

03:30:12.286 --> 03:30:15.252
-- you were going to 
put this on the B side -- I said

03:30:15.673 --> 03:30:18.489
 if it's got 
anything to do with me it will 

03:30:18.490 --> 03:30:24.068
get a chance now. 
It's a timeless lyric.

03:30:24.069 --> 03:30:27.054
          You knew it.
          I knew it when I read 

03:30:27.055 --> 03:30:32.054
the lyrics -- I'm 
relateing to this song -- this 

03:30:32.055 --> 03:30:35.840
happened like nine 
years since my mother passed 

03:30:35.841 --> 03:30:40.026
away, it was something 
I thought I never would survive 

03:30:40.027 --> 03:30:43.393
-- I was still 
suffering from that -- those of 

03:30:43.394 --> 03:30:47.216
you that lost your 
parent, you're still suffering.

03:30:47.217 --> 03:30:50.908
          So, yeah, I thought 
anybody -- everybody 

03:30:50.909 --> 03:30:55.289
is going to be able to relate to
 this and type has 

03:30:55.290 --> 03:30:57.290
approve me right.
          So when you stepped on

03:30:58.049 --> 03:31:00.019
 the statement and 
sang that what was the response 

03:31:00.020 --> 03:31:03.863
from the audience, 
how it did it resonate with 

03:31:03.864 --> 03:31:07.162
people.
          When I got the song in

03:31:07.164 --> 03:31:10.998
 my hands and took 
it to the record company to say 

03:31:10.999 --> 03:31:14.543
this should be the A 
side, they wouldn't listen to it

03:31:14.955 --> 03:31:18.963
. The President had 
chosen another song and nobody 

03:31:18.964 --> 03:31:23.387
wanted to go against 
his choices. So we went to 

03:31:23.388 --> 03:31:28.067
studio a 54, gave it to 
the DJ there and the audience 

03:31:28.068 --> 03:31:32.522
immediately loveed it. 
I said I know I'm right. New 

03:31:32.523 --> 03:31:36.137
York audiences are soja 
ided, they don't immediately 

03:31:36.138 --> 03:31:38.332
love anything. So this 
is right.

03:31:38.333 --> 03:31:41.003
          We gave minimum a 
stack of them, he gave 

03:31:41.004 --> 03:31:44.038
them to his friends around New 
York and they began 

03:31:44.039 --> 03:31:48.558
to play it, people began to 
request it on radio, 

03:31:48.559 --> 03:31:52.638
they want it on the way home, on
 the way to work and 

03:31:52.639 --> 03:31:54.639
the rest is history.

03:31:58.361 --> 03:32:01.732
1970's this music is bringing 
people from 

03:32:01.733 --> 03:32:05.909
diverse communeityies together, 
they have a voice, 

03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:12.098
what was that experience like?
          It was a discovery for

03:32:12.265 --> 03:32:16.111
 me -- I discovered 
that there was one music, the 

03:32:16.112 --> 03:32:21.216
only music in the 
history of music, ever to bring 

03:32:21.217 --> 03:32:26.642
together people onto 
the dance floor, from every 

03:32:26.643 --> 03:32:28.764
inability, creed, color 
and age group, and that was 

03:32:28.765 --> 03:32:33.258
amazing to me and I was 
in the forefront of that, so I 

03:32:33.259 --> 03:32:37.718
felt really prismed, 
really great about it, 

03:32:37.719 --> 03:32:41.023
especially since it's so 
uplifting and encourageing -- 

03:32:41.024 --> 03:32:44.858
you didn't bring people 
to money together -- you didn't 

03:32:44.859 --> 03:32:47.986
bring people to 
complain, you brought people 

03:32:47.987 --> 03:32:51.532
together to uplift and 
encourage and inspire one 

03:32:51.533 --> 03:32:56.958
another. And this is why 
I've done a website called I 

03:32:56.959 --> 03:33:01.147
will survive dot.org, 
please go to because it's a 

03:33:01.148 --> 03:33:03.622
communeity for that very 
purpose, where people come 

03:33:03.623 --> 03:33:07.012
together and tell theory 
stories, uplift and encourage 

03:33:07.013 --> 03:33:11.564
one another, it's a 
charity based website on which 

03:33:11.565 --> 03:33:15.424
you can purchase, we 
love to purchase, and at the 

03:33:15.425 --> 03:33:19.114
same time support a 
charity of your choice and some 

03:33:19.115 --> 03:33:22.093
of the chaiityies are 
represented -- I don't know -- 

03:33:22.094 --> 03:33:24.109
they're going to be 
here --

03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:26.546
          (APPLAUSE).
          There's

03:33:29.628 --> 03:33:35.190
 BCRS -- there's thrive --

03:33:53.574 --> 03:33:55.111
these charity that 
you can support while you're 

03:33:55.112 --> 03:33:59.682
encourageing and uplift
uplifting one another. 

03:33:59.683 --> 03:34:02.350
          When you say I will 
survive everyone can 

03:34:02.351 --> 03:34:05.333
take it personally and use it 
differently -- it 

03:34:05.334 --> 03:34:08.060
means something different for 
everyone doesn't it.

03:34:08.061 --> 03:34:12.159
          Yes, it does. It 
request be applied to so 

03:34:12.160 --> 03:34:14.892
many different areas of your 
life. So many different 

03:34:14.893 --> 03:34:18.280
things. all of which, any of 
which might be things 

03:34:18.281 --> 03:34:20.281
that you are

03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:26.125
 feeling and hoping you'll 
survive. And 

03:34:26.126 --> 03:34:29.358
that way we can relate to one 
another because of 

03:34:29.359 --> 03:34:32.340
those things.
          I can relate when you 

03:34:32.341 --> 03:34:37.203
were talking about 
-- my mom and dad are cheering 

03:34:37.204 --> 03:34:44.036
us right now from our 
Heavenly balance conny, how am I

03:34:45.057 --> 03:34:49.155
 going to survive 
without them and health crisis, 

03:34:49.156 --> 03:34:54.211
and I understand, so 
many people, who are fellow 

03:34:54.212 --> 03:34:57.233
thriveers that have 
surviveed, it's been your and 

03:34:57.234 --> 03:35:02.501
them, and to know -- 
library of Congress, and we 

03:35:02.502 --> 03:35:04.361
heard earlier --
          (APPLAUSE).

03:35:04.362 --> 03:35:08.606
          Come on now. Come on. 
What's -- what that 

03:35:08.607 --> 03:35:11.067
means -- what's that mean? 

03:35:14.173 --> 03:35:19.991
          My friends it's not 
normal for me to be 

03:35:19.992 --> 03:35:25.249
speechless -- but it does -- 
it's overwhelming -- to 

03:35:25.250 --> 03:35:29.100
know that someone who started 
from such humble begin

03:35:29.101 --> 03:35:33.092
beginnings that I can say that 
I'm now going to be 

03:35:33.093 --> 03:35:37.345
history. People will come for 
years to come and be 

03:35:37.346 --> 03:35:41.751
inspireed by something that I've
 done -- something 

03:35:41.752 --> 03:35:46.467
that I've been a part of. And 
it's such an honor. 

03:35:46.468 --> 03:35:50.860
It's such an unbelieveable honor
. To be here, to be 

03:35:50.861 --> 03:35:54.641
sitting before you, to be a part
 of the library of 

03:35:54.642 --> 03:35:57.628
Congress, to be inducted into 
the library of 

03:35:57.629 --> 03:36:02.547
Congress, to be a part of 
American history, it is 

03:36:02.548 --> 03:36:06.235
wonderful, and it's not only 
wonderful because for 

03:36:06.236 --> 03:36:08.236
me, but I'm hoping that

03:36:11.453 --> 03:36:14.186
 it's wonderful for people 
who started like me, and are 

03:36:14.187 --> 03:36:18.427
starting out even now 
like me, to know what heights 

03:36:18.428 --> 03:36:23.449
you can reach, simply 
by the gifts and talents that 

03:36:23.450 --> 03:36:26.679
God has placeed in you, 
we all have them.

03:36:26.680 --> 03:36:29.348
          Yes, I love that.
          (APPLAUSE).

03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:38.079
          You know, Gloria, as 
you became emotional 

03:36:38.080 --> 03:36:42.785
as were looking at arts, years 
from now there's 

03:36:42.786 --> 03:36:45.360
going to be somebody like 
yourself coming in and 

03:36:45.361 --> 03:36:48.610
they're going to see your music 
and see I will 

03:36:48.611 --> 03:36:54.117
survive, and that -- just talk 
about how you became 

03:36:54.118 --> 03:36:57.551
emotional when seeing the great 
recordings that are 

03:36:57.552 --> 03:37:00.857
here and the great archive 
that's are here.

03:37:00.858 --> 03:37:08.386
          I looked at the music 
and realizeed that I 

03:37:08.387 --> 03:37:13.640
was being -- having the 
privilege of being 

03:37:13.641 --> 03:37:17.477
transported back in time -- we 
don't need a time 

03:37:17.478 --> 03:37:23.938
machine -- to be transported 
back in time to 

03:37:23.939 --> 03:37:30.889
experience and gain the rich the
 benefit by the rich 

03:37:30.890 --> 03:37:34.126
legacy that other artists and 
other people have left 

03:37:34.127 --> 03:37:37.246
from their arts, from their 
talents and their 

03:37:37.247 --> 03:37:41.496
abilityies, this is what this 
place is all about, and 

03:37:41.497 --> 03:37:47.470
what an honor to stand there and
 see that, and be a 

03:37:47.471 --> 03:37:49.471
part of it and to

03:37:58.136 --> 03:38:00.590
 experience it and to know that 
people can

03:38:04.140 --> 03:38:05.830
 benefit from these wonderful 
things.

03:38:05.831 --> 03:38:08.813
          Can you express the 
importance of it, for 

03:38:08.814 --> 03:38:12.386
not only you, the general public
 that can come here 

03:38:12.387 --> 03:38:16.046
and witness this this and see it
, and also know that 

03:38:16.047 --> 03:38:21.310
disco, the culture, the fashion,
 all of it -- it's 

03:38:21.311 --> 03:38:24.197
part of us and you brought this 
here.

03:38:27.208 --> 03:38:29.208
It's point for

03:38:32.871 --> 03:38:36.547
 self-discovery, it's 
important photo recognize you 

03:38:36.548 --> 03:38:39.846
can do this. Anybody 
can do this. Just

03:38:42.933 --> 03:38:44.645
 hone in on what you have and 
what 

03:38:44.646 --> 03:38:50.359
you are and being recognizeed.  
I said recently you 

03:38:50.360 --> 03:38:54.052
are designers of original. 
Everyone single of us is 

03:38:54.053 --> 03:38:58.454
a designer of original. Every 
similar one of us has 

03:38:58.455 --> 03:39:03.569
been given something to 
contribute to the better. To 

03:39:03.570 --> 03:39:07.971
the welfare to the progress, to 
the pleasure of 

03:39:07.972 --> 03:39:10.546
mankind.
          And if we honeed in on

03:39:10.706 --> 03:39:15.028
 what that is, not 
try to be someone else, not try 

03:39:15.029 --> 03:39:17.029
to

03:39:19.907 --> 03:39:22.480
 have -- recognize 
what that is and be about 

03:39:22.481 --> 03:39:25.880
finding out what your 
purpose is and bringing that 

03:39:25.881 --> 03:39:30.033
purpose to the part, so 
to speak.

03:39:30.034 --> 03:39:34.732
          It's a wonderful thing
, because that's 

03:39:34.733 --> 03:39:38.835
what we're all meant to do, and 
deep down inside 

03:39:38.836 --> 03:39:41.658
somewhere that's what each of us
 wants to do.

03:39:41.659 --> 03:39:46.218
          We have great guardian
s here, the people, 

03:39:46.219 --> 03:39:48.499
the staff, the library of 
Congress, don't we?

03:39:48.500 --> 03:39:51.088
          They are special 
people. Had is what they 

03:39:51.089 --> 03:39:55.176
bring. This is their particular 
talent, they're 

03:39:55.177 --> 03:40:00.439
particular ability to preserve 
what we've done -- 

03:40:00.440 --> 03:40:04.032
everything that is being 
preserveed here is showing 

03:40:04.033 --> 03:40:07.165
off their talent, their ability
ies, their

03:40:11.013 --> 03:40:14.580
 desire to 
be a part of human kind, to add 

03:40:14.581 --> 03:40:18.339
to, to contribute to 
human kind.

03:40:21.974 --> 03:40:24.357
Their passion and compassion.
          Is parallel.

03:40:24.358 --> 03:40:27.748
          And now I will survive
 will be one of them

03:40:27.749 --> 03:40:34.078
them. I know you performed 30 
anniversary Michael 

03:40:34.079 --> 03:40:38.981
Jackson concert -- thriller is 
also here. Okay. The 

03:40:38.982 --> 03:40:40.703
album -- I know a little bit 
about that -- this 

03:40:40.704 --> 03:40:44.954
brings me back -- to migrate 
College days. What was 

03:40:44.955 --> 03:40:51.789
it like to perform for Michael 
Jackson, and not very 

03:40:51.790 --> 03:40:56.330
many people got to know him.
          It was wonderful to 

03:40:56.331 --> 03:41:02.635
perform for and I 
believe to the constant survivor

03:41:02.639 --> 03:41:07.559
 -- he surviveed 
things throughout his life and 

03:41:07.560 --> 03:41:11.725
have him sitting in 
the audience and applauding and 

03:41:11.726 --> 03:41:14.417
smiling was 
absolutely wonderful. I became

03:41:18.943 --> 03:41:23.495
 295-cent grade A ham 
-- I had to do my best for the 

03:41:23.496 --> 03:41:26.228
best, and it was 
wonderful.

03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:28.904
          Give us some back 
stories for some other 

03:41:28.905 --> 03:41:33.338
things -- I am what I am.
          I am what I am was 

03:41:33.339 --> 03:41:39.285
brought to me by my 
producer, Eds been to the play 

03:41:39.286 --> 03:41:44.531
-- and heard the song 
-- sitting in his seat watching 

03:41:44.532 --> 03:41:49.808
the play he thought 
it would make a great disco song

03:41:49.817 --> 03:41:55.070
, called me the next 
day and had me listen to his 

03:41:55.071 --> 03:41:59.222
idea for the song. I 
was like this is great idea and 

03:41:59.223 --> 03:42:03.614
I was very happy to 
do that. And I was thinking of 

03:42:03.615 --> 03:42:05.031
-- I have going 
through the lyrics, I was 

03:42:05.032 --> 03:42:07.855
thinking of all the 
different things, all the 

03:42:07.856 --> 03:42:11.143
different reasons that 
people need to say I am what I 

03:42:11.144 --> 03:42:15.543
am, as I said I'm a 
designer's original, I'm not 

03:42:15.544 --> 03:42:18.376
anymore or any less 
than you or anybody else, and 

03:42:18.377 --> 03:42:22.180
because of who I am 
and how I look and what I wear 

03:42:22.181 --> 03:42:28.858
and how I think and 
how I feel, any of that -- and 

03:42:28.859 --> 03:42:30.236
yeah --
          &gt;&gt; 

03:42:30.237 --> 03:42:38.013
          I am what I am. 
Everyone wants to us -- 

03:42:38.014 --> 03:42:41.153
your part of something and 
that's why I am what I am 

03:42:41.154 --> 03:42:44.144
and other songs you have brought
 to us, do you think 

03:42:44.145 --> 03:42:49.246
that's part of the message about
 being inclusive? 

03:42:49.247 --> 03:42:52.685
          Yes I really do 
because I think that's why 

03:42:52.686 --> 03:42:57.646
disco music is so popular 
because it is include, 

03:42:57.647 --> 03:43:00.217
like I said every

03:43:04.066 --> 03:43:06.351
 race, creed, color, come 
together, 

03:43:06.352 --> 03:43:09.731
let's be a family, and if you 
wouldn't mind -- if 

03:43:09.732 --> 03:43:12.314
you wouldn't mine I have 
something that I think I 

03:43:12.315 --> 03:43:16.404
would like to say and it fits 
right here -- I'm 

03:43:16.405 --> 03:43:20.155
going to walk over to the podium
 and do this -- 

03:43:27.943 --> 03:43:29.251
You.
          (APPLAUSE).

03:43:29.252 --> 03:43:33.753
          Bear with me as I do 
this.

03:43:33.754 --> 03:43:36.487
          Are these working?
          Wonderful.

03:43:39.880 --> 03:43:45.206
Survive is defineed as to remain
 alive tox 

03:43:45.207 --> 03:43:51.965
sustain once self, pull through 
on or out. In 1978 I 

03:43:51.966 --> 03:43:56.824
recorded the song -- since then 
millions of men, 

03:43:56.825 --> 03:44:01.031
women and children have develop
ed this song as their 

03:44:01.032 --> 03:44:04.924
mantra including myself. Through
 the years what we 

03:44:04.925 --> 03:44:10.901
were hoping in our hearts I'm 
going to thrive, 

03:44:10.902 --> 03:44:17.566
thrive is defineed as continue 
to live despite of 

03:44:17.567 --> 03:44:22.581
danger, hardship and keep going 
through difficult 

03:44:22.582 --> 03:44:25.284
circumstances and we need to 
recognize that and be 

03:44:25.285 --> 03:44:29.392
aware of other people's 
structures and be willing to 

03:44:29.393 --> 03:44:32.792
help when and where we can. We 
don't care about 

03:44:32.793 --> 03:44:37.529
others we can't expect anyone to
 care about us. And 

03:44:37.530 --> 03:44:43.224
none of us will survive. It one 
group starts to 

03:44:43.225 --> 03:44:45.225
perpetrate

03:44:46.466 --> 03:44:51.141
 a hateful act with others -- it
 provides 

03:44:51.142 --> 03:44:55.564
others groups to do the same, 
until acts become 

03:44:55.565 --> 03:45:02.376
common place and normal.
          The death camps, the 

03:45:02.377 --> 03:45:08.609
slaveery, the South 
Africa -- the slaveer of the 

03:45:08.610 --> 03:45:17.318
confederate states -- 
the Earth in this case cleaning,

03:45:17.351 --> 03:45:20.736
 all went on far too 
long and those that managed to 

03:45:20.737 --> 03:45:26.285
survive did not do so 
without the help and concern and

03:45:26.293 --> 03:45:30.295
 caring of others. 
Any of it can happen again, 

03:45:30.296 --> 03:45:35.099
anywhere at any time. 
The only thing necessary for 

03:45:35.100 --> 03:45:37.342
evil to prevail is for 
good men to do nothing.

03:45:37.343 --> 03:45:40.629
          So it is up to each 
one of us to read 

03:45:40.630 --> 03:45:44.483
about, know the stories, relate,
 tell and discuss 

03:45:44.484 --> 03:45:48.172
the stories with others to keep 
them fresh in our 

03:45:48.173 --> 03:45:51.879
minds because if we don't care 
about all persons and 

03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:55.262
watch on the for each other evil
 will prevail and no 

03:45:55.263 --> 03:45:58.165
one is except.
          These United States of

03:45:58.218 --> 03:46:05.880
 America used to 
stand for under the banner of 

03:46:05.881 --> 03:46:10.356
one nation under God 
inDavissibility with liberty and

03:46:10.467 --> 03:46:13.136
 justice and all. 
Part of liberty and justice 

03:46:13.137 --> 03:46:15.911
means what I believe to 
be truth is different from what 

03:46:15.912 --> 03:46:20.299
you believe to be 
truth. We can and do share what 

03:46:20.300 --> 03:46:23.281
we each believe 
without reapproach from one 

03:46:23.282 --> 03:46:28.402
another. It means we are 
able to disagree without being 

03:46:28.403 --> 03:46:31.535
disagreeable. We 
share our beliefs without 

03:46:31.536 --> 03:46:35.224
condemnation. It means we 
speak the truth to one another 

03:46:35.225 --> 03:46:39.798
and love. It means 
that we respect one another N 

03:46:39.799 --> 03:46:43.072
enough to examine what 
the other believes to be the 

03:46:43.073 --> 03:46:48.929
truth, define what the 
truth we might be angle to 

03:46:48.930 --> 03:46:53.033
accept. It means that we 
are sure what we believe what is

03:46:53.278 --> 03:46:58.899
 true we show no 
hostility, disdain arrogance or 

03:46:58.900 --> 03:47:03.139
anger towards anyone
anyone's point of view. We show 

03:47:03.140 --> 03:47:06.232
no hostility, we 
have no problem listening to 

03:47:06.233 --> 03:47:09.686
what somebody else has 
to say because we're confident 

03:47:09.687 --> 03:47:13.117
in our own beliefs.
          If I had a diamond and

03:47:13.784 --> 03:47:17.767
 somebody else had a 
cubic sir Kona and thought it 

03:47:17.768 --> 03:47:22.466
was just as valuable 
as my diamond I wouldn't be 

03:47:22.467 --> 03:47:25.856
angry with them. I would 
fry to share with them what I 

03:47:25.857 --> 03:47:28.700
know to be the 
difference and the benefit of a 

03:47:28.701 --> 03:47:33.252
diamond and what it 
has -- the benefit it has, if 

03:47:33.253 --> 03:47:38.256
they refuse to listen, 
I would hope and pray somebody 

03:47:38.257 --> 03:47:42.921
else and would one 
day be able to explain so they 

03:47:42.922 --> 03:47:44.956
can receive it.
          If that never happened

03:47:45.195 --> 03:47:48.784
 that person would 
simply lose out when they would 

03:47:48.785 --> 03:47:52.036
get to retirement 
age and I would be very sorry 

03:47:52.037 --> 03:47:56.579
for them but I would 
have done all I could help. In 

03:47:56.580 --> 03:48:00.280
attitude in dealing 
with others is the only way to 

03:48:00.281 --> 03:48:03.108
live in peace and 
harmony with others with 

03:48:03.109 --> 03:48:08.429
different ideas and 
ideologyies. Because the 

03:48:08.430 --> 03:48:11.143
popularity of I will survive 
my name has become

03:48:15.101 --> 03:48:21.170
 -- of course getting on in age 
-- 

03:48:21.171 --> 03:48:24.157
I have to admit adds a little to
 that.

03:48:24.158 --> 03:48:28.040
          Among the many things 
that extensive 

03:48:28.041 --> 03:48:31.598
travel has done for me is it 
convinced me of 

03:48:31.599 --> 03:48:33.862
something, that I live in the 
greatest country in 

03:48:33.863 --> 03:48:37.973
the world.
          I have off continue 

03:48:37.974 --> 03:48:39.974
said I am

03:48:41.961 --> 03:48:44.987
 295 and a 
half% American, we sing God less

03:48:45.819 --> 03:48:49.957
 America, well what 
I've seen and experienced in my 

03:48:49.958 --> 03:48:53.052
travels God has 
blessed America. My travels have

03:48:53.591 --> 03:48:57.048
 made me cog glance 
of the fact that we're the 

03:48:57.049 --> 03:49:00.880
babies or teenagers of 
the world and are pretty much 

03:49:00.881 --> 03:49:04.985
running things. 
America has become a teenage 

03:49:04.986 --> 03:49:10.235
rock sister.
          I learn that people of

03:49:10.428 --> 03:49:14.084
 other nations have 
loveed and respected us, they've

03:49:14.801 --> 03:49:18.789
 copyied everything 
from our politics to our bad 

03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:24.782
habits and every 
changing fashion sense -- and 

03:49:24.783 --> 03:49:30.171
our bad eating habits. 
I called McDonald's our American

03:49:31.883 --> 03:49:32.860
 am ambassador 
because it's everywhere.

03:49:32.861 --> 03:49:37.688
          I also find we have 
the best japing food 

03:49:37.689 --> 03:49:41.109
in the world. Depending on your 
point of view we're 

03:49:41.110 --> 03:49:44.800
the richest country in the world
. Why? We have 

03:49:44.801 --> 03:49:49.094
become like international rock 
stars in every way. 

03:49:49.095 --> 03:49:54.912
We seem to be so wrapped up with
 our fame and 

03:49:54.913 --> 03:49:58.659
fortunate that we have gun to 
believe our own

03:50:02.063 --> 03:50:04.749
 height 
-- smooth over the bad publicity

03:50:05.284 --> 03:50:08.113
, like the teenager 
teenage rock star.

03:50:08.114 --> 03:50:13.532
          It seems to me trying 
to analyze any ills, 

03:50:13.533 --> 03:50:18.644
we down play the cause of any 
problems and treat the 

03:50:18.645 --> 03:50:21.970
symptoms.
          I'm not a political 

03:50:21.971 --> 03:50:27.042
person, but I say it's 
a safe bet that a lot needs to 

03:50:27.043 --> 03:50:29.312
change.
          One thing, we have 

03:50:29.313 --> 03:50:33.158
become a nation that's 
upset with treating symptoms. 

03:50:33.316 --> 03:50:38.295
Identify said to my 
friends we here in the America 

03:50:38.296 --> 03:50:45.999
got the recommend did 
I for whatever -- if you have 

03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:49.283
pain we have the 
process to get rid of the pain. 

03:50:52.954 --> 03:50:56.647
We have got to 
become concerned with treating 

03:50:56.648 --> 03:51:00.735
the core and causes 
of our problems. We got to get 

03:51:00.736 --> 03:51:05.033
back to absolute, 
without absolute we will perish.

03:51:05.034 --> 03:51:09.437
 We know right from 
wrong -- sorry -- we know right 

03:51:09.438 --> 03:51:14.260
from wrong, we no 
good from evil, we know how to 

03:51:14.261 --> 03:51:22.244
cure the ills of this 
nation -- we need to change 

03:51:22.245 --> 03:51:24.923
agreed agreed and 
selfishness, it has to start 

03:51:24.924 --> 03:51:26.953
with you.
          With you the 

03:51:26.954 --> 03:51:32.459
individual. You must become, 
I must become the industry in 

03:51:32.460 --> 03:51:39.442
the hands our savor. 
Our savor is unselfishness, our 

03:51:39.443 --> 03:51:43.842
savor is grace and 
mercy than the less fortunate 

03:51:43.843 --> 03:51:47.122
than we are. Our savor 
is recognizeing that we are a 

03:51:47.123 --> 03:51:50.826
family and just as with 
your blood families there are 

03:51:50.827 --> 03:51:52.795
those we don't 
particular like.

03:51:52.796 --> 03:51:59.936
          But if we are to 
survive as a family, as a 

03:51:59.937 --> 03:52:03.077
nation, we must all have the 
opportunities to 

03:52:03.078 --> 03:52:07.122
survive.
          We need to trampel 

03:52:07.123 --> 03:52:09.123
down the

03:52:10.159 --> 03:52:14.564
 -- to prosper, 
to reach his or her greatest 

03:52:14.565 --> 03:52:18.275
potential or highest 
level of productivity, you 

03:52:18.276 --> 03:52:20.541
deprive yourself of 
whatever that person might have 

03:52:20.542 --> 03:52:25.084
been able or willing 
to contribute to the better. Of 

03:52:25.085 --> 03:52:29.779
man kind.
          It amounts to cutting 

03:52:29.780 --> 03:52:32.925
off your own nose 
despite your face.

03:52:32.926 --> 03:52:37.958
          The Bible says, we 
have inherited ability 

03:52:37.959 --> 03:52:43.434
to hide in our own hearts, we 
make our hearts the 

03:52:43.435 --> 03:52:47.422
breeding ground for sin. That's 
an old fashion world

03:52:47.423 --> 03:52:51.308
world.
          One that we rarely 

03:52:51.309 --> 03:52:54.552
hear because we are 
assignmented to say it.

03:52:54.553 --> 03:53:00.784
          Most many of us are 
not ashameed to do what 

03:53:00.785 --> 03:53:03.365
it means.
          The Bible says you 

03:53:03.366 --> 03:53:06.737
should know the truth 
and the truth will set you free 

03:53:06.738 --> 03:53:09.031
-- we need to 
recognize the truth that you 

03:53:09.032 --> 03:53:12.020
walk in will set you 
free. You need to do what you 

03:53:12.021 --> 03:53:15.884
know to be right in 
order for what you know to set 

03:53:15.885 --> 03:53:22.386
you free. It's as 
we've all been put in prison, 

03:53:22.387 --> 03:53:31.484
and in order to get 
out we must pay basketball, 

03:53:31.485 --> 03:53:37.066
that's truth. We insists 
on staying in jail and not walk

03:53:37.206 --> 03:53:41.042
ing in our freedom, 
why? Very similarly and very sad

03:53:41.115 --> 03:53:43.014
ly because everyone 
is doing it.

03:53:47.432 --> 03:53:48.829
Nobody has the courage to say 
this is 

03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:53.027
wrong. This is counter 
productive, this is not in 

03:53:53.028 --> 03:53:57.236
our best interest, no one is 
willing to recognize 

03:53:57.237 --> 03:54:01.076
the fact that if we stay on this
 path we'll perish. 

03:54:01.077 --> 03:54:08.061
We're not the blind leading the 
blind -- it begins 

03:54:08.062 --> 03:54:13.221
the criteria for our behaver. 
Are we all sheep just 

03:54:13.222 --> 03:54:17.572
following some leader to 
slaughter. The big 

03:54:17.573 --> 03:54:20.161
difference between us and sheep 
we get to choose our 

03:54:20.162 --> 03:54:28.793
leaders and to -- we must follow
 those -- what 

03:54:28.794 --> 03:54:33.811
criteria are we using to choose 
our leaders and are 

03:54:33.812 --> 03:54:37.656
leaders concerned with to make 
their choices, to 

03:54:37.657 --> 03:54:41.341
create law that's are in the 
best interests of us or 

03:54:41.342 --> 03:54:45.442
even in their own best interests
. Are we also bogged 

03:54:45.443 --> 03:54:49.219
down what's good for me, what 
peels goods to me --

03:54:57.065 --> 03:55:00.003
 chooseers and chosen
chosen, legitted and electricity

03:55:00.523 --> 03:55:04.288
 teres, have we 
forgotten that we are one nation

03:55:04.396 --> 03:55:07.516
 undergoes or is is 
that no belonger really true? 

03:55:07.660 --> 03:55:11.749
With you we stopped 
saying it other schools, out 

03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:15.450
loud in other places 
have we stopped saying, believe

03:55:15.453 --> 03:55:18.895
ing it or wanting it 
in our hearts.  Are we so 

03:55:18.896 --> 03:55:24.016
wrapped up in ourselves 
that we're willing to know and 

03:55:24.017 --> 03:55:27.366
what happenses what's 
best for each of us and capeable

03:55:27.370 --> 03:55:30.528
 of working things 
out in a way that we all win.

03:55:30.529 --> 03:55:34.360
          I know some of you are
 thinking I didn't 

03:55:34.361 --> 03:55:39.259
come here for a sermon, well 
when I decided to speak 

03:55:39.260 --> 03:55:41.771
I didn't intend to give one, I 
did want to say 

03:55:41.772 --> 03:55:46.108
things that would be meaningful 
and helpful and call 

03:55:46.109 --> 03:55:50.605
us all to responsibility. This 
is an idea the time 

03:55:50.606 --> 03:55:53.208
has come again.
          The next crop of 

03:55:53.209 --> 03:55:58.024
leaders in this nation 
whether in government, in 

03:55:58.025 --> 03:56:00.702
corporate America is going 
to have the responsibility of 

03:56:00.703 --> 03:56:07.894
joining the leaders in 
helping this nation to fail or 

03:56:07.895 --> 03:56:11.102
rise or Diane survive
survive, we can survive together

03:56:11.732 --> 03:56:15.185
 or perish bidefault 
because not enough of us care 

03:56:15.186 --> 03:56:16.761
enough of this nation 
together.

03:56:16.762 --> 03:56:20.296
          Everyone knows you 
must care, take care of 

03:56:20.297 --> 03:56:25.015
and keep from the foundation. 
The working class. The 

03:56:25.016 --> 03:56:30.599
working class is the foundation.
          Those that have risen 

03:56:30.600 --> 03:56:35.600
up have done so 
because we have a strong working

03:56:36.395 --> 03:56:39.958
 class.  We stand on 
their shoulders. The creation of

03:56:39.964 --> 03:56:45.673
 this nation we have 
progressed and prospered for 

03:56:45.674 --> 03:56:50.387
those who are too weak 
to fight for themselves. 

03:57:03.251 --> 03:57:05.870
This is no coincidence deny 
dense.

03:57:05.871 --> 03:57:12.825
          -- a false sense of 
security only to be a

03:57:12.826 --> 03:57:16.906
aWayne by thoughts from the 
outside. We have seen 

03:57:16.907 --> 03:57:21.921
the end myopathy us.
          Another wise man has 

03:57:21.922 --> 03:57:25.300
quoted what's wrong 
with the world -- I am.

03:57:25.301 --> 03:57:30.000
          If you study the 
lessons of seven habits 

03:57:30.001 --> 03:57:33.557
of highly successful people and 
road to character, 

03:57:33.558 --> 03:57:39.708
you'll learn the lessons 
necessary for success. 

03:57:39.709 --> 03:57:43.527
You're doomed to failure if you 
allow your gifts, 

03:57:43.528 --> 03:57:46.345
tall limits and abilityies to 
take you to a place 

03:57:46.346 --> 03:57:50.903
where your character cannot 
sustain you. This apply

03:57:50.904 --> 03:57:54.440
applies to a nation as well as 
an individual. It's 

03:57:54.441 --> 03:57:59.100
equally dangerous because it's 
arrogance and a flaw 

03:57:59.101 --> 03:58:03.966
to think you can sustain 
accessibility up on good 

03:58:03.967 --> 03:58:06.712
character even though you allow 
that good character 

03:58:06.713 --> 03:58:09.330
to deteriorate. That is what 
that nation has done.

03:58:09.331 --> 03:58:12.653
          The truth is if you 
cannot honestly say 

03:58:12.654 --> 03:58:16.357
that you've done all you can to 
fix what's wrong, 

03:58:16.358 --> 03:58:19.976
you cannot honestly say it's not
 my fault.

03:58:24.037 --> 03:58:27.877
I'm not naive enough to think 
that this 

03:58:27.878 --> 03:58:31.268
can happen quickly or even 
within the next 

03:58:31.269 --> 03:58:36.545
generation or two. We need 
radical change and it 

03:58:36.546 --> 03:58:41.090
always calls for revolution. It 
will be a task. 

03:58:41.091 --> 03:58:46.395
While it must be a peaceful 
Revelation, it must be 

03:58:46.396 --> 03:58:50.207
spread thought the nation, not 
necessarily to all 

03:58:50.208 --> 03:58:53.887
but toa larger enough majority 
to bring that radical 

03:58:53.888 --> 03:58:57.811
change, therefore it will be met
 with opposition 

03:58:57.812 --> 03:59:02.497
from those that are so limited 
in fore site that 

03:59:02.498 --> 03:59:07.003
they prefer the status quo. But 
every journey begins 

03:59:07.004 --> 03:59:11.549
with one step and this is the 
journey that must 

03:59:11.550 --> 03:59:14.685
begin. The nation is broken. As 
great a task as it 

03:59:14.686 --> 03:59:18.529
is, as unfair as it is, as young
 people say, it is 

03:59:18.530 --> 03:59:22.486
what it is.
          And it is our daunting

03:59:22.490 --> 03:59:25.458
 task to fix it.
          The good news is we 

03:59:25.459 --> 03:59:30.754
can.
          Call me an optimist, 

03:59:30.755 --> 03:59:34.155
but I believe we can, 
but only if enough of us are 

03:59:34.156 --> 03:59:39.472
ready to take the bull 
by the horns, refuse to be self-

03:59:39.852 --> 03:59:44.686
indull gent, refuse 
to walk in ignorance or 

03:59:44.687 --> 03:59:48.502
arrogance, we are a family 
and we are your brother's keeper

03:59:48.503 --> 03:59:51.770
.
          We are true to and 

03:59:51.771 --> 03:59:55.633
persistent about these 
things, I promise you as a 

03:59:55.634 --> 03:59:59.064
people, as a nation, we 
will survive.

03:59:59.065 --> 04:00:01.065
                    (APPLAUSE).

04:00:07.612 --> 04:00:09.612
          Girl. 

04:00:11.704 --> 04:00:15.009
          (APPLAUSE).
          Thank you.

04:00:32.184 --> 04:00:34.620
Thank you so much. Thank you for
 bearing 

04:00:34.621 --> 04:00:37.315
with me through that. But it was
 on my heart.

04:00:37.316 --> 04:00:44.971
          We're backstage, and 
Gloria said to me I 

04:00:44.972 --> 04:00:48.262
have something that I want to 
say to folks -- didn't 

04:00:48.263 --> 04:00:51.253
tell me what it was -- said at 
some point that she 

04:00:51.254 --> 04:00:54.174
was going to share that she want
ed to go to the 

04:00:54.175 --> 04:00:56.810
podium.
          Wow.

04:00:56.811 --> 04:01:02.172
                    Thank you.
          To have the courage, 

04:01:02.173 --> 04:01:04.242
to speak what's in 
your heart,

04:01:08.139 --> 04:01:10.172
 where -- why did you want to do
 this? 

04:01:10.173 --> 04:01:13.499
Where did this come from? 
Because if you said you're 

04:01:13.500 --> 04:01:17.389
not a political person, and it 
shoot be seen if you 

04:01:17.390 --> 04:01:22.011
talk about the challenges that 
we're facing that's 

04:01:22.012 --> 04:01:23.511
all of a sudden you're right, 
left, this, that and 

04:01:23.512 --> 04:01:27.517
the other, we're all humans -- 
what was it that led 

04:01:27.518 --> 04:01:31.069
you to say those words? 
          Well, the

04:01:44.723 --> 04:01:45.964
 -- this was a speech I was 
going 

04:01:45.965 --> 04:01:52.109
to give in a College, when they 
look theeled at it 

04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:58.116
thecate it 90% of what I said 
here, but I felt I 

04:01:58.117 --> 04:02:03.309
needed to say needed to be said,
 when where it came 

04:02:03.310 --> 04:02:05.982
from, when I was called to speak

04:02:09.892 --> 04:02:13.800
 I went to my prayer 
closet, sat down,

04:02:22.688 --> 04:02:24.516
 I said I don't know what to say
 to 

04:02:24.517 --> 04:02:29.768
them -- I felt something and I 
grab my cell phone 

04:02:29.769 --> 04:02:34.470
and I put it on dictate and I 
began to say -- there 

04:02:34.471 --> 04:02:40.057
goes an I-Phone -- I began to 
say what I heard in my 

04:02:40.058 --> 04:02:43.011
heart -- and that's -- I didn't 
change it -- that's 

04:02:43.012 --> 04:02:47.050
it.
          That's where it came 

04:02:47.051 --> 04:02:50.490
from.
          Right there. God bless

04:02:50.497 --> 04:02:52.497
 you.

04:02:54.800 --> 04:02:59.505
Your story, your words, your 
music, who 

04:02:59.506 --> 04:03:03.511
you are, has been something that
 has helped a lot of 

04:03:03.512 --> 04:03:07.609
people, living your truth as you
 have, facing the 

04:03:07.610 --> 04:03:09.610
challenges that you

04:03:20.722 --> 04:03:25.694
 lost -- how have you been able 
been able to survive?

04:03:25.695 --> 04:03:31.923
          I survive in that 
closet -- I really do -- 

04:03:31.924 --> 04:03:36.492
I take I have everything to God 
my faith -- my faith 

04:03:36.493 --> 04:03:39.612
is very strong. I know God in a 
personal way that I 

04:03:39.613 --> 04:03:43.157
believe he wants to know each 
and everyone of us, I 

04:03:43.158 --> 04:03:47.158
sit down and talk to my daddy --
 I say I don't 

04:03:47.159 --> 04:03:51.004
understand -- I do understand 
but I don't like it -- 

04:03:51.005 --> 04:03:54.282
I need help in this -- somebody 
else needs help -- 

04:03:54.283 --> 04:03:58.845
my friends -- I would like to do
 this with so and so 

04:03:58.846 --> 04:04:03.638
-- your will be done but please,
 can you -- I just 

04:04:03.639 --> 04:04:06.788
go to him and that's how I 
survive everything.

04:04:06.789 --> 04:04:09.613
          I have this plaque in 
my dressing room 

04:04:09.614 --> 04:04:15.900
that says this too shall pass.
          Amen.

04:04:15.901 --> 04:04:20.878
          That would be good. 
Right there on my 

04:04:20.879 --> 04:04:23.986
remember. Mirror.
          As we conclude, a lot 

04:04:23.987 --> 04:04:25.987
of people, we have

04:04:30.653 --> 04:04:33.968
 one piece of advice 
you can give us to help us --

04:04:41.033 --> 04:04:44.173
 I follow -- I can only 
give you what I have.

04:04:44.174 --> 04:04:50.884
          I follow one 
particular scripture, it's my 

04:04:50.885 --> 04:04:55.162
favorite scripture, in all my 
ways I acknowledge hip

04:04:55.163 --> 04:05:00.817
hip, and he addicts my path.
          Amen. Gloria Gaynor 

04:05:00.818 --> 04:05:02.722
ladieses and gentlemen
gentlemen.

04:05:14.467 --> 04:05:16.467
          (APPLAUSE)

04:05:28.689 --> 04:05:30.689
.
          She's going to sing. 

04:05:31.152 --> 04:05:32.992
Don't worry. She's 
going to sing.
