00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.560
You know how your mom told you to eat your
broccoli?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.720
She was right - better eat it(!) or you gon'
die.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.020
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.769
I'm not ashamed to admit it!

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.310
Broccoli is one of my all time favorite vegetables.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.400
And now there's an excuse to eat 25 pounds
of them per day....well, approximately.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.430
You may have seen Trace's video he did awhile
back about how China is one of the most polluted

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.430
countries in the world.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.570
The World Health Organisation recommends that
cities not exceed a particulate matter 2.5

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
concentration of 25 micrograms -- these are
the particles that can penetrate deeply into

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380
your lungs and enter the bloodstream.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.260
Beijing's concentration....is over 500 micrograms.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520
The Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences report
that Beijing's pollution is so bad, it's almost

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.510
uninhabitable by humans.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.890
Rough times you guys.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.170
But now, broccoli is coming to the rescue.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.000
Research from Johns Hopkins on 300 men and
women in rural China found that by drinking

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.219
a beverage with broccoli sprouts every day,
they can excrete some of the pollutants through

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.219
their urine.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.149
Compared to their control group, the group
that was drinking of the broccoli sprout drink

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.590
excreted 60% more benzene out with their pee
-- and 23% more acrolein!

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.859
Benzene is a known carcinogen, it has been
linked repeatedly with leukemia and other

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:11.859
blood-related cancers.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.659
Acrolein, on the other hand, is a chemical
that causes irritation of the respiratory

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.659
tract.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.469
It may also cause cancer, scientists don't
know for sure.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.420
The drink might even help secrete other pollutants
as well, scientists just studied these two

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.109
because they are the most stable molecules
-- good for tracking.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.920
They found that throughout all 3 months of
the study, the benzene and acrolein excretion

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.359
stayed the same too, so it wasn't just a one
time thing.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.600
How is it that broccoli sprouts are able to
work this wizardry?

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.579
Broccoli contains glucoraphanin , which, when
you eat it, creates another compound called

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.249
sulforaphane.

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.601
Sulforaphane signals enzymes in your body
to get to work, breaking the pollutants down

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:47.549
to be washed out through your urine.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.549
Unfortunately, scientists think that sulforaphane
only breaks down chemicals you've JUST been

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.560
exposed to, so it may not be very helpful
for pollutants, pesticides, and other nasty

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.819
junk that are already lingering in your fat
cells.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.270
Scientists have also observed indirect antioxidant
effects with sulforaphane -- the enzymes it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.849
catalyzes can block chemicals in the body
from becoming carcinogen.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.770
It's kind of magical isn't it?

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.539
EAT THIS...PEE THIS OUT.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.260
Sometimes I'm just in awe of the human body
and all these complicated chemical processes

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.230
that are going on inside of us ALL THE TIME.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.650
And all you gotta do to amp it up...is eat
your broccoli.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.049
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone.

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.560
