00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.330
We're asked to graph the
proportional relationship shown

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.150
in the table below.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.160
And they give us a
table of x values,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.189
and the corresponding y values.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.671
So we see when x is equal
to 0, y is equal to 0.

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:13.420
Then they give us a
bunch of other points.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.730
When x is 3, y is 0.5.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.632
When x is 6, y is 1,
so on and so forth.

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:21.340
So let's graph one of
these that actually

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.690
have integer values
for both coordinates.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.660
So when x is 6, y is 1.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.660
So we only need two points
to specify the line.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.180
So we've actually graphed it.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.309
But then they also ask us,
what is the slope of this line?

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.850
And we just have to
remind ourselves.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.160
Our slope is what is our change
in y for a given change in x.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.290
So, for example, or another
way to think about it,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.100
what is your change in
y over your change in x?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.210
So here, our x changed by 6.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.800
It went from 0 to 6.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.190
And our y changed by 1.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.289
So our change in
y over our change

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.580
in x, which is the definition
of slope, our change in y

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.528
is 1, when our change in x is 6.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:04.569
See that right over here.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.700
Change in y, 1 when
our change in x is 6.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.240
Let's check our answer.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270
We got it right.
