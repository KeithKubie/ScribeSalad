00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.810
- [Instructor] Regulations
require that product labels

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.060
on containers of food that
are available for sale

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.960
to the public accurately
state the amount of food

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.500
in those containers.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.050
Specifically, if milk
containers are labeled

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.820
to have 128 fluid ounces and
the mean number of fluid ounces

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.730
of milk in the containers is at least 128,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.710
the milk processor is considered

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.370
to be in compliance with the regulations.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.630
The filling machines can be
set to the labeled amount.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.710
Variability in the filling process

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.240
causes the actual contents
of milk containers

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.170
to be normally distributed.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.880
A random sample of 12
containers of milk was drawn

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.710
from the milk processing line in a plant,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.680
and the amount of milk in
each container was recorded.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.280
The sample mean and standard
deviation of this sample

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.070
of 12 containers of milk were 127.2 ounces

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.880
and 2.1 ounces, respectively.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.860
Is there sufficient evidence to conclude

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.410
that the packaging plant is not

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.630
in compliance with the regulations?

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.830
Provide statistical
justification for your answer.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.020
So pause this video, and see
if you can have a go at it.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.790
All right, now let's do this together.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.060
So first, let's say what
we're talking about.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910
So let me define mu.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.610
And this is going to be the mean,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.060
mean amount,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.910
amount of

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.743
milk

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.730
in population,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.570
population

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.139
of containers,

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:31.600
containers

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.870
at the plant

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.360
that we care about.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.260
And so then we can set up our hypotheses.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.150
Our null hypothesis over here
is that we are in compliance.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.820
We could say that the mean

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.210
for our population of
containers is actually 128.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.750
That's our minimum we
need to be in compliance.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.550
And then our alternative hypothesis is

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.380
that we are not in compliance.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.750
So that's that our mean,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.920
the true population mean, is less than 128

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.350
fluid ounces.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.570
And so this is a situation
where we are not in compliance,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.730
not in compliance,

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.630
compliance in

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.980
the alternative hypothesis.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.430
Now, if you're going to
do a significance test,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.000
you need to set a significance level.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.570
So let's do that over here,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.190
significance level.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.314
And if you haven't noticed,

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:24.900
I'm trying to do, in this video,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.860
what would be expected of you on a test.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.370
This is an actual
question from an AP exam.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.050
So our significance level here,
I'll just pick it to be 0.05

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.930
because, well, that's
a fairly typical one.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.440
And since they didn't give one to us,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.470
it's important to set one ahead of time.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.150
And now we want to check our
conditions for inference.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.200
So let me do that over here, conditions,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.770
conditions

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.200
for

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.100
inference.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.300
And this is to feel good that
the sample that we're using

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.410
to make our inference, to
do our significance test,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.420
that it's a reasonable one
to make inferences from.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.260
And so the first one is,
are the random condition.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.210
And do we need that?

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.380
Well, they tell us here
it's a random sample

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.260
of 12 containers

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.510
of milk.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.470
If I was doing this on the AP exam,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.850
I would write it out here.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.930
So I would say, in the
passage or in the question,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.300
in the question,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.700
they say,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.250
they say

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.130
a random,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.930
a random

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.920
sample

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.830
of 12, and then they go
on to say more things.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.160
And so I would say that meets condition,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.300
meets condition.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.840
Now the next one we want to care about

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.920
is our normal condition,
and this is to feel good

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.050
that our sampling distribution
is roughly normal.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.150
Now, there's a couple of
ways that we could do that.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.220
One is if our sample
size is greater than 30

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.150
or greater than or equal
to 30, then we'd say, okay,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.950
our sampling distribution's
going to be roughly normal.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.950
But in this situation, our
sample size N, so sample size,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.980
sample size

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.040
is less than 30, but,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.090
but there's another way to
meet the normal condition.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.470
And that's if the underlying parent data

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.900
is normally distributed.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.390
And they actually say it right over here.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.340
Variability in the filling process

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.460
causes the actual contents of milk

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.210
to be normally distributed.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.920
So we could say in passage,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.360
in passage says,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.380
and let's see, I could quote part of this.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.730
So actual contents,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.950
actual

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.100
contents

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.380
and dot, dot, dot, normally distributed,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.500
normally

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.020
distributed.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.520
So that meets condition,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.740
meets condition.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.040
And then the last condition we want

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.594
to think about is the
independence condition,

00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:03.430
independence.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.590
And this is to feel good
that the observations,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.810
that the individual
observations in our sample

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.610
can be considered to
be roughly independent.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.030
Now one way is if they were
sampling with replacement,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.940
which they're not doing here.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.520
Looks like they took all
12 containers at once.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.420
But another way is if
this is less than 10%

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.370
of the overall population,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.520
then you could say, okay, they're gonna,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.310
you could view them as
roughly independent.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.020
And so you can say didn't,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.650
didn't

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.810
sample

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.780
with replacement,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.020
with replacement,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.853
but,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.893
but

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.290
assume,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.210
assume

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.913
that

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.160
12 is less than 10%

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.980
of the population.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.080
And in that case, you
would meet condition,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.900
meet this condition as well.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.890
So it looks like we are,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.620
we've met these three conditions

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.900
that we needed to make for inference,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.230
or we can assume we've done it.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.350
They haven't given us any
information to the contrary.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.970
And so now, what we can do
is calculate a t-statistic

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.920
and then, from that,
calculate our P-value,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.560
compare our P-value to
our significance level,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.710
and see what kind of
conclusions we can make.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.910
And so our t-statistic right
over here, and, once again,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.480
if at any point you're
inspired and if you haven't

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.610
done so already, try to do it on your own.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.760
Our t-statistic is going
to be our sample mean

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.220
minus the assumed mean
from the null hypothesis.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.410
And let me, since I'm
introducing this notation,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.150
this little sub zero, I'll
say that's the assumed,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.900
assumed mean

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.310
from

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.100
my null hypothesis.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.130
So I'll do that, and then I'll divide,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.980
ideally, if I was doing a z-statistic,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.940
I would divide by the standard deviation

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.600
of the sampling distribution
of the sample mean,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.070
which is often known as the
standard error of the mean.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.340
But the whole reason why I'm
doing a t-statistic is, well,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.530
I don't know exactly what
that is, but I could estimate

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.680
the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.930
of the sample mean using the
sample standard deviation

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.230
divided by the square root of n.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.670
And once again, it's always good,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.260
if you're doing this on a
test, to explain what n is

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.830
or what some of these things are.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.820
If you're using standard notation,

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.430
people might assume what they are, but,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.980
if you have time on these tests,
you can always explain more

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.830
of what these actual variables are.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.830
But in this case, this
is going to be 127.2,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.430
that is our sample mean,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.130
minus our assumed mean from
our null hypothesis, minus 128,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.080
all of that over our sample
standard deviation is 2.1,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.780
divided by the square root of 12.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.010
And so this is going to
be approximately equal to,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.610
get a calculator out here,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.370
and so we have, let's see,
the numerator, we have 127.2

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.240
minus 128.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.120
And then we're gonna divide that by,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.690
I'll do another parentheses, 2.1

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.620
divided by

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.970
the square root

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.370
of 12.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.870
And then

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.840
let me close

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.240
my parentheses.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.870
Did I type that in correctly?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.980
Yeah, that looks right.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.120
Click enter, and so this is negative,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.530
I'll say it's approximately negative 1.32.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.080
So negative 1.32.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.810
And now we can figure out our P-value,

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.410
our P-value, which is the
same thing as the probability

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.600
of getting a t-statistic
this low or lower.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.270
So we could say t is less than
or equal to negative 1.32,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.700
is equal to, so I'll get
my calculator back out.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.700
And so here, what I would
use is I would use the

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.160
cumulative distribution
function for t-statistic.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.750
So that's that right over there.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.200
And so I do care about the left tail.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.410
So I care about the area under the curve

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.250
from negative infinity up to
and including negative 1.32.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.950
So let's do negative,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.440
negative 1.32.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.990
And then my degrees of freedom,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.870
well, it's gonna be my
sample size minus one.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.330
My sample size was 12,
so that minus one is 11.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.630
And then I do paste.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.480
And so I have this tcdf

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.030
from negative E 99

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.670
to negative 1.32 comma 11.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.290
And actually, you'd
want to write this down

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.900
on your exam if you were doing it,

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.650
just so they know where you got that from.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.700
And so this is,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.480
this is equal to 0.107.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
So let me write it.

00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:52.150
This is approximately 0.107.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.600
And it's important to say
how you calculated this,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.420
so used,

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.880
used tcdf.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.160
And we went from negative one

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.870
times 10 to the 99th power.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.920
And we went up to negative 1.32,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.120
and then we had 11 degrees of freedom

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.480
to get this result right over here.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.490
And it also might be good practice

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.090
to draw your t-distribution
right over here.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.610
So that's our t-distribution.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.720
That's the mean of our t-distribution.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.600
So we say that this is the
area that we care about.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.370
So that is

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.380
that right over there,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.910
just to make sure people know
what we're talking about.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.350
And so here, now we're
ready to make a conclusion.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.780
We can compare this to
our significance level.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.430
And so we can say since,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.630
since

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.210
0.107

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.100
is greater than,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.160
our significance level
is greater than 0.05,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.770
which is alpha,

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.410
we fail,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.050
we fail

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.390
to reject,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.850
reject the null hypothesis.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.810
And so let's just make sure
we read their question right.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.830
Is there sufficient evidence to conclude

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.270
that the packaging plant
is not in compliance

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.260
with the regulations?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.580
And so another way of
saying this is there is not,

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.480
there is not

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.730
sufficient,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.130
sufficient, I'm gonna have
to scroll down a little bit.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.100
I'm trying to squeeze it on the page, but

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.260
I'm gonna have to go down.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.410
There is not

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.930
sufficient evidence,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.030
sufficient evidence to conclude,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.240
to conclude

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.513
that

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.140
the plant

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.340
is not

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.750
in compliance with regulations.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.560
And then we are done.
