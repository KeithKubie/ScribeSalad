00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.603
<i> It seemed like the centerpiece
 of every celebrity tipping stor</i>

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.738
<i> is a photo
 of the transaction receipt</i>

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:08.608
<i> with the celebrity's full name
 and account number on it.</i>

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.743
<i> If we fake the receipt,
 there's a chance</i>

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:13.646
<i> a nosy journalist could verify
 the transaction</i>

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.448
<i> and expose the fraud.</i>

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.550
<i> So if we really wanted it
 to appear real,</i>

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.119
<i> We'd have to use a bank card
 that was owned by someone</i>

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:22.188
<i> with the same name
 as our celebrity.</i>

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.424
<i> So I started calling
 every Michael Richards</i>

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.226
<i> listed the local white pages
 to ask for permission</i>

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.129
<i> to borrow their bank card
 for a one-time transaction</i>

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.731
<i> they'd be fully reimbursed for.</i>

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.600 line:0%
<i> ...and for--</i>

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.213
<i> - But unfortunately,
 none of them would help me out.</i>

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.385
Ok--hello?
Mr. Richards?

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:55.254
<i> For a moment, I thought
 I was all out of options,</i>

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.490
<i> but then it occurred to me
 that if we could find someone</i>

00:00:57.523 --> 00:01:00.593
<i> who was willing to temporarily
 change their legal name</i>

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.295
<i> to Michael Richards,
 we'd be able</i>

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:04.397 line:0%
<i> to open up a bank account
 on their behalf</i>

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.234 line:0%
<i> and get the debit card we neede
 to make the transaction real.</i>

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:11.737
<i> And after posting several ads,
 we finally got a response.</i>

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.709
- So can I ask why you wanna
change your name?

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.411
- I've been Paul
for a long time.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:21.214
Since I was a kid,
uh, I think probably five.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.216
Um...

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.318
my family started
calling me by my middle name

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.854
and it just stuck.
- So you just wanted

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.555
to be Paul Holmes?
- Yeah.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.758
- Okay, for this project,
I'm willing to pay you...

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.193
- Mm-hmm.
- To change your name

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:37.563
to Michael Richards.
- Okay.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:40.166
[laughs]
Why?

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.768
- We're trying to make it seem
like a man by that name

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.171
left a big tip
at a restaurant.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.740
- Okay.
- And...

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:51.410
for that I'd be willing
to pay you $1,000.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:54.481
[lightly chuckles]

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.285
Uh, what's going through
my brain right now

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:01.687
is the huge
pain in the ass this is.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.756
You know? Uh...

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.325
and I'm thinking
if $1,000 is worth it.

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:08.327
Um...

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.562
I mean, is this a yard sale?

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:12.165
Can I counter offer
with some money?

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.433
- What amount do you feel
comfortable with?

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.836
- 14's in my head.
I like it.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.704
Uh, you can counter offer
with 12.

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.873
Whatever man, you know?
Give me anything over 1,000

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:23.242
and I'll think that I win.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:27.313
- So, like, $1,001?
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.315
- You'd be happy with that?
- Yeah, sure.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.918
- Okay.
So, she we do $1,001?

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.252
- Sure. Yes.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:34.887
- I mean, is that--
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.589
- As long as you're happy.
- I am happy.

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:37.590 align:end position:100%
- I just wanna make
sure you're happy with that.

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.458
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:40.960
- Okay, well, it was great
negotiating with you.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.595 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, good.
I'm an easy negotiator, man.

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:43.963
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:45.231
- Well thank you.
- Absolutely.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:49.335
<i> - After settling on an amount
 that we are both</i>

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.237
<i> happy with, I had Paul
 fill out the legal paperwork</i>

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.207
<i> that was required to begin
 the name change process.</i>

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.976
<i> But that's when I realize
 we had a big problem.</i>

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.245
<i> To complete a name change
 in California,</i>

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:02.448 line:0%
<i> you're legally obligated to
 publically announce the change</i>

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:04.550 line:0%
<i> in a newspaper
 of general circulation</i>

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.719 line:0%
<i> for four weeks in a row.</i>

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.956
<i> If anyone suspected that the
 Michael Richards tip was fake,</i>

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.757
<i> finding this name change
 in the paper</i>

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.626
<i> would be their smoking gun.</i>

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.596
<i> I tried calling my legal adviso
 Judge Anthony Filosa</i>

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.331
<i> to see if there was
 any way around this.</i>

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.966
You have to publish it?

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.834
You can't just
change your name secretly?

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.308
<i> - But unfortunately,
 there wasn't.</i>

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:31.410
<i> So I felt like
 the only way to do this</i>

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:34.313
<i> while maintaining our secrecy
 was by creating a newspaper</i>

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:36.349
<i> that no one would ever read.</i>

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.751
<i> My hope was that by calling it
 "The Diarrhea Times,"</i>

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:41.420
<i> no one would ever want
 to pick it up,</i>

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:44.457
<i> but to ensure our publication
 seemed legitimate to the courts</i>

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.827
<i> I rented us an office space
 in a media building downtown</i>

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.829
<i> and hired a professional
 ghost writer named</i>

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.431
<i> Austin Bowers--
 who once wrote me an entire boo</i>

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:54.467
<i> in less than a week,
 to serve as the paper's</i>

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.335
<i> Editor-in-Chief.</i>

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:57.970
You ever been the editor
of a newspaper before?

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.539
- Nope, this'll be
the first time.

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:02.541
<i> - The paper would obviously
 need content</i>

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:04.844
<i> and it seemed like Austin
 had a big vision.</i>

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:08.714
- Um...definitely wanna include
lots of topics:

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:11.617
um, business, arts, politics.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.520
Draw lots of people in
and they'll come.

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:15.988
They'll read.
They'll share.

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:17.890 align:start position:0%
- Right?
Just make sure there's a section

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:19.892 align:start position:0%
for name change announcements?
Okay?

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.427 align:start position:0% line:85%
- Right.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.995
<i> Austin walked me through
 the rest of the paper</i>

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:25.398
<i> which included articles
 on entertainment,</i>

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.400
<i> current events,
 and even a section</i>

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.835
<i> for political cartoons
 that he drew himself.</i>

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:31.504
That supposed to be
Donald Trump?

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.572 line:91%
- Yes.
<i> - And after including the name</i>

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:36.409
<i> change announcement in the
 bottom corner of page three,</i>

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.544
<i> next to an op-ed about
 "Zelda Symphony,"</i>

00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:40.880
<i> the first issue
 was ready to print.</i>

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.782 align:end position:100%
So you're gonna start working
on the next issue?

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.817
- Yes.
- Okay, awesome.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.420
<i> So after receiving thousands
 of copies back from the printer</i>

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:50.823
<i> we circulated our inaugural
 issue of "The Diarrhea Times"</i>

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:52.758
<i> to the dozens
 of distribution partners</i>

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:54.927
<i> we had set up
 around L.A. County.</i>

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.097
<i> Meeting the minimum requirement
 to be recognized by the courts</i>

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.466
<i> as a legitimate publication.</i>

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.402
<i> Since California law dictates
 the name change be published</i>

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.838
<i> for four weeks in a row,
 over the next month,</i>

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.773
<i> Austin wrote three more issues</i>

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.842
<i> with the name change
 announcement in each</i>

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.978
<i> that were made publically
 available to L.A. residents.</i>

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.481
<i> So with all the legal
 requirements now met,</i>

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:17.950
<i> Robert Paul Holmes
 was given a date to appear</i>

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:20.619 line:0%
<i> at the L.A. Superior Courthouse
 where his name change</i>

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:22.788 line:0%
<i> to Michael Richards
 was approved.</i>

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.790
- Here I am. I am
officially Michael Richards.

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:27.760
Which is...weird and...

00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:31.697
again, I'm not relating to it
that much, but...

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.330
time will tell, I guess.
