they experience the world and this is
very powerful is that other people are

on top so if you and I have the same
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020
on top so if you and I have the same
thing over the course of 30 years but we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.320
times as much we're not going to say Oh
everything's fine because we have the

everything's fine because we have the
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.810
everything's fine because we have the

has more than we do and has so much more

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
has more than we do and has so much more
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.810

he could probably reach in and take

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
he could probably reach in and take
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.499
he could probably reach in and take
everything we have away which is of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
everything we have away which is of
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450
everything we have away which is of
course true and that's the condition

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
course true and that's the condition
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.510
course true and that's the condition
that people call oligarchy so the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
that people call oligarchy so the
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.850
that people call oligarchy so the
politics of inevitability says the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
politics of inevitability says the
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.190
politics of inevitability says the
market has to lead to democracy and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
market has to lead to democracy and
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140
market has to lead to democracy and
therefore there's no reason to correct

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
therefore there's no reason to correct
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.600
therefore there's no reason to correct
for what the market does if you don't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
for what the market does if you don't
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.280
for what the market does if you don't
correct what the market does if you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
correct what the market does if you
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.469
correct what the market does if you
don't support trade unions if you don't

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
don't support trade unions if you don't
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420
don't support trade unions if you don't
build up some kind of a welfare state if

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
build up some kind of a welfare state if
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.219
build up some kind of a welfare state if
you don't support public education and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
you don't support public education and
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749
you don't support public education and
so on then you're gonna have a situation

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
so on then you're gonna have a situation
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.179
so on then you're gonna have a situation
where citizens spread apart and wealth

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
where citizens spread apart and wealth
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.980
where citizens spread apart and wealth
and spread apart and income which is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
and spread apart and income which is
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.319
and spread apart and income which is
which is what's happening and that in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
which is what's happening and that in
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.319
which is what's happening and that in
turn may be the most powerful way that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
turn may be the most powerful way that
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.350
turn may be the most powerful way that
the politics of inevitability breaks

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
the politics of inevitability breaks
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.499
the politics of inevitability breaks
into the politics of eternity because if

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
into the politics of eternity because if
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539
into the politics of eternity because if
there is massive inequality of wealth

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
there is massive inequality of wealth
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.810
there is massive inequality of wealth
and income individuals and families no

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
and income individuals and families no

they no longer believe and this is
something mr. Trump got right even if he

something mr. Trump got right even if he
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550
something mr. Trump got right even if he
has no solution and he's making things

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
has no solution and he's making things
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100
has no solution and he's making things
worse on purpose they no longer believe

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
worse on purpose they no longer believe
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.869
worse on purpose they no longer believe
in the American Dream and they're

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
in the American Dream and they're
 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.760
in the American Dream and they're
correct not to do so if

it keeps going down so wealth inequality

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
it keeps going down so wealth inequality
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.950
it keeps going down so wealth inequality

way you stop thinking time is an arrow
which is moving forward to something

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
which is moving forward to something
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.330
which is moving forward to something
better and you start thinking hmm maybe

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
better and you start thinking hmm maybe

have to make America great again and you
get caught in these nostalgic loops you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
get caught in these nostalgic loops you
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.230
get caught in these nostalgic loops you
start thinking it can't be my fault that

enemies for you they provide language
 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.360
enemies for you they provide language
for you with which you can explain why

Muslims or the Jews or the blocks or the
immigrants and that allows you to think

immigrants and that allows you to think
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.350
immigrants and that allows you to think
okay time is a cycle things used to be

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
okay time is a cycle things used to be
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.300
okay time is a cycle things used to be
better but other people have come and

better but other people have come and
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.130
better but other people have come and
they've taken things away from me

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140
they've taken things away from me

they've taken things away from me
that's how the politics of inevitability

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870
that's how the politics of inevitability
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.870
that's how the politics of inevitability
becomes the politics of eternity wealth

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
becomes the politics of eternity wealth
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.699
becomes the politics of eternity wealth
inequality income inequality or one of

the major channels by which that happens

the major channels by which that happens
so one of the fundamental problems with

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.870
so one of the fundamental problems with
our American right-wing politics of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880
our American right-wing politics of
 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.430
our American right-wing politics of
inevitability is that it generates

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
inevitability is that it generates
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.210
inevitability is that it generates
income and wealth inequality and it

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220
income and wealth inequality and it
 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.550
income and wealth inequality and it
explains away income and wealth

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
explains away income and wealth
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.680
explains away income and wealth
inequality and so you get this cycle

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
inequality and so you get this cycle
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.460
inequality and so you get this cycle
where objectively people are less and

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470
where objectively people are less and
 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.820
where objectively people are less and
less well-off and subjectively we keep

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830
less well-off and subjectively we keep
 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.130
less well-off and subjectively we keep
telling ourselves this is somehow okay

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
telling ourselves this is somehow okay
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.690
telling ourselves this is somehow okay
because in the grand scheme of things

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700
because in the grand scheme of things
 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.750
because in the grand scheme of things
this is somehow necessary when it's not
