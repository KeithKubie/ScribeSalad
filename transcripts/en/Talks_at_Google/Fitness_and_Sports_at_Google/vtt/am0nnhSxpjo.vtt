00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.890
SPEAKER: We are really excited
for our guest, Hans Florine,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.120
to here today.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
He's come a long way from
Lafayette, California.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.750
So, long way, depending on
the time of day, the traffic.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.840
So Hans, just a
couple stats on Hans.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.910
He's the world's
speed record holder

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.070
for climbing the
nose of El Capitan.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.810
He did it with Alex
Honnold, not too long ago.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.240
He is a three time
x-games champion

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.850
and holds many other
national championship

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.560
records and global
championship records,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.480
which I'm sure he'll share.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.270
So this is a guy who's
pushed the limits

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.880
on the sport of
climbing beyond what

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.630
people thought it could go.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.680
What a perfect guest
for Google, who

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.010
are pushing the limits on
where technology is going.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.790
And he does it with a
great humility as well,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.750
and we'd like to think that
we have some humility also.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.274
So with that, I'm going to
welcome Hans to the stage,

00:01:08.274 --> 00:01:10.065
and let's give him a
big round of applause.

00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:11.838
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.110
HANS FLORINE: I think I'm good.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.580
We got great audio.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.230
Wow, thanks.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.570
I'm honored to be here.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.230
Anybody here, show of
hands, seen me speak before?

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.631
I mean live.

00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:28.130
Yeah?

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.190
Where did you see me speak?

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.065
AUDIENCE: It was probably
in the Simi Valley.

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:33.660
HANS FLORINE: Oh,
excellent, my home.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.480
So I want to be a great
speaker for you guys,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.860
and entertain you,
and all that stuff.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.067
But I want to tell you
what I'm going to tell you,

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.150
and then I'll tell you it.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.280
I'm going to just share.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.450
I'm not going to Google
into, like hey, I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.610
did this thing really
fast, and then you guys--

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.140
I don't know, Moore's law.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.110
You've doubled the number of
zeros and ones on a silicon

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.600
chip or something every--
is it three and a half years

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.451
or is it 17 months?

00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:55.950
What is it?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.730
AUDIENCE: One and a half.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.390
HANS FLORINE: There we go.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.806
We'll do trivia
during this thing.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.590
So it's one and a half years.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.120
But this is my playground.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.800
It's the second most
beautiful place on the planet.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.422
That's right, so you guys can
do audience participation.

00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:11.130
What's the first?

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.750
Of course, Mountain View is
the first most beautiful place.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.100
Or the Google campus, right?

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.807
But this is kind of my
playground, or my lab,

00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:21.390
or whatever you might
want to call it.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.350
And this is El Capitan,
here on the left.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.200
A lot of people
think Yosemite is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.990
all about that little boulder
back there, half dome.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.420
It is the most photoed
rock in the world.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.240
Half dome in the
back, but my stories

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.749
will mostly be about El Cap.

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.040
And something that has kind
of made me go out and speak

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.520
a little bit more is that I
climbed the nose route, which

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.120
happens to be the sun's shadow
line up the center of El Cap,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.978
for my hundredth
time a year ago.

00:02:51.978 --> 00:02:52.478
Yay.

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:54.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.810
So, the nose root of El Cap is
the Everest of rock climbing.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.170
Most climbers will
aspire to do it once.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.040
Most mountaineers would
aspire to do Everest once.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.587
So why on earth would I do it
100-- now 103 times, actually?

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:15.920
My co-author, Jamie, has done
all the beautiful writing,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.270
and she's the one who basically
answers the question, why

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.340
would someone do that?

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.010
This presentation is not
about the book or anything,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.100
it's more about just fun tales
of the history of climbing.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.170
How the world of climbing fits
into Yosemite and leading on up

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.962
to a lot about me, of course,
and my history of climbing.

00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:40.920
One of my sponsors of
outdoor research did this

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.753
because everyone's--

00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:43.650
I'm very much into
numbers, myself,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.350
and I think there's some
important things in here.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.990
That 11 bails,
that means I failed

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.800
to climb the nose 11 times
in those first 100 attempts.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.650
I don't know how many times
Sergey and Larry failed

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.380
to do the search engine
correctly, or whatever,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.440
but I'm sure it was
far more than 11 times,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.639
and that will probably be
my only tie-in to Google.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.180
There's a lot of
mainstream questions

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.530
people ask, like how do you
go to the bathroom up there?

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.530
This is 76 WAG
bags, we call them.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.260
I am very fast on El
Cap, but I've actually

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.560
spent 39 nights,
or 39 divvies, we

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.530
call him, on the route over
the 100 times I've done.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.560
I've climbed it with 88
different people, now.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.030
The oldest person
I climbed it with

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.910
was a 62-year-old and
the youngest, an 11

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.030
and 12-year-old boy and girl.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.020
40 haul bags.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.130
25 Cups of coffee.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.540
I'm usually going so fast,
I can't drink coffee.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.300
This is to get home afterwards
or to get to the base.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.390
So I do talks all over and I
like to kind of show people

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.950
referentially where it is.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.900
Show of hands here, how
many people have never

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.030
been to Yosemite, the
second most beautiful place

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.870
on the planet?

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.590
You guys, does anyone know?

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.580
It's probably three hours and
37 and a half minutes from here,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.380
from the Google campus.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.030
From my house it's
310 with a potty stop.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.380
This is really cool.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.440
It is not high altitude.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.010
I'm a t-shirt and
shorts climber.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.890
4,000 feet at the
base, only like 9,

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.780
10 at the height of the rim.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.240
But because it changes
altitudes so quickly,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.620
you actually can not only
climb through the clouds,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.620
you can hike through it.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.530
Anybody here climb
back a half dome?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.070
Cool.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.236
Did you do it with a permit?

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:26.425
Or did you kind of
black market it before--

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.050
AUDIENCE: I did Snake
Dike [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.360
HANS FLORINE: Oh,
Snake Dike, nice job.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.190
So I mean, incredible.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.994
I'm like a great guide,
real estate person

00:05:34.994 --> 00:05:37.410
to sell you on going to Yosemite
if you haven't been there

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.070
before.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.050
I climbed for 10
years in Yosemite

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.660
and didn't know that
this existed, that it

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.416
snowed in the winter there.

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:46.790
Because I was, like I said,
a t-shirt and shorts climber.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.230
But there's a little badger
pass ski resort there.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.150
It's $79 for a season
pass if you're under 14.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.910
So all you parents out there,
it's a great place to learn.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.650
One of the things that I
point out about Yosemite

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.240
is this 3,000 foot wall, there
are other 3,000 foot walls

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.790
in the world, but
you either need

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.910
to take a float plane or
a boat in Baffin Island

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.680
to get to them,
or a yak and maybe

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.720
a Russian helicopter in
the [INAUDIBLE] region

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.650
to get to it.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.899
In Yosemite, you can park
right here and 15 minutes

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:22.690
from your car door,
you can place your hand

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.670
at the base of El Cap.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.400
I mean, super accessible this
places is, is what I call it.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.530
Super wild and--

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.450
I purposely use this photo where
there's jet trails in the sky,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.830
to kind of make it-- it is this
odd thing of crazy wild terrain

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.660
and super accessible.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.510
So those people who haven't been
to Yosemite, brace yourself.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.830
This does not exist.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.780
These buildings aren't there.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.040
Just a reference, right.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.620
So the tallest building in
the world, the Burj Khalifa,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.890
or the Dubai tower, would
reach right about there.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.540
Right So the tallest
structure humans

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.890
have made is still
not as tall as El Cap.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.720
I know there's a Google--

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.770
what do they call it?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.150
Point of view thing?

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.090
Street View, they did a Street
View up the nose of El Cap.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.130
How many people have seen that?

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.060
Great, so it's all going to
be just rehash from that.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.730
I'm going to just--

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.040
but it's incredible, right?

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.470
I'll go to Seattle and I'll
place El Cap in their city

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.920
as opposed to putting
buildings superimposed.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.410
It's just crazy that the
spire is way down here

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.270
and El Cap would just be
towering over these things.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.400
So definitely some
place you've got to go.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.100
So the history of
climbing in Yosemite.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.200
Anyone here, show of
hands, know the first year

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.075
Everest was ascended?

00:07:43.048 --> 00:07:44.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.030
HANS FLORINE: '53, Yeah.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.300
You know, this is so funny.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.365
I was just thinking
you guys have

00:07:48.365 --> 00:07:50.260
got to put your phones away
because you guys could Google

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.759
everything really quick and get
the answers to all my trivia

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.360
questions, but it is 1953.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.550
And why I asked that
is because that's

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.990
the prize of the climbing world,
the tallest peak in the world.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.502
Or maybe the hardest
thing that you

00:08:03.502 --> 00:08:04.960
could do in climbing
is the tallest

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.850
peak in the world, which
is true in some regard.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.350
So

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.910
When did they first climb this
iconic face, this 1,900 foot

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.410
face?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.850
Was it before or after Everest?

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.310
It happened to be after, 1956.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.220
They didn't think that you
could get enough gear, food,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.660
red wine, whatever, up
this thing to survive.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.790
I just kind of throw a
quick picture of the 50s,

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.800
60s here, to kind of make it
a point that they didn't have

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.240
an REI that you
could-- actually,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.700
REIs opened in the
30s or 40s, but they

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.890
didn't have all the
gear that they have now.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.799
This was the Northwest
regular route of Half Dome.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.309
It took them five days
to climb this route.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.600
A guy named Warren Hardy, no
relation to the president,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.830
hiked around the back.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.400
Was known to congratulate
them and then say,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.460
I've got to do something
better to outdo you guys.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.760
So he said, I'm going to
climb the face of El Cap,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.520
which Half Dome would
only reach right here.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.390
So Warren Hardy didn't
spend five days,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:06.640
didn't spend 10 days, he
spent 33 days on this wall

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.495
and he got to right about here.

00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:09.870
And the Park
Service said, you've

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.610
got to take all that rope,
gear, everything down

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.710
or go up and top
out, die trying.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.850
So two years later,
1958, November 1st.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.965
He went on the wall
with Jerry Gaulois--

00:09:20.965 --> 00:09:24.130
excuse me, George
Whitmore and Wayne Merry.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.870
And they spent 12
more days on route,

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.950
and they topped
out on this route,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.540
and it's now called
the nose route.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.230
It's the most sought after
big wall route in the world.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:38.170
32-- I want to say bit, but
32 pitches or 32 rope lengths

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.119
long.

00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:40.660
And people come from
around the world

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.770
to do this big wall route.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.680
It's the number one
big wall route to do.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.650
And I want to throw out like
images from the early 60s

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.150
and 50s.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.990
Imagine these guys to get gear
to climb these walls in the 40s

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.010
and 50s.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.879
They would go to junkyards,
saw the legs off of stoves,

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.920
drill holes in them, and
then hammer these things

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.820
into cracks.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.900
They didn't have pitons
until mid late 50s,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.932
and Chouinard from Patagonia
was making these things

00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:10.390
as a blacksmith in his backyard,
and people were buying out

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.550
of the back of his truck.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.350
This is pretty wild, 1960.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.290
The second ascent of the
nose, they found this oil can.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.914
Smelled like red wine because
that's what Warren Harding used

00:10:19.914 --> 00:10:20.830
to bring up the stuff.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.484
They didn't have
plastic bottles, per se.

00:10:23.484 --> 00:10:25.900
It looks like there's only
maybe one or two people in here

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.330
as old as me.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.046
They had plastic
chemistry bottles

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.420
back in the 50s
and 60s, but they

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.810
would cost $20, which would
be about like $200 today.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.620
So they would find anything
they could to haul water up in.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.940
And this is pretty interesting.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.330
In his other hand, nothing
has changed in 60 years.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.600
That's a Ghiradelli
chocolate bar.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.190
That's Joe Fitch in there.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.530
So I point out this thing,
and if I could, I don't know--

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.130
the leg off the
bottom of a stove

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.130
is probably an IBM
punch card, right?

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.800
Then you get pitons,
which would be something--

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.700
I don't know, this might be
not quite an Apple 2E yet.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.080
But slowly, by the late 60s,
you had something as simple

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.500
as wedge shaped piece of metal,
which we call a nut or a chalk,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.230
which you can just
slide into a crack.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.740
And now you have these
aluminum aircraft devices,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.310
and you guys can come up and
play with these if you want.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.416
But you can pull this trigger
and this thing collapses,

00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:27.790
small goes into
a crack, and then

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.460
you can hang a VW
bus off it, which

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.370
is the climber's car of choice.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.230
And then pull the
trigger and it's out.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.040
But imagine hammering
a piton 15 times,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.900
and then someone
comes up behind you

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.660
because you're doing a
bunch of pitches in a row,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.930
they have to hammer it out.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:45.960
So a lot different.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.980
The technology of how
to climb these things

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.130
has changed over the decades.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.840
This picture is Mission Cliffs.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.910
It's a climbing gym
in San Francisco.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.040
And why I put this
in here is that Royal

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.530
Robbins, Tom Frost,
Warren Harding,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.870
they didn't climb
during the winter.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.530
They were ski bums
during the winter.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.105
So now you have 12
month a year climbers.

00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:08.980
And of course, there's
culture behind it now.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.411
Back then you were kind of a
beatnik, loser, outskirts sort

00:12:12.411 --> 00:12:12.910
of thing.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.493
Now you might as well be playing
football as you are climbing,

00:12:15.493 --> 00:12:16.380
it's so popular.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.820
We're in the Olympics, 2020.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.414
So I can't resist
a x-games thing

00:12:21.414 --> 00:12:22.580
that came around in the 90s.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.246
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:23.246 --> 00:12:25.265
[CHEERING]

00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:30.075
- Already you can see Lowe's
feet are all over the place.

00:12:30.075 --> 00:12:32.164
[INAUDIBLE] mostly
with his upper body,

00:12:32.164 --> 00:12:34.122
I think that's hurting
him because his arms are

00:12:34.122 --> 00:12:35.038
doing all of the work.

00:12:35.038 --> 00:12:37.584
Whereas Hans, really
precise with his feet,

00:12:37.584 --> 00:12:39.925
letting his legs propel
him up that wall.

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:42.289
- Florine again looking to
conserve some energy as--

00:12:42.289 --> 00:12:43.580
HANS FLORINE: So this is great.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.340
I'm showing you guys a
video of me winning, right?

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.840
- Florine has to
do the [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.131
HANS FLORINE: Of course, what
else is he going to show?

00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:53.300
- [INAUDIBLE] can only hope that
it's Hans Florine that misses

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.170
the buzzer this year.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.460
- And Hans Florine with a
signature double dyno move

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.690
takes a one length lead.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.980
[CHEERING]

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.200
HANS FLORINE: So
this was like 1997.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.130
Or it's '96.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.147
- It's all Florine.

00:13:05.147 --> 00:13:05.980
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.396
HANS FLORINE: I've
got to tell you

00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:11.570
that I've never used a double
hand dyno on El Capitan.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.620
It's strictly for
the show of the game.

00:13:17.434 --> 00:13:21.680
Part of why I've been able to do
the ascent 100 times-- and I'm

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.470
just gesturing over
here, but why on earth

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.464
would I do it 100 times?

00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:28.880
Part of it was the
culture started

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.299
accepting what we were doing.

00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:32.840
I wouldn't really
stretch it that you

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.060
could make a living climbing
because I was a yuppie

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.510
and I had other
ways to make money.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.340
But it was the
culture [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.920
But this is the
culture of Camp Four.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.570
And why I put this photo
up is that in 2000,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.470
Camp Four was at risk of being
plowed under because we had

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.696
the 100 year flood in 1999,
and housing got wiped out,

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:53.570
and they were going to
build apartments here.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.937
And so we got the Camp
Four campground put

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:58.520
on the historic
register, and climbers

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.220
came from around the world, not
just the state or the country,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.710
around the world, and gathered
to celebrate this being

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.042
put on the historic register.

00:14:05.042 --> 00:14:06.500
And they said hey,
if you'd climbed

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.046
in the 90s, the
last decade, come up

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:09.170
and get your picture taken.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.730
So I got to come up.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.577
This is me with my big
golden locks of hair.

00:14:14.577 --> 00:14:16.910
And then they said come on
up and get your picture taken

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.360
if you'd climbed in the 80s.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.600
And I came up then,
because I'd climbed.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.190
Some people came up twice.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.530
Some people came up three times.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.960
Some people came up four
times and some people

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.972
came up five times.

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:29.430
They had climbed
all those decades,

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.370
and I thought that was
so cool, the longevity

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.980
in the sport of these people
climbing, or the activity.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.830
They didn't really
call it a sport.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.650
So I remember vividly, my
first time in Camp Four.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.897
I'm coming from
my car to my thing

00:14:42.897 --> 00:14:45.230
and I have climbing gear on,
and this guy comes up to me

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.380
really fast and he's like
hey, what did you do today?

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.630
And I didn't know this
guy, and I'm like well,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.030
we climbed this route
called the Nutcracker over

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.640
on Manure Pile Buttress.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.100
And he's like, wow,
that's truly great.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.620
Did you guys free climb it?

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.880
I'm like well, I fell
on one of the pitches.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.189
My buddy got all
the pitches free.

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:05.480
And he's like, that is so cool.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.760
How long did it take you?

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.670
I time everything now
from diaper changes

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.410
to climbing rocks,
but back then I

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.960
didn't and I'm like well, we
started at 8:00 this morning

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.710
and it's three.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.360
So I don't know, it took
like five or six hours.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.610
He's like hey, that's so cool.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.180
Good job.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.247
Yeah, awkward silence.

00:15:25.247 --> 00:15:26.288
Like He just stood there.

00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:27.770
I'm like, oh, I
know, he wants me

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.130
to ask him what he did today.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.392
So I'm like, hey,
what did you do today?

00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:35.267
And he's like, we climbed
this new route over

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:38.510
on [INAUDIBLE] up this
crack and it's super scary,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.060
and my buddy on site
free climbed it.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.150
He was so psyched to
pat me on the back

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.687
and then burn me off with
something a little better.

00:15:47.687 --> 00:15:50.020
I don't know if you guys have
that culture here or what,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.120
but I thought that
was very cool that he

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.460
was kind of encouraging,
but he wanted you

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.130
to ask him what he had done.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.850
So I'm going to go through
the history of just the nose

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.360
route, the most famous big
wall route in the world.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.644
After the first ascent,
the second ascent in 1960,

00:16:08.644 --> 00:16:10.310
they did it in Alpine
style, which means

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.601
they didn't fix ropes all over.

00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:14.810
They just started at the bottom,
went to the top in seven days.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.490
The second ascent, like
wow, that can be done.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.730
So it was done in
three and a half days.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:25.400
And by 1975, probably oh, 25,
30 teams had climbed the route,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.500
but they did it in a single day,
and they coined this phrase,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.230
nose in a day, or NYAD.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.140
In fact my license
plate is love NYAD.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.460
This was pretty amazing because
they're still using pitons back

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.720
then.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.709
By the late 80s, it was
a feather in your cap.

00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:47.000
I don't know, maybe like a
CPA if you're an accountant.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.499
But if you haven't
done NYAD, you're

00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:50.720
not a competent trad climber.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.410
But what was interesting is
that an Austrian and a German

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.060
held the speed
record on the nose

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.090
and I didn't think that was
right, although my name's Hans.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.010
I'm a melting pot American.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.010
So I asked Steve Schneider,
also a melting pot American,

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.920
if he would go for the
record on the nose with me.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.020
And he didn't know me.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.839
He was like the John
McEnroe of climbing.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.670
I was a nobody, but he
said, OK because he was

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.750
worried I'd do it without him.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.060
Well, we climbed it in
eight hours and five minutes

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.770
and I'm just like, yes.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.510
I'm going to be a
famous climber now.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.968
I got the record
of Steve Schneider

00:17:21.968 --> 00:17:24.950
on the most famous big
wall route in the world.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.760
Well, one week later,
Peter Croft and Dave Shultz

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.270
did it in 6:40.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.700
These guys were immortal.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.880
Everybody went like this.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.200
These guys are the dream team.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.990
No one will ever
break that time.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.500
And this was in the New York
Times, and the Denver Post,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.750
and the LA Times, and the
San Francisco Chronicle.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:50.004
No mention of Steve or
Hans, just Peter and Dave.

00:17:50.004 --> 00:17:51.920
And we truly thought
this was amazing, an hour

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.780
and 25 minutes faster than us.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.630
Well, the following spring,
I ran into Andy Puvell,

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.240
which towered over me
six inches, and I'm 6'1".

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.650
He's a giant.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.260
We used to trade places
every month in these comps.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.900
I'd beat him one time,
he'd beat me another time.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.910
I went up to Andy and
I'm like hey, Andy,

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.920
how about we climb
together outside so people

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.569
don't think we're archrivals?

00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:12.860
And Andy's like yeah, let's go.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.090
Let's go up to Yosemite
and let's get on the nose.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.770
OK.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:20.300
So we get on the nose and just
for a lark, we timed ourselves

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.130
and we beat the immortals.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.990
We did it in 6:01.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.980
Just like yes.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.000
I called my mom.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.590
I said mom, get ready
to buy the newspaper.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.966
Well, one week later,

00:18:32.966 --> 00:18:35.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.380
Peter and Dave, 4:48.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.780
I mean imagine, that would
be like taking 20 seconds

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.370
off the mile time, right?

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.710
An hour and 13 minutes
faster than us.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.970
Everybody went like this.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.650
These guys are the dream team.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.290
No one will ever
break that time.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.050
Crazy.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.340
So the following spring
I got really smart.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.170
This is Peter Croft.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.810
I went to a slideshow
given by Peter Croft.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.610
After the slide
show go, hey, Peter.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.270
Good job on climbing the nose.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.070
[MUMBLES]

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.160
Good job on all this
other stuff you're doing.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.590
Hey, Peter-- he didn't know me
that well and I'm like, Peter,

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.200
would you climb with
me sometime so people

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.820
don't think we're archrivals?

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.228
He's like, no.

00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:17.577
And I'm all turning
red, like really?

00:19:17.577 --> 00:19:18.660
But he said, just kidding.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.740
I don't care what people think.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.490
Let's go climbing.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.104
So we go to Yosemite we're like,
what are we going to climb?

00:19:23.104 --> 00:19:24.020
He goes, I don't know.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.020
Let's call him the nose.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:30.330
So we climb the nose in
4:22, and everyone goes oh!

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.340
Well, I didn't call my mom.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.005
I said, I'm going to wait a
week and see what happens.

00:19:36.005 --> 00:19:37.380
Because I don't
know, I figured--

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.139
a week goes by.

00:19:38.139 --> 00:19:39.180
We still have the record.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.912
A month goes by.

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:40.620
We still have it.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.520
A year goes by.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.690
We still have the record.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.150
Well, all the press
we like, you guys

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.620
break the record every year.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.850
It's not news.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.850
So we got a little postage
size stamp thing in the letter

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.600
to the editor.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.420
They broke the record again.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.390
[SIGHS]

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.520
No fame for Hans.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.000
Well, nine years went by and
the new young dream team,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.950
Timmy O'Neill and Dean
Potter got the record

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.720
with all the new
tools and stuff.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.460
They broke the four hour mark.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.700
I thought it would be really
cool if one week later, someone

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.560
broke their records.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.367
So I call all of my friends.

00:20:12.367 --> 00:20:14.200
Let's go up there and
get the record, right?

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.980
And all my friends
are married with kids

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.260
and working 50 hours a week.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.300
But there's this guy, Jim Herson
who's just a total stud rock

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:23.800
climber.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.930
Anybody here know Jim?

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.756
He's a member here at Sunnyvale.

00:20:26.756 --> 00:20:29.130
So he goes, I can't go next
week, but in two weeks I can.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.350
Go so Jim Herson sends
me a picture of him

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.920
training to climb the nose.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.020
Get in trouble with the
parents authorities, here.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.320
So to our amazement,
two dads off the couch,

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.030
we do it in 3:57.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:47.580
We just slide underneath and
get it, just by sheer whatever.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.280
Well, Dean and Timmy being
young and disrespectful,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.020
they didn't let
us keep the record

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.090
for a month or even a week.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.380
Two days later they went
up and did it in 3:24,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.550
and everyone went like this.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.212
These guys are the
new dream team.

00:21:01.212 --> 00:21:02.670
No one will ever
break that record.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.054
Hans stay home, and
raise kids, and do a job.

00:21:06.054 --> 00:21:06.720
They were right.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.199
So they kept the
record for a week.

00:21:08.199 --> 00:21:09.240
They kept it for a month.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.860
They kept it for a year.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.920
The next year, my good
friend Yuji Hirayama

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.299
shows up to the US.

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:18.090
He wanted to climb the
Salathe route, which

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.860
is another route on El Cap,
and he wanted to do it free.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.170
And I said hey, Yuji, let's
do the nose kind of as warm

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.841
up to get used to the granite.

00:21:24.841 --> 00:21:26.340
You climb in the
southeast, you want

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.330
to get used to the sandstone.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.496
You want to climb here, you
get used to the granite.

00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:32.700
So to me and Yuji's amazement,
our very first time trying

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.110
the nose in a day, we did it in
3:27, which was not the record,

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.510
but we passed seven
parties along the way.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.790
It's a pretty busy route
and I wrote the book

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.690
on speed climbing.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.970
There's a whole
chapter designated

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.190
to the art of passing.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.320
You've got to stop and
say hello to people

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.270
and ask permission pass.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.930
So I figured we should get a one
minute handicap for each party

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.360
we pass and we should
have the record,

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.650
but that didn't
really go over well.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.100
So we went back the
next week and Yuji

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.642
had some friends go to the top
of El Cap and film down on us.

00:22:04.642 --> 00:22:06.224
So I'm just going
to play this footage

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:07.470
because it's pretty unique.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.840
I don't even think
Google sidewalk

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.181
or whatever it's
called has this.

00:22:12.181 --> 00:22:12.847

what it's called, right?

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.140
We did not have the budget
for a helicopter, by the way.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.910
There was a rescue
going on that day.

00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:33.460
Hey, and while
this is playing, I

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.220
got you guys lock solid
until 1:00, right?

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.650
I can give you
stories until then?

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.690
All right.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.300
I don't know if this
auditorium, has motion sickness

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.300
bags under the seat, but
this is kind of big here,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.080
so be careful.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.450
So this is pretty
amazing, you guys,

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.790
this is not a broccoli
patch up there.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.950
Those are full size pine
trees and today, that picture,

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.350
80% of that is brown from
bark beetles and the drought.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.060
Not to make an eco statement,
just an interesting thing,

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:09.590

Kenji, jumping in and out

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.400
to take the shot.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.240
So the very last part of El
Cap is this roof, right here,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.370
that Yuji's going to cup
under, and then you crest over,

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.629
and then you run like
80 feet to this tree

00:23:24.629 --> 00:23:25.670
where you stop your time.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:29.360
And Yuji is up there, and he's
pulling the rope up on me,

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.480
and all these people are down in
the meadow yelling like crazy.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.299
And their voices get lifted
up because of the air currents

00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:37.340
and we're super psyched
because we can hear them.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.530
And I'm exhausted
trying to keep up

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.095
with Yuji, totally
exhausted, but excited

00:23:42.095 --> 00:23:43.220
these people yelling at me.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.920
So I want to like yell
something back down at them,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.670
but I'm going anaerobic and
have almost no air left.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.370
And here's the best I can
do back towards the people

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.928
down below.

00:23:54.928 --> 00:23:56.374
[SHOUTING]

00:23:56.374 --> 00:23:58.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.480
Just focus on getting
to the top, Hans.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.290
So the week before, we
did it in three hours

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.580
and 27 minutes, which was three
minutes shy of the record.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.040
This week there was
nobody on the route

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.250
and we actually did it in
two hours and 48 minutes.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.800
That's like Moore's law
in two weeks, basically.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.290
But everybody went like
this, it's the dream team

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.360
and no one will ever
break that record.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.610
So Yuji is not only like
this world class climber,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.430
he's won the world
championships dozens of times.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.280
He's a super world-class,
funny, friendly guy.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.510
If you don't speak Japanese, you
can read some English subtitles

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.410
underneath.

00:24:57.784 --> 00:24:59.272
Yeah, fun guy.

00:24:59.272 --> 00:25:00.770
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.450
So this was amazing.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.820
There was a crowd of
people in the meadow.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.440
And so we get back
down to the forest

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.180
and there's somebody
poking a camera in my face,

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.250
and I'm happy to talk.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:09.450
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:09.990
HANS FLORINE (YOUNG):
I feel really happy.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.530
I think it's going to be
really hard for someone

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.850
to go faster than us.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.610
Yeah, unless there's like
two Yujis going up together.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.960
It would be really hard.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.422
I think this record will
last for a good long time.

00:25:26.422 --> 00:25:28.774
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:28.774 --> 00:25:30.440
HANS FLORINE: So that
was fun, finally I

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.740
got the definitive record,
and this is kind of

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.830
like my gear talk, tech talk
picture for climbers and stuff.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.870
But we actually
finally got press.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.880
I got on the front cover
of Climber Magazine.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.970
It's funny that Ali said
that I'm really humble.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.310
My nickname was Hollywood Hans.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:50.420
Nothing could be less
humble than that, right?

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.390
So we got all this press, and
worldwide, the nose kind of

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:55.730
gained more--

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.160
I don't know-- significance
in the climbing community.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.160
And actual
professional climbers,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.090
Alex and Thomas Huber, got
rumored a million dollar

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.660
filming budget to come and
do a documentary on getting

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.982
the record on the nose.

00:26:08.982 --> 00:26:10.940
And I went down to the
house they were staying,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.481
and brought my kids,
and I was trying

00:26:12.481 --> 00:26:15.331
to show him my little CD set
on how to climb the nose faster

00:26:15.331 --> 00:26:15.830
and stuff.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.140
And they're busy trying to
have my kids drink alcohol

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.520
like good Germans.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.940
They're like no, no,
we just go faster.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.757
It turns out they won all
these awards for the film

00:26:28.757 --> 00:26:30.590
because it was this
cool drama and whatever,

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.260
but they didn't get
the record in the film.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.060
Super proud, they came
back the next year

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.480
and got the record on the
nose, off film, I guess.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.650
But if a picture is
worth a thousand words,

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.420
a video is worth a
thousand pictures.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.490
These guys are hilarious.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.510
I'll just let this play.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.176
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:45.176 --> 00:26:49.220
- In 2007, the nose race was
shaken up by German climbing

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.350
stars Alex and Thomas Huber.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.800
- First, we thought speed
climbing is a stupid thing.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.180
Or it's an Americans thing.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.412
I don't want to say American and
it's the same like stupid but--

00:27:00.412 --> 00:27:01.870
HANS FLORINE: But
I just did, yeah.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.140
- --we don't like it.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.000
- But we found out that it's
real sport, and we like sports,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.990
and of course we're ambitious,
and we want to do this.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.930
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:12.930
HANS FLORINE: Hilarious.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.410
Alex and Thomas Huber
are very cool guys.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.740
Just the classic, we
got the record shot.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.872
They beat the record
only by 20 seconds,

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.580
and then they went
back three days later,

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.246
and chopped a full
three minutes off it.

00:27:24.246 --> 00:27:26.862
So very proud.

00:27:26.862 --> 00:27:28.570
When people would say
like oh, the record

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.300
will never be broken.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.520
No one's ever going to
break you and Yuji's record.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.560
I'd be like, no way,
and I'm a big wagerer.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.900
I'm like, I'll bet
you $100 that somebody

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.340
is going to break our record.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.840
And sure enough,
when they broke it,

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.980
my buddy, Bob, sent
me a $100 check.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.940
So I used it to go buy
beers for Thomas and Alex.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.600
It wasn't enough for
them, but I tried.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.480
So I got beta from
them on how to--

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.030
beta means ideas.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.640
That's an old term you
guys probably don't know.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.450
But ideas how to go faster.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.596
And that very next spring,
me and Yuji show up,

00:28:03.596 --> 00:28:05.970

the meadow, cheering us on.

is, whether we got the record.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.110
So again, my little
tech talk here.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.202
So I was in college.

00:29:23.202 --> 00:29:24.660
I went to Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.990
Me and my roommate came
up in 1988 by headlamp.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.730
We hiked to the base,
here in the woods,

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.080
and we started climbing,
and we climbed all day

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.630
until it got dark.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.025
Well, it was just
dusk, and we're like,

00:29:38.025 --> 00:29:39.150
we're not going to make it.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.520
We've drank more
than half our water.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.436
And we were kind of
planning on a two or three

00:29:42.436 --> 00:29:45.440
day ascent, like most people
do, and we're not going it.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.970
We drank more than
half our water,

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.910
ate more than half our
food, and after that 13, 14

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.940
hours of climbing, we
arrived right here.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.310
And we repelled down, went
back to school for a year,

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.980
and came back, and we climbed
route in three days a year

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:00.930
later.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:07.360
But when me and Yuji then--
let's see, 18 years later.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.690
I was 26 when I came and it
took me 14 hours to get here.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.970
18 years later, when I was
old and feeble, but more

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.940
knowledgeable, me and
Yuji took 17 minutes

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.870
to get to Sickle Ledge,
which is some sort of Moore's

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.070
law in there of some
sort or another.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.864
So really cool perspective.

00:30:25.864 --> 00:30:28.030
When I'm speaking around,
people come up to me years

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.210
later and say, I was
inspired to do this or that.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.490
I kind of point out, I don't
save lives in Ethiopia,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.430
per se, directly or whatever,
but because I've kind of

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.860
focused on something
so tightly, I've

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.872
gotten all these
cool invitations

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:41.830
to do different things.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.587
And one of them I just
wanted to share with you is I

00:30:45.587 --> 00:30:47.170
have had the good
fortune or the honor

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.350
to climb with Erik Weihenmayer,
who is a blind climber who's

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.120
done the seven summits.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.730
He asked me, in the
mid 90s, if a blind guy

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.886
could climb the nose of El
Cap and I'm like, yeah, sure.

00:30:57.886 --> 00:30:59.260
Because I was
young and ignorant,

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.880
I didn't know to say no to him,
and we ended up climbing it.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.760
And for those that don't know--

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.970
climbers know this, but on most
big walls, a leader goes up,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.590
and then the
followers go on rope.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.390
Either you're pulling
the rope up for them,

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.780
or you're sliding an ascender
like this up the rope

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.670
and then it can't come down.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.090
And so maybe even
you guys would think,

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.000
well, I'd rather be blind if I'm
3,000 feet up so that I'm not

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.710
scared of the exposure.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.750
All Erik did was follow
Hans up the rope.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.340
He just slid his jugs up there.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.770
And then I tell people
that Erik actually

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.100
led some of the pitches,
which means he went up first,

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.485
tied the rope, and then
I had to follow him.

00:31:38.485 --> 00:31:39.940
They're Like Hans,
you're stupid.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.762
How did you survive that?

00:31:41.762 --> 00:31:44.560
But totally incredible,
impressive guy, Erik.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.110
I've gotten to adventure with
him a couple of other times.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:51.760
He invited me to go do Mount
Kenya with him, which is not

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.050
the tallest peak in the
continent of Africa,

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.050
it's the second tallest.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.550
He'd already done Kilimanjaro
and he said hey, come and do

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.600
this because it's like
this big granite wall.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.330
So this is a shot of Erik and
Charlie in Heathrow Airport.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.320
And Erik's got his white cane
under his lap, right here.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.270
Erik came to San Francisco
with his seeing eye dog

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:10.990
and did a show.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:12.020
He's a motivational speaker.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.603
And then I was going
to meet him there

00:32:13.603 --> 00:32:15.130
and I would be
his seeing eye dog

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.890
to get him to Heathrow
Airport, where he'd be reunited

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.434
with Charlie and his stick.

00:32:20.434 --> 00:32:21.600
So we had this little trick.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.190
Erik would just kind of hold
onto a backpack, back here,

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.290
and he'd just be back at my 4
o'clock or maybe my 7 o'clock

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.956
because we're going
through the airport,

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:30.940
and you'd never know he's blind.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.390
And we're late for
our flight, as usual.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.345
And I go and I cut the
corner on this table,

00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:39.070
and I forgot Erik
was back there.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.890
Erik hits the table
right at the wrong spot,

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.960
doubles over on the ground.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.480
I'm like, how am I going
to get him up Mount Kenya?

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.200
I can't even get him
through an airport.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.770
Just crazy.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.130
So we're sitting in
first class because Erik

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.619
has all these miles, and
I'm probably going to go off

00:32:56.619 --> 00:32:57.910
the screen, so I can't do that.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.493
But OK, so I'm sitting
in first class,

00:32:59.493 --> 00:33:03.430
and back behind me is Erik
in his first class seat.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.680
And for those of you who've
never flown first class,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.750
they give you a little
menu and ask you

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.970
what you want before
the plane takes off.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.900
Well, this was 19--

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.200
no, this was 2005.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.380
He actually had a
CD player, Erik did,

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.550
and he was listening
to books on tape,

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.420
and he had his earplugs in, and
he's looking at his CD player,

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.700
like this.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.770
The Steward comes up and
places the menu right

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.000
in front of his face.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.600
She says sir, what would
you like for dinner?

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.070
He can't hear her and he
can't see that there's

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.330
a menu in front of his face.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.830
And he doesn't have
dark glasses on,

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.680
but he has these
fake glass eyes,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.849
and they look really nice.

00:33:39.849 --> 00:33:41.390
And she just gets
louder, and louder.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.724
And I'm up here, and I hear
this woman yelling, sir,

00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:45.890
what do you want for dinner?

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.260
Sir what do you want for dinner?

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.439
And I'm like oh, sorry
ma'am, he can't see.

00:33:49.439 --> 00:33:51.230
And she just starts
yelling, why didn't you

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.489
tell me he can't see?

00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:54.780
I'm like, I didn't know I
had to announce to everybody.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.320
And like here I am, oh my
god, how can I get this guy.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.900
So quite amazing just
all the little things

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.730
we take for granted
just getting places.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.030
So I think green is
approximately Kilimanjaro

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.380
and red is Kenya.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.739
So Erik sends me this beautiful
picture of Mount Kenya,

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:14.090
and he wants me to do this 1,900
foot granite face when there's

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.850
perfectly good ridge
line to do over there,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.500
but he wants to do the hard way.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.166
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:22.429
And when Erik's approaching,
we're talking and stuff.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:24.950
When our voices get tired,
we have a little jingle bell,

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:27.199
reindeer bell that we jingle
on the back of the packs.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.179
And it's just kind
of business as usual.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.054
You'd never know he's
blind because he's just

00:34:31.054 --> 00:34:34.120
feeling his way with his poles.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.025
I think off here on
the left skyline,

00:34:36.025 --> 00:34:37.900
you'll see-- we were
like a day into the hike

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.025
and we have another day
before we get to base camp.

00:34:40.025 --> 00:34:44.341
You can see Mount Kenya shows
up here in the far left corner

00:34:44.341 --> 00:34:44.840
there.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.540
So a long ways to go.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.520
This is Erik coming
down a talus slope.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.730
We went up and set gear at
the beginning of the route,

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.340
that 1,900 foot granite
face, and then we

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.770
had to go back down this
to get to base camp.

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.990
Now, me and Charlie probably
could have gone down

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.970
this talus slope in
less than 15 minutes,

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.440
but with Erik, it was probably
just less than two hours.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.374
Imagine the pool goes
between two rocks,

00:35:08.374 --> 00:35:10.040
so you think it's a
three foot drop off,

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.990
but it's actually only
a one foot drop off.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.820
Or the reverse could happen.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.030
He thinks it's a one foot, but
his foot goes next to a pole.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.677
Just arduous amount of work.

00:35:19.677 --> 00:35:20.510
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.290
We heard that there
was a European hut

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.570
on top of this thing.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.222
So we started at 4:00 AM,
topped out at like 10:00 PM,

00:35:30.222 --> 00:35:32.180
and there was a hut, all
right, but it was more

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.290
an aluminum coffin.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.650
It was this tall
and it was 5'11".

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.460
I know because I'm 6'1", and I
couldn't quite straighten out

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:39.960
in it.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.860
So we slept like a four
hour sleepless night

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.450
there and hiked on down.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.020
So Erik, he doesn't want to take
the easy route up this thing.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.719
He also doesn't want
to do normal stuff

00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:52.010
when he's in a foreign country.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.510
So he's like, what
do tourists do

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.640
that's kind of weird in Africa?

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.210
And somebody planted
the seed in his head

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.640
that people go and
ride ostriches.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.190
Anybody here ridden an ostrich?

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.890
I have, but there's
one thing Erik

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.330
can't do is as
adventuresome as he

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.330
is, he can't film for nothing.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.610
When he filmed me on
the ostrich, all you see

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.460
is the feet going by.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.540
But we do have footage
of him actually on it.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.206
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:19.206 --> 00:36:21.680
And these handlers have to
be on the side, no matter

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.960
whether you're sighted or not.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.112
And Erik's always game.

00:36:26.112 --> 00:36:29.720
You got to do it styling,
and we're like Erik,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.840
it doesn't count unless you
wave your hand over your head.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.390
So he's totally game to
do whatever we tell him.

00:36:39.326 --> 00:36:41.457
HANS FLORINE (ON
VIDEO): Very well done.

00:36:41.457 --> 00:36:42.290
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:43.550
HANS FLORINE: So some
of the fun adventures

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.890
I've gotten to go on.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.840
But I want to go back
to my neighborhood

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.500
and finish off with a story
here of something that's

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.270
happened here.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:57.650
Anybody know the name,
or two guys names,

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.420
that first ascended Everest?

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.802
Throw it out if you want.

00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:03.970
AUDIENCE: Edmund
Hillary and [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:05.560
HANS FLORINE: Correct.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.810
Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.960
Does anybody know who has the
fastest ascent of Everest?

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.520
Yes, dead silence.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.110
And the reason I
point that out is

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.980
that I had the fastest time on
the nose and the fastest time

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.700
on Half Dome [INAUDIBLE]
but people in the climbing

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.760
community, and somewhat
in outside world,

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.045
whoever's the first to
do something gets fame,

00:37:30.045 --> 00:37:30.920
and we all want that.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.590
Well, I do.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.050
Or you do something
that's just totally--

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.870
no one thought to
do it beforehand.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:44.540
So in 1986, John
Becker and Peter Croft

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:49.260
at midnight on a full moon,
they started right here--

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:49.760
excuse me.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.530
Is that where they started?

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.410
No, they started right
here, on their bikes.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.410
They biked up to the end of
the valley, they hiked over,

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.810
they climbed Half Dome.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.750
The face of Half Dome, a
grade 6 route, which today,

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.670
an average party takes
two days to climb.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.391
They climbed it in like
10 hours or so or less,

00:38:08.391 --> 00:38:10.890
hiked down, got on the bikes,
biked to this into the valley,

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.862
climbed El Cap, wend
down the [INAUDIBLE],

00:38:13.862 --> 00:38:16.070
got on their bikes, and went
to the Mountain Room Bar

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.354
in the same 24 hours.

00:38:18.354 --> 00:38:18.854
What?

00:38:18.854 --> 00:38:21.020
Everyone went like this.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.310
This was called The Linkup.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.140
The Linkup.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.130
One week later, nobody
repeated this feat.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.420
Two years later, nobody.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.700
Five years later--
it was 10 years later

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.980
before someone successfully
was able to repeat

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.170
this feat, The Linkup.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.370
I'm like, maybe I could do
something first that's fast.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:47.130
So around round about
the late 90s, only--

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.680
and myself included-- only
four teams total in the world

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.900
had done The Linkup.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.320
So what's the next thing to do?

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.430
Well, let me explain.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:01.040
When two people go up a big
wall, it's inchworm climbing.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.980
First person goes up, second
person cleans the gear

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.956
and meet, and then
the person goes up,

00:39:05.956 --> 00:39:07.580
second person cleans
has gear and meet.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.870
And they might
switch who's leading,

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.220
but it's an inch worm thing.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.420
You go a rope length at a time.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.130
So when you climb by
yourself up a big wall,

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.130
you place the rope at
the base, you climb up,

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.990
and now you're up on
this ledge or anchor,

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.975
and there's nobody there
to clean your gear.

00:39:23.975 --> 00:39:27.750
So you have to repel down,
get your rucksack if you're

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.630
European, or backpack
if you're American,

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.660
and you put your jugs on.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.350
You ascend back up to
here and then you repeat.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.820
You go up again, repel down.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.440
So when you solo
a big wall route,

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.960
you actually climb it
twice, and repel it once.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.430
Kind of like sand dune hiking.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.160
You go up three
steps, slide back two.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.590
So why would anybody solo?

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.200
Anybody?

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.560
Because you have no friends.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.900
But it turns out to be
a pretty proud thing

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.770
in climbing to solo big
walls or to solo mountains.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.330
So it's a thing that's done.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.760
Well, I wanted to
be the first person

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.020
to solo The Linkup, the two
grade sixes in the valley.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.450
I heard that winter that
this guy, Dean Potter,

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.840
had climbed this route
in 4 hours and 17 minutes

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.590
by himself.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:16.960
And I'm like oh, I've
climbed this route by myself

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.610
in 14 hours, so that's 18.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.460
So that's under 24, but of
course, you're exhausted.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.140
It's like saying you're going to
run a marathon in the morning,

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:23.770
whatever.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.530
But I got it in my head,
I'm going to do this.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:31.030
And I'd call it accountability
partners, this was 1999.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:32.804
As best I could, I
emailed out a bunch.

00:40:32.804 --> 00:40:35.470
Told everyone I'm going to do it
and committed to the full moon,

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.160
July 24.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.575
I'm going to go do
this thing and I went,

00:40:39.575 --> 00:40:41.200
and I climbed Half
Dome in the morning.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.440
I started at 4:30 AM, and
to my utter amazement,

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.890
I beat the immortal, crazy
climber, Dean Potter.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.600
I beat it by like 20 minutes.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.520
I climbed it in
under four hours.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.114
I came around down
by, I think 11:00 AM,

00:40:56.114 --> 00:40:58.030
I arrived in El Cap
Meadow and my good friend,

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.310
Steve Schneider was there,
who I talked about earlier.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.495
He's my number one
fan by this point

00:41:03.495 --> 00:41:04.870
because he's known
me for awhile.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.340
If I tie my shoe fast,
Steve Schneider's

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.670
like good job, Hans, way to go.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.644
So I was psyched to tell
my best buddy and mentor,

00:41:12.644 --> 00:41:14.560
Steve Schneider, I got
the record on Half Dome

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.101
that morning.

00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:17.590
And he knew, along with the
rest of the climbing community,

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.656
I was trying to do
The Linkup that day.

00:41:19.656 --> 00:41:21.280
And so I go, Steve
I just got to record

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.999
on Half Dome and Steve's
like good job, Hans.

00:41:25.999 --> 00:41:27.040
Kind of hanging his head.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.152
And I'm like, Steve,
aren't you excited for me?

00:41:30.152 --> 00:41:31.360
I mean, I just got to record.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.440
I'm going to do The Linkup.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.450
I'm going to be the first
person to do The Linkup

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.560
and he's like, Hans, I
got to tell you something

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.370
I don't want to tell you.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.470
I'm like, what is it?

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:39.850
Spit it out man.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:45.050
He's like Dean Potter
flew here yesterday

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.365
and did The Linkup, both
routes in a day, before you.

00:41:49.365 --> 00:41:51.365
He kind of hovers down
like I'm going to hit him

00:41:51.365 --> 00:41:54.645
and I'm just like oh,
that's totally awesome.

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:55.520
Oh, it's not awesome.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.420
I'm not going to be the first.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.605
I'm not going to be the first.

00:42:00.605 --> 00:42:04.460
So that was hard.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.650
I went from the
highest of highs to oh,

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.020
and I thought I was going
to be climbing El Cap.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.710
I didn't have anything else to
do that afternoon and Steve was

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.880
trying to break the ice.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.370
He goes hey, how about we go and
get an ice cream or something.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.220
I'm like, no.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.030
I've kind of got
it in my head, I'm

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.280
going to just go and
start climbing El Cap.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.730
So I walk to the base
and start climbing,

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.250
and it gets dark about
when I'm halfway up,

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.425
and I put on a headlamp,
and I keep climbing.

00:42:30.425 --> 00:42:32.300
And there's these big
ledges that you get to,

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.575
and I got to the ledge
called Camp Five.

00:42:34.575 --> 00:42:37.200
There's somebody there that kept
me awake because I'm climbing.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.039
And then I got to Camp 6
and Mark Wellman was there.

00:42:40.039 --> 00:42:42.080
Middle of the night, it's
1:00 AM in the morning.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.110
He's paralyzed from
the waist down.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.440
It's his second time up El Cap.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.230
How motivational, right?

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.500
Middle of the night.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.850
I arrive there and Mark
Wellman's like dude, Hans,

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:53.720
what are doing?

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.920
He's getting out
of his sleeping bag

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.120
or sitting up in a sleeping bag.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.119
What are you doing, man?

00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:59.840
And I'm like, Mark man--

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.310
by this time, I'm
kind of excited

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.080
and I've gotten over the whole
thing, I'm not the first.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.330
I'm just like hey, two
guys get to the moon.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.329
It's still cool to be the first
two guys to walk on the moon.

00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:09.120
This is incredible.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.350
So whatever in my head.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.850
I'm like Mark, I'm psyched that
I'm climbing El Cap and Half

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.510
Dome in a day by myself.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.417
And Mark's like
really, do you know

00:43:17.417 --> 00:43:19.250
that Dean Potter was
through here last night

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.930
doing the same thing?

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.840
I'm just like can't you think of
something original to do, Hans?

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.860
So I just kind of kept
climbing through the night.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.810
I got near the top
and my good friend,

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:33.080
Alard Hufner from South Africa,
had hiked the top of Half Dome,

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.870
and hiked to the top of El
Cap to photo and film me.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:40.610
And here he is, after 21
hours of hiking and climbing,

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.760
he just meets me with this big
old smile, and I'm exhausted,

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.782
and the best I could do
back to him was this.

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.410
This, to me, is the touchstone
picture, if you will,

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.690
of the end of the
best day of your life.

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.990
You're super
excited, super happy,

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.090
maybe not super
energized, but you've

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:04.950
got that feeling of
reward on your face.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.080
I know that 99%
of the time I look

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.315
like this, very
humble, Hollywood Hans

00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:10.980
and on the front cover of this.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.050
But really, all my
best adventures,

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.200
I want to end somewhere
looking like this.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.530
I don't know if it's you
guys have an app deadline

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.280
or what it is, and
you're here, and you're

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.450
programming in your
rooms to 1:00 AM,

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.200
but this is what you
want it to look like.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.710
I mean, just
exhausted and great.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.270
And it's this sort of--

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.550
I don't know-- image that
I look back on to try

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.004
to-- what's my next adventure?

00:44:31.004 --> 00:44:33.420
Well, whatever it is, I want
to look like this at the end.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.000
And that's kind of
what's spurned me on

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.200
to all of this numbers
stuff, if you will,

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.810
or achieving the 100th ascent
of the nose, or whatever.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.340
I wanted to point out something
else in the culture of climbing

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.330
that's kind of neat.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.160
This is Tom Frost, over here,
with the white shirt on.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.180
He started climbing--
pause for effect--

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.750
he started climbing
before I was born.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.370
He did the second
ascent of the nose,

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.642
and the first ascend the
Salathe, and many other things.

00:45:02.642 --> 00:45:04.350
So he started climbing
before I was born.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.580
I've gotten to
climb with him, some

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.913
of the great routes in Yosemite.

00:45:06.913 --> 00:45:09.900
And then Alex Honnold over
here, is kind of 60 minutes

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.440
boy, cover of
National Geographic.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.630
I started climbing
before Alex was born

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.730
and I've got to climb
with him as well.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.280
In fact, I got the nose
record with him in 2012

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.210
after I had done it with Yuji.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.200
And so I'm just
super grateful, I

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.670
guess, for that
sort of connection

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.030
between the generations.

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.250
Tom Frost, actually--
the old guy-- solo'd

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.040
up to the base of the nose
and gave me and Yuji ideas

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.480
on how to go faster.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.250
We're taking ideas
from this guy that

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.710
climbed in the 60s,
70s, and 80s, as well as

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.690
young people giving us ideas.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:46.386
So I put that out
there that it's great

00:45:46.386 --> 00:45:48.510
that the ideas come from
all these different levels

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.450
of the experience in climbing.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.890
And I want to end on this story.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.900
This is Yuji, here on
the right, and Tom Frost.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.950
This is the night before we
were going to go for the record.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.940
And Tom Frost is watching
Yuji organize all this gear,

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.690
and Tom Frost is
over here like hey,

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.950
I'm so psyched for you guys.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.946
I think Mother
Nature and The Rock

00:46:09.946 --> 00:46:11.070
is really cheering for you.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.140
I think you guys are going
to get the record tomorrow.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.890
What do you think?

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:18.120
Are you guys going to get 10
minutes off or 15 minutes off?

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.180
And Yuji's like yeah.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.715
He knows the legend, Tom
Frost, so he's psyched.

00:46:23.715 --> 00:46:24.924
And he's like, yeah man, Tom.

00:46:24.924 --> 00:46:27.381
I think we're going to get 10
or 15 minutes off the record.

00:46:27.381 --> 00:46:28.350
I'm so psyched.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:28.890
I think we're going to do it.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.320
I'm so glad you're here
cheering us on and whatnot.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.870
I should switch places, but Tom
is just like oh, that's cool.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.090
That's really awesome, you guys.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:44.090
And then he's just sitting
there silent like this.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.060
And I know that he's wanted us
to ask him something about what

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.730
he's done, So I'm
like, so Tom, you

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.760
broke the record on the nose
when you did it, didn't you?

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.460
Yeah, yeah.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.200
He's like, yeah, I did.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.325
And I'm like, well, how
much time did you take off?

00:46:56.325 --> 00:46:59.090
And he goes we took three
and a half weeks off

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:01.940
the previous best record.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.389
So if there's a lesson
in that, it's humility.

00:47:06.389 --> 00:47:08.180
Thank you guys for
listening to my stories.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.650
I got six minutes for Q&amp;A.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:17.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.610
SPEAKER: OK, so I can
pass this mic around.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:22.193
AUDIENCE: So what goals do you
have for the rest of your life?

00:47:24.261 --> 00:47:25.760
HANS FLORINE: My
goals right now are

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.260
get my 16-year-old
daughter out of high school

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.980
and into college, and my
son through middle school

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.810
and maybe to high school.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:39.230
They're pretty odd goals, but in
regard to climbing and fitness

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:43.100
goals, my odd thing is
I just like to stay fit

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.530
when an opportunity arrives.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.020
I happen to be doing the
CrossFit Open right now

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.430
for my third year.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:55.610
I bragged that I placed 1,310th
in my age division last year.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.830
But I just try to
find interesting ways

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.770
to stay fit in the city in
case I get invited to Mount

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:04.340
Kenya with Erik or something.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.980
I just want to say that
I'm totally comfortable.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.260
I know you guys maybe
you to be in your seat

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.110
at 1:00 PM working, or
you need somewhere to go

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.960
or whatever, I don't feel like
you're insulting me if you

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.710
have to get up and take off.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:20.990
AUDIENCE: People who speed
run video games play them

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.940
a completely different
way than normal people

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.741
play them for fun.

00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:25.490
They're finding glitches
in little corners

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:27.320
and unintended stuff.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:31.580
When you speed climb, how do
you see the rock or the route

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.312
differently than a normal
human would see it?

00:48:34.312 --> 00:48:36.770
HANS FLORINE: I thought that
was going to be like asking me

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.360
how I play one of
these rock climbing

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.052
video games or something.

00:48:44.672 --> 00:48:46.670
It's different on
a route that you've

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:49.370
been on before, like the
Nose, versus a route you

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:52.040
haven't been on.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.170
One of the things I teach
just in regular climbing

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:57.950
is that when you fall, most
people it's their forearms

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.710
that's tired, and you'll say,
where is Hans going with this?

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:02.300
But your forearms are
tired because it's usually

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.530
your grip strength
because you're

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:04.580
holding on for dear life.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.260
And I go hey, was
your neck tired?

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.380
And they're like, my neck?

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.450
No, it wasn't tired.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.910
And I go, well, look
around all the time

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.235
whenever you're
climbing for solutions.

00:49:14.235 --> 00:49:15.860
And that means when
I'm speed climbing,

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.860
I'm often not gripping hard
and fast, I'm looking around.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:20.860
Where can I place my foot
and push with my foot,

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.930
or push with my hand
rather than pull?

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.540
And a kind of an interesting
social commentary on that

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.210
is when I take a couple to--

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:30.620
I teach a lot of people to
climb at a gym or wherever.

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:34.325
When you take a couple to
climb, male and female, I mean.

00:49:34.325 --> 00:49:36.950
It doesn't have to be a
couple, but a male and female,

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.460
it tends to be that when
everything else is equal,

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.090
the woman will out climb the
man because you get to places

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:45.890
climbing or bouldering
and you're like,

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:47.210
I can't get any farther.

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.320
What do I do?

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.570
Guys tend to go like this,
and look at their bicep,

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:51.590
and pull harder.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.850
I mean, I exaggerate, but women
tend to go like this and look.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:57.350
Oh, I can put my foot up.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:58.922
Or oh, I can grab
this undecling.

00:49:58.922 --> 00:50:00.380
And so when I'm
speed climbing, I'm

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.590
like oh, my necks' not tired.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:02.030
I'm going to look around.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.900
What can I do?

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.480
You're a little bit
frantic, but more--

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.250
I like urgent better than--

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.440
frantic sounds so much better.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.800
AUDIENCE: So each time that you
went to beat a previous record,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.350
was there something that
you added in training or--

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:17.660
I mean, you mentioned that
you would be more aware?

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.730
But is there something
that you would work on

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:23.810
to be faster in the previous
time, in particular?

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.720
HANS FLORINE: Great question.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.140
Once the Huber brothers
got the record,

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.610
Me and Yuji actually
started looking at the topos

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:33.800
and plotting out
let's lead this,

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.570
and we never used this
piece of gear, here.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:39.230
Tom Frost was
really good at hey,

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.390
there's a logistical
point where a crack ends

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.310
and you have to pendulum
over to another.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.720
And how you decide who's
going to pendulum low and high

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.359
can save you time,
and someone doesn't

00:50:49.359 --> 00:50:51.150
have to climb this
terrain or that terrain.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.090
So we would actually
sit there on the topo,

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.880
and draw it out, and start
planning versus let's just

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.380
go faster.

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:00.980
Those guys did more
than just go faster.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.470
But that's one of
the big change was

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.760
strategy wise, we just really
took a close look at hey,

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.500
are we wasting time
coiling the rope up here

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.030
and somebody climbs
this part twice?

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:14.570
But as a training part, I
was working at an architect

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.596
engineering firm
when me and Yuji

00:51:16.596 --> 00:51:17.720
got the record [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.117
I would get up at 4:00
AM, climb for three hours

00:51:20.117 --> 00:51:22.200
because I knew the record
would be at three hours,

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.560
as hard as I could in the
gym, and go into my cubicle

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.420
all exhausted for
the rest of the day.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.780
And I'd do that
twice a week maybe.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.600
So I was just training
for the time period

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.200
that I'd be putting
out effort, I guess,

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.814
or what I thought I'd
be putting out effort.

00:51:38.814 --> 00:51:40.480
AUDIENCE: So I'm
definitely not planning

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.790
on climbing The
Nose this season,

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:45.760
or anytime in the
next couple of years,

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.280
but I feel like I speak
for a lot of people in here

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.820
that are aspirational big wall
climbers, or aspirational just

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.770
climbers in general.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:59.260
What tips you would have for
people that are intermediate,

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.270
trying to get
better in the sport,

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.420
and especially
trying to balance--

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.730
you mentioned you had
other ways of living.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.530
I don't know if you
had a full time job

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:12.060
and you had to balance
climbing with that job.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.960
HANS FLORINE: Well,
right out of college

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.610
I went and worked
50 hours a week

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:17.860
at a manufacturing
and engineering

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.410
firm with a tie and slacks.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:22.870
I was working 50 hours a
week, but every Tuesday,

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:26.050
Thursday after work, I'd be
bouldering around the city.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:30.070
I was in LA and then I'd go
out to the desert Joshua Tree

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.870
and climb my brains
out every weekend,

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.320
and be exhausted Monday.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.390
I was in love with the
activity of climbing.

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:40.680
But to your other question,
wherever you're at in climbing,

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:43.050
how do you get to
doing big walls?

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:46.002
Go and do a multi-pitch
route in Lover's Leap,

00:52:46.002 --> 00:52:47.460
like two, or three,
or four pitches

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:51.300
so you learn how to, for
one, go up trad cracks,

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.180
and then you add an anchor,
and now you go up another.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.060
Because in the gyms, of
course it's never multi-pitch.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.610
So just that organization
of how to move

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.592
urgently, and quickly,
and safely, of course.

00:53:02.592 --> 00:53:04.050
Different pitches,
and then you go,

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:08.280
well, let's go do an overnight
on a long route in Yosemite,

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.370
and then let's do a
two-day thing or something.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:16.510
There's a road to the Nose by
Chris McNamara on super topo.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.130
There, I plugged you, Chris.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:19.720
Supertopo.com, Road to the Nose.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.972
It tells you all the routes to
do on up to doing a big wall.

00:53:23.972 --> 00:53:26.430
AUDIENCE: If somebody goes and
breaks the record next week,

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.049
are you going to be
out there in two weeks?

00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:32.340
HANS FLORINE: I will not go
and break the record again.

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:39.280
A handful of public
audiences I've--

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.160
accountability partners, you
guys, I'm not going to go back.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.700
Not for that record, yeah.

00:53:49.984 --> 00:53:51.260
Yeah, back in the back.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.830
AUDIENCE: How much more
traffic has the Nose gotten

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.750
over the years, is
my first question,

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.249
and the second one
is how many times

00:54:02.249 --> 00:54:03.600
have you climbed the Nose.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.800
HANS FLORINE: Now it's been 103
times I've climbed the route,

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.030
and I've repelled it twice.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:10.650
I forgot to put
that stat in there.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.330
That's pretty fun.

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:15.030
About the crowdedness of
the Nose, it's interesting.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.847
There's no permit
required to climb El Cap.

00:54:17.847 --> 00:54:18.930
You can just go and climb.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:22.140
It's an old grandfathered thing
about climbers and wilderness.

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.760
We're allowed climb big walls.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.920
So you never know how
many people will be on it,

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.420
but when I climbed it in
1998, we passed nine parties.

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.590
Not people, but parties.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.950
So there could have been two to
four people in those parties.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:37.890
I've never claimed it since then
with that many parties on it.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.660
El Capitan as a whole,
you could look up

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.490
on a starry night
at dusk and there'll

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:51.120
be three dozen headlamps here,
and then the stars above it.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.560
It's a totally cool scene.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.740
So if you're ever in Yosemite,
go at dusk at climbing season.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:00.610
But that is limited to the
four to six weeks in the spring

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:03.390
and four to five
weeks in the fall.

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:07.710
If you go, there'll be nobody
on El from summer solstice,

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:11.280
June to the 1st of
September because people

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.362
tend to think it's too hot.

00:55:13.362 --> 00:55:15.070
We're really gifted
here in the Bay Area.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:16.520
We can look at the
weather report.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.317
I look at my watch,
I don't know why.

00:55:18.317 --> 00:55:20.900
Look at the weather report and
go, oh, it's cool this weekend.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.940
I can go.

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.660
You could go up El Cap
and there's nobody on it,

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.060
especially as a Bay Area person,
or if you have a private jet.

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:33.560
AUDIENCE: How do
you deal with fear

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.530
and have you had a bad fall?

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.620
HANS FLORINE: I have
had numerous bad falls.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.780
My worst was a broken--

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.850
I slammed my face into the rock
and broke front teeth and rope

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.970
burn on my leg.

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:48.122
That one happened so fast.

00:55:48.122 --> 00:55:50.330
There's a sport climbing
fall where I just flipped up

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:53.000
and probably it was
only fell like 25 feet

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.260
and slammed my face.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.110
There wasn't time to be afraid.

00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:59.780
But I've had falls
where I've slid down

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:04.400
slopes of granite 45 feet, and
I'm just like the whole time,

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.200
probably screaming.

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.760
This is before you had mobile
phones to record this stuff.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.240
And my hands were burned, and
actually, my knees were burned.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:19.698
I was frog laying on
it, trying to get grip.

00:56:19.698 --> 00:56:24.750
I said at the beginning,
often at mainstream talks--

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.210
I don't know what that
qualifies as-- but I'll

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:28.540
explain I'm not the m-word.

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.380
I'm not a mountaineer,
which tends to be more risk.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:36.480
And most deaths in climbing
is mountaineering alpinism.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.280
Although, I've tried
that type climbing,

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.560
and it's fun and
adventurous, I'm

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.850
a t-shirt and shorts climber.

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:45.210
I love the athleticism of
covering all this ground

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.770
on El Cap.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:51.330
And so when I get scared or
fearful, I look to end it.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.890
Like oh my gosh, I'm 10
feet above my last piece

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:54.630
of protection.

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:57.990
What can I do right now to put
something in so I'm not afraid?

00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.680
Kind of like when
your deadline--

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.690
I don't know, I'll
try to tie it in.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.314
Deadline for your
app is due and you're

00:57:02.314 --> 00:57:05.610
like bring in some more
help, I don't know.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:06.690
AUDIENCE: So my question.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.150
In the book, "50
Favorite Climbs,"

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:12.200
you said that Beggars Buttress
was your favorite route.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.159
HANS FLORINE: Yeah.

00:57:13.159 --> 00:57:14.950
AUDIENCE: Is that still
your favorite line?

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:17.860
HANS FLORINE: That never
was my favorite climb,

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.160
but the author of the
book, "50 Favorite,"

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:25.430
said you cannot choose any route
that's in the 50 classics book.

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:28.425
So right across the valley
from Beggars Buttress

00:57:28.425 --> 00:57:31.360
is a beautiful view of the Nose.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.480
So the route he talks
about, Beggars Buttress,

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.800
ends right here, actually.

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.508
So you're looking
right over at the Nose.

00:57:38.525 --> 00:57:40.400
AUDIENCE: I listened to
an interview with you

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.941
where you talked a
lot about bringing

00:57:41.941 --> 00:57:44.030
a lot of other
climbers up El Cap.

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:46.190
Can you just talk
about maybe some

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:50.130
of the best stories you have of
bringing other climbers up El

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:50.750
Cap?

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:52.250
HANS FLORINE: If I
tell you the best

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:54.200
stories of bringing
other climbers up El Cap,

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.480
nobody will read the book.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:56.990
How's that?

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.140
One of the chapters
is completely

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.090
published in "Rock and
Ice," and it's probably

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:08.600
most known for me as that's the
speed record with Alex Honnold.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.000
He's a very funny,
charming young man.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.050
But one of the most memorable
is Erik Weihenmayer,

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:15.220
the blind guy.

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:19.640
We were five days on the
route and that he led pitches,

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.851
I would never consider
having him lead pitches now

00:58:22.851 --> 00:58:23.850
that I know what I know.

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:25.760
I was just ignorant back then.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.920
And I remember him
leading up this crack that

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.729
was of the same size for 100
feet, I'm thinking, oh great,

00:58:33.729 --> 00:58:34.520
it's the same size.

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.311
He can just keep feeling
his hands the same

00:58:36.311 --> 00:58:38.030
and placing gear.

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:41.510
But I'm down there belaying and
I only gave him three number

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:43.880
two Camelot's, which is
the right size for that,

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.070
and he's placed the three,
and he has none left,

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:48.650
and he still has
70 feet to climb.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:51.620
And I'm down there belying just
going, what have I just done?

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.640
What have I just done?

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.170
I set this blind guy up to
either die or fall a long way

00:58:57.170 --> 00:59:02.610
and be maimed for life,
more so than he is.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:04.380
And just other
memories on that trip.

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.500
I broke down and cried on top.

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.780
I was so exhausted from
guiding him up there,

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:13.290
which I use the term
now guided, but I

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.870
realized when I got to the
top, I didn't guide him.

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:18.240
He led us to do this thing.

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.685
He's an amazing leader.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:26.642
You guys got to be careful
because I can Q&amp;A for 10 hours

00:59:26.642 --> 00:59:28.100
because I just love
what I'm doing.

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:31.570
But most people, because it's
the Everest of rock climbing,

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:33.430
they will do it once
and they'll remember

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:34.630
it the rest of their life.

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:39.370
And that, to me, is just
this crazy fun rewarding bond

00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:41.230
that I was with them.

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:43.150
And so it's so cool
to go up that route

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:44.800
with different
people, whether it's

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:50.195
famous Lin Hill or I don't
know, John Smith from Belgium,

00:59:50.195 --> 00:59:51.720
or whatever.

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.330
Yeah, it's cool to be
part of their memory.

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:58.340
SPEAKER: Let's just give Hans
another round of applause for--

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.490
[APPLAUSE]
