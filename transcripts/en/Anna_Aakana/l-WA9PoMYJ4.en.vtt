00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.500
Babe, hurry up.  I'm hungry.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.140
What is your passcode!?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.620
Who is Kara!?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.460
You think I wont find out?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.280
You disgust me.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.700
Hey sorry that took so long.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.180
Well well well, if it isn't the sexting king himself.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.480
You're trying to go through my phone?

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.380
Can I get you anything Matt?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.760
A cup of coffee?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.480
Uh, no thanks.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.580
It's FRESH!

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.060
Haha, I'm just kidding.  I wouldn't do that.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.620
You can't do this okay?  I have rights.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.440
Your friend flipped on you, Matt.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.940
He told me all about Kara.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.860
Celly wouldn't do that.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.760
Hm.  Just tell me you had a sextext with Kara.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760
I'm sure we can work this whole thing out.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.880
She's a nobody, okay?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.380
Listen.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.940
I can get the DA to agree to three weeks on the couch.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.680
Potentially, Poker Night parole.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520
But you've got to give me something to work with.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.640
Kara is just a co-worker, okay?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.980
It's strictly platonic!

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.660
I swear!

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.780
WHAT IS THIS?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.860
The home shopping network!?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.680
Because I'm not buying.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.100
You know, you probably shouldn't be going through my phone.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.700
I'LL ASK THE QUESTIONS!

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.820
First of all, that wasn't even a question!

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.440
Second of all, if you had anything on me

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.380
I would already be getting the silent treatmet.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.700
Aw, Matt, Matt, Matt.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.060
I didn't want to do this.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.740
What--what are you doing with that?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.740
Oh, you know.  Just swinging it around.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.620
And causing chaos.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.460
That's a limited edition!  Please be careful!

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.980
It can all be yours if you just give me that passcode.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.320
Tik tock, Matt.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.480
Oh!  Oh!

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.120
3 seconds left before I smash it on the ground!

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.440
Three.  Two.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.040
Times up!

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.500
Okay okay!  69 69!

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.920
You're pathetic.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.900
Where am I?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.020
Text: "Hey Matt, just a reminder that all expense receipts need to be scanned into a pdf document."

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.720
I love you, babe.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.740
We need to talk.
