00:00:00.505 --> 00:00:01.447
- [Voiceover] In this
video, we're gonna talk

00:00:01.447 --> 00:00:04.499
about some terminology
that we use to talk about,

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:06.703
how circuits are put together.

00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:08.537
In previous videos, we've talked

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:10.101
about the components, or the elements,

00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:11.794
that are used to make up circuits.

00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:15.127
So, for an example, resistor, capacitor,

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:19.913
and inductor, are circuit components.

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:22.059
We also call those elements.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.892
In addition, we have some sources,

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.229
like a voltage source, or for
example, a current source.

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.896
Those would be the components...

00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:41.024
Or elements of a circuit.

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:49.787
Now, we're going to start
assembling these things

00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:53.533
into circuits, and we need a
few more words to talk about.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.586
Here's some circuit components,

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:57.765
that are laying out on the tabletop,

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:01.605
and we're gonna connect
those up with a wire.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:05.789
For example, I could connect
this one to this one,

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.319
with this yellow, ideal wire.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.874
An ideal wire has zero resistance,

00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:13.890
and it's perfect everywhere.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.887
This forms a junction,
between these two components.

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:19.720
That is called a node.

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:25.753
Node is the word for
junction, mean the same thing.

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:31.081
That's what a node is.

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:34.664
If I connect up these
two other components,

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:38.918
I still have one node,
because I have one junction,

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:41.457
that's the same voltage everywhere.

00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:43.290
That's what a node is.

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:46.128
We're gonna go over to this circuit here,

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:47.429
and we'll identify the nodes.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.736
This is a little more normal
looking, tidy circuit.

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.620
Here's a junction, right here,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.789
between a resistor, and
this voltage source.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.544
So that's one node.

00:01:59.544 --> 00:02:03.087
If I move over here, I see
resistors connected together

00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:08.055
by ideal wires, so that forms
one single node, like that.

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:10.453
That's our second node.

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:12.350
Down below, same sort of thing.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.065
I see an ideal wire,
connecting the resistors,

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:19.309
and the source, so I can color that in.

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.392
That's node number three.

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:25.833
This circuit has three nodes.

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.143
Now what's connecting the nodes?

00:02:31.143 --> 00:02:32.600
The thing that's connecting the nodes,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.183
is called a branch.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.622
A branch is the same things as an element.

00:02:39.622 --> 00:02:43.415
We'll count the branches,
or elements, in this thing.

00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:46.219
This voltage source,
connects the third node

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.324
to the first node, so that's one element.

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:53.130
This resistor connects
node one and node two,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.014
so that's the second branch.

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:58.867
This resister connects
node two and node three,

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:00.873
so there's the third branch.

00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:03.757
And this resistor, with
a separate current,

00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:05.387
also connects those two nodes,

00:03:05.387 --> 00:03:08.205
so that's the fourth branch.

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:12.372
This circuit has one, two,
three, four elements in it,

00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:17.659
and it also means, it has four branches.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.086
Four branches.

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:22.565
That's what a branch and a node are.

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:24.054
I'm gonna move the
picture over a little bit,

00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:26.484
so that we can do this again,

00:03:26.484 --> 00:03:29.067
on a little more fancy circuit.

00:03:29.963 --> 00:03:31.546
First thing we're gonna do, again,

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:34.289
just to repeat the process,
we're gonna count the nodes.

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.456
Here's a junction between
a resistor and a source,

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:44.148
here's three resistors,
connected by a perfect wire,

00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:45.935
so that's the second node.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.768
Here we find three more resistors,

00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:53.302
connected by a perfect
wire, there's the third.

00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:55.559
Down here, we have, there's a junction,

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:59.493
between two resistors, so
that's our fourth node.

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:02.486
Finally, we have this node here,

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:06.319
connecting these four
elements, with one node.

00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:12.596
This is sometimes called a distributed,

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:14.524
a distributed node,
when it's all spread out

00:04:14.524 --> 00:04:17.580
on the page like that, but
it's still just one node.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.163
So this circuit has five nodes.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.765
If we count up the elements,

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.865
that will tell us how
many branches there are.

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:32.865
One element, two, three,
four, five, six, seven?

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.379
Seven elements.

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:48.991
Alright, there's our two key words.

00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:50.574
Elements and nodes.

00:04:55.887 --> 00:04:59.288
Now, I'm gonna quickly move again, down.

00:04:59.288 --> 00:05:01.749
Bring in another circuit here.

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.249
We're gonna talk about the idea of a mesh.

00:05:08.614 --> 00:05:12.781
The other thing we're gonna
about is the word, loop.

00:05:14.962 --> 00:05:17.533
The word mesh comes from screen doors,

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:20.117
or screens that you put on your windows,

00:05:20.117 --> 00:05:21.112
to keep the bugs out.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.761
If I draw a screen, like this,

00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:26.269
this is what it looks like.

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:27.351
A bunch of crossing wires.

00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:28.605
This little space right here,

00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:30.909
that little gap, is called a mesh.

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.075
That's what that word comes from.

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:36.097
We're gonna find the
meshes of our circuit.

00:05:36.097 --> 00:05:38.837
What we look for, here's the branches,

00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:41.920
and the mesh, it is a kind of a loop,

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.339
that fills up this open space.

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:50.564
This circuit has one mesh,
two mesh, three meshes.

00:05:55.253 --> 00:05:56.256
That's how that looks.

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.780
To draw a mesh, you start on a node,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.005
you go through elements, until you

00:06:01.005 --> 00:06:02.933
come back to where you started.

00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:04.312
That's how we did those three,

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:07.212
and they fill the open
windows of the circuit.

00:06:07.212 --> 00:06:09.712
This circuit has three meshes.

00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:16.513
A mesh is a loop, and we can
have other kinds of loops, too.

00:06:16.513 --> 00:06:19.773
They don't have to be just the
ones that fill the windows.

00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:22.563
In general, this circuit has other loops,

00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:24.364
and we'll identify some of those.

00:06:24.364 --> 00:06:26.895
Let's just start at one
of these nodes here,

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:29.669
and go around like that.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:30.919
This is a loop.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.152
I could draw other loops in here,

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:35.751
we'll make them all different colors.

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.918
There's a loop, if I start right here,

00:06:40.093 --> 00:06:43.510
I can draw a loop through these elements.

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:48.635
Finally, if I have a sharp eye,

00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:51.783
there's one more loop in this circuit.

00:06:51.783 --> 00:06:53.045
Let's just start right here,

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:57.212
and it actually goes all
the way around the outside.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.682
This circuit has three, actually,

00:07:01.682 --> 00:07:04.549
if I add them together,
this has three loops,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:08.312
that I drew here, plus the three
loops that were the meshes.

00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:10.562
This circuit has six loops.

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:14.487
Circuits always have a lot of loops,

00:07:14.487 --> 00:07:17.434
and so, usually, we
don't talk about these.

00:07:17.434 --> 00:07:19.926
More often, it's more
organized and straightforward

00:07:19.926 --> 00:07:23.249
to talk about how many
meshes are in a circuit.

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:24.082
Alright.

00:07:25.004 --> 00:07:26.148
That does it for this video.

00:07:26.148 --> 00:07:27.981
We got mesh and loop,

00:07:29.252 --> 00:07:32.752
we talked about components and elements...

00:07:41.618 --> 00:07:43.609
And we finished up, with the idea,

00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:45.942
also, of nodes and branches.

00:07:58.076 --> 00:07:58.909
That'll do it.

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:01.879
There's our new vocabulary,
for talkin' about circuits.
