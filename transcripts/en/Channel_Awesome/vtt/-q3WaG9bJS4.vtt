I remember it so you don't have to.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.700
We all remember the mid-90s comedy, "The Mask".

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.920
One of the first films to work in the
growing popularity of computer effects,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.960
with the more cartoony nature as opposed to threatening.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.580
It was a decent flick,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.140
with the Mask character for the kids

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.320
and Carrey's straight man routine for the adults.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.360
And on top of that, it made A LOT of money.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.260

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.080
We enter a museum that literally has the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.440
Ben Stein.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.700
And seriously, was it even worth getting him?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.260
It's like making 'Ghostbusters 3' and the only cast member you bring in is the lamp from Scene 22.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.940
Though, to be fair,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.360
the lamp would give a much more
stunning performance than Stein.

"Who's that ugly guy?"

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.900

what a coinkidink! Loki himself
appears, played by Alan Cumming,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.520

This is one of many "shit your pants" disturbing images.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.460
Granted, anything dismembering 
Ben Stein is usually a plus,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.920
but I'd rather be able to watch it as opposed to 
run out of the theater in my urine soaked khakis.

So, the real Mask is in the river just outside of Fringe City,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.480
which is so similar to Edge City, you'll be asking yourself "why the fuck didn't they just keep it in Edge City?",

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.540
and it's picked up by the NOT dog from the first movie.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.640

the kids can see the trailer and say,

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.920
"Oh look, even the Jack Russell Terrier wanted 
more money than they were willing to shell out."

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.920
But thankfully they found other performers 
who were willing to take less,

set his acting to permanent nasally whine.

and apologize at the same time!"

"I can't go as this."

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.760

it sounds like he's whining.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.800
No, that's not a very encouraging thought.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.680
In fact that's about as far away from an encouraging thought an encouraging thought could get!

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.960
Well, that's all I got.

more "Lord of the Rings" anytime.

Why was he here?

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.360
So, Jamie tries something different for a change: Actually being a good father

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.520
by at the very least changing the kid's diaper.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.180

[baby giggling]

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.120
Why are you making me think 
about a baby with three penises?

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.500
What twisted pig shit does that?!

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.040

[baby cooing]

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.320
So, Loki finally finds the baby and tries to 
force them to tell him where The Mask is.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.380
Loki: [demonic voice] "Prepare to feel my true power!"

admire his fashion sense.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.000
Must be an homage to when

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.080
KISS performed on St. Patrick's Day.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.980
But it's okay because the baby likes his dad now.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.780
Yep, right the fuck out of nowhere
again with no goddamn explanation.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.300
And Odin possesses Jaime's 
body to tell Loki he's fed up.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.700
"You are hereby stripped of your immortal powers

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.120
and forever banished to the land of mortals!"

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.740
Loki: "No--!" [screams]

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.320
So he's a mortal now,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.660
which doesn't add up because the baby does 
all this stuff and he survives it somehow...

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.880
But what makes even less sense 
is Loki is stripped of his powers

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.880
just so he can convince Odin literally
in two scenes later to give them back.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.660
Yeah, just two scenes later, it's like a couple minutes.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.200
Meaning, there was no point to take the powers away,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.620
except to make the movie go even longer.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.440
Because...yeah that's what I need,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.740

Jaime: "Is that you?"

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.280
Loki: "No, you idiot."

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.320
EW....

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.540

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.920
EWWWWW!!!!

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.060
God, it's bad enough we have the
Schwarzenegger baby from "Junior".

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.000
Can you imagine showing those two back to back?

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.560

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.700
So, Loki takes the kid saying

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.580
if he doesn't get The Mask back soon, he's keeping him.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.240
This leads to a delightful moment where 
Jamie thinks his wife returned home is Loki

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.900
and thus beats the loving bejesus out of her.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.100
[grunting and shouting]

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.220
So, they find the mask and decide to
do a trade, but wouldn't you know it,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.400
in the less than three minutes of screen time,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.880
Loki decides he likes the kid now 
and wants to keep him forever.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.200
"Thank you, but I've grown attached."

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.800
But the always-popular crotch shot...

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.900
[screams]

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.940
gets the mask out of his hands and back onto Jamie.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.280
"Honey, I think it's time we trade up."

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.020
So they work their way into the Charlie Sheen mobile,

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.240
actually to be fair...

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.520
that car is fucking awesome,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.680
and drive on over to the final showdown.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.520
"And here he is, folks..."

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.420
Will you TURN your wide angle lens down?

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.100
You've had it pushed to maximum since frame one!

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.560
"And Loki said, 'Let there be a brick wall!'

Loki: "And there was." [laughs]

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.940
Now, why didn't they make a toy out of that?

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.840
It's such a charming delightful image,
I'm sure kids would flocked it...

DON'T SHOW IT AGAIN!

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:25.940
So, they decide they're evenly matched and figure the best thing to do is let the baby decide where he goes.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.240
"Pick me. Pick me."

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.660
"Alvey, I'm your real dad!"

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.520
Loki: "Come on, you little devil. Let's play."

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.540
NC: "I'm just the mother so 
clearly I have no say in this..."

"I love you."

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.080
"Dada."

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:50.860
"Oh, Alvey..."

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.080
So his CG mouth chooses his father.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.460
Again, the mother I guess 
weighed no part in this decision.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.540
And we even get some family 
bonding with Loki and Odin.

"I don't know how things work in 
the god world, but you're his father.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.720
He's your son.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.420
And even if you banish him, he's still gonna be your son."

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:15.460
"Come on, son, let's go home. Okay?
Loki: "Okay."

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.760
Odin: "Godspeed."

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.780
Well gee, if only Jamie Kennedy 
were there in 'The Avengers'.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.460
I'm sure things we've gone over much
better with Loki if he was around.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:32.900
Jamie: "There is nothing more important in this entire 
universe than your relationship with your family."

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.260
"So, you might as well get things right now--."

huge hit TV show, doesn't it?

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.560
a poorly made movie that dived 
into the mind of a serial killer?

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.560
Well, Tarsem got it wrong,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.200

dives into the mind of a serial killer.

It just forgot to mention the serial killer part.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.080
Not only is the movie horribly written,
awkwardly acted, filled with lame as hell effects,

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.200
and using way too much goddamn wide-angle lens,

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.920

should ever have to see the terrifying...
