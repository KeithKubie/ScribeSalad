00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.950
Now, a router in AS1 might learn two routes to a destination, one via the AS

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.580
path 24 and the other via the AS path 34. Local preference or simply local pref

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.840
allows an operator to configure the router to

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.000
assign different preference values to each of the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.620
routes that it learns. The default local preference

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.520
value Is 100. If the operator prefers that this

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.400
router select the path through AS two, it can configure the router to set a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.680
higher local preference for that route. Such

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.072
as 110. This results in this router selecting

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:42.896
the route through AS two and sending traffic to the destination in AS four via

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:46.230
AS two. In this way a operator can

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.570
adjust local preference value of incoming route to

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.870
control put bound traffic or to control

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.930
how traffic leaves it tominac system in route

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.520
to a destination this is extremely useful in

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.519
configuring primary and back up routes for example

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520
here the route though A.S two might

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.082
be the primary route,and the route through AS

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:12.770
three, is the backup route. Now typically as

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.920
I mentioned, local preference is used to control

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.260
outbound traffic. But sometimes autonomous systems can

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.760
attach what's called a BGP community to a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.040
route to effect how a neighboring autonmous system

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.270
sets local preference. A community is nothing more,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.345
but a fancy jargon word for a tag on a route. So let's suppose that AS four

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:41.165
wanted to control inbound traffic by affecting how AS two or AS three set

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:47.593
local preference. In this case, let's suppose, that AS two wanted traffic

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:53.730
to arrive via AS three, its primary, rather than by AS two, its backup. In this

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.870
case, AS two might advertise its BGP routes with primary and backup communities.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.270
The backup community value might cause a router in AS two to adjust its local

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.050
preference value, thus affecting how AS two's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.150
outbound traffic choices are made. So, again

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.990
local preference is used to control outbound

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.170
traffic, in this case AS two's outbound traffic

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.570
decision, but the use of a BGP

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.830
community on the route advertisement can sometimes

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.060
be used to cause a neighboring AS

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.130
to make different choices regarding it's outbound traffic.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.240
Thereby, allowing an AS to specify a primary or back up

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.350
path for incoming traffic. This type of arrangement requires prior agreement.
