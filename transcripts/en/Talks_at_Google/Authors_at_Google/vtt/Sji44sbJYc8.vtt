00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:07.070
PRESENTER: All right.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.390
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.760
Really thrilled to be
hosting Barry Strauss today

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.700
for our Authors@ series
in Mountain View.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.590
Barry is a professor
of history and classics

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.660
at Cornell University,
and he's the author

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.790
of seven books on ancient
history and military,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.455
and a naval historian
and consultant.

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:27.080
For the spring semester, he is
a visiting scholar at the Hoover

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.940
Institution at Stanford.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.440
In his book "Masters
of Command,"

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.390
Barry compares the
way the three greatest

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.580
generals in the ancient world--

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.170
Alexander, Hannibal,
and Caesar--

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.500
waged war and draw lessons
from the experiences that apply

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.450
on and off the battlefields.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.480
Understanding where each of
these three great but flawed

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.910
commanders succeeded
and failed concerns

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.890
anyone who wants to
think strategically

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.930
or must demonstrate leadership.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.910
And with that, I'll
turn it over to Barry.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.730
Welcome.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.190
BARRY STRAUSS: Thank you,
Jessica, and thanks, everyone.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.670
It's really great to be here.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.050
And as Jessica said, I'm going
to talk about leadership.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.570
I often talk about
leadership, and I'm always

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.920
excited to see how passionate
people are about the subject.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.680
I want to talk about
what makes a great leader

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.380
and how leaders
inspire and motivate

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.420
people to give their best.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.180
But I also want to talk
about what kind of leaders

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.530
we need today.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.930
And to get to that subject, I'm
going to start with the past.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930
I'm going to take a
historical approach.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.820
Now I know that
Henry Ford famously

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.730
said that history is bunk.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.230
And I also know
that I'm going to be

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.270
speaking about ancient history.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
So perhaps what I'm going to
be doing today is double bunk.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.120
But I hope that I
can persuade you

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.940
that there are some things
about the human condition that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.260
haven't changed and
from which we can learn.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.910
Let me tell you that my
methodology as a historian

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.340
is fairly traditional.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.670
I think my perspective is
broad, but my methodology

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.600
is traditional.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.470
And my approach, to some
extent, is storytelling.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.980
My notion of leadership
is looking at leadership

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.160
as an art rather than a science,
although there are certainly

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.540
scientific approaches
that one could take.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.160
And my intention is to
raise some broad questions.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.220
So in looking at Alexander
the Great, Hannibal, Julius

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.240
Caesar--

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.920
and today, I'm going to
add a fourth person who

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.380
is very much part of the story.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.600
That's Cleopatra.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.030
So in looking at
these leaders, I

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.350
want to talk about what I call
the paradox of leadership,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.420
or what I also call the
problem of Alexander

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.640
and the cup of water.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.270
And I'll explain
what I mean by that.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.610
More generally, I
think I want to ask

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.060
the question is it better
to have a leader who

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.000
is charismatic or caring?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.440
Is it better to have a leader
who is strong or humble?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.910
And is it possible to have both?

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.240
Can we have our cake
and eat it, too?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.480
Can we have a leader who is
both charismatic and caring?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.910
Well, those are some of the
questions I want to ask today.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.750
Now, if you think
about these names--

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.490
I'm sure you've heard of them
before-- on the face of it,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.730
it might seem absurd
to suggest that they

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.950
could be caring or humble.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.670
After all, folks like
Alexander and Caesar

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.020
are exhibit A of power and
ego and the blind spots

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.220
those qualities can create.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.777
These are certainly leaders
who issued top-down orders.

00:03:51.777 --> 00:03:53.235
And yet the closer
we look at them,

00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:58.200
the more we see that they
didn't simply issue commands,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.060
and they weren't
simply top down.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.120
These were leaders who led by
example, who considered others

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.580
in the group, and who also
offered outstanding benefits.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.630
So let me say a little
bit about each of them,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.690
just as an overview
to begin with.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.209
So Alexander, whose dates
are 359 to 323 B.C.,

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.170
he is the king of
Macedon, and he goes on

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.910
to conquer an empire.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.910
He conquers the greatest
empire that the world had

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.790
known to date, and that
was the Persian Empire.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.370
It stretched about 3,000
miles from the Mediterranean

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.290
to South Asia.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.890
And it included, perhaps, about
20% of the people on Earth.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.780
Alexander conquered this
empire, and he employed a series

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.790
of disruptive paradigms.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.420
First, he won a
naval war on land.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.160
And second, having
conquered the empire,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.790
he then proceeded to attempt to
create a new ruling class that

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.620
would consist of intermarriage
between Greeks and Macedonia

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.280
on the one hand and
Iranians on the other.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.080
It was something that
neither group took to easily.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.870
And Alexander-- whether this
experiment would have succeeded

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.520
or not, we don't know,
because Alexander died young.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.490
And he left behind a legacy
of civil war and disruption.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.240
His new empire did not last.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.580
With Hannibal, we're going
down to the next century.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.900
He's born in 247
B.C., dies in 183.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.010
He is a Carthaginian
who, from a base

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.840
in a colonial empire in
southern Spain, invades Italy.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.140
And he does so-- again,
another disruptive paradigm--

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.400
by shocking his Roman
opponents by marching 900 miles

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.240
overland from southern
Spain across the Pyrenees,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.960
southern France, the
Rhone, and then the Alps,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.960
and drops down into
northern Italy.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.450
He takes with him an
army and 37 elephants,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.360
who he famously manages to get
across the Alps in the snow,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.910
and then invade Italy.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.020
He then proceeds to hand the
Romans the biggest military

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.510
defeats that they had
ever had, including

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.880
one of the most lopsided
victories in history,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.470
the Battle of Cannae, in 216
BCE, in which Hannibal's army

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.680
defeats an enemy army that's
about twice the size of his,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.950
and in which he carries out
one of the gold standards

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.740
of tactical achievement
on the battlefield--

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.650
a double envelopment,
something that's

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.470
bedeviled people over the
ages, or bewitched people

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.430
over the ages.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.870
He and his army last
in Italy for 15 years.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.080
He never has a
mutiny, which is very

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.260
unusual for ancient conditions.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.060
But he goes on to lose the war.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.340
In spite of his great victories,
in the end, he is defeated,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.660
and his own country
suffers the fate

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.315
that he expected Rome to suffer.

00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:18.970
The third case is Julius Caesar.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.800
His dates are 100 to 44 B.C.
Caesar was a great conqueror.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.070
His goals were first
to conquer an empire

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.340
for the Republic, his
soldiers, and himself,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.370
not necessarily in that
order, and then to take on--

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.380
he conquerors and
empire in Gaul,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.950
and then to take on the
entire Roman ruling elite,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.480
and to bend it to his will,
which he proceeds to do.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.730
He, too, uses
disruptive paradigms.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.480
He invades Italy against
the entire Roman state

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.320
with only 5,000 men behind him.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.380
And in his climactic battle--

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.890
Battle of Pharsalus
in Greece in 48 B.C.--

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:06.540
he manages to defeat cavalry
by a very unusual infantry

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.740
tactic--

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.450
sending infantry to stop
cavalry dead in their tracks.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:19.800
Well, after all these conquests,
he lets success go to his head.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.670
And he is the victim of one of
the most famous and greatest

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.070
conspiracies in history--

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.300
the conspiracy of
the Ides of March.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.580
60 Romans, including a
majority of them Caesar's

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.590
own supporters, turn on him.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.830
They stab him to death
in the Senate house

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.710
and bring down the
curtain very dramatically

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.520
on his most
extraordinary career.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.840
Finally, Cleopatra--
Cleopatra was queen of Egypt.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.390
Her dates were 69 to 30 B.C.,
so she, too, died young.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.680
She was a descendant of one
of Alexander's generals,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.370
a Macedonian.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.920
And she came from
a ruling house that

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.300
had been ruling Egypt
for several centuries.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.910
She herself did not
have the throne.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.920
The throne had gone to
one of her brothers.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.910
And she managed to maneuver
herself to be in a position

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.640
to become the queen
of Egypt, to defeat

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.050
her brother who
was on the throne

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.230
militarily, and then to--

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.352
he dies in battle--

00:09:26.352 --> 00:09:27.810
then to get rid of
another brother,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.760
and indeed, to get
rid of her sister.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.910
She was quite ruthless, but
she was a brilliant strategist,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.100
exceedingly charming.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.140
And she managed to
get on her side,

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.980
in turn, two of the
strongest men in Rome--

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.120
first Julius Caesar,
whose lover she became.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.560
And she bore a son, who she
claimed was Caesar's son.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.720
And then Mark Antony.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.730
After Caesar is
assassinated, she

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.130
becomes his mistress
and then his wife

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.790
and bears three children to him.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.870
She almost succeeds in
having the power of Rome

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.200
move eastward to the capital
of Egypt, to Alexandria.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.700
And she almost succeeds in
shifting the balance of power,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.660
in making Egypt independent,
in bringing Rome over to Egypt.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.790
And she influences
both Caesar and Antony

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.810
and their conceptions.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.960
Huge influence on
Caesar and on his notion

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.170
of what it means, what he's
going to do-- having conquered

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.539
Rome, how is he
going to govern Rome,

00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:35.580
and what is he going to
do with the city of Rome.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.520
He gets a lot of his
ideas from Cleopatra,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.820
from seeing her
success as a queen

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.480
and seeing what her dynasty
had achieved in Alexandria

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.370
as the capital city of Egypt.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.910
Antony also looks
eastward with Cleopatra,

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.530
opening a vision of conquest
to empire in the East for him.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.540
In the end, it doesn't work.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.150
They come up against
a greater talent.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:05.460
Octavian becomes Augustus,
Rome's first emperor.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.240
But for a moment, it
looks as if Cleopatra

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.420
was going to be the most
powerful woman in human history

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.590
to that date.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.510
With that as a
historical overview,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.420
let me say a little bit
about my model of leadership

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.110
and the paradox of leadership.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:27.110
So on the one hand, we
have very strong leaders.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.570
And these leaders
all have in common

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.140
a certain series
of characteristics

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.620
that they project.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.150
They project strength.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.310
They project intelligence.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:43.010
They project passion, energy,
and communication skills.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:48.620
And in particular, each of them
has a very powerful brand--

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:54.880
a brand that's simple,
identifiable, and compelling.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.520
They also have a
persuasive mission.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.300
So it's the combination of
the brand and the mission

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.000
that makes their
communication successful.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.550
Now, all of these
qualities are ones

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.080
that they could use by
leading from the top.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.570
They're all top-down qualities.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.460
But there's another
set of qualities

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.280
that they have that
are not so top down.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.680
And these are
leading by example,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.300
sharing hardships, minimizing
risk to their best performers,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.500
building community, and
offering outstanding benefits.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.270
These are all part of what
these leaders did as well.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.650
So let's take a closer
look at how this works.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.910
Alexander the Great first.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.070
Here is an image of Alexander.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.420
This is a Roman mosaic, a famous
mosaic that comes from Pompeii.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.760
And it projects Alexander as
he wanted people to see him.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.950
You can see that
he is in battle.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.490
He's in battle against
his Persian opponent.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.110
He is on horseback.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.709
If you look at the
guy behind him,

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:11.250
you'll see that the
fellow behind him

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.010
is wearing a helmet, which of
course Alexander would have

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.660
been doing as well in battle.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.120
He wouldn't have gone into
battle without a helmet.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.820
But the artist is
taking license here

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.510
that's very much part of
Alexander's public image

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.320
of someone who is fearless.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.260
He is someone who is young.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.470
Greek men-- mature
Greek men-- wore beards.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.830
But he is beardless, so
he's emphasizing his youth.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.710
And you'll also notice his
hair is parted in the middle

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.190
and it is swept back.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.510
It's windblown.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.460
This is the image that
Alexander liked to present.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.240
Now, yes, here he is
in a leadership role

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.760
going fearlessly in to battle.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.420
But he's also somebody
who saw himself

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.160
very much as a caring leader
and someone who paid attention

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.480
to his men.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.010
This is the story of Alexander
and the cup of water.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.710
At one point during
his long journey

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.080
eastward conquering
the Persian Empire,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.830
he found himself in what
is today Afghanistan.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.550
And Alexander was leading
his army northwards

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.030
through the desert in what is
today northern Afghanistan.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.840
It's an area of desert.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.760
The men were running
out of water.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.430
They were in terrible shape.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.890
And let me read to you from
one of the ancient sources what

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.835
Alexander does.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.660
"These urgent problems
distressed Alexander.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.460
His friends stood
around him and begged

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.410
him to remember that
his intrepid spirit was

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.390
all that could
restore the fortunes

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.390
of his languishing army.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.890
At this point, he was met by
two of the men who'd gone ahead

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.500
to select the campsite.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.700
They're carrying skins
of water to bring relief

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.320
to their sons,
who they knew were

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.440
suffering from severe thirst
in Alexander's column.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.110
On meeting the king,
one of them opened

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.580
a skin, filled the
cup he was carrying,

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.200
and offered it to him.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.316
Alexander took it.

00:15:11.316 --> 00:15:13.440
Then he asked for whom they
were carrying the water

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.524
and learned it was
for their sons.

00:15:15.524 --> 00:15:17.940
He returned the cup, as full
as it was when it was offered

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.250
to him, saying I cannot
bear to drink alone,

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.500
and it is not possible for me to
share so little with everybody.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.360
Go quickly and give
your sons what you

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.910
have brought on their account."

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.830
So after this gesture
of self-abnegation,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.620
that very evening,
they come to a river.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.530
They can all drink.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.550
And Alexander waits until
everyone in his army drinks.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.430
He's the last one to
take a drink of water.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.740
Did it really happen this way?

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.740
Does it matter?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.780
It's the message that
Alexander gave out.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.350
It's the image that he wanted
to people to have of him--

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.630
as I said, a caring leader.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.100
Here's another
image of Alexander.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.240
This is a coin issued
in his lifetime.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.480
You can see
Alexander's head here.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.360
And he is wearing the lion's
skin of Heracles or Hercules.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.500
He Identifies himself with
this great Greek hero,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.850
this great Greek warrior,
a symbol of strength,

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.870
but also the son of Zeus,
the king of the gods.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.890
We see Zeus on the
other side of the coin.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.430
You can see that it says the
coin belongs to Alexander.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.780
And Alexander proclaimed
himself as the son of Zeus.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:46.420
He proclaimed himself
as no less than a god.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.960
This outraged some of his
subjects but delighted others.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.530
Because for them, being the
son of a god was, in some ways,

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.220
equivalent to us
being a celebrity,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:02.400
being somebody who really
deserved great fame.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.220
There are other ways as
well in which Alexander

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.950
showed that he was caring.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.550
He visited the sick
in military hospitals.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:18.089
He took very good care
of widows and orphans.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:21.869
He set up statues back
in the home country

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:25.950
to officers who
had died in battle.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.180
And he certainly led by example.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.430
More than any of the other
people we're talking about,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.510
he liked to lead
in the front lines.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.590
In fact, he fought in
the front lines too much.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.640
During his battles, Alexander
suffered seven major battle

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.340
wounds, one of which
almost killed him.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.750
And it might be the reason
why he succumbed just

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.120
before his 33rd
birthday to a virus.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.450
If he hadn't had this
series of wounds beforehand,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.780
he might have been
in better shape.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.090
He was a workaholic.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.670
And he said that only the
need for sleep and sex

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.670
reminded him that he was human.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.900
Well, he was human.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.540
And as I said, he
died at the age of 33

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.970
while he was planning
to lead his army

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.350
on to yet more conquests, having
conquered the Persian Empire.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:24.442
He intended to conquer Arabia
and Carthage and then Italy.

00:18:24.442 --> 00:18:25.650
So let's move on to Hannibal.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.700
We don't have a
coin of Hannibal,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.040
at least one that we
can securely identify

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.570
as belonging to Hannibal.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.710
This coin is probably issued
by his father, Hamilcar,

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.900
who was also a great commander.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.980
But it touches the same
themes that Hannibal

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.360
touches in his propaganda.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.550
And we know that Hannibal
uses these themes

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.370
because the written
sources talk about them.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.130
So on one side of the coin,
the face we're looking at

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:59.110
is, by now, our old
friend Heracles, Hercules.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.960
He's got a victory
wreath, and he

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.650
is carrying a club,
another symbol of Hercules.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.550
Hercules is important
for Hannibal

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:13.630
because he is also the first
god of the ancient world

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.690
to go to Spain, to go from
the Eastern Mediterranean

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.100
all the way to Spain.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.420
Hannibal has his base in Spain.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.360
Hannibal is a Carthaginian.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.460
They worship Hercules
in their own form.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.930
They call him Melqart.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.790
But it's roughly the same god.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.000
They have a temple of Hercules
that they build on the Atlantic

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.520
Ocean, because they're
so excited about the fact

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.712
that they're so intrepid--

00:19:34.712 --> 00:19:36.670
they've gone all the way
from the Mediterranean

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.840
to the Atlantic.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.160
And according to myth,
Hercules, after going to Spain,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.570
goes back towards
Greece by way of Italy

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.540
and has some conquests
in Italy as well.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.500
So he's a symbol of
Hannibal and how Hannibal

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.530
plans to conquer Italy.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.710
He's Hannibal's
brand, as it were.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:02.440
If Alexander's brand
was youth and charisma,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.530
Hannibal's brand is
Hercules and the elephant.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.960
And here you see the elephant
on the other side of the coin.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.930
Now, why the elephant?

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.530
The Carthaginians acquired
elephants in Africa

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.370
and brought them with them
to Spain, and then, indeed,

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.600
to Italy.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.290
But the paradox-- and
they use them in war.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.550
But the paradox is that they
didn't use them very much.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.270
The elephants were more terror
weapons than anything else.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.520
They were more
symbols than they were

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.280
practical realities in battle.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.740
In fact, elephants are of
so little use in battle

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.540
that one of my
colleagues says there's

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.310
a simple rule to
ancient battle--

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:48.000
the side that has the most
elephants always loses.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.420
But the elephant was a really
good symbol for Hannibal.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.440
The elephant is a symbol
of strength, of heroism,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.110
of intelligence-- because
elephants are very intelligent

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.370
animals--

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:04.500
of emotion, because elephants
are easily aroused to emotion,

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.940
and of rebellion, because
elephants are hard to control.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.260
It's a symbol that Hannibal
goes back to again and again.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.990
He makes sure that he's
seen riding on elephants

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.760
in the Italian countryside.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.520
He makes sure that he's
seen entering on elephants

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.890
when he enters cities.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.130
And even though he's very
short on supplies in Italy,

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:32.310
he has his home base in
Carthage send nine elephants

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.140
across the Mediterranean.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.570
It's so important to
him that he has these

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.510
to intimidate the opposition.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:44.880
Now, if Alexander's mission
was a mission of revenge

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.420
and conquest, Hannibal's
mission is a mission

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.890
of revenge and liberation.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.440
When he comes to Italy,
he says he is not there

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.810
to conquer the
Italians, but rather,

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:01.110
to liberate the Italians
from the yoke of Rome.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.430
Italy for the
Italians is his motto.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:10.130
And he uses it again and again
to try to wean away allies

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.630
from Rome and wean them over to
the side of the Carthaginians.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:20.300
And he offers these allies
extremely generous terms

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.030
in order to get their support.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.720
He's successful to a degree,
though not, ultimately,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.300
to the degree that
would allow him to win.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.780
He depends, above all, on the
army he's brought with him

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.940
and on the
reinforcements he gets.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.320
It's a remarkable army.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.960
It is one of the most
multi-ethnic armies

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.580
in the ancient world.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.120
It is surely the most
multi-ethnic professional army

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.430
that the ancient world has seen.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.480
It consists of people
from North Africa--

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.950
both Carthaginians, Libyans,
and people of Berber descent

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.110
as well as Numidians--
that is to say,

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.870
the equivalent of
Algerians today.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:07.820
It consists of people from
Spain, mostly Celt Iberians.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.020
It consists of Celts
from Northern Italy.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.580
And it consists of Greeks and
Semites and Oscan speakers,

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.660
a variety of people from
Southern Italy, All of whom

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.160
join Hannibal.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.710
How does he hold them together?

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.870
Well, one of the ways that
he holds them together

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:32.960
is through his ability
to lead by example.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.780
Let me read a quotation.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.780
"There was no leader in whom the
soldiers placed more confidence

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.880
or under whom they
showed more daring.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.850
He was fearless in
exposing himself to danger

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.240
and perfectly self-possessed
in its presence.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.930
No amount of exertion could
cause him either bodily

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.490
or mental fatigue.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.700
He was equally indifferent
to heat and cold.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.630
His eating and
drinking were measured

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.120
by the needs of nature,
not by appetite.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.340
His hours of sleep were not
determined by day or night.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.610
Whatever time was not
taken up with active duties

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.230
was given to sleep and rest.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.040
But that rest was not wooed
on a soft couch or in silence.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.050
Men often saw him
lying on the ground

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.320
amongst the sentinels
and outposts, wrapped

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.730
in his military cloak.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.030
His dress was in no way superior
to that of his comrades.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.480
What did make him conspicuous
were his arms and horses.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.120
He was by far the foremost,
both of the cavalry

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.320
and the infantry, the first to
enter the fight and the last

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.450
to leave the field.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:41.920
So he was indeed someone
who led by example.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.290
He's also someone
who takes great care

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.910
to minimize the risks
that his best men share.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.860
So his best soldiers--

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.290
the elite ones
from North Africa--

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.950
he is very sparing
of and only uses them

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.310
in the most necessary
situations, otherwise

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.350
using other soldiers.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:08.210
He himself, like Alexander,
shares hardships and suffers

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.680
with the men.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.220
While he is leading the
army over the mountains

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.200
from Northern to
Central Italy, they

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.000
have to go through a
very difficult swamp.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.550
It's extremely unhealthy.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.890
He gets an infection in
his eye, and the infection

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.690
leads to permanent
negative effects.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.510
He loses sight in
one of his eyes.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.820
He's willing to take
this kind of risk

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.760
and suffer this kind
of loss for the cause.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.300
It has a great effect on
his followers, particularly

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.530
the Celts.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.920
Because the Celts believed
that one of their gods

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.050
was a one-eyed god.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.530
And they came to associate
Hannibal with this one-eyed god

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.440
and saw him, like
that God, as someone

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.790
who was leading to victory.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.190
Hannibal also has
a sense of humor.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.740
We're told that before
the Battle of Cannae, when

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.220
one of his officers saw that
the Romans outnumbered them

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.586
by two to one, he said he was
terrified at the amazing army

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:12.960
that the Romans
had put together.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.320
And the man's name was Gizgo.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.170
So Gizgo was terrified at
how amazing the army was.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.280
And Hannibal replies to him,
it is an amazing army, Gizgo.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.240
But I'll tell you one
thing I'm sure of--

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.880
there's no one in
it named Gizgo.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.330
As I said, Hannibal
never suffers a mutiny.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.340
Alexander does suffer a mutiny.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.940
His men mutiny in India
and force him to turn back.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.020
Hannibal is in Italy for 15
years, living off the land.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.420
And yet his men
remain satisfied.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.670
He pays them very
well, and he also

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:51.050
makes sure that they have
sufficient rest and recreation.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.480
Let's turn to Gaius
Julius Caesar.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.240
Here we see a statue of Caesar.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.970
This is a statue in green slate.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.090
It probably comes from Egypt.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:10.480
It probably was carved
within the century

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.382
after Caesar's death.

00:27:12.382 --> 00:27:13.840
If you look at it,
you can see this

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.550
is a statue that shows what
a lot of hard living this man

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.750
has done.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.760
His cheeks are sunken.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.530
He's got crow's feet.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.000
He's got wrinkles.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.580
His hairline is receding.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.630
His look is certainly
not youthful and happy.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.810
This is probably the
reality of the man

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.930
in the last years of his life.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.280
We know that he was suffering
from epilepsy as well

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.890
as from a series
of mini-strokes,

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.130
so hardly in the peak of health.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.770
But that's not the
image that Caesar wanted

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.920
to present to the Romans.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.250
Here we have a coin that
was issued within a month

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.600
before his death.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.710
So Caesar dies on March 15,
44 B.C. This coin probably

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.790
was issued in February.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:06.680
And if you look at it, you
see this man looks vigorous.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.570
He's looking straight ahead.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.810
He is square-jawed.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.570
He's wearing a victory wreath.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:19.250
There's nothing of the tired,
old Caesar that we saw before.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.750
And the legend is
Caesar Imperator,

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.330
Caesar the Victorious General.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:30.470
This is the one of the images
he wanted the Romans to conceive

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.550
of himself.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:37.010
Caesar's brand is victory,
but not just any victory.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.412
It's victory won by
intelligence and speed.

00:28:40.412 --> 00:28:42.620
And he comes up with one of
the most famous marketing

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.720
slogans in history--

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.660
veni, vidi, vici--

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.850
I came, I saw, I conquered.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.340
He displays it in a
triumphal procession

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.020
through the heart
of Rome, which is

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.670
why I show this modern monument,
the Wedding Cake, as it's

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:05.050
sometimes called, the Altar
of the Fatherland in Italian.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.180
You see the chariot
there on top.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.490
And this monument stands on
the Capitoline Hill in Rome,

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.000
which is where Caesar's
triumphal procession would

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.100
have ended up.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.590
I came, I saw, I conquered.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:22.300
It's meant to be so
brief as to symbolize

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.190
the speed of Caesar's victory.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.720
So Caesar was fighting a
rebel in what is today Turkey.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.460
The father of this
rebel had been

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.260
one of the most problematic
enemies the Romans had ever

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:33.760
fought.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.460
And it took them two
decades to defeat him.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.930
Caesar defeats this
guy in one day.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.370
And that's what he wants
everybody to remember.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.410
I came, I saw, I conquered.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.890
And indeed, his speed had
been one of his trademarks

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.690
throughout his military career.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.584
He wants to terrify people
into accepting his power.

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:57.250
The funny thing about it is that
in addition to being a general,

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.470
Caesar is also a politician.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:04.720
And as a politician, he
is the ancient equivalent

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.610
of a populist--

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.100
not entirely a populist.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.040
He's certainly not
a man of the people.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.490
As one of my colleagues
put it, Caesar neither

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.190
was nor is lovable.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.710
He was very much an aristocrat.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.860
And yet he built
his political career

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:30.420
on giving benefits to the
ordinary people of Rome,

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.910
of listening to the
ordinary people of Rome

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.040
and speaking to their needs.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.030
So in that sense, he very
much was a populist as well as

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.730
being someone who
moved with great speed.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.630
There are other
aspects in which Caesar

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.190
showed his care for ordinary
people besides his populism.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:31:00.440
As a commander, he paid great
attention to the captains

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.430
in his army.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.290
The senior officers
of the Roman army

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.870
were mostly there because
they were aristocrats,

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.620
they were nobles, and they
got these positions from pull.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.300
The only reliable professional
officers in the Roman army

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.290
were the captains,
or the centurions,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.591
as the Romans called them.

00:31:16.591 --> 00:31:18.590
These were people who
came from the middle class

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.720
or the upper middle class.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.270
And Caesar paid them a
great deal of attention.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.200
Unlike other Roman generals,
he listened to the centurions

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.650
and what they had to say.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.920
He welcomed them to
his councils of war.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.720
He gave them a
seat at the table.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.090
When Caesar writes
his famous propaganda

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.970
books about his wars, the
commentaries on the Gallic Wars

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.890
and the commentaries
on the Civil War,

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.110
he foregrounds the centurions.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.059
In some ways, they were
the heroes of the show.

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:46.850
And they show how much
they think of Caesar

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:51.230
by later on offering him a
loan when he's very hard up

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.660
for funds.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.760
Another way in which
Caesar shows his concern

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.910
for ordinary soldiers is he
honors them by calling them

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.050
fellow soldiers.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.930
It may seem a small
thing, fellow soldiers.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.570
But no Roman general had
ever done that before.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.430
They always called
them soldiers.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.530
He calls them fellow soldiers,
as if he were one of them.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.810
And he certainly rewards
them financially.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.830
He offers them enormous riches.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.270
An ordinary legionary,
an ordinary soldier,

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.720
would get a bonus that was
2,500% of his annual wages.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.460
A captain would
get a bonus that's

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.980
5,000% of his annual wages.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.750
A colonel would get
a bonus that was

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.750
10,000% of his annual wages.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:36.260
And as for the highest
officers, their benefits

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.510
were entirely off the charts.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.540
That a sort of benefit
that encouraged people

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.410
to stay with Caesar
for a long time.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:52.160
Again, if he's not a man
who was naturally lovable,

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.490
he yet was able to inspire
friendship, sometimes

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.420
by little gestures.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.870
For instance, once on campaign,
one of Caesar's friends

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.480
was in very poor health.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.890
They came to a place
to spend the night.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.480
It was a small house, really
a hut with a front porch.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.600
And Caesar insisted that his
friend stay inside the house

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.760
because he wasn't doing
well, whereas Caesar

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.070
slept on the front porch.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.370
After his assassination,
one of Caesar's friends

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:24.650
wrote in a letter, "I
didn't follow the cause--"

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.680
in supporting Caesar--

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.210
"I didn't follow the cause.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.160
I followed the man.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.370
And I followed him
because he was my friend."

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.300
So Caesar was able
to inspire loyalty.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:45.120
Caesar also did a very good job
in building a military culture

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.440
that inspired and rewarded
individual initiative.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.190
It might seem paradoxical
that someone like Caesar--

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.680
who became a
dictator, after all--

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.710
Rome's first and only
dictator for life--

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.820
that someone like
that should inspire

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.280
in his individual
initiative, and yet he did.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.130
And I want to read you a short
selection from his commentaries

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.239
on the Gallic Wars.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.500
This is from a battle at the
beginning of the war, battle

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.610
in what is now in
Northeastern France,

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.429
when the Gauls suddenly
ambushed the Romans,

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.500
and they threatened to
conquer the Romans, who

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.120
were unprepared for them.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.520
And Caesar tells the story--

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.920
typical Caesar
style-- he foregrounds

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.449
his own contribution.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:32.130
And yet, as we'll see,
more complicated than that.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.219
He says, I had to do
everything at once--

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:38.190
hoist the flag that was the
signal for running to arms,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.110
sound the trumpet,
recall the men

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.120
from their work on
the fortifications,

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.610
bring back the men who had
gone further afield in search

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.949
of material for the
rampart, get the troops

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:49.170
into battle formation,
address the men,

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.630
give the signal for attack.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:55.170
There was no time to
do most of these things

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.420
because the enemy
was almost on us.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.220
But in this very
difficult situation,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.690
two things helped us--

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.810
first, the knowledge and
experience of the soldiers.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.499
Their training in
earlier battles

00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:07.290
meant that they could
decide for themselves

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.990
what had to be done
without waiting to be told.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:14.160
Second, the order I had given
to all the legionary commanders

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.050
that they must stay
with their legions

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:18.870
and not leave the work until
the fortification of our camp

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.310
was completed.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.850
Because the enemy was so close
in advancing at such speed,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.940
the commanders of the legions
did not wait for further orders

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:33.740
from me, but did what seemed
best on their own initiative.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.840
Now, if Caesar--
after he had conquered

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.280
Rome, if Caesar had remembered
to consult ordinary people,

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:48.770
and if Caesar had remembered
his background in associating

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:53.330
with others outside of his
class and not simply looking

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.700
at himself, he
might have avoided

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.420
his fate of being assassinated.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.240
But he did not.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.760
And fairly or
unfairly, the Romans

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.560
blame Caesar's fate, in
part, on this person, who

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.790
will be the last person
we'll look at today,

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.180
and that is Cleopatra.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.340
Now, Cleopatra was
queen of Egypt,

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.550
but she was also the
mistress of Julius Caesar.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:26.850
Julius Caesar had a very
active extracurricular life,

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:32.550
but none was more famous of his
various loves than Cleopatra.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.750
Here we see two busts
of them in Berlin.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.140
And if you look more closely
at the bust of Cleopatra--

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:46.540
this is one of the images that
she presented of herself--

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.300
it's actually quite
important because it

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.260
makes her look like a Greek
woman or a Roman woman.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.380
It's kind of a standard
image of the time.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.100
But her hairstyle
is very striking.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.640
If you noticed, her hair
is pulled back in a bun

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.350
at the nape of her neck.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:09.670
And in the front, she has
ringlets on her forehead.

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.850
This is a style that swept Rome.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:16.050
It became one of the most
popular hairstyles of the day--

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.580
so much so that--

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:23.250
as I said, she becomes
an enemy of Octavian--

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.890
so much so that Octavian's
sister and his wife developed

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:30.700
their own counter-hairstyle
to oppose to Cleopatra's.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.210
She's also wearing
the Ribbon of Royalty.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.720
You can see it around her head.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.120
The ancients wore ribbons
rather than crowns.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.840
She looks like a
very serious person.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.700
She is attractive, but
perhaps not beautiful.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.460
Here's another
image of Cleopatra.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.560
This is a coin image.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.990
The hairstyle is
similar, and she is

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:58.980
wearing the Ribbon of Royalty.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.760
But in this image,
she's projecting

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.210
an image that is certainly not
one of conventional beauty.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:12.600
In fact, as you can see, she's
got a prominent nose and also

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.790
a very prominent chin.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:19.680
And on her neck, she might have
a goiter, the site of a thyroid

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.210
condition.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.120
She certainly could have
presented herself more

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.770
attractively if she had wanted.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.110
Why did she do it this way?

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.690
Possibly because this is
what she really looked like

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.550
and she wanted people
to recognize her,

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.310
but possibly because
she wanted to recall

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:38.970
images of her father, who
had been king of Egypt.

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.040
And she wanted to
say, in effect,

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.320
I am my father's daughter.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:47.530
Although it is not usual for the
ruler of Egypt to be a woman,

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.510
I'm entirely up to the job and
no less capable than any man.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.960
Now, as I said,
Cleopatra was extremely

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:05.310
intelligent and capable of
doing things differently.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.700
She is the first and
only ruler of Egypt

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.440
that we know of-- first and
only Greek ruler of Egypt--

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.480
who spoke Egyptian.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.594
She's the only one to do so.

00:39:15.594 --> 00:39:17.010
She certainly
wasn't the first who

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.510
knew how important
it was to appeal

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.230
to her Egyptian subjects.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.100
But she went the extra step.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.620
And I want to symbolize
that in this slide.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:31.240
This is also an
image of Cleopatra.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.750
Cleopatra-- this is
the Temple of Dendera

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:35.950
on the wall of the temple.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.870
And he or she is with her son.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.290
And as you can see,
Cleopatra shows herself

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.080
as very much an Egyptian woman.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.250
She's not Greek.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.390
She's not Roman.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:51.070
She is Egyptian-- appealing
to her Egyptian subjects

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:53.710
and in a traditional
Egyptian pose.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.440
This might have come
from the Pharonic period.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.940
And she she's with her son.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.920
Now, this is not an accident.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:07.190
Her son is co-ruler with
her as Ptolemy the 15th.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:10.550
That's the typical name of
the males of the dynasty.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.970
But he also has a
nickname, and his nickname

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:18.390
is Caesarion, which
means little Caesar,

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:24.570
because she claimed that he
was Caesar's natural child.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:29.430
Now, for her to present
herself with her son, I think,

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:33.300
is a strategy that's
not uncommon for women

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.800
leaders in the ancient world.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.770
Certainly in the Roman
and the Egyptian world,

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:42.720
it's very difficult for a woman
to exercise power on her own

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.890
without having at least
symbols of male authority

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:48.180
where she can work with.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.400
Very common in the Roman
Empire, for instance.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.020
There are a series of
quite powerful women.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.810
But they almost always
work through a man,

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.520
and ideally through their son.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.750
In fact, there is a
great unwritten book

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.760
on Roman mothers and their sons.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.407
Certainly there's work
been done on Roman mothers,

00:41:08.407 --> 00:41:09.990
but I think there's
more to appreciate

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:15.180
just how close the mother-son
tie was in the Roman world

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.700
and how important
it was to power.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.340
Caesar himself had a mother
of whom we know little.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.350
Her name is Aurelia Cotta.

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.960
But she was a byword
for the Romans

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.220
of a mother who had
raised her son well

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.710
and had succeeded
in his education.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:36.960
It's not at all surprising
that Cleopatra presents herself

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:44.160
in this way, with her son as
a way of making her subjects

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.960
see her as someone of
great authority and someone

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:54.760
who buttresses herself
with her son's image.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.510
Cleopatra, alas, is also
not successful in the end.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:05.860
Her attempt to work with Antony
to defeat their enemies in Rome

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.470
fails.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.550
They are defeated at the
Naval Battle of Actium,

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:13.180
and she and Antony each
have to commit suicide--

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.660
romantically but tragically,
for their point of view.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.021
So let me sum up what I have
to say about these leaders.

00:42:22.021 --> 00:42:23.770
What are the lessons
that we have learned,

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.680
and what can the takeaways be?

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.950
Well, I want to go back to the
point that I mentioned earlier.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.320
It's possible to
have leaders who are

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.080
both charismatic and caring.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:40.270
It's possible to have leaders
who are strong but humble.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:45.190
And I would suggest that
with Alexander, Hannibal,

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:50.770
and Caesar, and with
Cleopatra, we have just this.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.480
They're strong,
they're intelligent,

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.940
they're personable, they're
passionate, they're energetic,

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.940
they are communicators
who have simple,

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.800
identifiable, compelling
brands and persuasive messages.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.500
And yet they also
lead by example.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.440
They share hardships.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.950
They minimize the risks
of their best people.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:19.030
They build a sense of community
and individual initiative.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:24.237
And finally, they offer
outstanding benefits.

00:43:24.237 --> 00:43:26.320
I hope those are the lessons
that you'll take away

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.010
from this look at these great
leaders of the ancient world.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.396
Thank you.

00:43:31.396 --> 00:43:33.886
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.580
PRESENTER: Question for you.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.330
So you mentioned that
a lot of the leaders

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:41.425
had a really innovative,
disruptive paradigms

00:43:41.425 --> 00:43:43.400
and approaches to
their strategy.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.300
What lessons can we take away
from any common qualities that

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.070
allowed for them
to be so innovative

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:52.640
and yet so seemingly in
touch with their people?

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.460
BARRY STRAUSS: Yeah, that's
really a great question.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:59.090
I guess my first
answer is probably one

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.260
that maybe I shouldn't
think of as a teacher,

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.450
but not listening
to their teachers.

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:10.430
Alexander was famously taught
by Aristotle, the philosopher.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.550
And I think he
learned from Aristotle

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:17.150
how to think, but also
not to necessarily think--

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.140
not necessarily
reached the conclusions

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.100
that Aristotle
wanted him to reach.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.230
Aristotle was a great
thinker, but Aristotle

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:25.970
was quite an ethnic
chauvinist who

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.180
believed in the superiority
of Greek civilization

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.160
over any other civilization.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.920
He believed that Greeks
were fit to be freemen,

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.700
and people who lived in Western
Asia were fit to be slaves.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.960
Alexander didn't reach
that conclusion at all.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.610
In fact, he wanted to create
a new ruling group that mixed

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.770
Greeks with Iranians.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.990
So Aristotle wouldn't have
been pleased with that.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:52.280
So one thing that they share
is when you go to school

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.960
learn how to think, but not
necessarily what to think.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.710
And maybe that's one
lesson that we always

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:01.700
should be taking away-- looking
for the broader lessons,

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.071
looking for the paradigms
rather than the content.

00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:07.070
Looks like we have a
question from the audience.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:07.611
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:07.611 --> 00:45:09.220
Thanks for an interesting talk.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.360
I think I'd like to
work with Hannibal.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.120
He seemed the most interesting.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.970
One of the leaders around
Silicon Valley that's fairly

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:18.860
well known is Steve Jobs.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.070
Could you briefly compare
his leadership style

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.534
with that of the ancients?

00:45:24.534 --> 00:45:26.450
BARRY STRAUSS: Well,
thanks for that question.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:33.620
Steve Jobs has sometimes been
compared to Caesar, certainly

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:39.820
in his desire to build
something very big,

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:46.370
and also, I suppose,
in the sense

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:53.990
that he wasn't worried
about who he might offend.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:58.310
He certainly wasn't shy
about saying what he thought.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.226
Also, like any of
these commanders--

00:46:00.226 --> 00:46:01.850
I hope I haven't left
you with the idea

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.610
that these commanders
were nice folks,

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.160
because they were ruthless.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.660
And Steve Jobs was
certainly ruthless.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.210
But I think all
three of them-- what

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.350
they share with
Steve Jobs is there's

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:20.270
a visionary quality
to what they did.

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.430
I think that Caesar
in particular

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:26.660
understood that the Roman
Republic was simply incapable

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.340
of dealing with
the Roman Empire.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:32.030
The Romans had conquered
maybe 50 million people

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:33.720
at this point in history.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.290
And yet the defenders
of the republic

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.930
thought that a few hundred
families, descended

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.610
from the Roman
nobility, could go

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:44.060
on governing 50 million people
around the Mediterranean world

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.600
without sharing power in any
meaningful way with this wider

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.290
group.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:52.220
I think Caesar understood
that that was not acceptable

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.720
and that they really
needed to shift

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.970
the paradigm in massive ways.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.715
It's one of the reasons why
he was so controversial,

00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:01.640
and it's one of the reasons why
he gets killed-- because people

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.250
don't want to share power.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.400
Likewise, Caesar was
ahead of his time--

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.680
perhaps not in such a good
way-- in that he believed

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.670
that monarchy was really
the only way to run Rome,

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:16.730
and that the Republic, which
was kind of ruled by committee,

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.310
was not something
that can continue.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:23.300
Steve Jobs clearly is
also a visionary person.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.215
And like Caesar, I think
he saw that people--

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.990
he saw something that
people needed before they

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.480
knew they needed it.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.900
They shared that in common.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.360
But you asked about Hannibal.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.220
So a way in which Steve
Jobs is similar to Hannibal

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.490
is they both saw
themselves as liberators.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:46.100
They both saw themselves
who were freeing people

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.650
and who were going to create
a better world in that sense.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:51.950
Hannibal really didn't
want to destroy Rome.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:55.040
He had no intention of
burning Rome to the ground.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.970
He wanted the Romans to simply
agree to give up their power

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.540
and admit the fact
that they were beat

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.240
and that he had defeated them.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.030
So he wanted to--

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.240
he was not a destroyer.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.969
He saw himself as a builder.

00:48:10.969 --> 00:48:12.760
So maybe in that sense,
something in common

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.990
with Steve Jobs as well.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:17.220
PRESENTER: Question
for you on the brand

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.910
that seems so strong
for all of them.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.990
So this is obviously a
time before there was

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.989
widespread internet technology.

00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:24.780
And a couple of the
ways that you highlight

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.440
that they spread
their personal brand

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.430
was through and public artwork.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.820
Were there other techniques they
employed to get the word out

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.590
and recruit people
to their armies?

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.060
BARRY STRAUSS: Yes.

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.560
So great question.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.050
Cesar, again, is a really
good example of this,

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.830
because he writes these books--

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.810
the first campaign
books, if you will--

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.120
the commentaries on the
Gallic Wars and commentary

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.560
on the Civil War.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.200
And these books are
written as annual reports

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.390
that he sends home to Rome.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:57.530
And they are read
by people in public.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:00.830
And they are ways to
give certain messages--

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.200
one, that Caesar is
really doing great things

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.470
for the Roman people, two, that
Caesar is a friend of the Roman

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.530
people, and three, that you
don't want to mess with Caesar.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:13.260
These are the messages that
he's sending home in that way.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.160
Another way in which people
communicate their message

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.650
was through religion.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.580
Religion was very
important for all of them.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.680
Hannibal associating
himself with Hercules

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.800
before he goes on his
mission of conquest--

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.310
he goes to the Temple of
Hercules on the Atlantic Ocean,

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.620
and he lets it be
known that he's

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.830
in touch with Hercules himself
before he goes on that mission.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:40.610
He also has visions, and he lets
people know about his dreams

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.340
and visions everywhere he goes.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:48.870
So that is another way
to get the message out.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.630
PRESENTER: So some
of the companies

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:54.260
that we see more and more in the
modern era have a somewhat less

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.540
hierarchical structure,
especially in Silicon Valley,

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.460
and are considered
more flat, where

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.460
anyone can take and should
take leadership initiative.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.770
What comparisons would you
draw between the cultures

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.960
that they tried to
intentionally create?

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.300
Were they more or
less hierarchical?

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.557
Did it depend on the leader?

00:50:10.557 --> 00:50:11.390
BARRY STRAUSS: Yeah.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.920
Obviously, there's
a long, long way

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.170
from these armies
to Silicon Valley.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:20.384
But the one way in which I think
there is something similar--

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:21.800
particularly,
again, with Caesar--

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.880
is the attempt to reach
outside of the narrow circles

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.050
of the senior officers to
find out what should be done.

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:32.090
It was really very unusual
for the commanding officer

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.460
to say I want to
take these captains,

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.760
and I want them to
be in the meeting

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.800
when we decide what to do.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.660
That really is very unusual.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.940
And then to write
books in which he

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.780
advertises to people that
he's talking to the captains--

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.230
again, that is a very
unusual thing to do.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.050
Caesar's own style
was not particularly

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.750
approachable or personable.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:01.130
But in practice,
in his own way, he

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:04.640
was reaching out to a much
wider group of people.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:11.180
Likewise, Caesar, in
terms of his advisors,

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:15.290
he's reaching outside of the
usual circle of the Roman

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.250
nobility.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.890
He's consulting foreigners,
and he brings them

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.500
into his inner
circle, or people who

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.170
were foreigners who had been
given the Roman citizenship.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:26.030
Because Romans did that.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:28.730
And he makes them some
of his chief advisers.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.130
This is shocking
to traditionalists,

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:34.700
but it is a way in which he's
flattening his organization

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.680
just a little bit.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.490
Alexander also is reaching
out to foreigners.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:43.790
He's horrifying
traditionalists from Macedon

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:45.890
who are saying, hey,
we thought that we

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.270
were going to be the rulers.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.070
What does this mean
that you are talking

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:50.720
to people who we've conquered?

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.580
And Alexander marries women
among the conquered people.

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.850
And that's also a way in which
he's reaching out and shocking

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.532
and horrifying his followers.

00:52:00.532 --> 00:52:02.990
PRESENTER: Sounds like they
were disruptive for their time.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.590
BARRY STRAUSS: They
were definitely

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:04.730
disruptive for their time.

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.188
PRESENTER: One last
question, then.

00:52:06.188 --> 00:52:09.230
You mentioned that they had,
obviously, their qualities that

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.150
allowed them to inspire
followership, and be

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:14.180
great leaders, and have
very impressive victories

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.630
and conquests in
multiethnic armies.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.130
Talk a little bit
about the lessons

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.020
that we can derive
from blind spots

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.200
and when the victory
goes to the head.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.930
How do you avoid
that as a leader?

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:31.970
BARRY STRAUSS: Well,
the Romans had a custom.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:35.560
When a leader would
win a great victory,

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.370
he would march in a
triumphal procession

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.890
through the streets
of Rome in a chariot.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.220
And there would always
be someone behind him

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:47.000
whose job it was to say
to him, remember to die.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.070
Remember you are a mortal.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:54.650
So I think that one of the
things a leader really needs

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.810
is people who can
say that to him,

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:59.210
trustworthy people
who can say you're not

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.520
as great as you think you are.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.660
And that's a really
difficult thing to do.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.230
I'd say that each
of these leaders--

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:07.700
the one way in
which they failed is

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.130
they all had troubled
relationships with their number

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:11.330
two.

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:13.487
None of them had a number two--

00:53:13.487 --> 00:53:16.070
none of them had a really good
relationship with a number two.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.260
And often, that
is the thing that

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:22.820
will save leaders-- to have
someone trustworthy who

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.800
can tell them that very thing.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.294
I think that's one of
the problems they have.

00:53:27.294 --> 00:53:28.460
PRESENTER: Very fascinating.

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:29.700
Thank you so much.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.512
Please join me in
thanking Barry Strauss

00:53:31.512 --> 00:53:32.720
for being here with us today.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.670
And hopefully, we
can all take away

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.100
some interesting food for
thought for the rest of our day

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:37.390
here.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.990
BARRY STRAUSS: Thank you.

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.590
PRESENTER: Thank you.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:39.923
BARRY STRAUSS: Thanks, everyone.

00:53:39.923 --> 00:53:42.240
