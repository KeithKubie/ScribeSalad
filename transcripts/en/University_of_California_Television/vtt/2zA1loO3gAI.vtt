- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language. But
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

- [Steven] So this is a slide of some
representative fossils from about 2.8

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.450
million to 1.4 million years ago that have
been attributed to the genus Homo. And by

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.220
now you should have a pretty good idea
that we're looking at a morphologically

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.560
very diverse group of fossils. And there's
a lot of discussion about what we make of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.600
that diversity. How many species are
represented? Which specimens go in which

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.920
species? How do we sort this all out? And
by the time that we get to specimens that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.850
we're quite sure are Homo erectus it's not
really clear how we can trace the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.160
ancestry. Which of these various groups
gave rise to Homo erectus? Recently

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.350
discovered fossils from South Africa have
really only kind of muddied the waters

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.530
even more. In 2010, we announced
Australopithecus sediba from roughly 2

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.830
million year old deposits of the site
called Malapa and last September we

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.790
announced Homo naledi from Rising Star.
Unfortunately, the site is currently

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.180
undated. We're working very, very hard to
try to get a date on the material, but we

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.450
do not yet know where it falls
chronologically and that makes it really,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.010
really difficult to understand its
evolutionary relationship to other groups.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.180
But what's interesting about these two
groups is that we now have got four

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.430
morphological groups, most of us would
call them species: Homo habilis, Homo

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.440
rudolfensis, Australopithecus sediba and
now Homo naleti which all share features

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.390
with later Homo and with Homo erectus.
They're all primitive in their own ways,

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.110
they all share derived features with Homo
erectus but they all have a different mix

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.000
and match of features and that's kind of
interesting. Again, it makes it difficult

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.630
to understand where Homo erectus came from
and that makes it difficult in turn to

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.980
figure out the evolutionary processes, the
adaptive shifts, etc. , which gave rise to

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.580
the genus Homo. When we announced
Australopithecus sediba, we were really

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.370
impressed by the number of features that
it seemed to share with later Homo and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.010
with Homo erectus. This is a list of some
of the more important features. A lot of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.180
these features are adaptively important
features and to us, our preferred

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.830
interpretation of this was that it meant
that sediba had an evolutionary

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.270
relationship with later Homo. We thought
that sediba was perhaps the Australopith

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.630
that had given rise to the genus Homo or a
close sister taxon to that group. A common

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.150
refrain from our colleagues in talking
about this was that the sediba was at the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.030
wrong place at the wrong time, have
anything to do with the ancestry of the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.670
genus Homo. Meaning, at 2 million years
it's already almost a million years later

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.700
than we're already starting to pick up
fossils of Homo in East Africa and

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.070
secondly there's sort of a general idea
that the origins of genus Homo occurred in

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.530
East Africa and here we've got a fossil
species down in southern Africa. So if in

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.180
fact sediba does not have anything to do
with the origins of the genus Homo, then

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.090
we can write off these lists of shared
features as homoplasy, as convergent

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.490
evolution. And as has already been
mentioned we know from the fossil record

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.080
that homoplasy is probably a very, very
common occurrence in evolutionary biology.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.060
So it's probably not unreasonable to
think, maybe in fact, sediba has nothing

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.920
to do with the origins of Homo and these
are just parallel traits that have evolved

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.820
because they were adapting to similar
environments and facing similar challenges

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.880
and experiencing similar selection
pressure. There might be another good

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.060
reason to discount the species from
southern Africa from the bigger picture of

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.900
the origins of the genus Homo and that
reason is that southern Africa is a center

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.030
of mammalian endemism. It is a place where
unique species, which are only found in

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.760
southern Africa, tend to crop up. If you
look, for instance, at historically known

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.900
fauna like the quagga, unfortunately now
extinct but known in historic times, you

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.730
find this only in South Africa whereas the
plain zebra, virtual zebra extends up and

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.760
down the eastern coast of Africa and over
large parts of the continent. Over much of

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.710
Africa you've got the blue wildebeest. In
South Africa you've got the black

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.780
wildebeest. Up in most of Africa you've
got Grant's and Thomson's gazelles. In the

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.910
same ecological niche in South Africa
you've got the springbok and the springbok

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.790
isn't even closely related to Grant's and
Thomson's gazelles. This is a beautiful

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.270
case of convergence, the kind of thing
that we're talking about here. And in fact

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.050
there are 90, 90 mammalian species which
are known only from within the political

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.940
boundaries of the Republic of South
Africa. So this is clearly a center of

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.640
mammalian endemism and the mechanism that
probably has been driving this over

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.370
evolutionary time is that as global
climate waxes and wanes, as the ice ages

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.790
come and go, during the cooler, dryer
periods it's thought that a grassland

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.620
Savanna belt probably extended from the
Ethiopian highlands down to the Kalahari

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.950
desert and allowed an avenue by which
these open country forms, like the ones

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:27.120
that you're looking at here, were able to
migrate between geographic regions in

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.670
Africa. But then during warmer, wetter
intervals, forest spells begin to break up

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.930
that Savanna belt and in fact the Ituri
Forest here probably forms a continuous

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.750
forest with the lowlands of Mozambique and
that isolates smaller populations of these

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:50.370
open country forms in South Africa where
they diverge. If that's the case, then

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:56.330
perhaps Australopithecus afarensis appear
with sort of the pan-African wider

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:02.360
distributed version of an Australopith and
Australopithecus africanus down here was

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.830
the southern Africa endemic form of an
Australopith and likewise maybe

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:11.290
Australopithecus sediba and now Homo
naledi are just South African endemics

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.460
that have got very little to do with the
origins of genus Homo and the bigger

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.460
picture of human evolution.
Jonathan Kingdon, in his book "Island

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:27.580
Africa," talked about this when he said
that the centers of endemism because

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:33.390
unique species crop up there we tend to
think of them as evolutionary scrapyards,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:39.390
as places where species originate and then
die without issue. So my goal today is to

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.780
convince you that southern Africa is not
an evolutionary scrapyard, but in fact is

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.490
important to the bigger picture of
biodiversity on the African continent and

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.290
also to say that maybe from a southern
African perspective, it might give us a

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.930
little bit of perspective on where Homo
erectus comes from. So I'm going to begin

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.630
by talking about these three antelopes.
This is the blue wildebeest up here, the

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.520
eland down here and the impala here. Based
on morphological evidence in the case of

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.830
the impala and molecular evidence for
these two antelopes, it's been argued that

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.780
in relatively recent evolutionary history,
within about the last 200,000 years, their

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.290
East African forms probably experienced
extirpation, they went locally extinct in

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.910
East Africa, and there was a repopulation
event from a South African refugium. So

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.750
these give us three examples of recent
African mammals which have spread from

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:40.680
southern Africa back into East Africa and
into a broader range in Africa. And the

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.900
wildebeest in particular is a member of a
tribe called the alcelaphines and the

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.470
fossil evidence suggests that the
alcelaphines are themselves a South

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.980
African endemic which originated about 7
million years ago and which now has a

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.640
distribution over much of Africa. The
quagga is also another really interesting

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.430
example. In the early days, well for most
of the time that we've known about the

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:09.740
quagga, it was put into its own species,
equus quagga and considered to be a

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:15.100
different species from the plains zebra,
equus burchelli. Plains zebras are

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:22.450
distributed from southern to northern
Africa as a series of subspecies from

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.760
burchell zebra down here in the south all
the way up to mainland zebra up here in

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.540
the northern part of Africa but DNA work
done on museum-preserved skins of the

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.420
quagga have strongly suggested that it is
in fact just a subspecies of the plains

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.120
zebra. So here we've got a southern
African endemic and one which at least in

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:51.950
terms of its pellage is quite distinct
from other zebras which is at least part

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.280
of a gene flow across the African
continent; and then of course there's

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.600
baboons. Cliff Jolly has long argued that
baboons make sort of a good model for

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.510
understanding human evolution and both
molecular and fossil data suggests that

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:12.410
modern baboons, of the genus Papio,
originated in southern Africa probably

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:20.000
like something from Papio angusticeps or
Papio ursinus or something like that and

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.990
they expanded up the Savanna corridor and
expanded into the Ethiopian highlands and

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:32.120
across the north of the Ituri Forest all
the way to West Africa. And then later as

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.590
the climate got warmer and wetter, that
those forest belts broke up, these groups

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:43.610
became isolated and they diverged into the
five species of Papio that we recognize

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.460
today. Not everybody recognizes them as
species and I'll come back to that in a

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.530
minute. So here's another example of a
possible South African endemic which is

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:58.020
now found with a widespread distribution
across southern Africa; but what about the

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.660
diversity that we see in the early Homo
fossil record? The diversity is important

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.440
because we've got to figure out what it
means. Does that mean that we're looking

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.420
at different species? And in fact this
specimen right here is kind of very

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.660
important to the argument. This is a
maxilla which dates to about 1.44 million

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.170
years old and is morphologically very
similar to specimens which have been put

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.850
into Homo habilis. And there are some
people who suggested, because we're

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:32.790
finding this morphological diversity early
in time like at 1.9 million and closer to

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:38.370
1.4 million, that these groups remained
morphologically distinct for long periods

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:43.060
of times, for half a million years. And
that suggests to some people that they

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:50.910
were good biological species, that they
were not exchanging genes across species

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:56.940
boundaries and that has big implications
for the nature of competition and the

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:02.330
nature of the evolution of adaptive traits
in early Homo. Well, again, if we go back

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.880
to some of these southern African
endemics, I think they give us a little

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.980
bit of a perspective on this. So if we
again look at the quagga, what's

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:18.800
interesting is that in a study done by
Richard Kline and Kathy Cruz-Uribe back in

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:25.880
1999 they showed that the skulls of the
quagga is as distinct from the skull of

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.650
the plains zebra, and remember these two
are considered now to be a subspecies of

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:38.720
the same species as the plains zebra is
from the Cape Mountain zebra. We know from

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.810
genetic evidence of the Cape Mountain
zebra and the plain zebra probably

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:47.860
diverged from one another close to 3
million years ago. So this is a case where

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:55.660
despite being connected by gene flow,
these two morphological groups have

00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:01.420
remained distinct probably helped out a
bit by isolation, by distance, a bit by

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:10.170
some patterns or some repeated periods of
allopatry, where they got separated into

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:15.100
geographically distinct populations, but a
single species which is remaining

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.781
morphologically distinct over a period of
time.

00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:23.720
And again if we go back to the baboons,
they present a really interesting case.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:30.600
Some work that was done on mitochondrial
variation in the five baboon species found

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:37.620
that the mitochondrial genome sorted into
haplogroups, but that there was not good

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.730
phylogeographic structure to the
haplogroups; that they were a bit of a

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:47.500
mess and that you got some yellow baboons
mixed in with olive baboons and these

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.560
Anubis baboons in the middle of these
olive baboons, etc, etc. And the

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.210
geneticists, and there have been a number
of studies both on nuclear DNA and

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:02.510
mitochondrial DNA which comes to the same
conclusion, baboon genetics are a mess

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.850
because they appear to have a history of
hybridization and introgression of genes

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.940
passing between species boundaries and a
lot of people would prefer to put these

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.850
five baboons into a single species because
they do, in fact, interbreed quite freely

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:21.020
where they meet at hybrid zones. Other
people prefer to consider them a super

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:26.960
species with five distinct groups. So this
looks like a good example of a reticulate

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:33.800
species of some organisms which dispersed
across a geographic space, became more or

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.510
less isolated, diverged in their
morphology, their pellage, their behavior

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:44.190
etc, and then came back together before
that reproductive isolation was complete.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.530
We know on average for large bodied
mammals, excluding some kind of accident

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:54.010
like the Oxalic acid that Pascal was
talking about we know that on average it

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.500
takes about 5 million years for large
bodied mammalian species to really become

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.660
reproductively isolated from one another.
But what's great about these baboons,

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.730
before I say what's great about them,
there's a second thing that's great about

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:13.860
them and that is the olive baboon. I think
he's the coolest baboon going because the

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:19.170
genetic evidence suggests that first off
the olive baboons originated as a hybrid

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:25.850
species in the contact zone between the
hamadryad baboons up here and the yellow

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:31.260
baboons here and that they were sort of
almost like a super baboon. They were

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.840
adaptively very competent and their range
expanded across the northern part of

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.750
Africa and they probably swallowed up
smaller pockets of baboons across that

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:47.230
range. And they basically, through
interbreeding with them, were able to

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:52.880
capture some of the genetic variations and
possibly adaptive traits from those local

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.830
populations of the baboons. So that's
really cool. But the other thing is that

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:03.280
we're looking at here at a species which
over 2 million years has had a history of

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.100
maybe diverging for a while and then maybe
coming back together and exchanging genes,

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:14.430
yet their cranial morphology remains
diagnosable. To somebody like Stephen

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.680
Frost, he can tell you, if you give him an
isolated baboon skull, whether he's

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.530
looking at an olive baboon or a chacma
baboon or yellow or Anubis. And so my

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:29.970
point here is that the morphological
diversity that we see in the early Homo

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:36.530
record, I do not think we can take that as
evidence of reproductive isolation. It's

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.250
interesting and it's interesting that it's
persisting for a long time but I don't

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.940
think that we can take it as evidence of
reproductive isolation. This is some work

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.080
that was done by Maislin and colleagues
published a couple years ago and they were

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:57.140
pointing out that in East Africa you have
these events which are driven by global

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.880
climatic events where the lakes in the
African Rift Valley filled up and got very

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.410
deep and they're indicated by these blue
bars here which are passing across and

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:14.500
they noted that after one of these events
we often pick up more diversity in the

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.710
hominin fossil records and so these are
hominin species over here on the

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.820
right-hand side and this suggests to me
that early hominins were probably relative

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.720
stenotopic, meaning they had narrow
habitat preferences. They were likely

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.990
Savanna adapted and when Savanna belts
broke up during weather conditions when

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.880
these lakes were filling up they became
relatively isolated and then after those

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:47.470
events we pick up new species because
we're recognizing new diversity in the

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:53.250
fossil record. But I don't think Homo
erectus is stenotopic. I mean Homo erectus

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.870
we pick him up in the Republic of Georgia
and very quickly after that they're

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:04.000
expanding into the far reaches of Asia and
that kind of thing and it makes me wonder

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.960
if Homo erectus is sort of analogous to
the olive baboon, like a super hominid it

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.530
originates out of one of these groups and
may be just because it just sort of struck

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.840
on some adaptive strategy which gave it a
wider habitat tolerance, it spread more

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.140
and it encountered other groups and
interbred with them and maybe absorbed

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.410
some of the adaptive features. And if this
is the case, then these groups out here

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:34.400
which we consider separate species and I
still prefer to do that although again I

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.670
argue it doesn't mean that they're
reproductively isolated, this is why we

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.270
might be seeing a pattern where they all
share different features with Homo erectus

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.870
and we may not, in fact, ever be able to
identify a single ancestor of Homo

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:54.400
erectus. And I think the challenge before
us is to begin to imagine new models how

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.730
do we deal with reticulate pieces. Dan
Lieberman has even talked about how we

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:03.240
don't really even have any methods for
recognizing hybridization even in F1

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.870
generations in the direct hybrids. And so
I think this is the challenge for us, is

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:14.298
to sort of figure out how we might be able
to develop and test these models.

00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:16.179
Thank you very much
