00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
We'll now learn about what is
arguably the most useful

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.860
concept in finance, and that's
called the present value.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.220
And if you know the present
value, then it's very easy to

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.620
understand the net present value
and the discounted cash

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.570
flow and the internal
rate of return.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.200
And we'll eventually learn
all of those things.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.340
But the present value.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.170
What does that mean?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.580
Present value.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.910
So let's do a little exercise.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.090
I could pay you $100 today.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:41.470
So let's say today, I
could pay you $100.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:50.690
Or, and it's up to you, in one
year I will pay you-- I don't

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.010
know-- let's say in a year
I agree to pay you $110.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.840
And my question to you-- and
this is a fundamental question

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.930
of finance, everything will
build upon this-- is which one

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.490
would you prefer?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.580
And this is guaranteed.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.490
I guarantee you.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.800
I'm either going to pay you
$100 today, and there's no

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.980
risk, even if I get hit by
a truck or whatever.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.010
This is going to happen.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.630
The U.S. government, if the
earth exists, we will pay you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.740
$110 in one year.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.010
It is guaranteed.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.780
So there's no risk here.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.060
So it's just the notion of
you're definitely going to get

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.740
$100 today in your hand, or
you're definitely going to get

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.910
$110 one year from now.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.390
So how do you compare the two?

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.780
And this is where present
value comes in.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.940
What if there were a way to
say, well what is $110, a

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.570
guaranteed $110,
in the future?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.930
What if there were a way
to say, how much

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.690
is that worth today?

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.630
How much is that worth
in today's terms?

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.360
So let's do a little
thought experiment.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.120
Let's say that you could
put money in the bank.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.220
And these days banks
are kind of risky.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.350
But let's say you could
put it in the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.010
safest bank in the world.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.630
Let's say you , although someone
would debate, you put

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.199
it in government treasuries.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.360
Which are considered risk-free,
because the U.S.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930
government, the Treasury,
can always

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.610
indirectly print more money.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.460
We'll one day do a whole thing
on the money supply.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.380
But at the end of the day, the
U.S. government has the rights

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.040
on the printing press,
et cetera.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.180
It's more complicated
than that.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.100
But for those purposes, we
assume that with the U.S.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.740
Treasury, which essentially is
you're lending money to the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.330
U.S. government, that
it's risk-free.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.970
So let's say today I could give
you $100 and that you

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.510
could invest it at
5% risk-free.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.920
And then in a year from now,
how much would that

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.170
be worth, in a year?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.520
That would be worth
$105 in one year.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.240
Actually let me write
the $110 over here.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.270
So this was a good way
of thinking about it.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.840
You're like, OK, instead of
taking the money from Sal a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.780
year from now and getting $110,
if I were to take $100

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.910
today and put it in something
risk-free, in a year

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.940
I would have $105.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.020
So assuming I don't have to
spend the money today, this is

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.820
a better situation
to be in, right?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.200
If I take the money today, and
risk-free invest it at 5%, I'm

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.610
going to end up with
$105 in a year.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.990
Instead, if you just tell me,
Sal, just give me the money in

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.520
a year-- give me $110-- you're
going to end up with more

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.080
money in a year, right?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.490
You're going to end
up with $110.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.950
And that is actually the right
way to think about it.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.060
And remember, and I keep saying
it over and over again,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.330
everything I'm talking about,
it's critical that we're

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.760
talking about risk-free.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.400
Once you introduce risk, then
we have to start introducing

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.590
different interest rates
and probabilities.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.560
And we'll get to that
eventually.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.880
But I want to just give the
purest example right now.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.050
So already you've made
the decision.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.800
But we still don't know what
the present value was.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.320
So to some degree when you took
this $100 and you said

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.110
well if I lend it to the
government, or if I lend it to

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.000
a risk-free bank at 5%, in a
year they'll give me $105.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.750
This $105 is a way of saying
what is the one-year value of

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.339
$100 today?

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.810
What is the one-year-out
value of $100 today?

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.140
So what if we wanted to go
in the other direction?

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.040
If we have a certain amount of
money and we want to figure

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.450
out today's value,
what could we do?

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.720
Well, to go from here to
here, what did we do?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.250
We essentially took $100 and we
multiplied by- what did we

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.760
multiply by-- 1 plus 5%.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.230
So that's 1.05.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.170
So to go the other way, to say
how much money, if I were to

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.120
grow it by 5%, would
end up being $110?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.430
We'll just divide by 1.05.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.085
And then we will get
the present value.

00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:06.220
And the notation is PV.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:20.180
We'll get the present value
of $110 a year from now.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:30.030
So the present value of $110,
let's say in 2009.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.240
It's currently 2008.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.430
I don't know what year you're
watching this video in.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.750
Hopefully people will
be watching

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.910
this in the next millennia.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.250
But the present value of $110
in 2009, assuming right now

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:54.270
it's 2008, a year from now, is
equal to $110 divided by 1.05.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.980
And let's take out this
calculator, which is probably

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.660
overkill for this problem.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.630
Let me clear everything.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:14.740
OK so I want to do 110 divided
by 1.05 is equal to-- let's

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:25.120
just round-- so it
equals $104.76.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.580
So the present value of $110 a
year from now, if we assume

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.780
that we could invest money
risk-free at 5%, if we were to

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.460
get it today -- let me do it in
a different color just to

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.460
fight the monotony--
the present

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.760
value is equal to $104.76.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.180
Another way to kind of just talk
about this is to get the

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.430
present value of $110 a year
from now, we discounted the

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.690
value by a discount rate.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.830
And the discount rate is this.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.440
Right here we grew the money by,
you could say, our yield.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.600
A 5% yield or our interest.
Here we're discounting the

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.270
money, because we're going
backwards in time.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.190
We're going from year-out
to the present.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.650
And so this is our yield.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.330
To compound the amount of money
we invest, we multiply

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.650
the amount we invest times
1 plus the yield.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.640
Then to discount money in the
future to the present, we

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.490
divided by 1 plus the discount
rate-- so this is a 5%

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:39.000
discount rate-- to get
its present value.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So what does this tell us?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.960
This tells us if someone's
willing to pay $110, assuming

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.020
this 5%-- remember this is
a critical assumption.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.710
This tells us that if I tell
you I'm willing to pay you

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.650
$110 a year from now, and you
could get 5%-- so you could

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.750
kind of say that 5% is your
discount rate risk-free-- that

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.780
you should be willing to take
today's money, if today I'm

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.070
willing to give you more
than the present value.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.455
So if this comparison were-- let
me clear all of this, let

00:08:14.455 --> 00:08:24.920
me just scroll down-- so let's
say that today, 1 year.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.520
So we figured out that $110 a
year from now, its present

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:39.145
value is equal to-- so the
present value of that $110--

00:08:39.145 --> 00:08:46.260
is equal to $104.76.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.680
And that's because I used a 5%
discount rate, and that's a

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.360
key assumption.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.390
This is a dollar sign.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.310
I know it's hard to read.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:58.190
What this tells you is that,
if your choice was between

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:06.260
$110 a year from now and $100
today, you should take the

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.400
$110 a year from now.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.140
Why is that?

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.320
Because its present value
is worth more than $100.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.740
However, if I were to offer you
$110 a year from now or

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.790
$105 today.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.620
This, the $105 today, would
be the better choice.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.100
Because its present value ,
right, $105 today, you don't

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.890
have to discount it .

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.030
It's today.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.280
Its present value is itself.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.110
$105 today is worth more than
the present value of $110,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.710
which is $104.76.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.980
Another way to think about it
is, I could take this $105 to

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.760
the bank-- let's assume
I have a risk-free

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.440
bank-- get 5% on it.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.800
And then I would have-- what
would I end up with-- I'd end

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.870
up with 105 times 1.05.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.180
Equal to $110.25.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.890
So a year from now, I'd be
better off by $0.25.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.980
And I'd have the joy of being
able to touch my money for a

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.840
year, which is hard to quantify,
so we leave out of

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.680
the equation.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.730
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
