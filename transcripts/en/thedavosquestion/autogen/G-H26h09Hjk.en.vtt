which don't take into account that the
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.750
which don't take into account that the
core problem which were facing around

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
core problem which were facing around
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970
core problem which were facing around
the world today is that there's a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
the world today is that there's a
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.620

it is these these are the causes of the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
it is these these are the causes of the
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.690
it is these these are the causes of the
problems we have in terms of security

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700
problems we have in terms of security
 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.920

these are the problems which you have

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
these are the problems which you have
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.069
these are the problems which you have
with regard to the imbalances etc and I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
with regard to the imbalances etc and I
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.500
with regard to the imbalances etc and I
think what we need to realize is that we

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
think what we need to realize is that we
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600
think what we need to realize is that we
need to be able to impart a spirit of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
need to be able to impart a spirit of
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.689
need to be able to impart a spirit of
hope amongst our people whether it be an

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
hope amongst our people whether it be an
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.279

Africa whether it being the Middle East

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
Africa whether it being the Middle East
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560
Africa whether it being the Middle East
whether it be in Europe and if we would

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
whether it be in Europe and if we would
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.740
whether it be in Europe and if we would
have work together to realize to try to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
have work together to realize to try to
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.310
have work together to realize to try to
figure out how we can impart hope we can

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
figure out how we can impart hope we can
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.469
figure out how we can impart hope we can
we give impart a spirit that could give

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
we give impart a spirit that could give
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.429
we give impart a spirit that could give
people a sense there is a better being

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
people a sense there is a better being
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289
people a sense there is a better being
out there that there is a better life

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
out there that there is a better life
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.530
out there that there is a better life
and that they could equitably get to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
and that they could equitably get to
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.190
and that they could equitably get to
that life

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
that life
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.359
that life
I think this world would be a much

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
I think this world would be a much
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.580
I think this world would be a much
better place so I think the core spirit

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
better place so I think the core spirit
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.310
better place so I think the core spirit
of imparting hope on our people people

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
of imparting hope on our people people
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620
of imparting hope on our people people
of the world as a whole should be the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
of the world as a whole should be the
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.590
of the world as a whole should be the
fundamental basis behind redesigning

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
fundamental basis behind redesigning
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.980
fundamental basis behind redesigning
anything that we did we mean that we do

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
anything that we did we mean that we do
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.179
anything that we did we mean that we do
