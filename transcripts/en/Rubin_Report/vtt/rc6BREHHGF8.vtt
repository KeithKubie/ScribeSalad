WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.310
[inaudible] but you know that government is all obsessed by sex and gender.

2
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.300
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
The last budget,
you know,

3
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:16.790
that was a gender budget.
The,
the,
the,
I think I would,

4
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:18.450
what does that even mean by that?

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.840
Meaning they didn't have a lot of economic data in the budget.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.380
You supposed to be a budget,
supposed to have economy,
economic data,

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.120
and then have a lot of economic data.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.340
But I think the word gender was in the budget to be on good times.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.880
So,
and the F I will give you an example.

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.240
If you want to build a pipeline in Canada with the new bill c 69,

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.060
you need to do,
uh,

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.950
enter sectorial sex and gender analysis.

13
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.600
Don't ask me what that means and tell sexual,

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.640
sexual sectional sex and gender analysis that's in religious stations.

15
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
So the sex and gender to build a pipeline to build a pipeline.

16
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.310
A lot of people were talking about this when we were in Alberta,

17
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.830
the sex and gender expert.

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160
We'll look at the impact of building a pipeline in a rural community with man

19
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:19.680
and woman and Desex.
And so it's crazy.
It's a nonsense.
It's crazy.

20
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.130
So,
and this government is obsessed about that.

21
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.810
And I think that's why people are looking for an alternative.
So,

22
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:28.170
so a guy like Trudeau,

23
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.650
it's hard to judge what's really going on in someone's mind.

24
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.630
But do you think he really believes in the things that he's saying when it comes

25
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.470
to all of this gender stuff?

26
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.790
Or is it just that it always leads to bigger government and what he wants

27
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:44.400
fundamentally is bigger government because he wants more power.

28
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.660
He believes in state power.
Yeah.
So,
so that it's almost like it's a,

29
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.030
it's an ends.
The ends justify the means.

30
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.340
It's like you'll just say anything about gender and all these things.

31
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.810
I think he probably kind of believed them,

32
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
but at the end they just give him more power.
I think first of all,
he believe it.

33
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240
And I think also it's because he believed in a big government that will fix

34
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.770
every problem in our society.
Uh,
that's his philosophy.
And you know,

35
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:09.260
when he said that,
you know,
uh,

36
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.270
the Noaa Canada is no core identity or Canada is the first suppose national

37
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.510
state.
You know,
people that the,

38
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.050
the understanding Canada that we,
we are a nation.

39
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.810
We are all not the post nation state.
We are,

40
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.850
we have Canadian values and we share the western civilization values.

41
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.460
So for him is a little bit like his father,
you know,
uh,

42
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.560
the UN and the world is important and the mass immigration and open borders and

43
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:47.730
everybody,
everybody can come to Canada.
Uh,
that's what people,

44
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.470
they don't like that in Canada.

45
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.300
They want us to respect our immigration system and,

46
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:54.960
and having a sustainable immigration system.

47
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.010
So Trudeau adding wants to build a big government.

48
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.030
And at the end he believed in a supra and national government,
uh,
you know,

49
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.680
he,
uh,
he just signing in 2010,
uh,
with the UN,

50
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.300
there's the UN UN pa UN parliamentary assembly.

51
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.950
It's a,
it's a group that prolonged to promote a world government,

52
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.110
like the,
uh,
the EU parliament that will be able to,

53
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.280
uh,

54
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.280
write legislation that will be biding with and with the countries and they will

55
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.640
lost their sovereignty and to do in 2010,
uh,

56
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.900
promote that and believe in that.
So it's all about the UN.

57
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.901
It's not about the big government and that it's all about him trying to find the

58
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.520
right policies that will solve every problems.
But that's not the case.

59
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.190
Just less regulation,
more freedom.

60
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.210
You'll have more prosperity and then people are tired of that in Canada.

61
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.870
It almost strikes me as it's like a psychological condition more than anything

62
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.790
else.
It's just like sort of what,
like,

63
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.750
it's obvious to me that you believe in just that the individual can,
yeah.

64
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.050
To the best of their ability,
solve their problems,
not all of them,

65
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.820
but to the best of breed.
Absolutely.

66
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.510
And I think that this other set of people believe that,
I don't know.

67
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.390
I would view it as almost a very dim way of viewing humans.

68
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.550
That if we all weren't controlled,

69
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.390
that endless evil would spread everywhere or,
or something to that.

70
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.570
I think they believe that Canadians are children and you know,

71
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.530
most follow regulation and you,
but I trust,
you know,

72
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.010
I have faith in people I fade,
that they have the ability,

73
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.210
the dignity and the right to make their own decision and determine their own

74
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:41.740
destiny.
Uh,
that's important for us.
That's important for me.
And yes,
you can make,

75
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.030
you can make a mistake,

76
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.580
but you will be responsible of your success and your,
your,

77
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.120
your mistake if that's how you learn in a society.
Uh,

78
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.210
that's why,
you know,
uh,
uh,
speaking about that,

79
00:04:55.211 --> 00:05:00.211
people like me a little bit and then they're looking at Jordan Peterson and the

80
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:04.660
single Bernie a personal responsibility.
And Jordan also is his book.

81
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:08.680
It's all about that,
you know,
clean your,
your,
uh,
your room before I,

82
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.600
before cleaning the,
the world is so,
so be responsible of your action.

83
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.680
And that's what we want to do.
And that's what,
as a politician,
I want to,

84
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.930
I want to do,
well,
I mentioned it before we sat down,

85
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:23.050
but I may as well say it on camera that when I go to these events and with

86
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:25.480
Jordan and especially in the 12 or 15 we did in Canada,

87
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.240
I say something about Trudeau and the whole audience boos,

88
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.480
I say talking about you and the whole audience goes crazy.
So,

89
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.670
so something good is happening.
Um,
you've mentioned,
uh,
borders a couple of times.

90
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.140
This does seem to now be the hot one,
at least in the United States,

91
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.330
where we seem to be caught between either a wall or open borders and it's such

92
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:47.140
a,
it's not a real choice.
I don't think.
It's not a sensible choice.

93
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.990
And in one hand,
if you're for the wall,
they say you're racist.

94
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:53.860
If you say you're for open borders,
then you're an anarchist or whatever it is.

95
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.310
So what would be the right way to look at borders if you want to maintain your

96
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:00.030
national sovereignty?
Yeah,

97
00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:03.320
and that's the debate that we're having right now in Canada because as you know,

98
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.940
we have people who are crossing the border,
uh,

99
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.660
from the state of new or to Quebec.
And,
um,
the,
the,

100
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.500
they are asking to do,

101
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.360
they said that they are refugees and actually down that really refugees,

102
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:21.500
you know what?
Your life is not in danger in the state of New York.
Uh,

103
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:26.430
but that being said,
I think it is.
They didn't proceed.
Proceed.

104
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.890
Yeah.
But,
um,
but,
uh,
the last two years,

105
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.880
I think more than 40,000 people cross the border illegally.

106
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.240
So the Trudeau government doesn't want to fix that.

107
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.630
And that's a big issue in Canada.
So,
uh,

108
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.060
what I'm asking as a politician,

109
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.320
we have an immigration system and that is it by it.

110
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.140
It was going very well at points system.

111
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:55.430
So it's a privilege to be Canadians and we want people who come here to share

112
00:06:55.431 --> 00:07:00.000
our Canadian values are basic western civilization values and,

113
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.130
and it's a privilege.
So we have tree kind of immigrants in Canada,

114
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.780
the reunification of family,

115
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.980
the refugees and the economy can grow into a person that will come because they

116
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:14.150
have a job because the business wasn't able to find a Canadians for that job.

117
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.500
So they are coming,

118
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:19.070
they have a job and usually tease you or 20 greater society if you have a job.

119
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.990
But we don't need to build a wall between Canada and us.

120
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.890
We just need to be sure to respect our immigration system.

121
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.970
And the way to do that,

122
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:33.440
it's to have a discussion with president Trump about the third safe country

123
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.280
agreement.
We had a,

124
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.200
we have an agreement with us about that and to fix that loophole.

125
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.300
So people who are crossing at a real point of entry,

126
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.070
it's all okay what people who are crossing and not a real point of entry.
Uh,

127
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.901
we in the end,

128
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:50.780
my school bag to the u s and we must have an agreement with the US about that.

129
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:54.980
And I think we can have that kind of argument if we sit with the Trump

130
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:57.410
administration.
But at the same time,

131
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.540
we must be clear that people who are coming to Canada must come from the right

132
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:06.940
reason.
And these people who are crossing our border,
uh,

133
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.783
right now,

134
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.030
40% of them will have to be the port because they're not real refugees.

135
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.520
So it's a big cost for Canadian taxpayers because these people will be deported

136
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.250
maybe in two years from now.
So we must fix that.

137
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.980
And we have a strong position.
Our platform,
yes,
we'll fix that at the border.

138
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.380
What we need,
don't need to impose a wall.
We don't need to create a war.

139
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.760
But the most important,
and we need to focus on more economy can be grounds.

140
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.510
That's what we need in Canada.
And a little bit less of refugees.

141
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:42.410
And other debit less of reunification of family.
So that's a strong position.

142
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.800
But seeing that,
uh,
yes,

143
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.800
it's a risk in Canada when they see that as a politician.
Um,

144
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.970
but I'm taking that risk and uh,
yeah.
What,

145
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.610
what do you make of the libertarian argument that is pro open border?

146
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.550
Because I've had many guests are that are libertarian that take that position.

147
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.550
I've never been convinced of it.
I actually,
I just,

148
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.030
I don't understand the fundamental premise because as you said earlier,
it's,

149
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.160
if you're a nation,
a nation has borders.

150
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.190
That's just otherwise everything is just in a morphous blob.

151
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.010
But what I'm sure you hear this very libertarian circles,

152
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.340
so what do you make of that argument that's not coming from the left that's

153
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:21.600
coming from [inaudible] yeah,
absolutely.
So all party is,

154
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.070
we're not anti immigration and we're not open borders for immigration.

155
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.240
So what do we want?
It's a little bit less immigrant,
250,000 a year.

156
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:35.100
Like we had under Stephen Harper,
not 350,000 a year to do increase in,

157
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.750
to do a government.
The increase that by uh,
um,
uh,

158
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.700
40%.
So what I'm saying,
when people say,

159
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:48.390
oh,
well,
you know,
open border is good.
It's not,

160
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.590
it's not to everybody that can be part of a nation if you don't support of

161
00:09:55.821 --> 00:10:00.000
values.
If you are,
I don't know,
pro uh,

162
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.200
sharia law,
that's against our values.
That's again,

163
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.870
freedom between men and woman.

164
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.500
Equality between men and woman are the respect of the rule of law.

165
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.480
If you want to impose a new rule of law or Sharia law,
uh,

166
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.510
the integration one be very well in our society.

167
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.270
So these people,
uh,
much they,

168
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.220
they must share our values,
our western civilization values.

169
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:30.270
So that's why if you have an open border and you want everybody from everywhere

170
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:31.320
to come to Canada,

171
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.880
that will create tension and dislike in the population.

172
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.120
And that's happening actually in Europe actually right now.

173
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.560
Are you able to point to that?

174
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:43.020
That's the one thing that I've never understood that Europe has.

175
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:44.930
Having all of these integration problems.

176
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.970
Merkel has basically said she screwed up.
Yeah.
You know,

177
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:51.330
after letting a million people in,
are you able to point to that?
And say,

178
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:55.440
you see they might have,
that's the warning I'm doing that.
You know John,
his son,

179
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:58.260
I'm telling,
I'm telling me maximi nothing happened in Canada.

180
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:01.050
It's a great country.
I said,
yes it is a great country,

181
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.410
but our one this country to be like that in 20 years from now.

182
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.000
So that's why we must have the discussion right now and people who are coming to

183
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:12.210
Canada much more share our values.
If not,
you know,

184
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.090
they're not welcome because the integration will be very difficult.
And that's,

185
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.970
that's the total government policy on extremely particular tourism.

186
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.410
So you know,
for [inaudible] diversity is our strength is friend.

187
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.400
And for me it's unity.
When we Zahra Strand as a country and by two it always,

188
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.780
always pushing for more diversity,
more diversity,
more diversity.

189
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.490
And I said that and I tweet about that more diversity.

190
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.720
What else?
Our country it at the end it will destroy our country.

191
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.370
I know that we,

192
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.200
there's Canada is a diverse country with people coming from different countries

193
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:51.810
and with different culture.
But at the end,

194
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.570
the integrated our society because they believe in our freedom,

195
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:57.910
in our values.
In a,

196
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.970
and they want to share our traditions and our irritated celebrate are irritated.

197
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.510
So that's what we want and we need to have that discussion in Canada.
And,

198
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.330
and I think that discussion actually,

199
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.940
so that's why I don't believe in open borders.

200
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.620
I think it will create a tomb much diversity.

201
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:23.010
And I want people who come in our country to share our values and it's a

202
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:28.090
privilege to be Canadians and uh,
uh,
like it's a privilege to be an American.

203
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:30.160
So we must choose are immigrants.

204
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.300
And we did that for the last 35 years and that was very successful for our

205
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.160
country and people,
it's interesting,

206
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:40.240
you're only trying to roll it back to what it was 40% less.
I mean,

207
00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:42.070
it's not like you're doing something,
it's not like you're saying,

208
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.490
we're not letting anyone else 100 people that are coming and it's going back to,

209
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.010
you know,
it's a couple years ago.
Yeah.

210
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.310
And it is just stay until the door is radical.

211
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.120
Because the last Paul in Canada,

212
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:57.150
49% of Canadians said that they want fewer immigrants and only 6%,

213
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.720
6% of Canadian said that he wanted more immigrants.

214
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.910
So who is the radical Nixon,
Bernie or just thing to do?

215
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.610
It's just central to increase that by 40%.
So that's a fact.
And,

216
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.380
and that's what Canadian itin they're fed up with.
It's extremely,

217
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.150
extremely good tourism.
Uh,
the cold of diversity,

218
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.530
uh,
you know,
it too much.
It's too much.

219
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.240
And I think Canadian can see that in the future.
If you go on,
on,
on that road,

220
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.780
we'll have more problem and the integration would be more difficult.

221
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.200
And,
uh,

222
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.700
but [inaudible] team immigrants and people came in our country and the build

223
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:42.070
this country,
so,
and,

224
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.100
but they came for the right reason and they're proud to be Canadians,

225
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.970
but the liberals and,

226
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.310
and the conservative are doing identity politics and they tried to please have

227
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:56.290
risk per Sharle enter as good,
but every special ethnic groups also,
so,

228
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:59.620
you know,
and they call that outreach.
Um,
but for me,

229
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:02.710
the policies must be the same for every Canadians.

230
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:07.000
And we don't do any difference with your race,
your gender or what.

231
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.170
So for us it is not important,
but the Kenyan government is playing like this,

232
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.030
being that,
that,
uh,
that the,

233
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.770
they're doing these policies and I think that won't,

234
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.650
that won't be good at the end for our country.
Yeah.

235
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.740
So speaking of these policies,
I've also seen you on Twitter.

236
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:26.740
You're not a big fan of what's going on at the UN these days.
No,

237
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:31.160
I'm a to say the least.
Uh,
can you,
can you lay out why the UN,
why,

238
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.780
why you're so down?
I mean by,
it's,
it's a,
it's first of all,

239
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:38.680
it's a dysfunctional organization.
Um,
uh,

240
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:40.240
just as example,

241
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:45.241
I think the last two years they've ordered 21 resolutions against Israel on

242
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:49.240
human rights and only one or two resolutions.
Again,

243
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:53.690
Shane or Cuba or our venues.
So,
you know,

244
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.860
and the countries that are on that,

245
00:14:56.861 --> 00:15:00.950
a human right committees or you know,
the bad guy.
Yeah.

246
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:05.710
It's all the bad guys and Iraq,
uh,
China,
uh,

247
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.250
uh,
all,
all the bad guy.
All the dictatorships.
So,

248
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.020
so it's,
it's a joke and,

249
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.070
but do you on one to impose their vision of the world on other countries and uh,

250
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.200
you know,
I was against recently against the,
uh,

251
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.230
compact on migration.
And then you'd have the,

252
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.290
do you want migraines to be normal?
It is not normal.

253
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.630
People must be able to live in their country.

254
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.490
We must try to bring peace and prosperity.
And that's,
that's the most important.

255
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.020
But no,
they want that to be normal there.

256
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.280
There's 215 million people that are migrants on the globe and they want to

257
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:51.590
facilitate that.
So,
and the total government saying that agreement,

258
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:56.320
but it was the worst thing.
Oh,
it's not binding.
It's not binding.
But at the end,

259
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.980
why signing an agreement?
And if you said that you will follow all that.

260
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.230
But yeah,
it's not binding,

261
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:08.231
but you will put legislation in place to be in line with the agreement that you

262
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:14.330
signed.
So that will have an effect on our country at the end.

263
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.070
It won't be imposed by the UN.
It will be imposed by an illegitimate,

264
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.700
uh,
elected Kennedy and government.
So

265
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.500
<v 1>ironic because the Paris accord was non binding to,</v>

266
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.200
and he was all about the parents.

267
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.220
<v 0>Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah,
you're right.
So I think people there,</v>

268
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.940
and I think I was very clear about that and I had a lot of support about that,

269
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.990
that migrant a Compaq and people understand that,
you know,

270
00:16:42.991 --> 00:16:47.991
we have our sovereignty as a country and we must be able to select our

271
00:16:48.601 --> 00:16:53.550
immigrants.
And so that's coming from the UN.
So yes,
you're right.
Uh,

272
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.770
I don't like the UN.

273
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.740
I think that there are not so efficient and um,

274
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.080
and I'm clear about that.

275
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.990
<v 1>Yeah.
Do you guys have a strain,
you know,</v>

276
00:17:02.991 --> 00:17:06.800
we're seeing in Europe now where there's nationalists parties that there does

277
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:10.970
seem to be a strain of sort of ethno nationalism or something that has a

278
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:13.820
different racial kind of cage connotation to it.

279
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.820
Do you guys have a strain of that in Canada?

280
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:19.520
Because it seems to me that I think what's happening and we're starting to see

281
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:20.390
it here,
is that if the,

282
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.470
if the good liberals and the good libertarians and the people who just want to

283
00:17:24.471 --> 00:17:25.304
live and let live,

284
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.290
if they don't start making some advances against this radical leftism that's

285
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:34.070
moving,
there's going to be a lot of people that break in a bad way.

286
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.920
And in a weird way,
I wouldn't be able to blame them.

287
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.710
And I say that is someone that has no racism in my home,

288
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.420
but they would be left with no alternative as they watched their country
crumble.

289
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.010
Do you have any of that in Canada?

290
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.680
<v 0>No,
we don't.
And it's a good news,
but the end,</v>

291
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.690
that's why we must have this discussion and,
and uh,

292
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.650
I don't fear to have the discussion four meters,
no political correctness.

293
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.280
There's no taboo subject.
And we need to have the discussion and,

294
00:18:03.281 --> 00:18:05.400
and having that discussion with Canadians,

295
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.120
and I think it is time to have the discussion if we wait too long,

296
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.390
that can happen.
Our country.
Yeah.
So,

297
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.250
so right now I would imagine there's probably some people on the right that are

298
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:20.850
saying,
well Bernie,
Yay.
If he gains too much strength,

299
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.850
it'll sort of split the right and then that gives us,

300
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.530
I mean this is always the argument against Libertarians,
right?
Yeah.

301
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.600
And I say this is someone that I voted for Gary Johnson,
you know,

302
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:35.601
and I get it the more at some micro level when the third parties,

303
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.140
usually the libertarian party,

304
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.680
that's usually gonna take from the conservatives more than the lefties.

305
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.690
And then then there is an argument,

306
00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:44.790
then you're always going to end up with a lefty government.

307
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.840
I suspect as the guy leading this thing,
you don't buy that argument.

308
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.830
I think in the long term I don't buy that.

309
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.510
But actually it is the only argument that my opponent,

310
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:58.290
the Conservative Party of Canada has.
Um,

311
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.470
so that's their whole thing is,
oh yeah,
you vote for this guy,

312
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:05.760
you're going to fracture eyes.
They have a weak leader there.
No conviction there.

313
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.480
Uh,
you know,
the conservative are doing a lot of polling,

314
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.660
polling and focus group and survey,

315
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.570
but they're not doing politics by conviction.

316
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.770
And I'm doing politics by conviction and we must speak about what we believe

317
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.740
openly with passion and conviction.
And that's what I'm doing.

318
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:27.270
That's a big difference with me and Andrew Scheer and Andrew Scheer,
uh,

319
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.050
tried to please everybody.
And he said,
actually,
uh,
the truth,

320
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.190
he was with the Toronto Sun and he said,
my party,

321
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.650
he is a centrist,
centrist,

322
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.740
pragmatic politics called party open for a lot of ideas for a lot of people.

323
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.670
So what is saying is he doesn't have any principal,

324
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.840
does want to have any conviction,
doesn't have any vision for the country.

325
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.170
He wants to please everybody.
But at the end,
when you please everybody,

326
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:59.070
you end up pleasing nobody.
So that's their conservative.
I'm not,

327
00:19:59.071 --> 00:20:03.840
I think I'm not happy with him,
but they are telling me,
Maxine,
we want to win.

328
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.920
And yes,
you are splitting the vote,
but I'm seeing in a democracy,

329
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.350
the vote,
it's always split.
If you don't want anyone to speak the vote,

330
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.500
it would be a dick.
Toucher you don't have so,

331
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.110
so why don't telling them if Andrew Scheer,

332
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.500
when I was with him when I was a conservative,
um,
you once,

333
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.930
not winning against your stent could do,

334
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.160
it was always six to eight points behind just thing to do.

335
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:34.350
And Maxim Biani is not with Hendry sheer right now and uh,

336
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.860
and we'll shoot it has not winning is bi and draw two behind your sainthood all

337
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:41.970
by four to six point now.
So he is not able to win.

338
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.350
So when I'm saying to people,

339
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.100
vote for your values vode for what you believe in,

340
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.840
be part of the change.
Be with us.

341
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.570
We have the momentum right now.

342
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.780
We have the real conservative policies and ideas and come with us and with,

343
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.510
we'll see what will happen.
Maybe we can be,

344
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.470
we can have the balance of power in,
in a parliamentary system.

345
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.190
We can be in power.
So,
I don't know.
I don't know what will happen,

346
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:13.360
but I know that we have the momentum and then so you think it's a risk worth

347
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.410
taking regardless.

348
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.460
Even if even if at the end of the day the party splits or not the market,

349
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:21.370
cause it's two separate parties but the votes are split enough that you ended up

350
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:25.860
with Trudeau.
Again,
you think it's just longterm,
it's what you have to do.
I see.

351
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.810
You'd have to vote for what you believe,
you know,

352
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:31.510
and and giving them another alternative.

353
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.280
And you know why you will vote for a politician that is telling you something

354
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:39.730
and at the end he won't do any reform me one donating because he will look at

355
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:41.500
Nepal and he won't be able to do that.

356
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:46.630
I'm speaking about real conservative reform before,

357
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.030
after and during an addiction time every time.
So yes,

358
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:55.690
that there's a risk over there that just stated could all be erected,

359
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.710
but maybe you will have,

360
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.550
it will be erected only as a minority government and even some minority

361
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:03.040
government.
And we are there with a lot of seeds.

362
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.710
We can be the difference and we can,

363
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.810
and Paul's our reform to the government or reverse the government.

364
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.660
We don't know what we can do,
but I don't know what can happen,

365
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:18.850
but I'm telling them that's a risk.
But you know,
vote,

366
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.930
vote for what you think will be good for this country in the long term.

367
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.650
That's what we're doing right now.
We did.
They liked the part.

368
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.010
That's why I'm telling you that's the only argument that the AV,
yeah.
Uh,

369
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.990
but the goal and I think I can defeat just stay into the most important from me

370
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:35.824
actually.

371
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.300
It's to be able to have candidates all across the country in every writing and

372
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:41.440
we'll be able to have that.

373
00:22:41.441 --> 00:22:46.000
So we're not our original party where are a national body in Quebec and outside

374
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:49.150
Quebec and all across the country.
And also I'll be,

375
00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:53.590
I will be present at the national debate on,
on the national TV during the,

376
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.980
during the election campaign in September,
October.

377
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.780
And that will be important for me as the leader of a new party to be there.

378
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.790
And I think I'll be able to questions the other leader to,
to,
to challenge them.

379
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.380
And that will help off party at the end.
So we can be a big surprise.

380
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.460
And I'm telling people,
come with us,
voted for what you believe,

381
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.660
be part of the change and,
and we'll be able to do something.

382
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.600
I don't know what would be the end result of all that,

383
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.450
but I can tell you that we are able to change the country for the better.
Yeah.

384
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.300
That,
that should be the ending.
But I'm not quite,
I'm not quite done yet.

385
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:35.020
But that was,
that was,
that was the ending portion here in a way that was your,

386
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.990
that was your closing stump speech there.
What do you make of,
um,

387
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.100
sort of the state?
We haven't talked at all about religion.

388
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:44.650
It's one of the themes that we've talked a lot about here.
And I know you're,

389
00:23:44.651 --> 00:23:47.390
you're familiar with Jordan Peterson work,
um,

390
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.740
that it seems that the way that Western countries have,
say,

391
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:54.410
moved off of Judeo Christian values,

392
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.860
that they've replaced everything with a big state.

393
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.390
I actually don't know what you're [inaudible] actually that's,

394
00:24:01.391 --> 00:24:05.000
that's I believe in that.
And then that happened in Quebec,

395
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.270
in my own province in Quebec at the provincial level.
You know,

396
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:13.420
we had the relationship with the state and the church in Quebec in the 1915,

397
00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:18.200
1960 16 and,
and after dad,
you know,

398
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.590
we,
we did at the plane,
Shoulder Bala quiet revolution.

399
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.810
And so we were praised,
were appraised,
did the,

400
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:30.440
the church by a bigger state and that had been in Quebec.

401
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:34.160
And we're still have a big fat government at the play in Charlotte Laval in

402
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:37.900
Quebec.
That's why,
you know,
Quebec,
uh,
uh,
is a,

403
00:24:37.901 --> 00:24:39.260
a poor province in Canada.

404
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:42.380
We have a kind of a formula in Canada under constitution in the,

405
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.350
we call that the equality nation,
uh,
formula.

406
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.860
The rich balances are giving money to poor provinces.

407
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:53.420
And Quebec received equitization my name for the last 50 years.
So,

408
00:24:53.421 --> 00:24:58.421
so because bad economic policies have to play and show Lovell and because of a

409
00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:01.550
big state at the provincial level,
because it's still work,

410
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.860
there's no nothing the money you ever work on.

411
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.740
Why did they have to do it for 50 years if this was so the good policy?
Yeah,

412
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.860
but Polynesian like to give them money and too,
but so,

413
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:16.870
so what you're saying about the re when I think we did that in Quebec and and at

414
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:21.920
the federal level with the total government,
they want a bigger state.
Absolutely.

415
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:26.300
So I agree with Jordan.
When is say when,
when he said that,
uh,

416
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:30.070
that was the case at the branch show Laval in Quebec and it a bit more evident

417
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.960
but also on the food.
I love all sorts people want,

418
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.540
politicians wanted bigger government and,
and the,
the,

419
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.570
the more bigger the garment is,
the more power the APP,

420
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.660
the more regulation they doing,
the more inference they will have.
And,

421
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.070
and so for me,
I don't buy that.
So that,

422
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.920
so as a libertarian and government,
which as I started,

423
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:56.180
this is an odd thing because it's the only type of people that want to scale

424
00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:58.130
back the very thing they're becoming part of.

425
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.370
Are you worried at all that everything has become political,

426
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.160
that it seems politics has sort of replaced sports,

427
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.780
at least here in the United States.

428
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.160
The way we talk about politicians is the way you used to talk about athletes.

429
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.160
We worship these people who've never accomplished anything,

430
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:17.060
but they're good on sound bites.
Trudeau has nice hair and wears Nike socks,

431
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.210
although you're clearly,
you're doing all right in the sock game.
But that we,

432
00:26:21.211 --> 00:26:25.430
we worship these people who should have,
if we were doing this right,

433
00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:27.740
would have almost no control over us.
And yet we,

434
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:31.610
we've elevated them to some magical state that's gotta be just weird for you

435
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:35.960
personally as someone that you want to scale this thing back and yet you have to

436
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:40.030
be part of,
I have to be bothered that I have to be part of that to do that.

437
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.010
You absolutely right.
Uh,
but yes,

438
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.540
and I think that the population,
sometimes they are putting too much,

439
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:53.820
too much,
uh,
uh,
faith in a politician to change things.

440
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.380
You know,
and that's what I'm telling to people.
You know,
I will,

441
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:02.700
I will put forward the policies that will believe in.
But after that,
you know,

442
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.690
when we'll have more competition,
no more corporate welfare,
a government debt,

443
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.870
respect the constitution and,

444
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.680
and we'll all these extreme middle to good tourism policies will,
you know,

445
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.780
that that is there to buy votes,

446
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.830
ed ethnic voting and with different communities will abolish these policies.

447
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.310
So,
and telling them,
I'll do that,

448
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.450
but at the same time I'm doing that because I believe in you because I don't

449
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:31.950
want to save you for every individual problems that you can have in your life.

450
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.110
Uh,
I want you to be irresponsible.
That's a little be,
uh,
but you know,

451
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:40.230
and the only politician who speak like that,
and for me,
you know,

452
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:42.690
I believe in free markets.
I believe in competition,

453
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.700
but when you don't have competition,
it is fun,
are in politics.

454
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:52.620
And you know,
Otto politician are too afraid to say that.
And for me,

455
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:53.520
uh,
that,

456
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.960
that's great because I don't have a political competition on what I'm seeing.

457
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.460
But you're right,
you know,

458
00:27:59.461 --> 00:28:04.260
people most be responsible and we must have a smaller government.
And I want,

459
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.770
I want to have that job to be sure to do what I want to do an LP ball in the

460
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:12.870
right way by giving them back their,

461
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.930
their response OBD and giving them back their own money and uh,

462
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.900
giving them back.
They're increasing their purchasing power.

463
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.450
So all the things that if they have more money in their pocket,

464
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.660
in their pockets that we bought,
they'll,
there'll be able to do more things.

465
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:30.750
And so for them or for their family.
So that's,
uh,

466
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.380
that's what I want you to do in politics.
And I like that actually.
It's my best.

467
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:35.550
I'm in politics right now.

468
00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.640
<v 1>Yeah.
All right.
I normally don't end an interview asking for favor.</v>

469
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.240
Favor is this,
if you can make this thing work in Canada,

470
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.290
can you then send somebody down to fix the Libertarians in the United States?

471
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.420
Cause our libertarians needs some help.
I mean your,

472
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.180
your voice and someone that's speaking clarity on libertarian issues because we

473
00:28:55.181 --> 00:28:56.870
have a lot of talkers that are doing it.

474
00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.250
We have a lot of youtubers and the think tanks that do really well,

475
00:29:00.251 --> 00:29:03.400
but for whatever reason,
and I,
again,
I voted for Gary Johnson.

476
00:29:03.401 --> 00:29:08.170
I think he's a really nice man,
but he wasn't a great candidate.
We,
we need that.

477
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.620
What you are presenting,
so if you've got anybody,
can you,

478
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.470
can you send them our way when you're done with this name?
Don't deal.

479
00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.720
Sounds good.
All right.
What was a pleasure?

480
00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:20.410
Thank you so much for coming in and for more on Maxime you can check out
