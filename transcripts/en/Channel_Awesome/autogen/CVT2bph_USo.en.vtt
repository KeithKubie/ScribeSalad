00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 align:start position:0%
there wasn't much to get sucked into
 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
there wasn't much to get sucked into
it's<00:05:13.070><c> just</c><00:05:13.310><c> like</c><00:05:13.490><c> oh</c><00:05:13.699><c> there's</c><00:05:14.360><c> a</c><00:05:14.449><c> matrix</c><00:05:14.720><c> so</c>

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 align:start position:0%
it's just like oh there's a matrix so
 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.779 align:start position:0%
it's just like oh there's a matrix so
there's<00:05:15.500><c> this</c><00:05:15.680><c> fake</c><00:05:15.889><c> world</c><00:05:16.190><c> and</c><00:05:16.460><c> then</c><00:05:16.550><c> there's</c>

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 align:start position:0%
there's this fake world and then there's
 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.850 align:start position:0%
there's this fake world and then there's
the<00:05:17.000><c> real</c><00:05:17.150><c> world</c><00:05:17.419><c> and</c><00:05:17.630><c> the</c><00:05:17.720><c> real</c><00:05:17.900><c> world</c><00:05:17.930><c> sucks</c>

the real world and the real world sucks
 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.980 align:start position:0%
the real world and the real world sucks
and<00:05:19.220><c> the</c><00:05:19.789><c> matrix</c><00:05:20.180><c> is</c><00:05:20.330><c> actually</c><00:05:20.510><c> the</c>

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 align:start position:0%
and the matrix is actually the
 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
and the matrix is actually the
interesting<00:05:21.260><c> part</c><00:05:21.710><c> and</c><00:05:21.979><c> I</c><00:05:22.250><c> I</c><00:05:22.520><c> like</c><00:05:22.699><c> the</c><00:05:23.030><c> idea</c>

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
interesting part and I I like the idea
 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.930 align:start position:0%
interesting part and I I like the idea
and<00:05:23.660><c> then</c><00:05:23.780><c> it</c><00:05:23.810><c> ended</c><00:05:24.260><c> with</c><00:05:24.560><c> neo</c><00:05:25.160><c> flying</c><00:05:25.699><c> off</c>

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 align:start position:0%
and then it ended with neo flying off
 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
and then it ended with neo flying off
into<00:05:26.210><c> space</c><00:05:26.389><c> like</c><00:05:26.750><c> Silver</c><00:05:27.169><c> Surfer</c><00:05:27.350><c> and</c><00:05:27.680><c> I'm</c>

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 align:start position:0%
into space like Silver Surfer and I'm
 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.650 align:start position:0%

like okay there it is like the end and
 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.629 align:start position:0%
like okay there it is like the end and
you<00:05:30.470><c> know</c><00:05:30.530><c> what's</c><00:05:30.919><c> that</c><00:05:31.070><c> could</c><00:05:31.220><c> open</c><00:05:31.580><c> up</c>

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
you know what's that could open up
 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
you know what's that could open up
what's<00:05:31.880><c> it</c><00:05:32.000><c> gonna</c><00:05:32.120><c> mean</c><00:05:32.360><c> and</c><00:05:32.770><c> but</c><00:05:33.770><c> then</c><00:05:33.919><c> that</c>

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 align:start position:0%
what's it gonna mean and but then that
 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.310 align:start position:0%
what's it gonna mean and but then that
turned<00:05:34.490><c> into</c><00:05:34.610><c> a</c><00:05:34.729><c> huge</c><00:05:35.030><c> hit</c><00:05:35.300><c> and</c><00:05:35.510><c> they</c><00:05:35.810><c> said</c><00:05:36.080><c> are</c>

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
turned into a huge hit and they said are
 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
turned into a huge hit and they said are
and<00:05:36.740><c> well</c><00:05:37.400><c> we</c><00:05:37.580><c> got</c><00:05:37.820><c> less</c><00:05:39.849><c> we</c><00:05:40.849><c> got</c><00:05:41.000><c> a</c><00:05:41.030><c> few</c><00:05:41.240><c> cool</c>

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 align:start position:0%

Neos yeah the cubical wall and I'm like
 

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
Neos yeah the cubical wall and I'm like
they're<00:16:10.120><c> programs</c><00:16:10.960><c> in</c><00:16:11.500><c> this</c><00:16:12.190><c> but</c><00:16:12.960><c> how</c><00:16:13.960><c> do</c><00:16:14.020><c> you</c>

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.170 align:start position:0%
they're programs in this but how do you
 

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.590 align:start position:0%
they're programs in this but how do you
do<00:16:14.410><c> that</c><00:16:14.560><c> like</c><00:16:14.830><c> if</c><00:16:15.220><c> your</c><00:16:15.640><c> computer</c><00:16:16.210><c> program</c>

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
do that like if your computer program
 

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
do that like if your computer program
shouldn't<00:16:16.930><c> you</c><00:16:17.050><c> just</c><00:16:17.080><c> have</c><00:16:17.470><c> a</c><00:16:17.500><c> system</c><00:16:18.040><c> where</c>

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.370 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you just have a system where
 

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you just have a system where

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
into the matrix why do you even need to
 

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
into the matrix why do you even need to
physically<00:16:22.390><c> find</c><00:16:22.900><c> this</c><00:16:23.170><c> guy</c><00:16:23.350><c> if</c><00:16:23.529><c> you</c><00:16:23.680><c> can</c>

physically find this guy if you can
 

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:28.250 align:start position:0%
biggest sin is that Zion is incredibly
 

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.549 align:start position:0%
biggest sin is that Zion is incredibly

00:41:30.549 --> 00:41:30.559 align:start position:0%
boring whenever they were outside the
 

00:41:30.559 --> 00:41:32.109 align:start position:0%
boring whenever they were outside the

00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
matrix see me is that the one is
 

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:33.010 align:start position:0%
matrix see me is that the one is
incredibly<00:41:32.539><c> boring</c>

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:33.020 align:start position:0%
incredibly boring
 

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.450 align:start position:0%
incredibly boring
yeah<00:41:33.260><c> but</c><00:41:33.440><c> whenever</c><00:41:33.589><c> they</c><00:41:33.829><c> were</c><00:41:33.890><c> outside</c><00:41:34.309><c> the</c>

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:34.460 align:start position:0%
yeah but whenever they were outside the
 

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.190 align:start position:0%
yeah but whenever they were outside the
matrix<00:41:34.609><c> I</c><00:41:35.029><c> could</c><00:41:35.270><c> have</c><00:41:35.359><c> cared</c><00:41:35.539><c> less</c><00:41:35.630><c> whenever</c>

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.650 align:start position:0%
matrix I could have cared less whenever
they're<00:41:36.440><c> in</c><00:41:36.650><c> the</c><00:41:36.799><c> matrix</c><00:41:37.250><c> and</c><00:41:37.819><c> that</c><00:41:38.150><c> goes</c><00:41:38.450><c> for</c>

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:38.660 align:start position:0%
they're in the matrix and that goes for
 

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
they're in the matrix and that goes for
the<00:41:38.750><c> first</c><00:41:38.960><c> movie</c><00:41:39.140><c> the</c><00:41:39.349><c> best</c><00:41:39.529><c> scenes</c><00:41:39.829><c> in</c><00:41:40.069><c> the</c>

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:40.130 align:start position:0%
