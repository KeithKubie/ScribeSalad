00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:07.634
Narrator:
BIOLOGIC MEDICINES ARE PROTEINS

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:09.868
PRODUCED INSIDE LIVING CELLS,

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:12.100
WHICH ARE MINI FACTORIES

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.334
GENERATING THE
GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:14.868
PROTEIN TREATMENTS.

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:17.501
IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH
FROM TRADITIONAL DRUGS,

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:21.234
WHICH ARE MANUFACTURED
USING CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:24.400
BIOLOGICS OFFER HOPE WHERE
OTHER THERAPIES HAVE FAILED.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:29.634
TO MASS PRODUCE
THESE BIOLOGIC MEDICINES,

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:32.067
SCIENTISTS USE THE
MOLECULAR MACHINERY

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:34.901
INSIDE LIVING CELLS.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.501
THE PROCESS STARTS WITH

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:38.501
THE INSERTION OF
GENETIC MATERIAL

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:41.667
INTO CHINESE HAMSTER
OVARIAN CELLS.

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.234
THEY'RE KNOWN AS C.H.O. CELLS.

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.801
THEY KEEP THEM FROZEN
IN LIQUID NITROGEN

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:48.601
UNTIL THE NEXT STEP.

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.067
IN THE SEED LAB,

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:53.067
A TECHNICIAN THAWS THE CELLS
IN WARM WATER.

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:59.267
HE TRANSFERS THEM
TO A GLASS FLASK

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.167
THAT CONTAINS GROWTH MEDIA.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.167
THE GROWTH MEDIA IS COMPRISED OF
HUNDREDS OF NUTRIENTS,

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:08.133
INCLUDING VITAMINS AND MINERALS.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.501
IT'S A RECIPE
TO HELP THE CELLS MULTIPLY.

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:18.300
A WORKER TRANSFERS THE FLASK
THAT CONTAINS THE CELLS

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.968
TO THE PRODUCTION SIDE
OF THE PLANT.

00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:23.734
THE TEAM INJECTS THE MIXTURE

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.834
INTO A FIVE-GALLON CAPACITY
BIOREACTOR.

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:31.467
INSIDE, A PROPELLER
AGITATES THE MIXTURE

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.334
TO STIMULATE GROWTH.

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:34.901
OVER A THREE-WEEK PERIOD,

00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:38.300
THE NUMBER OF CELLS
INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.601
EACH NEW CELL
IS PROGRAMMED TO PRODUCE

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.067
THE TARGET BIOLOGIC PROTEIN.

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:48.033
NEXT, A TECHNICIAN MEASURES
SALTS AND OTHER DRY INGREDIENTS.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:52.000
HE'S PREPARING A RECIPE
FOR PURIFYING THE PROTEIN LIQUID

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.801
ONCE IT'S BEEN SEPARATED
FROM THE CELLS.

00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.534
HE LABELS THE BAG

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.801
AND RECORDS THE INFORMATION
SEPARATELY,

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:02.601
AS REQUIRED BY
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.434
HE ADDS THE INGREDIENTS
TO PURIFIED WATER

00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:08.067
IN A MIXING TANK.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:10.801
AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM
KEEPS TABS ON THE CONDITION

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:13.300
OF THE PURIFICATION SOLUTION.

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:19.434
AFTER SEPARATING
CELLULAR MATERIAL

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.000
FROM THE PROTEIN MIXTURE,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.234
THE TEAM PUMPS IT THROUGH
STEEL-AND-GLASS COLUMNS.

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:27.968
HERE, THE PURIFICATION SOLUTION
WORKS WITH RESIN BEADS

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:30.968
TO SEPARATE THE PROTEIN
FROM THE IMPURITIES.

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:33.601
FINALLY, THIS TECHNICIAN
TAKES A SAMPLE

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.868
AND CONDUCTS A TEST TO ENSURE
THE MEDICINE IS STERILE.

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:41.267
GROWN IN LIVING CELLS,

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:44.033
THESE BIOLOGIC MEDICINES
ARE NOW ON THEIR WAY

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:47.834
TO POTENTIALLY MAKING
A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE LIVES.
