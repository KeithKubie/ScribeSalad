00:00:01.696 --> 00:00:03.920
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to "Google
Developers Weekly" for

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.150
September 30, 2013.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.280
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.020
happening in the world
of Google Developers

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.050
on the set and off.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.830
This week, we welcome back the
"Root Access" team, led by Don

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.120
Dodge, for a pair of shows
highlighting issues faced by

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.480
most every startup
as they grow.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.420
The first show included guest
Izabel Idris, who talked about

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.180
how to capture a product's
persona and deliver a great

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.410
user interface.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.300
Your product not only
has to be smart

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.520
but be smartly designed.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.560
Our second "Root Access" show
is all about ideas.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.390
When you're coming up with your
startup ideas, you might

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.460
worry that someone would steal
your idea outright and build

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.260
their own competing company.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.850
Don Dodge takes the time to
answer viewer questions and

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.290
tell you the inside scoop on his
experience at Napster, the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.810
music-sharing pioneer.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.790
By popular demand, Nasir Khan
returned to our studio to

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.340
debut the much-awaited
documentation for the new

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.380
Wallet Instant Buy API, helping
you accept payments

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.180
for goods and services
in your application.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.270
And if you're among the many
looking to get started with a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.540
cloud platform, this was
your lucky week.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.040
Martin Omander and Alex Maier
connected with Mandy Waite

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.160
from London and taught you the
process of how to start over

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.350
at zero and end up
with Hello World.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.440
Sticking with the cloud, as we
often do, Nick Bortolotti

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.340
delivered the latest from Latam
with a piece focused on

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.550
non-rational cloud
data storage.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.560
It is by far the best rundown of
BigQuery and Google Compute

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.960
Engine I've ever heard,
in Spanish.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.890
And this week, Jeff Posnick
phoned in from New York City

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.800
to demonstrate how you can
discover great videos and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.080
channels using the YouTube
Data API Version 3.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.480
The event was a companion piece
to an introductory blog

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.230
post that debuted earlier
this month.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.630
And meanwhile, the Wallet
Developers duo of Mihai

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.420
Ionescu and Peng Ying introduced
us to the newly

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.140
released Wallet Objects Platform
with special guest

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.530
Tania Depasquale, which helps
merchants acquire and engage

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.820
loyal customers.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.930
Making the web universally
accessible is a big part of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.140
Google's mission.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.880
David Tseng and Volker Sorge
joined us to once again talk

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.610
about ChromeVox, a screen
reader for Chrome.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.910
ChromeVox can now read
all kinds of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.490
mathematics on the web.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.990
As a developer, you will be able
to customize reading of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.850
your own math content and make
your content work for

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.670
low-vision users.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.030
Also, recently on GDL, Felipe
Hoffa and Michael Manoochehri

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.240
talked to you about
the great new

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.380
correlation features in BigQuery.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.480
This talk inspired Googler Josh
Livni from the Maps team

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.940
to mash up Maps and BigQuery
data to show airport delays.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.420
Josh generated the data with
Felipe and Michael's code,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.730
then wrote some JavaScript
to build the map.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.100
This powerful correlation can
be used to predict the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.270
likelihood of future delays, so
you know just how close you

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.030
can cut it when leaving
for the airport.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.330
Also last week, the Android
Studio team

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.690
released version 0.2.10.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.030
Of course, it has some bug fixes
and probably some new

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.200
bugs, but you'll also find
improved quick documentation,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.910
integrated traceview,
better layout

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.350
rendering, and other goodies.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.510
Be sure to upgrade if
you haven't already.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.930
Security is easy.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.710
You just have to be perfect
every single time.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.930
Those are the words of Mike
West, who gets our attention

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.880
with the scary advice in his
talk about how to prevent

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.630
cross-site scripting attacks.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.330
Check out Mike's talk
and his slides.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.710
It's a great investment in
making your site safer from

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.210
bad things.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.130
In the world of politics,
last week saw the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.170
German federal elections.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.320
And Google developers were there
with an election results

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.000
map built in Dart.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.430
Google's Jason Brooks built
the app, noting that Dart

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.260
provided great power
and flexibility.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.380
The map displayed results
by district as

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.120
well as national totals.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.410
And finally, Andres Leonardo
Martinez Ortiz continues his

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.610
series of posts about

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.720
entrepreneurship in sunny Spain.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.730
This time, he focuses
on Valencia.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.430
If you're looking for some new
places to explore, check out

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.080
all of his posts.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.560
And to make sure you never miss
a single thing from the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.300
world of Google Developers,
subscribe to Google Developers

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.680
on YouTube and check out
the GDL schedule at

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.170
developers.google.com/live.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.710
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you in the studio.
