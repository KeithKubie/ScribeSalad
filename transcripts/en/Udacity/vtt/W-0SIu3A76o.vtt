00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.110
&gt;&gt; Alright so, Stochastic Games are more general than

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.430
other models that we've talked about. And so, just to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.280
make that case here's a way of making the Stochastic

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.550
Game settings more constrained. And, by making them more constrained,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.450
actually turning them into other models that we've talked

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.380
about or could talk about. So, I wrote down three

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.150
different ways of constraining the Stochastic Game model. One says

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.370
that we're going to make the reward function for one player

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.780
the opposite of the reward function for the other. The next one says that the

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.600
transition function has the property that for any state and joint action and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.800
next state. If that's going to be equal to the transition probability for state

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.700
joint action, next state, where we've changed

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.410
potentially the choice of action for player two.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.770
&gt;&gt; So basically, player two doesn't matter

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.600
to the transitions or the rewards for player one, and the rewards

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.520
for player tow are always zero. So that's, that's again, you can specify

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.320
this as a Stochastic Game and then in the third case we

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.410
are saying that the number of states in the environment is exactly one.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.425
&gt;&gt; So I claim that by doing these restrictions. We get out the

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:13.690
mark-off decision process model, a zero

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.100
sum statistic game model, and the repeated

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.040
game model that we've been talking about in

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.440
the context of, like, the folk theorem. So, what

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.450
I'd like you to do is write the letters, A, B, and C in the correct boxes.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.510
&gt;&gt; Go.
