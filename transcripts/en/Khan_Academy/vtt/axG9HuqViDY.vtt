00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.524
- [Voiceover] The Second
Law of Thermodynamics,

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:03.904
one statement of it is

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.944
that the entropy of the
universe only increases.

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:09.488
And, I put an exclamation mark here,

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:11.566
because it seems like a
very profound statement.

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.284
And, on a lot of levels, it is.

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.107
And, just to get us into
the right frame of mind,

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:17.301
I have this image here
from the Hubble telescope

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.088
of the night sky.

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:21.178
And, each of these dots,

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:22.304
these are not stars.

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:23.361
These are galaxies.

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.301
That's a galaxy.

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:25.439
That's a galaxy there.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.658
That's a galaxy.

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:28.504
So, hopefully this gets
you into little bit more

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:31.023
of a cosmological scale.

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:32.927
But, let's think about what
this is actually telling us.

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:36.084
The entropy of the
universe only increases.

00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:40.438
So, entropy, we can define
that as the disorder

00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:41.564
of a system.

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:42.598
And, we're really talking about the number

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:45.163
of states that a system could take on.

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:46.522
And then, we're saying the universe.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:47.496
But, we could also say the entropy

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.806
of a closed system only increases.

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:51.803
A system that is fully contained,

00:00:51.803 --> 00:00:53.265
that's not interacting
with its surroundings,

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.333
because the universe is
the ultimate closed system.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.667
There's nothing for it to,
outside of it to interact

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.257
with thermodynamically.

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:01.474
And, I'll do a quick review
of open and closed systems,

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:03.437
just so we make sure we understand that.

00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:04.737
So, if I had a campfire,

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:07.304
so I have some logs and I had my,

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:09.324
the flame going right over here.

00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:11.030
So, that's the campfire.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.583
If I were to just look
at the logs and the fire,

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:16.707
that's going to be an open system.

00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:18.588
Because, it's clearly
interacting thermodynamically

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:19.785
with its surroundings.

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:20.991
It's releasing heat.

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:24.787
It's warming up the air
molecules around it.

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:27.585
It's releasing light
out into the universe.

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:29.872
There could be interactions from the rest

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:31.602
of the universe into the system.

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:34.840
So, it isn't isolated from
the rest of everything else.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.627
But, a closed system, it is isolated.

00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:38.950
And, there are, it's very hard

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.922
to create a true closed
system in our everyday life.

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:43.141
But, we can approximate it.

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.569
And, the one that you've
probably experienced

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.644
in the not too distant
past is an ice cooler.

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:50.861
And, an ice cooler,
we're at least attempting

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:55.756
to thermodynamically isolate,

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:57.881
isolate the inside of the cooler

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.737
from the outside, from
the rest of the universe.

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:04.522
So, this is, and the way we
do it is we have some type

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:05.763
of an insulating material.

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:07.656
Maybe some styrofoam.

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:08.735
And, we could put,

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.500
you know, we'd use it to maybe store ice.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.543
But, it's not a perfect closed system,

00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:14.459
because eventually, the heat from the rest

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.779
of the universe will warm
up the walls of the cooler.

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.820
And eventually, that heat will warm up,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.213
will be transferred to the ice,

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:23.421
and it will warm it up.

00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:26.138
And, it will melt it.

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:27.902
So, it's not a perfect closed system,

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:29.342
but it's a good approximation,

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:30.619
because we're at least attempting

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.231
to isolate it thermodynamically

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:34.578
from the rest of the universe.

00:02:34.578 --> 00:02:35.994
And, I can even make
a little cover of this

00:02:35.994 --> 00:02:38.554
to show that we really
wanted to isolate it.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:39.703
And, in research labs,

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:41.456
you'll see things that are
much better approximations

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:42.176
of closed systems.

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:45.029
But, even those at some level
are, they're going to interact

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.619
with the rest of the universe.

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.106
The ultimate closed system,

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:50.009
so this is a closed system,

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.028
is really the universe.

00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:56.858
Nothing to interact with
outside of it thermodynamically.

00:02:56.858 --> 00:03:00.121
So, let's think a little
bit about this definition.

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:02.663
The entropy of the
universe only increases.

00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:04.495
Why does this make intuitive sets?

00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:06.251
Well, the best example I can think

00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.502
of is just straight up diffusion.

00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:11.902
So, if I were to have, let's
say I have a container.

00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:13.725
So, I have a container,

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:15.640
and I'll make it a,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.660
I'm gonna make it a closed container.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.227
We'll say this is some type

00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:22.384
of theoretical ideal closed system here.

00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:24.707
Now, let's say I had some ideal gas.

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:28.724
So, I had some ideal gas
molecules right over here.

00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:30.024
They have some average temperature,

00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:32.821
but that means they all each
have their own individual,

00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:36.258
their own individual kinetic energy.

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:38.852
They're all bouncing
around in different ways.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.988
What's going to happen over time?

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.308
Well, over time, the
ones on the left here,

00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:45.028
they're gonna bounce off this wall.

00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:46.270
And then, they're eventually gonna go

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.152
in this direction.

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:49.207
And so, over time, you're
gonna have a situation

00:03:49.207 --> 00:03:52.945
where the system is going to
look something more like this.

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:56.706
So, the system is going
to look more like this,

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:59.028
where instance, let's see,
this is six particles.

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:00.950
These six particles are gonna diffuse

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.957
throughout the container.

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:05.814
So, they're gonna diffuse
throughout the container.

00:04:05.814 --> 00:04:09.730
They're going to take up more
of the space of the container.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.598
Now, what just happened in that process?

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:13.979
Well, when you knew that
the particles were confined

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.788
to this little section of the container,

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:18.494
there were fewer possible states.

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:20.968
You had lower entropy
than when you are here,

00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:23.394
when you know that it's
filled up the container.

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:25.112
There's more possible locations,

00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:26.854
more possible orientations for it.

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:28.896
And so, you are going to have more states.

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:30.394
You have higher entropy,

00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:34.014
higher, higher,

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:36.707
higher, entropy.

00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:40.109
And, in general, these processes
where you have the entropy

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:43.313
increasing, we call these
irreversible processes,

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:47.771
irreversible, irreversible processes.

00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:49.791
And, why is it irreversible?

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:51.451
Well, there's some probability

00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:53.715
that these molecules
might just gather back

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:55.270
into this corner of it.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.592
But, it's very, very low probability.

00:04:57.592 --> 00:04:58.496
And, this is when we're dealing

00:04:58.496 --> 00:04:59.495
with six molecules.

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:02.815
But, in real systems, we'd
be dealing with much larger

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:03.871
than six molecules.

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.531
We'll be dealing with millions of millions

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:10.233
of millions of millions of molecules.

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:14.470
So, things with, between 20
and 30 zero's of molecules.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.608
And there,

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:17.709
it's very unlikely that
they just all bump together

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:20.612
in the right way to start
taking a smaller volume,

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.748
when they could actually
fill the container.

00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:24.187
And so, that's why you don't see,

00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:28.831
that's why you don't see
smoke just naturally turn

00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:31.074
into to some type of shaped particle,

00:05:31.074 --> 00:05:33.269
or take up less space,

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:35.009
as opposed to filling its container.

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.170
So, this is irreversible,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.572
because you went from,
you went from fewer number

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.637
of potential states,

00:05:40.637 --> 00:05:41.433
as a smaller volume,

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:45.739
to a higher number of potential states.

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:48.293
And, the universe is
constantly doing this.

00:05:48.293 --> 00:05:50.568
That's why the entropy of the
universe is only increasing.

00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:52.309
Now, there's some processes

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.992
that it feels like the entropy
isn't increasing that much.

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:58.009
So, if you were to take one
billiard ball right over here,

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.750
and you were to roll
it, you were to roll it

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.431
into another billiard
ball right over here,

00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:06.589
and transfer the momentum to that one,

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.969
it feels like that could
go the other way around.

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.908
Like, that other billiard
ball could hit this one

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.196
and go backwards.

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:13.415
And, at a macro level,

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.388
it feels like this is
a reversible process,

00:06:15.388 --> 00:06:18.116
and people will tend to
call this reversible.

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:20.496
But, if you really were to
go on a microscopic level,

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:22.923
and it looks like the entropy
isn't increasing that much,

00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:25.106
but if you were to look at
it on a microscopic level,

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:26.221
and just to be clear, the entropy,

00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:28.100
you know, when this ball is moving

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.227
and this is stationery,

00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:31.235
going to a state where this is moving

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:32.163
and this is stationery,

00:06:32.163 --> 00:06:33.974
it doesn't look like the
entropy is increasing that much.

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.060
And so, that's why they tend
to call this irreversible,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.441
because you tend to observe things

00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:39.995
where maybe this one,
it could go backwards.

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:41.063
This could hit this one

00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:42.171
and then, this one could go,

00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.585
you can kind of run the film in rewind.

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:48.149
But, even there, if you were
to look at a microscopic level,

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.668
you would see that some
heat is being generated,

00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:53.861
and that some molecules in
the ball are getting excited

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:56.183
as they collide, and as they
have friction with the air,

00:06:56.183 --> 00:07:00.025
and as they, roll on the ground over here.

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:01.906
And, you're never going
to get those molecules

00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:04.240
to go back into the state
that they were before,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.339
that you actually do have
the entropy increasing

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.465
in the system.

00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:09.939
So, even when in our every day lives,

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:11.263
in thermodynamics,

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:13.747
people talk about reversible processes.

00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:15.860
They're only approximately reversible,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.227
and that the entropy's only
increasing a little bit.

00:07:19.227 --> 00:07:21.966
It's not like there's
zero increase in entropy.

00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:24.381
Irreversible reactions,
these are the ones.

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.204
Diffusion is a very obvious one,

00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:28.641
where it's very clear
that you have an increase

00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.265
in entropy, and it feels like it's a very,

00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:34.237
very low probability, or
almost zero probability

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:36.396
of this thing ever going
back to where it was.

00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:37.360
And, you won't observe it,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.264
because we were talking
about that many molecules.

00:07:39.264 --> 00:07:41.562
Something with 20 or
30 zero's of molecules.

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:43.559
The odds of all of them
just doing the right thing,

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:45.858
you could wait around a very long time

00:07:45.858 --> 00:07:49.840
and never actually observe that happening.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.024
And so, hopefully this makes sense

00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:52.324
that the disorder in this way,

00:07:52.324 --> 00:07:54.123
the number of states only increases

00:07:54.123 --> 00:07:55.714
as you have more and more interactions.

00:07:55.714 --> 00:07:57.757
And, a lot of that is coming from heat.

00:07:57.757 --> 00:07:59.080
Everything you're doing right now,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.183
when I'm making this video,

00:08:00.183 --> 00:08:01.623
my body is generating heat.

00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:03.480
That heat is dissipating
into the universe.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.500
That is adding to the number of states

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.938
that the universe can actually take on.

00:08:07.938 --> 00:08:09.064
As I move my hands up,

00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:13.058
my little digital pencil that
I'm using is causing friction.

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:14.961
That's releasing heat into the universe.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.622
My computer is running and releasing heat

00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:17.481
into the universe.

00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:19.338
You watching this, releasing
heat into the universe.

00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:21.962
The electrons traveling on
the wire to your computer,

00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:23.355
releasing heat into the universe.

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:25.479
And, all of that is increasing
the number of states.

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:29.572
So, if you're thinking on a
molecular level of everything.
