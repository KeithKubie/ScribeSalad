00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.473
SPEAKER 1: --project
what we decided to do

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:18.450
was make a remote control car.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.750
And in theory, what this is
supposed to be able to do

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.330
was use this accelerometer,
and you controlled it forward,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.180
backwards, left and right.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.457
And it'll tell the
car which way to move.

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:31.290
So there's a lot of
different working parts.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.840
We're able to make
the car move forward,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.340
backwards, left, and right.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.050
We're able to have
it send signals,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.960
and we're able to have it
recognize the accelerometer.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.920
But unfortunately, in
the short time frame,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.670
we weren't able to put
all three together.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.690
But we can show you the
separate parts working.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.731
SPEAKER 2: Just this
transmitter and the receiver

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:49.039
that's not working right now.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.460
Everything else is working.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.490
And then you have an
ultrasound to stop

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.297
before we get to something.

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:01.562
I don't know if you reset
the data, accelerometer

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:02.270
actually working.

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:11.530
If you move this around
[INTERPOSING VOICES] you--

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.610
SPEAKER 1: See it
on this screen.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.460
SPEAKER 2: Go left,
stop, go left, go right.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.560
I mean, the printing,
it's not working,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.520
so you turn this around
to generate right,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.350
turn left, forward, stop.

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:30.160
But this guy does
not understand this.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.450
Somehow it didn't get them to
communicate with each other.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.320
For example, they communicated--

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.210
for example, you telling
the car to go forward, stop

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.950
for a few seconds, and then
turn left, and then stop,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.950
and then turn right.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.997
SPEAKER 1: And it uses
these two radio sensors.

00:01:47.997 --> 00:01:48.580
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.442
For example, they communicate.

00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:53.932
OK, and now this one.

00:01:53.932 --> 00:01:56.930
SPEAKER 1: Actually, you
want to demo the car.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.700
We put it somewhere
it should be able to--

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.760
we just had it going--

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:08.130
if we put it on the floor,
will you be able to capture it?

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.032
SPEAKER 3: Yes.

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:09.615
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:10.198
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:12.585
So if you connect
it will start go.

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:14.070
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.700
So we just have a preset
program on the car

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.070
so you can see it in motion.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.750
So pull it guys to
go get that now.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.166
So as soon as I plug it
in, it should start moving.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:28.832
SPEAKER 4: Nice.

00:02:32.768 --> 00:02:35.720
SPEAKER 5: It does wheelies.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.022
SPEAKER 1: Swing the car again.

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:37.688
SPEAKER 4: Sure.

00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:39.656
SPEAKER 1: Repeat
it in a second.

00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:40.170
Watch out.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.669
Sorry.

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:46.067
SPEAKER 6: Is the ultrasonic
sensor important to get,

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:46.983
or is that next round?

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:47.899
SPEAKER 2: Yes, it is.

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.920
The only thing is
that because you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.140
want it to, from
the accelerometer,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.730
tell this guy to go
forward, and then we have

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.350
the ultrasound in that loop.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.620
Like if he receives the action,
work, but for the presets, no.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.380
The preset is just
to show you that--
