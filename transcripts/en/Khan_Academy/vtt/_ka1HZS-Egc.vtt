00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.810
Let's try to construct a
situation where I participate

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.320
in the new Treasury Public
Private Program.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.510
And I get all of the upside
I would have gotten in a

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.840
traditional just straight up
investment in these toxic

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.570
securities.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.360
But then I'm able to offload
some of the downside.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.100
And so just as a review, what
the program entails is that if

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.130
I want to make an investment
in something.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.689
Let's say I want to make a
$100 or 100% investment.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.130
It doesn't matter.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.810
Either way.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.140
That's 100.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.250
The Fed is going to give us
a loan for 85% of it.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.900
And then the remainder, the
equity, is going to be split

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.960
half, or 50-50, between myself
and the Treasury.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.960
And then this is the
private investor.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.120
So what happens here?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.430
And we talked a lot about it in
the last couple of videos.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.240
Is that the upside, if this
thing is worth more than 100,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.990
it's split between the Treasury

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.370
and the private investor.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.980
And then the downside is split
between the private investor

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.720
and the Treasury.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.220
Until the asset becomes
worth less than 85% of

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.020
its original value.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.550
And then the Fed takes
the hit, right?

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.320
Because this loan won't
be worth anything.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.820
And all this loan can go
after is this asset.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.560
It's a non recourse loan.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.270
The Fed can't say, oh, this
thing is only worth 84.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.630
Private investor and Treasury,
you guys owe me a dollar.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.250
The Fed is just left with this
asset that might be worth

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.390
something less than that.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.300
But how could we use this
program to get the same upside

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.030
we would have otherwise gotten,
if we had just bought

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.530
the toxic security outright?

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.970
So let's say that the toxic
security, in a before-this

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.570
program world that Geithner
has come up with.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.130
Let's say that I'm willing to
pay $30 for a security.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.360
And obviously if the security
is worth $40, I'll make $10.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.490
If it's worth $50,
I'll make $20.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.480
And so forth and so on.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.610
That's obvious.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.110
Now what I can do is, instead
of just, with this plan-- I

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.640
mean, before I would have to
take my $30 that I have in the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.880
bank, and use it to buy some
asset, if one of these banks

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.589
were willing to sell it to me.

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.550
But what I can do now is, I
could say, well, let me just

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.450
take 15% of this.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.390
So what's 15% of $30?

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.210
It's $4.50.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.420
And use that to invest
in this program.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.250
And essentially get the same
upside as I would if I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.690
invested the whole $30.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.800
And then put the rest of the
cash away essentially safe, so

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.140
that my worst case is that I
just lose what I invest. So

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.080
let's do that.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.780
And we'll see that the numbers
do all work out.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.860
So instead of just doing $30
all for the investment, I'm

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.020
going to set aside 15%.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.820
So I'm going to put $4.50 to
participate in the plan.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.900
And then I'm going to set
aside what's left.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.190
$25.50 in cash.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.840
And using this $4.50 in the
plan, I'll show you that I'll

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.610
get all of the upside that I got
if I had originally had to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.790
use all $30 by myself.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.370
And obviously my downside
is limited.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.925
My downside is limited to the
$4.50, because I'm still going

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:09.730
to have the $25.50 in
cash on the side.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.760
So how is this going to work?

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.660
I'm going to put in $4.50.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.200
That's from me, the
private investor.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.140
The Treasury is going to
match my investment.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.310
$4.50.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.560
That's the Treasury.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.550
Now I have $9 of equity.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.040
And this is going to be 15% of
the total equity, so the debt

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.610
that the Fed will lend me
is going to be $51.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.580
And I did the math before I did
the video, but you could

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.880
work it out yourself.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.100
$51 loan from the Fed.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.190
And so what's our total capital
that we've raised now?

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.320
So if you add $51 plus
$9, we have $60.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.150
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.600
We now have $60.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.230
And we could use that $60.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.640
If someone was willing to sell
me one, I guess we could say

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.520
one of the units, or one of the
securities for $30, now

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.570
with $60, we can buy
two of the units.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.420
So we could buy two
of them for $30.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.750
And why did I end up making the
math work so we'd get two

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.770
securities?

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.020
Because we split the
upside, right?

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.090
We split the upside
with the Treasury.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.800
So in order to set up a
situation where I get all of

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.140
the upside that I would have
gotten with a $30 security, I

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.820
essentially have to set up a
configuration where we buy

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.270
twice as many securities.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.840
I buy twice as many securities,
and then I split

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.415
the upside 50-50 with the
Treasury, then I'm just going

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:52.230
to get the upside.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.750
You could almost view
it on one security.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.770
Let's see how the math
works out now.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.050
Let's do a bunch of scenarios.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.060
So in the world where-- maybe
I should do a table.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.910
Yeah, let's say that the
eventual value of the

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.930
security, let's say it's worth--
I'm going to make a

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.020
bunch of numbers up.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:25.140
0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.050
That's good enough.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.000
So let's say that these
securities end

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.200
up being worth nothing.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.050
How much am I left with?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.670
What's the total value of
my total investment?

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.100
Well if these are worth
nothing, then I

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.860
get wiped out here.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.860
We all get wiped out here.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.510
In fact, everyone gets
wiped out here.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.140
So how much did I lose?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.760
Well my $4.50 is gone.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.660
This goes to 0.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.160
But what is my total investment
left with?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.590
I still have my $25.50 that
I put to the side, right?

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:01.650
So I still have my
$25.50 in cash.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.750
If each of these securities
are worth $10, this is

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.680
eventual value of each
of the units.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.440
So if each of these is worth
$10, then the whole asset side

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.760
of this balance sheet is worth
$20, and once again, the Fed

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.570
is going to take a $31 hit.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.850
And these two guys
are wiped out.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.720
So my investment is
worth nothing.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.130
But I still have that money
I set aside in the bank.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.750
$25.50.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.480
If these securities are worth
$20, then this whole asset

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.785
side is worth $40, because
there's going

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:32.980
to be two of them.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.240
The Fed is still taking a hit.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.370
Doesn't get all its
money back.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.010
And these two guys still
get wiped out.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.100
My $4.50 is gone.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.120
I still have my money
in my bank. $25.50.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.850
If this security is worth $30,
which is essentially the price

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.150
that we're paying for it.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.850
Then this is what the balance
sheet is going to look like.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.710
So my equity is worth $4.50.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.720
But I have $4.50 plus
the money that I

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.530
had set aside, right?

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.070
I have $4.50 plus this
$25.50 that I'd put

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.280
aside in the bank.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.610
Because I didn't have
to invest that.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.600
I just had to invest the
$4.50 initially.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.960
So I have my $4.50 here,
plus $25.50.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.510
So the value of all of my
investments is $30.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.780
What

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.650
Happens if each of these
units are worth $40.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.110
If each of these are worth $40,
then we have $80 on the

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.600
left-hand side of the
balance sheet.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.170
So let me draw that
really small here.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.310
So then we'll have two units
that are worth $40.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.190
That's $80.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.190
We owe $51 to the Fed.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.920
So we're going to have $29
to split between the

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.170
Treasury and ourselves.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.420
$29 divided by 2 is $14.50.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.600
We're each going to
split that $29.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.290
So my equity is now
worth $14.50.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.500
So my total investment is going
to be the cash that I

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.910
put aside-- so that's,
let's say, $25.50.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.200
Plus the value of my equity
investment now.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.660
So that's plus $14.50.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.340
And so it's worth $40.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.760
I think you see the
pattern here.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.320
In all of these kind of downside
scenarios, the most I

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.600
lost was $4.50.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.660
And now in all of these upside
scenarios, we're going to see

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.790
that I get the value of
the actual security.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.450
Now let's do it for $50, but I
think you know how the math's

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.480
going to work out.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.950
If each of these ends up being
worth $50, then this whole

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.700
left-hand side is $100.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.440
We owe the Fed $51.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.309
So this is going to be $49.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:44.700
And if you split that,
it's $24.50.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.450
The money we set aside in
the bank is $25.50.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.700
And so this is worth $50.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.460
And, likewise, if these are each
worth $60, this is going

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.190
to turn out to be $60.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.240
So what you see here,
and I'm going to

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.490
draw a payoff diagram.

00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:03.440
Let me draw a line here.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.030
Let's see if I can
do this right.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.300
So if this is the eventual
value of the asset.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.280
When we pay something in the
market, we're hoping we're

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.250
buying it for less than its
real value, but we really

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.910
don't know 100% what the
eventual value is.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.100
But this x-axis is the
eventual value.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:42.270
So it could be 10, 20,
30, 40, 50, 60, and

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.640
so on and so forth.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.060
So depending on this eventual
value, what is the value of my

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.270
investment?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.880
So we figured out if it's 0, 10,
20, all the way really up

00:09:52.880 --> 00:10:02.850
to-- The value of my investment
is going to be-- I

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.400
didn't have to draw this stuff
down here-- let's say that

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.420
this is $24.50.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:18.580
So in all of these scenarios--
whoops, trying to draw a

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:29.310
line-- so 20, and
then at $25.50.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.780
If this thing is worth--
We could figure out the

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.640
break-even, right?

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.460
If these assets are worth
anything more combined than

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.750
$51, then we start to have
value to the equity.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.080
So what's that value?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.560
That's this divided
by 2 is $25.50.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.860
So after $25.50 some value
starts going to the equity.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.550
And we know at $30-- let me draw
those points, actually.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.200
I'll do it in a different color
when we're in the money.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:04.660
So at $30, the value of
our security is 30.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.820
At $40, the value of
our security is 40.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.990
And so on and so forth.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.345
And let me draw a line now.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.422
That's not what I
wanted to do.

00:11:16.422 --> 00:11:17.960
I'll just draw a regular line.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.120
Our payoff would look
something like this.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.920
This is a good visualization
for what the

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.850
government is giving us.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.790
And I'll show you that what
they're giving us is

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.010
essentially insurance, or
a put option for free.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.820
And then we can talk in the
next video about how

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.870
we can value it.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.800
And then we have a real sense
of what the government is

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.530
handing over to the investor.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.360
Now, you might say that it's
handing it to the investor,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.750
but if because of this the
investor overpays for the

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.990
asset, that subsidy is
really going to the

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.270
person selling the asset.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.420
And we'll talk about
that a little bit

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.220
more in the next video.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.520
But let me just finish
this up a little bit.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.660
So we said that the point
at which we start

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:58.690
making money is here.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.370
Because this is what we
paid for the security.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.090
We're paying $30 for
the security.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.690
So these are all the scenarios
where we start making money.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.040
Where the security's worth
more than that.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:18.010
But the equity's actually worth
something above $25.50,

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.730
but we're still taking
a slight loss.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.230
But the cool thing is, if we are
the private investor here,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.580
even if the thing is worth very
little, we don't take

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.250
that much of a loss here.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.050
And this is much better.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.430
What would the payoff diagram
have looked like if we were

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.330
just a straight-up investor?

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.930
Let me just draw that in
a different color.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.870
Well then it would've looked
something like this.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.363
We would have had
the same upside.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.920
But our downside would've
gone all the way to 0.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.240
If the asset is worth 0, we
would have been worth-- well,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.006
these lines were supposed to
be on top of each other.

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:57.260
But I think you get the idea
that the government is saving

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.800
us from these losses
right here.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.705
Oh, I think you can't see it.

00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:02.430
I'm off the screen.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.240
The government's saving us from
these losses right there.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.700
And so I'm out of time
in this video.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.190
In the next video, I'm going to
actually analyze what that

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.850
subsidy or what that insurance
or that option that the

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.990
government is giving us,
what it might be worth.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.370
And then we could think about
whether now people are willing

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.040
to actually overpay
for these things.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.910
See you in the next video.
