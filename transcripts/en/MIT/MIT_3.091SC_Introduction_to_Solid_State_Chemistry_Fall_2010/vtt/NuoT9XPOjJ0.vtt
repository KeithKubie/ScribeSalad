00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.950
PROFESSOR: So now we're going
to start Part (b).

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.730
First we're going to
read the question.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.260
To which does an atom of argon
form a stronger bond: another

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.830
argon atom or an atom
of krypton.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.690
Justify your choice with an
explanation, using narrative

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.010
or cartoons or both that makes
reference to the operative

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.540
chemical bonding.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.580
So again, he's not just asking
you for one or the other, but

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.840
that you give an explanation
to show that you understand

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
the concepts that are
being tested.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:04.290
Here we're asked: does argon
bond stronger with another

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.580
argon or krypton.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090
And some students were confused
by the usage of the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.650
term bond here.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.310
But remember that bond doesn't
necessarily mean a covalent or

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.330
an ionic bond, it can also mean
intermolecular bonds,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.810
which we have been using in
Part (a), so it might seem

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.400
logical that we would think
about intermolecular

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.350
bonds in Part (b).

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.430
Now we need to look at the
specific species we are asked

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.960
to consider here.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.410
Argon and krypton are both Nobel
gases, and what do we

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.130
know about Nobel gases?

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.420
They have complete octets; they
don't bond very often,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.440
and so, especially
to each other.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.170
Therefore.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.500
we will probably be looking at
intermolecular bonds, as I

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.720
said before, but also
the weakest form,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.970
which is Van der Waals.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.510
We're looking at Van der Waals,
because each of these

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.440
are a mono-atomic species.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.830
That is, they just are gases as
one atom of argon and one

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.110
atom of krypton.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.740
And so, Van der Waals is the
only type of interaction they

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.460
can have. As I said in Part (a),
Van der Waals has to do

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.010
with the movement of electrons
in an induced dipole.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.900
And what does that mean?

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.070
So, we're going to talk
a little bit about

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.320
polarizability.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.250
And polarizability is basically
how easy is it to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.610
induce a dipole into the
atom or molecule.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.210
And because these are non-polar
atoms, obviously, we

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.790
want to think about what can
cause a difference in

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.200
polarizability between
argon and krypton.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.720
So if you think about it,
we're going to do a very

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.770
simplistic model of the atom.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.950
We have a cloud of electrons,
and to get intermolecular

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.290
interactions, we want to have
a partial negative and a

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.360
partial positive induced
in the atom.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.730
And this can be due to just
spontaneous fluctuations in

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.810
the electron density or to an
external charge or another

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.280
molecule or something.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.710
But here we have two non-polar
atoms, so we want to see which

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.760
one will inherently be
easier to polarize.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.770
And so if we go back to our
two species here, we have

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:06.830
argon, which has 18 electrons
and krypton,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.920
which has 36 electrons.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.100
So based on our discussion of
polarizability, we can see

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.960
that krypton is going to have
a greater amount of

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.250
polarizability, because it has
a larger cloud of electrons.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.420
Those electrons are bound
less strongly.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.040
As we know from our periodic
trends, krypton is a larger

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.220
atom, and so we are going to say
that the polarizability of

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:45.080
krypton is greater than argon.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.000
As we talked about in Part (a),
even though these had the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.250
same type of intermolecular
bonds, if one of them exhibits

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.920
a higher difference in partial
charges as krypton will, then

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.220
it results in a stronger bond.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:13.500
And so the answer here would be
that krypton has a stronger

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:38.660
interaction because it
is more polarizable.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.910
And that because is important.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.370
Remember, when you're answering
a question, you

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.880
don't just want to put down the
answer, you want to show

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.770
that you know why that's the
answer, and that you

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.540
understand the concepts.
