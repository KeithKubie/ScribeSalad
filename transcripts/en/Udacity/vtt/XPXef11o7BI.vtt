00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.990
Well to write in slope intercept form,
I know that it's going to be y equals m,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.160
which is two,
that's my slope from before, times x,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.170
plus, well whatever b is and
I need to find b.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.930
I'm going to manipulate
one of these equations and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.500
you could choose either one, I'm
going to choose this first one and so

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.410
I'm ignoring the bottom one for now.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.609
And what I'm going to do is first
distribute this two on the right-hand

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.328
side, which gives me y minus
eight equals two x minus two.

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:28.251
Next I'm going to add
eight to both sides and

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.846
that gives me y equals two x plus six.

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:34.740
So it looks like zero,
six would be my y intercept and

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.760
my b would just be six, excellent work.
