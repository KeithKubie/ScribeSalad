00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.016
 Reia was founded in 2011 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.168
 Seventh year of this year 

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:11.744
 And we just launched seven games. 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.344
 That is the CYTUS series that players are familiar with. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.768
 "DEEMO", "VOEZ", etc. 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.696
 All games are in more than 100 countries 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.144
 And the region won the first place 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.456
 That other type of game 

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:22.568
 Contains "Mandora" like casual 

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:25.640
 "Implosion" of the action RPG class 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.376
 Almost all games we have in the store 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.856
 I got the first place on the total list. 

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:32.080
 I think the game itself is created. 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.984
 It is also like playing a game 

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:39.568
 It has a very artistic and subjective component at the perceptual level. 

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:43.536
 In rationality, you must also have a profound analysis of commerciality. 

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:45.072
 Then after the work is released 

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:46.672
 Can support yourself outside 

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.952
 Then make one can 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.128
 a work that makes your creative desires satisfied 

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:53.456
 Development of a game 

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:54.952
 If there are good tools 

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:58.552
 It actually can greatly reduce the cost of communication 

00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:00.664
 When Cytus II is on the shelves 

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.000
 Our Crash Rate is 8% 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.328
 That's because there is a very convenient Android vitals dashboard background 

00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:09.784
 Let us monitor which version is in 

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:12.168
 Or what are the problems on the models? 

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:13.624
 So after the instant adjustment 

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:16.192
 We then fell to 0.12% 

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:18.024
 Let it make a good 

00:01:18.024 --> 00:01:19.816
 Stability score 

00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:25.632
 That Google Play Console 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.240
 Provides a great staged release feature 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.560
 Like internal test 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.848
 Can let our internal QA staff 

00:01:31.848 --> 00:01:34.136
 You can play the latest version every day. 

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.040
 That Close test and Open test 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.824
 Can let us limit all players worldwide 

00:01:38.824 --> 00:01:40.632
 What kind of people do we want to play? 

00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:41.776
 We are on the Play Console 

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:44.976
 You can see all the players in different languages ​​directly. 

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:45.768
 Give us feedback 

00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:49.480
 And it will be translated directly into the language used by our developers. 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.992
 That goes further 

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:53.056
 It goes to summarizing the different feedbacks 

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:56.472
 There may be a negative comment on the crash, it will be brought together 

00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:59.376
 That is to say, there is a problem with the performance of the art. 

00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:02.360
 Can greatly improve the efficiency of our development 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.056
 The Google Play Console provides an A/B test feature 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.464
 Through different store graphic design, or icon design 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.128
 Then we can collect what kind of pixels everyone is 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.496
 There will be a better conversion rate 

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:14.544
 The final result of our game page to 

00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:16.456
 Download conversion rate increased by 10% 

00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:20.416
 That is 4.8 percent higher than all games of the same type. 

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:24.240
 Then we think this will be a function that is very easy for developers. 

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:30.144
 In fact, we don’t just think of Raya as a game developer. 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.792
 But think of it as a content provider 

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:36.224
 In fact, the platform will change with the times and technology. 

00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:39.112
 But it really will keep the player in mind. 

00:02:39.112 --> 00:02:42.504
 In fact, in the process of creation, and in the process of play. 

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:43.784
 The feelings obtained 

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:45.096
 So we will also want to say 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.000
 Really create a touch that allows players to stay in the bottom of their hearts 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.216
 And IP 

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:53.760
 This will be what Reya will do and will do in the future.
