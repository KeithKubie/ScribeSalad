00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.610
 In this lesson I will reveal to you what it is 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.860
 One of the five most useful equations 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.550
 In mathematics. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.460
 If I have seen a number of my teachers before, you will know that I am not a provocateur 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.660
 On the save. 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.400
 However, I advise you to remember 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.776
 And study the method of proving them 

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:22.940
 Because it is not good to remember things 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.870
 Without knowing where it came from
