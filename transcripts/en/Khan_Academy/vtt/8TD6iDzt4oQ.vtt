00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.410
Let's add 249 to 383.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.530
Now, the first thing you want
to do with any type of

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.860
addition problem, especially
when you have multiple digits,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.490
is to write the two numbers
above and below each other.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.290
So we have 200-- let me write
a little bigger than that--

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.050
249 plus 383.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.170
And you want to line them up
so that we have the same

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.980
places above and below
each other.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.550
So the 9 and the 3 are both in
the ones place here, so we've

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.470
lined them up.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.600
The 4 and the 8 are both in the
tens place, and the 2 and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.890
the 3 are both in the
hundreds place.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770
If you had a thousands place in
one of them and not in the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.840
other, it would just kind of
be sitting out here by

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.640
themselves.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.590
The easiest thing is just to
kind of both make them line up

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.160
to the right, or the
ones places.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.870
Now I'll show you the process,
but while we do the process,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.520
we'll think a little bit about
why it makes sense.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.320
So we start at the ones place,
and we say what is 9 plus 3?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.000
So we say 9 plus 3.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.990
Well, that's equal to 12.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.740
I'm writing the 1 in 12 in
orange on purpose, because

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.770
when you want to write the sum
down here, you can't write a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.660
two-digit number.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.560
You can only write a digit
between 0 and 9.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.625
So what we do is 9 plus
3 is 12, that's the

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:15.270
equivalent of 10 plus 2.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.720
So we write the 2 in the ones
place, and the 1, which is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.740
really representing 10, we put
in the tens place, which

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.710
hopefully makes sense.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.960
This now represents 10.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.960
And now we want to add this
10 plus 40 plus 80.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.710
It looks like we're adding a 1
to a 4 to an 8, but these are

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.430
really in the tens place,
so this is really a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.920
10, a 40 and an 80.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.810
But if you just think about
the process, you just take

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.050
your 1, you add it to your 4 and
your 8-- plus 4 plus 8--

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.340
and what do you get?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.040
1 plus 4 plus 8 is what?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.370
5 plus 8, that is 13.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.200
I'll write it like this.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.860
Actually, this is in the tens
place, so it actually

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.540
represents 130, but you don't
have to think about that.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.830
The process is fairly
straightforward.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.740
You have 13.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.700
You write the 3 down here, and
we regroup the 1 or, you might

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.130
have learned, you carry
the 1, so then you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.650
carry the 1 up here.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.590
Same process now in the
hundreds place.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.730
This 1 actually represent a
hundred, because this was

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.190
actually 130 because it
was in the tens place.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.900
So we have a 1 plus 2 plus
3, what is that?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.040
Well, that's just 6, right?

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.060
1 plus 2 is 3 plus 3 is 6.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.715
So that is equal to 6.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.600
So we write it right
over here.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.680
So 249 plus 383 is 632.
