00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.210
MALE SPEAKER: Well good
morning and welcome to Authors

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.700
at Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.280
Today it's my enormous pleasure
to introduce Joel Christian

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.975
Gill.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:21.060
And before I launch into the
prepared portion of my remarks,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.240
I have to say that Joel is
the first author we've ever

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.000
had in Cambridge whom
I've spotted actually

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.135
selling a copy of his book
on the way to the talk.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.260
The security guard
downstairs bought a copy.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.190
Well done, Joel.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.970
He's staying for lunch.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.040
Please feel free to join us.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.740
The cafeteria staff may
each get a copy too.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.580
Who knows?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.260
I don't know.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.270
Nobody is safe, clearly.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.120
Anyway, more formally,
Joel is the Associate Dean

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.040
of Student Affairs of New
Hampshire Institute of Art.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.350
And he is a member of the
Boston Comics Roundtable.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.485
He received his
Master in Fine Arts

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:05.519
from Boston University and
a BA from Roanoke College.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.120
He's here today to
discuss his provocatively

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.020
titled and amazing graphic
anthology, "Strange Fruit,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.760
Volume One: Uncelebrated
Narratives from Black History."

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.600
He has uncovered and
retells in dramatic fashion

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.740
nine stories of extraordinary
African Americans

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.530
whose lives have been
long forgotten by most.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.035
I was excited to learn about
these strong individuals,

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:32.540
and I know you will be too.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.163
Please join me in welcoming
Joel Christian Gill.

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:41.870
JOEL CHRISTIAN GILL: That
makes me sound so much more

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.465
impressive, to hear
someone else talk about me.

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:47.090
Well thank you guys
for having me down.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.220
I appreciate the
opportunity to come down

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.100
and talk to you about my work.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.160
I'm going to talk about a
few things this morning.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.610
I'm going to talk
specifically about how

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.380
I came to the idea of calling
my book Strange Fruit,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.030
and what the inspiration
for that was.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.990
Because that seems to be
a really common question

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.440
that people ask me.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.337
Why did you title your
book "Strange Fruit"?

00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:14.920
I'm going to talk
to you how I came up

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.580
with the stories
for "Strange Fruit"

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.890
because you all have the book.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.390
As you can see,
some of these things

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.930
are very obscure,
very-- sort of-- you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.075
have to find them in a
lot of different places.

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:26.450
And then I'm going
to talk to you

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.370
specifically about
how I make the comic.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.370
And then I'm going
to read and show you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.110
on the screen one of the
stories, my favorite story

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.210
in "Strange Fruit,"
which is called

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.455
"Two Letters" about a
slave name Spotswood Rice.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.740
I went to college
initially to draw comics.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.010
And in southwestern
Virginia where I'm from,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.370
there weren't any
illustration programs.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.680
And so I went into a
graphic design program.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.022
And my second semester in,
I took a painting class.

00:03:00.022 --> 00:03:01.730
And if you've ever
taken a painting class

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.188
and been artistically
inclined, you

00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:05.580
know that it's like a
puzzle you can't solve.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.650
And so you go down
that rabbit hole,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.510
trying to figure out how to
solve that problem of painting.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.820
And one of the
most common issues

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.340
with painters-- with anybody
who makes any type of art--

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.090
is how you get your inspiration.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.240
Like, where does it come from?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.410
And at the time,
I had a professor

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.200
whose name was Brian Sieveking.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.450
He was my drawing teacher
and he was really brilliant.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.850
And he did these paintings
of southern rock stars,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.580
or sideshow freaks.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.320
You know, like the Incredible
Half boy, or the Human Trunk.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.140
So I remember
thinking to myself,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.970
why do you paint the
things that you do?

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.320
They just all seem
really disconnected.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.740
And he said, well
I collect folk art.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.690
And when I was in
college, I had gone

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.030
through this process
of trying to make

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.670
these paintings about
how bad Nicaragua was.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.270
And how messed up the
situation in Nicaragua was.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.080
And at the same time,
I met Howard Finster,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.840
who was a pretty
famous folk artist.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.367
If you guys have ever seen REM's
cover, the lead singer of REM

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:16.950
is actually sitting in this rock
garden, Howard Finster's rock

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.810
garden in Georgia.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.279
He said, I met Howard Finster.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.640
And Howard Finster paints
these amazing things.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.350
He paints Elvis as a baby.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.120
Or he paints Henry Ford's wife.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.600
Or he paints this
amazing painting

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.760
called, "The Path to Hell is
Paved With Good Intentions."

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.300
And he said, I met
Howard Finster,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.169
and I realized that because
he's a folk artist-- which

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.210
are these people who are
sort of outside artists,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.293
they didn't go to college,
and they start painting

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:43.190
in their 60s-- he
said, he had this one

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.850
hand in cable television.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.480
And he had the other
hand in the church.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.326
And so he had these
two conflicting things

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:51.450
that were happening to him.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.130
So he was painting the things
that were interesting to him.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.140
And he said, so I looked back
at those paintings in Nicaragua,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.500
and I was like, I don't
really care about Nicaragua.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.150
I mean, yeah, it's bad, but
I don't really care about it.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.700
And at the same time, he
was writing these things

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.455
about Ty Cobb.

00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:07.570
And he's a really big
baseball historian.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.139
So he said, I did these
paintings of Ty Cobb.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.430
And everybody thought these
paintings were much better.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.170
And the difference between
those paintings of Ty Cobb

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.910
and the paintings that
I was doing before,

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.020
is that these are something
that I'm interested in.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.724
And so I immediately
thought to myself,

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:24.890
that's what I'm going to do.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.015
I'm going to find something
that I'm interested in,

00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:29.290
and I'm going to
do paintings of it.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.550
About that same time,
there was an article

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.900
in the paper in Roanoke,
Virginia, where I'm from.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.720
Roanoke is a small city.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.430
I live right outside of
Manchester, New Hampshire now.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.330
Manchester's really small.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.807
And so it's about the same size.

00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:45.390
So there was an
article in the Roanoke

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.130
Times about a tree
that had fallen.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.730
Typically trees falling
is not a news event, even

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.100
in a small city.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.850
But this tree was supposed
to have been cursed.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.310
And the article
was about the curse

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.740
of this tree falling
because it was

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.250
the centerpiece
of a lynching that

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.620
happened in Roanoke,
Virginia in 1893.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.872
So I wanted to
know more about it.

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:15.830
So I went back and looked
at some of the images

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.570
in the newspaper
about the lynchings.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.680
And this is from the
Roanoke Daily Record.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.250
If you can see the very
top left hand corner,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.380
it says, Negroes Lynched.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.350
There was a woman, a farmer, who
was going into Roanoke to sell

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.630
her wares at the farmer's
market, which is not

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.600
unlike Quincy Market, you know,
Faneuil Hall sort of place.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.810
She was selling grapes.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.170
And while she was
selling the grapes,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.690
a man approached her and asked
her how much the grapes were.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.430
And she said, $0.60.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.630
He told her, he said,
well I'll give you

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.000
more of those if you
actually deliver them.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.230
So she agreed.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.080
And then she followed him.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.000
So she followed him
down an alleyway.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.130
And he got to a place
where there was a gate.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.690
Once he got her
through the gate,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.270
he shut the gate behind
him and pulled out a razor,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.530
and said to give me your money.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.580
So she proceeded to give him her
purse, which had $2.00 in it.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.340
And she begged for her life.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.090
And she begged and pleaded
for him not to kill her.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.372
And he immediately grabbed her
and tried to slit her throat.

00:07:24.372 --> 00:07:27.036
Well, she fought him off.

00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:29.285
And when she fought him off,
she knocked the razor out

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:29.850
of his hand.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.550
But in the struggle, he
was able to grab a brick

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.480
and he beat her until she was
unconscious with the brick,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.870
and left her there
in a pool of blood.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.060
She was found later
by the authorities.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.500
And they took her to
the local hospital.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.925
And because this happened
near a black neighborhood,

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:49.550
the police went to
a black neighborhood

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.270
looking for a suspect.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.290
This was before she had given
a description or anything.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.910
So they found a
man named Thomas.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.775
And they brought
Thomas to the hospital.

00:07:58.775 --> 00:08:04.530
And in her fugue, they asked
her if she could identify Thomas

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.310
as the guy who had beat
her in this alleyway.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.920
And she said she couldn't be
sure, but show me his hat.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.050
If you show me his
hat, I can be sure.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.680
So they showed her the hat,
and she said that's him.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.760
Thomas was taken to jail.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.390
And he was locked
up in the jail.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.280
Now at the time, Roanoke
was a stop on the railroad.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.145
And there was all
these railroad riders

00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:36.020
who had stopped in
Roanoke, and they were all

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.850
hanging out in these bars
by the railroad tracks.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.289
Somehow it got to them that
this horrible thing had happened

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.320
to this woman, and that it was
a black man that had done it.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.880
And like most mobs in a drunken
fugue, they went to the jail.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.920
And the sheriff was
able to deter them.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.550
He came out, sort
of talked them down,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.890
had a conversation with them.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.110
And they dispersed.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.680
Well, they were not
to be turned away.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.950
In the meantime, the mayor
got together with the sheriff

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.220
and said, we need
to do something

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.502
to keep these people out.

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:14.960
So they called in
the local militia

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.600
to protect the prison, the jail.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.700
So the militia
surrounded the jail.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.920
And the mob came back.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.826
When the mob came
back, they were larger,

00:09:26.826 --> 00:09:28.200
they were more
menacing, and they

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.580
were trying to attack the jail.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.250
Something happened, and the
militia fired on the crowd.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.980
And they killed nine people.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.314
When the dust cleared, that
only made the people madder.

00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:42.146
You would think it would
make them disperse,

00:09:42.146 --> 00:09:43.680
but it would make them madder.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.100
So they regrouped.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.290
And in the meantime, the mayor
and the sheriff got together,

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.280
and they were going to send
Thomas to Lynchburg, Virginia

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.670
to get him away from the mob.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.470
So they put him on
a cart, and they

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.700
started taking him to Lynchburg.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.050
He got about five
miles out of Lynchburg

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.650
when the mob caught up with him.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.820
And they wrapped the rope
around his neck and they drug

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.230
him back to Roanoke.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.920
They drug him through
the street, people

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.040
shooting at him the entire time,
and they hung him in a tree.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.910
They shot him more.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.230
They placed a sign on the
front, said do not remove,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.260
by order of Judge Lynch.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.200
And a sign on the back, because
they were mad at the mayor,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.270
that this is the mayor's friend.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.494
So in those three days, he
just hung there, his body.

00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:40.410
And people would go by
and they would actually

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.960
strip pieces of clothing,
even pieces of his skin

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.052
off as souvenirs.

00:10:45.052 --> 00:10:46.510
This happened for
a couple of days,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.860
and at the end of
the three days,

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.175
the coroner came with
a number of officials,

00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:55.930
and they were going to
pull this body down.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.950
And at the time, they
came to the conclusion

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.730
that he was killed
by unknown people

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.150
under unknown circumstances.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.700
And so as they take him down--
they're going to go bury him--

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.090
another mob shows back up.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.590
This mob, just as
enraged as the first mob,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.070
they're going to take
his body and bury it

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.610
at the mayor's house.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.980
A prominent minister
had been out of town.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.290
When he heard about
this, he decided

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.560
to come in to be the cooler
head and talk them out of it.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.360
So instead of burying this body
of this man-- who, by the way,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.660
had not been convicted,
hadn't been proven innocent,

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.270
hadn't been proven
guilty, no one

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.880
knew it was all about a hat.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.310
They put him in
a railroad wagon.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.450
They piled him up with lumber.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.730
And then they poured coal
oil on his body and drug

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.650
it down and paraded
it through town,

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.680
down to the river, where they
actually lit this body on fire

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.090
and burned it over
the course of a day.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.860
And people came out
and had picnics,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.420
they brought their children.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.540
Sort of like, this is what
happens when you do something.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.550
So I read about this
in the newspaper.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.820
And so I thought, this is
something I'm interested in.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:22.200
So I decided to do some
paintings based on those,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.027
with no fixed understanding
about what the paintings would

00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:27.110
be about, they were just
paintings about lynching.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.880
So I was working at
Kinko's at the time.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.650
So I would sit at Kinko's
until 3:00 or 4:00 o'clock

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.640
in the morning, and I
would draw and print out

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.500
these lynching images.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.800
After about a week of doing
this, as you can probably

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.700
imagine, I was disturbed
and thought to myself,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.900
I can't do this.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.550
This not something
that I can do.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.300
So I stopped doing it and
just put it aside, always

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.960
in the back of my mind.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.560
In the meantime, I moved
from southwestern Virginia

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.110
to Boston to go to
BU for grad school.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.690
My wife moved our
four kids to BU

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.090
so that I could
go to grad school.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:09.070
And just to recap about
that town I grew up in,

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.805
southwestern Virginia
is beautiful,

00:13:10.805 --> 00:13:12.430
if you ever get a
chance to go and see.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.830
Roanoke is called the
star city of the South.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.100
It's an amazing city.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.794
If you know anybody who's ever
hiked the Appalachian Trail,

00:13:17.794 --> 00:13:19.460
that's where they end
up in some places.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.720
People stop along the way.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.030
And I'm actually from
a little smaller town

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.370
outside called Rocky Mount.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.180
Which its claim to fame is the
moonshine capital of the world.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.400
When I was in third
grade, there was

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.340
a Klan march in Rocky Mount.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.110
This was about 1983.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.570
Now I grew up in the
projects in this small town.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.224
And I was never
afraid to go anywhere.

00:13:42.224 --> 00:13:43.890
Me and my friends,
we didn't have money.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.910
So we had bikes.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.360
And so that was
our entertainment.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.609
We would ride our bikes
places, sit in apple trees

00:13:49.609 --> 00:13:51.150
and eat people's
apples and cherries,

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.990
and never was afraid
to go anywhere.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.010
So I move in to Boston.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.506
So that was a
culture shock to me,

00:13:56.506 --> 00:13:57.880
because now the
black people were

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.929
speaking a different language.

00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:02.470
Which was odd to me, because
all the black people in Virginia

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.210
spoke English.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.870
I'd been here for
about two weeks

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:13.342
and I took a trip to the MFA
with the painting class at BU.

00:14:13.342 --> 00:14:15.800
And they had this thing called
the Brandt Collection, which

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.670
was a collection of modern art
that was separate from the MFA.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.350
So we got in for
free, but you had

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.980
to pay to get into
this other thing.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.780
And there were two
security guards there,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.950
and they were black.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.930
And one of them heard
my southern accent,

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.110
and he was just like,
hey, you from the South?

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.480
I was stationed in
the South, and I

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.770
dated this woman in the South.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.640
And he started talking to me
and sort of being my friend.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.890
And I asked him how much it
was to get into the Brandt

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.130
Collection, and he said
it's free, go ahead.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.949
Go on in.

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:43.490
So let me into the
Brandt Collection,

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.397
and I walked around,
and I came out.

00:14:45.397 --> 00:14:46.980
And then he started
talking, asking me

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.830
how long I'd been in Boston,
what I thought of the city

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.930
so far.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.500
He asked me if I
was into sports.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.429
And I said, I'm not
really into sports.

00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:56.970
I live about four
blocks from Fenway,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.912
but I really like basketball.

00:14:59.912 --> 00:15:01.120
He said, you close to Fenway?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.744
I'm like, yeah.

00:15:01.744 --> 00:15:03.630
He's like, I was born
and raised in Boston.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.129
But I'll never roof
for the Red Sox.

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:06.620
I'm a Yankees fan.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.000
And now I hadn't
been in Boston long,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.050
but I knew that if you were
a Yankees fan in Boston,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.100
that was kind of like being
a prostitute in church.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.830
Like, you're sweating.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.760
Or Mike Tyson at a
spelling bee, or something.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.620
It was like-- it was
something you didn't do.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.264
So I was like, how do
you become a Yankees fan

00:15:25.264 --> 00:15:26.180
if you live in Boston?

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.310
He said, the Red Sox are
a racist organization

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.970
historically.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.590
And he pulled out
this laminated article

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.120
that he'd been
carrying around that

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.480
was written by this
sportswriter in Worcester

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.040
about Boston and race.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.350
And one of the things he
said in there was Boston

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.440
has two sports legends
in its history.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.670
They have Ted Williams
and Bill Russell.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.210
Ted Williams never won anything.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.550
Bill Russell won
11 championships,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.660
and who do they name
the tunnel after?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.220
And I was like, wow.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.290
I had never thought of that.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.150
He said that the
manager of the Red Sox

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.029
passed on every black
player, including

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:06.820
Hank Aaron, because he
said he wasn't going

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.530
to sit around waiting
for some nigger.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.665
And I was like, I didn't know--
that was common in Virginia,

00:16:13.665 --> 00:16:15.790
like, that's the kind of
thing you just knew about.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.706
But I was coming to the
bastion of liberalism.

00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:22.000
Like that was miles from where
abolitionists ran newspapers.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.650
So I was sort of
shocked by that.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.270
So I left there with
this new world view.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.270
I lived in BU
housing, and there was

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.830
a guy who lived on
the bottom floor who

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.250
was a business
journalist professor.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.300
And he also did business
journalism on CNBC.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.260
He had bright red hair.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.420
I can't remember his name.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.086
But we only called
him by his last name.

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:46.470
And he was a great guy.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.840
And he stopped me one day in the
hallway when I was coming up,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.840
and he goes, Joel, where are all
of the black people in Boston?

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.874
And I said, what?

00:16:54.874 --> 00:16:57.290
He said, I haven't seen black
people since I've been here.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.460
I don't see that
many black people.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.362
He was from DC.

00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:02.320
He said, there are a lot
of black people in DC.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.153
He said, there's not
that many black people.

00:17:04.153 --> 00:17:04.930
Have you noticed?

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.349
Actually, I hadn't noticed.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.807
I hadn't even looked
up-- because I

00:17:07.807 --> 00:17:10.096
was working on my MFA--
to take the opportunity

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:12.220
to notice that there wasn't
that many black people.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.160
I'm like, that's kind of odd.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.710
He was like, Yeah,
it's really odd.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.589
There's not a lot
of black people.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.005
This is not something
I'm used to.

00:17:17.005 --> 00:17:20.000
This was a white Irish
guy with bright red hair.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.550
I was like, I hadn't
thought about that.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.390
The end of that first
year, I had to get a job.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.890
My wife was like,
you got to work.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.430
Get a job.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.150
Work as hard as you can.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.108
We're living in Boston.

00:17:31.108 --> 00:17:32.970
You can't just go to
school and not work.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.450
So I went down to Faneuil Hall
to get a job waiting tables.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.702
In the meantime, I saw a
caricature artist booth.

00:17:38.702 --> 00:17:40.410
And I'm like, no I'm
not gonna get a job.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.810
I'm gonna get a job at the
caricature artist booth.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.310
That's what I'm going to do.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.140
Because I can do that.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.630
Waiting tables, I
mean I can make money.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.004
But I can make more money at
this caricature artist booth

00:17:47.004 --> 00:17:49.170
then I ever would
waiting tables.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.550
So I got a job at the
caricature artist booth .

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.470
And I spent Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.970
in Faneuil Hall
drawing caricatures.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.220
Which is a great job, if you're
young and want to do that.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.250
Because you get to talk
to hundreds of people.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.330
You make tips.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.432
And you get to basically
hang out in Faneuil Hall

00:18:06.432 --> 00:18:08.740
all weekend, which is great.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.330
So I was hanging out at Faneuil
Hall, and this guy shows up.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.990
He was about my age.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.640
And he was black and his
girlfriend was white.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.090
And he was talking
to his girlfriend

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.730
about where they
were going to eat.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.635
And he was suggesting they eat
inside Faneuil Hall, Quincy

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:24.135
Marketplace.

00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:26.468
You know, I joke with people--
and I was talking to him.

00:18:26.468 --> 00:18:29.420
And I'm like, if you take that
girl inside Quincy Marketplace,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.540
that's a sleep on the
couch kind of dinner.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.290
Because you're basically
eating fast food.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.970
There's a place over
on the north end

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.470
that a friend of
mine and I ate when

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.489
I came to Boston a
couple of years ago.

00:18:39.489 --> 00:18:40.780
Maybe you should go over there.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.196
He said, I'm not
going over there.

00:18:42.196 --> 00:18:43.060
Not at night.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.460
Not with her.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.540
I said, really?

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.080
He goes, oh yeah.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.290
And by the way, don't
go to south Boston.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.540
Don't go to this neighborhood.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.445
Don't go to that neighborhood.

00:18:51.445 --> 00:18:52.260
I said, really?

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.470
He's like, yeah, they
don't like our kind there.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.450
Now remember, there was
a Klan march in my town

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.940
when I was in third grade.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.310
Like a declaration that we
don't like black people.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:07.620
And here I was in this place
where there were abolitionists,

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.160
where the Kennedys came from,
where all these people who

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.820
were civil rights pioneers were
supposed to have come from.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.185
And now people are telling
me not to go to these places.

00:19:17.185 --> 00:19:19.060
The last thing that
happened to me in Boston,

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.610
which was really
rather traumatic--

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.160
psychologically traumatic, was
I was walking home from BU one

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.660
night.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.460
My studio was on 808
Commonwealth Ave.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.300
And so I walked down St Mary's
to get to my apartment, which

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.555
was only like a couple blocks.

00:19:34.555 --> 00:19:37.290
It was about 3:00
in the morning.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.980
And I had gotten
to this place where

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.160
I would wear these
giant headphones.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.760
Now you would think
because of the way

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.709
I looked-- I had a hoodie on,
I had giant headphones on,

00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:48.000
and I had a giant jacket on,
and sneakers, that I would

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.874
be listening to rap
music, but I was probably

00:19:49.874 --> 00:19:53.010
listening to an audio book.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.530
Or something as benign as that.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.090
Not to say that
rap music doesn't

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.464
come through those
headphones, It

00:19:58.464 --> 00:20:02.370
was just that usually
it's just an audio book.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.080
And I was walking along there,
it's like 3:00 in the morning.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.550
And a police officer was
flying around that corner.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.050
And when he saw me, he
slowed almost to a stop.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.740
And when he did
that, I immediately

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.900
understood why people
run, because I had not

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.680
done anything.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.040
And it was just about the
way I looked that he stopped.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.930
He went, but I was terrified.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.800
After that I graduated from BU.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.940
We went back to Virginia.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.420
Nothing ever bad happened to me
other than that cop stopping,

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.660
and people telling me
things when I was in Boston.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:48.080
But as a dad with a family,
I had four kids and living

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.850
in Boston.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.010
Boston's a great city if
you're under 30 and no kids.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.212
If you're over 30 and kids,
it's like a nightmare.

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:57.170
So my wife and I were
like, we are Southerners.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.130
We had just decided.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.170
We were Southerners.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.470
We are going back to the South.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.410
It's going to be great.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.340
But there was also
this understanding

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.080
that being a black man and
being in love with the South

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.250
is a very complicated thing.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.720
It reminded me of
something that I

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.530
read in the autobiography
of Malcolm X

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.560
where he said, at least in
the South, they'll tell you

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.860
they don't want
to sit beside you.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.810
And there was another thing
that Dick Gregory-- who

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:30.210
was a social commentator,
comedian, and civil rights

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.540
activist-- said
that in the South,

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.540
they don't care
how big you get, as

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.580
long as you don't get too close.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.850
And in the North, they don't
care how close you get,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.050
as long as you
don't get too big.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.770
Those two things sort
of weighed on me.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.940
Plus my experiences of
coming to the South,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.385
and I'm coming to
Boston and hearing

00:21:47.385 --> 00:21:50.010
about the riots in the '70s, the
bussing, and then these things

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.830
about the racist organizations,
and the Ted Williams tunnel

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.259
not being Bill Russells tunnel.

00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:56.800
Because that would
make sense really.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.000
It would make sense if it
was the Bill Russells tunnel.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.085
And I started thinking about
those lynching paintings again.

00:22:03.085 --> 00:22:05.460
But I was thinking about them
in a different context now.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.670
Because I had spent a
whole long time listening

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.270
to "Strange Fruit" by
Billie Holiday's collection.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:17.470
And "Strange Fruit" and
how I had done something

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.280
that a lot of my ancestors--
just to quote Maya Angelou--

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.970
I am the hope and
the dream of a slave.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.370
I'd already done something that
a lot of people, even my peers,

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.390
because most of the people that
I grew up with were in prison.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.830
So I had done something
my peers hadn't done.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.560
So I had come a long way.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.500
And so I started to reevaluate
those lynching paintings

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.810
in a way that I was
talking about sort

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.510
of making social commentary as
a metaphor for how far we've

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.970
come, but how far
we still have to go.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.020
And so I did a series of
paintings based on lynchings,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.740
and I called the
show, "Strange Fruit."

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.000
And the most
successful painting was

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.290
this one, called "Strange Fruit
Harvested: He Cut the Rope."

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.350
In this painting, I was
trying to talk about, and make

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.950
commentary about, how
far I was able to come.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.530
Because I'm no longer
hanging from that tree.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.460
I had cut the tree, but
the rope was still there.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.170
So it was sort of
a metaphor to say,

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.320
we've become a really
long way, but we still

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.640
haven't come far enough.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.690
So a friend of mine
came to that show--

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.360
a guy I went to BU with,
who lived two hours from me

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.450
in Virginia-- and he moved back
a year after I did, and came

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.150
to the show, which
was a big deal.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.060
And people came to
the show and said

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.285
it was beautiful and
disturbing, beautiful

00:23:38.285 --> 00:23:40.530
and ugly at the same time.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.040
And he looked at the
whole show and he said,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.820
it seems to me
like your paintings

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.880
are trying to tell a story.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.770
And they're failing.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.280
And he was absolutely right.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.170
Because one of the things you
learn about art in grad school,

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.887
is when you get out,
nobody tells you

00:23:54.887 --> 00:23:56.220
when you've done anything wrong.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.520
Your mom always says that
everything you make is great.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.020
No matter what you
make, she's going

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.190
to pin it to the refrigerator.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.620
And so, that was an
eye opener for me.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.380
Because he was absolutely right.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.340
The paintings were
trying to tell a story,

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.370
and they were failing.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.580
And this was the most successful
one of the entire bunch.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.460
So that started to
prompt me into thinking

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.480
about storytelling again,
and how I could specifically

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.280
use visual media to
tell the stories.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.810
So that made me come full
circle to drawing comics again.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.630
And so I started thinking about
ways in which to tell my story,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.260
like living in the South,
coming from the projects,

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.119
being in this position that I'd
been in, and being a success.

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:38.410
Because at this time I was
teaching at a small college,

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.590
I was running a gallery.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.760
I was successful by
all measures of what

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.500
I was supposed to be doing.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.680
So I started thinking about ways
in which to tell that story.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.450
So I started this comic
called Dandelions.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.870
And it was this long epic
autobiographical metaphor

00:24:54.870 --> 00:25:00.260
of me and my life, and I
got about 50 pages into it,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.156
and a friend of mine-- so I
got another harsh critique.

00:25:03.156 --> 00:25:04.780
By this time I had
moved back to Boston

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.738
and I was going to the
Boston Comics Roundtable

00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:07.680
at this point.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.650
And I took it to the
Boston Comics Roundtable

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.370
for a critique.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.010
And a guy who I'm friends
with now was going through it,

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.792
and he got about 30 pages in,
and he looks at me and he goes,

00:25:16.792 --> 00:25:18.000
I don't know what's going on.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.830
I'm 30 pages into this and
there's nothing happening.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.850
So I'm like, I'm failing again.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.100
I'm absolutely failing again.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.240
So I started looking at
people who made comics

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.800
to try to figure out how I
could tell these stories that I

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.230
was trying to tell.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.630
These vaguely social
conscious stories

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.520
that have uplifting
elements to them.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.730
How can I tell these stories?

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.444
And I was cyberstalking.

00:25:44.444 --> 00:25:46.110
Have you ever heard
of a library degree?

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.690
If you get a
library degree, it's

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.280
like you don't have
a degree in it,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.510
but you go and read every book
on it that you possibly can.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.820
If you have a library card,
you can get a degree in it.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.560
So I was trying to get a
library degree in comics.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.060
So I would look up artists,
then I would look up their work.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.684
Then I would cyberstalk them for
a while, looking at their work

00:26:01.684 --> 00:26:05.090
online, trying to get as much
information as I possibly can.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.540
And I ran into this
cartoonist named Box Brown.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.520
Box Brown has a book
out right now called

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.130
"Andre the Giant,"
which is really great.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.300
And so when I
Googled Box Brown, I

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:19.010
came up with the story
of Henry Box Brown.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:24.780
Henry Box Brown was a slave
who was born in Virginia,

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.020
and got together with
some abolitionists

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.570
after an issue that he had had
with his master and his family

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.460
being sold, and mailed
himself in a box from Virginia

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.250
to Philadelphia.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.470
And so I didn't know
much about Box Brown,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.820
but I knew a couple of things--
that he was in Philadelphia,

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.210
he was a white kid, and he
didn't get there in a box.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.260
So I sent him an email.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.220
And I said, I'm just
curious as to why

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.280
you have the same name is this
slave named Henry Box Brown.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.150
And he said, well I'm
just square shaped,

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.640
so my friends call me Box.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.990
And he said, but
I've also thought

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.180
about doing a comic about
this guy at some point.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.340
And I sent it back to him,
because that sparked an idea.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.950
I said, that's a fantastic idea.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.640
I'm going to steal your idea.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.150
And so, I stole his idea.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.990
And I made a comic
about Henry Box Brown.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.720
And I spent about a year
putting it together.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.450
And I sent it to him.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.310
And he said to me, when
I sent it back to him,

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.590
he's like, this is great.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.340
You should do more of these.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.440
So I put together that story.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.410
And now I had to figure
out how to get it out.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.130
So it wasn't a book, right?

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.930
So I couldn't shop
it to a publisher.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.050
It was more like a one
shot kind of a thing.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.840
And so I came to the
conclusion that I

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.625
needed to put together a
sort of series of comics.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.160
And the series had to have
some kind of unification.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.650
The unification was me.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.070
But I wanted it to be the
unification to everybody else.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.830
So I was going to go to a
convention, a comic convention,

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.900
and I was going to
sell these comics,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.608
so I had to figure
out what to name them.

00:28:06.608 --> 00:28:08.175
And I'm a huge Chris Ware fan.

00:28:08.175 --> 00:28:10.087
If you're not familiar
with Chris Ware,

00:28:10.087 --> 00:28:12.420
he won the Guardian Prize for
his book, "Jimmy Corrigan:

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.544
The Smartest Kid on Earth."

00:28:13.544 --> 00:28:15.486
He's the only
cartoonist to ever be

00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:16.860
included in the
Whitney Biennial.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.010
He's brilliant.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.500
His work is amazing.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.660
It's slow and
methodical, but it's

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.080
like-- it's kind of like a Wes
Anderson film in a lot of ways.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.960
It's quirky, and it's deeper
than it looks like it is.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:34.060
So Chris Ware has this series
called "Acme Novelty Library."

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.510
And in "Acme
Novelty Library," he

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.870
does one story in each
comic, but they're

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.270
connected to other stories.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.290
So maybe 18 will
be "Rusty Brown."

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.267
And then 19 will be
"Building Stories."

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.100
Then once he gets the
entire thing together,

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.870
he collects them separately,
and then puts out a book.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.670
His latest is called
"Building Stories."

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:58.390
And it was all serialized
in "Acme Novelty Library."

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.030
So I thought to myself, what
could be my "Acme Novelty

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.500
Library"?

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.720
So I started thinking about
a unifying theme or idea.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.240
And I went back to
"Strange Fruit,"

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.550
because if you think
about Henry Box Brown,

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.201
Henry Box Brown cut the rope.

00:29:16.201 --> 00:29:16.700
Right?

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.570
He did that thing
that I did in a time

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.590
when it was harder
to actually do that.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.550
And so I thought to
myself, I'm going

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.180
to name my comic
"Strange Fruit."

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.590
So I put together
"Strange Fruit,"

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.480
and started selling them
with different comic covers.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.774
And each one had
a different story.

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.690
So when I went to the
first one, the first one

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.190
is the top left hand corner.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.970
That was the first
one that I did.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:44.630
So when I went to
the conventions,

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.630
having been a caricature
artist at Faneuil Hall,

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.280
I knew how to sell
stuff one on one.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.324
One on one retail is
something I'm good at.

00:29:51.324 --> 00:29:52.740
If you could get
a degree in that,

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.150
I would have a
degree in 101 Retail.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.110
Friends of mine say
I could sell ice

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.980
to people who have a glass
of ice water in their hand.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.650
So I would sell these comics.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.280
And I would sell hundreds
of them at a show.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.540
While I was selling the comics,
people would come up to me

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:15.812
and they would say, have you
heard about Marshall Taylor?

00:30:15.812 --> 00:30:16.520
And I'm like, no.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.436
Who's Marshall Taylor?

00:30:17.436 --> 00:30:19.190
And they would say,
Marshall Taylor

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.910
was the first black
world champion

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.490
in any sport in America.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.810
And he was a cyclist.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:27.190
And at one point he held seven
world records in cycling.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.440
And I'm like, really?

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.530
I would pull out my
little book and I

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:30.905
would write down
Marshall Taylor.

00:30:30.905 --> 00:30:32.360
And then I would go look him up.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.200
And then I would do a story
about Marshall Taylor.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.020
People would tell me, have you
heard of Theofilus Thompson?

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.650
And I'm like, no, I haven't
heard of Theofilus Thompson,

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.250
why don't you tell me more?

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.910
So I would write down
Theofilus Thompson's name.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.770
And they would all be subsequent
issues of "Strange Fruit."

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.940
Each one of them was a separate
cover and a separate story.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.280
"Strange Fruit"
would have one story

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.290
about some obscure
black history,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.470
and then another story would
have sketch book images.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.670
In one of my favorite
covers for "Strange Fruit"

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.500
I put myself as a toy.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.760
This is all digital.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.440
That toy does not exist.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.010
It's all built in Photoshop.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.150
And I did one where I put
myself on the cover of "Amazing

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.620
Fantasy Number 15."

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:20.130
And this is the one with
Theofilus Thompson in it.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:27.320
So Fulcrum approached me about
halfway through and asked me

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.680
if I would be interested
in putting together

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.160
all of my stories
as an anthology.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.220
And I had already
shopped this to a number

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.185
of publishing companies.

00:31:38.185 --> 00:31:40.310
And they said things like,
put together a new book.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.435
You're a first time author.

00:31:43.866 --> 00:31:45.240
Can you do it in
black and white?

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:45.820
We can do it.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.700
People don't buy anthologies.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.630
Those kind of things.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.720
And so I was resigned to
actually just continue

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.380
to do what-- I mean, I work
at a college, so I had a job.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.390
So I didn't need to
make money with the art.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.332
So I was going to continue
to do what I had been doing.

00:32:00.332 --> 00:32:01.790
When Fulcrum
approached me and said

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.480
we should put
these all together.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.190
And do you have more
of these stories?

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.830
And I said yes,
as I got my book.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.110
Of course I have more stories.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.710
And I start to list off
some of those stories.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:11.820
And they were like, great.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.653
We can put this all
together, and we'll just

00:32:13.653 --> 00:32:15.820
go with the title
"Strange Fruit,"

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.260
because that's what
these stories are.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:23.530
And so I started to
work on those stories.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.300
And in the process
of doing that,

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.910
we talked about who could
write the forward for the book.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.560
And the first person I thought
was Henry Louis Gates, Jr.,

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.020
because one of the stories
in "Strange Fruit," the story

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.810
of Richard Potter who was the
first American stage magician.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.145
And also a black man
from New Hampshire.

00:32:42.145 --> 00:32:44.020
I don't know if you've
been to New Hampshire,

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.110
but when I left this
morning, I significantly

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.230
decreased the black population
by leaving the state.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.480
So you can imagine what it
was like for Richard Potter

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.430
in the early 1800s, late 1700s
when he was a magician up

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.540
and down the east coast,
living in New Hampshire.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.700
But the first time I heard about
that was Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.019
was talking about him on NPR.

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:05.560
And I was like,
that's another person

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.002
I can write down and go look up.

00:33:07.002 --> 00:33:08.460
And so I thought
he would be great.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:14.310
Plus I used his encyclopedia
of African American History.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.270
So we were able to
get in touch with him,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.360
through Facebook of all places.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:25.360
And he wrote the story
without any prompting from us.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.950
He defended the
title "Strange Fruit"

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.470
automatically in his writing.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.790
Like, this is no longer
about black bodies dangling,

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.450
this is about stories
that are dangling

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:36.210
outside the
mainstream of history.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.530
Which was pretty amazing to
have someone of his caliber

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.270
write that about me.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.550
So now that you
have some background

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.950
about how "Strange Fruit" and
how the stories came about,

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.783
I want to talk to you
a little bit about how

00:33:46.783 --> 00:33:48.800
I went about making the stories.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.920
For the most part, I
did everything analog.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.847
So it was pencil and paper.

00:33:54.847 --> 00:33:56.680
I would do the thumbnails
in my sketch book.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.730
And then I would transfer
those to Bristol board.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.855
Do blue line images of
them, and then ink them.

00:34:01.855 --> 00:34:03.110
Then I would scan them.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.095
And then if they
were 18 by 24, I

00:34:05.095 --> 00:34:07.696
would have to repiece
those images back together.

00:34:07.696 --> 00:34:09.070
Well, I couldn't
do that anymore.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.007
I had to go digitally.

00:34:12.007 --> 00:34:13.840
And so I started doing
everything digitally.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.440
With Wacom tablets
and everything.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.139
So now everything is
completely digital.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.989
And I'm going to talk to you
about that with "Two Letters."

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:23.780
Now "Spotswood
Rice" is the story

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:30.050
about a slave-- we have a
couple of documents about him.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.960
We have two letters
that he wrote,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.460
and then we have
all the information

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.830
about him being in the military.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.590
The two letters he wrote, he
wrote a letter to his children

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:43.699
saying that don't
worry about life.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.350
It's going to be OK and I'm
going to come and get you.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.480
And then he wrote a letter
to his slave master,

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.649
his former slave master
after he had run away.

00:34:50.649 --> 00:34:52.440
And he said, I'm coming
to get my children.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.949
And I'm bringing an army
of 1,000 black men with me.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.950
And there's an interview
with his daughter in 1925,

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.792
where she talks about
living with Spotswood Rice.

00:35:01.792 --> 00:35:03.500
So the connection that
I was able to make

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.160
is that he actually came
back and got his daughter.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.780
And so I wanted to
tell this story,

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.410
but I didn't want
to use my words.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:13.860
I wanted to use the words
that he wrote initially.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.990
So I wanted to mimic
his handwriting.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:21.490
And I wanted to actually use
the words in his letters.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:24.330
And there are images
of his letters.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.950
Here's the image of the letter
to Miss Kitty Diggs, who

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.140
was his former slave master.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.670
And this is actually him.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.640
So once I got the
images down, and I

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.140
knew that I wanted
to use the words,

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.723
I wanted to know what Spotswood
Rice would actually look like.

00:35:41.723 --> 00:35:43.440
And there's no images of him.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.740
And so I started
doing some drawings

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:51.090
where I sort of imagined
him as a big man.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.950
Because he went
into the military.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.200
And he was about taking
care of his children.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.421
And when you read his letters,
he feels like a big man

00:35:58.421 --> 00:35:59.170
when you read him.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:03.760
He feels like a man who's that
pen is too small in his hand.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:09.240
And so after I got that,
I went through the process

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.615
of deciding how
to do the comics.

00:36:11.615 --> 00:36:12.590
These are thumbnails.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:18.060
And thumbnails and comics
really are hieroglyphics.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.766
They only make sense to me.

00:36:20.766 --> 00:36:22.390
One of the things I
knew I wanted to do

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.940
was, I didn't want
to use any words.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.520
And so I had to have places
where there were exclamations

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.800
and there were racial
slurs in the words.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.070
And so I decided to
use colors and symbols.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:35.190
So the colors I used are
yellow, orange, and red

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.030
as mounting anger.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.470
And the symbols, we'll
get to those in a second.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.650
So the symbols here
I wanted to use,

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.030
the derogatory term
for black people, coon.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.420
I wanted to use that one.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.190
And I wanted that word to
be a picture, so that it

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.430
was embedded with all the
information as opposed

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.590
to me saying the word.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.270
If you've watched
"Django" for example,

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.670
the n-word becomes
wallpaper in that movie.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.640
He says it so much
that you can actually

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.520
forget that he's actually
saying it anymore.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.909
And so I wanted you not to
forget that it was there.

00:37:08.909 --> 00:37:10.200
I didn't want it to be passive.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.080
I didn't want it to
be n-- dot, dot, dot.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.454
I wanted it to be
something else.

00:37:13.454 --> 00:37:15.810
And so I tended to
use actual images--

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.520
racist images-- in order to
show what those words are so

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.890
that there's a disconnect
between the person

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:21.680
and the word.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.420
So that you see that disconnect.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.900
So I decided that
in this instance

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.850
I was going to use the
actual image of a coon.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.600
So once I get the
actual thumbnail,

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.360
I do a larger thumbnail
in my sketch book

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.080
where I start to map out things.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:44.863
Once this process is done,
I scan this image-- well

00:37:44.863 --> 00:37:46.696
actually, what I did
was I went back through

00:37:46.696 --> 00:37:51.040
and I wrote out the
entire letters, trying

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.620
to mimic as close
to his handwriting.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.900
But I wanted it to be legible.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.000
And also the thing
I wanted it to be,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.990
was I wanted all of the
misspellings to be in there.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.100
So that the misspellings
are specifically his.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.890
So these are his
words, not mine.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.040
There's no real
evidence about what

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.850
Spotswood Rice was able to do.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.550
Or what he did.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.380
So all that's
conjecture on my part,

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.920
but the words are actually true.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.450
And we know he did
eventually get his daughter.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:19.215
So once I got the words, and
once I got the thumbnail,

00:38:19.215 --> 00:38:23.330
I scan this in and I did a
drawing over it in Photoshop.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.890
And I put those things
on three layers.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:29.810
So I put the ink on one layer,
and then I put the painting

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:34.660
on another layer,
and then I combine

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.940
those two to create
the actual image.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.170
And so from here I want to
read to you the actual story.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.760
And I'll show it on
the screen as well.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.920
My children, I
take my pen in hand

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.350
to write you a few lines to let
you know I have not forgot you.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.730
I will have you if
it costs me my life.

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.900
I want you to be contented
with whatever may be your lots,

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:21.440
but be assured on the 28th day,
on the 28th of the month, 800

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.650
white and 800 black soldiers
expect to start up the River

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.540
Glasgow.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.570
And I expect to be with them.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.990
Don't be uneasy my children.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.880
I expect to have you.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.940
Your Miss Kitty
Diggs, Miss Kitty

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.750
said that I tried to steal you.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:48.384
God never intended for a man to
steal his own flesh and blood.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.870
If I had any confidence
in her, I have none now.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:13.080
And I want her to
remember if she meets me

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:18.385
with 10,000 soldiers,
she will meet her enemy.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:28.640
I have no sympathy
for slave holders.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.410
Give my love to
all, Spotswood Rice.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:41.042
So here he's in encampment,
and he receives a letter.

00:40:41.042 --> 00:40:42.500
And the letter's
from his daughter.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:50.370
And again, I'm using mounting
anger with the yellow, orange,

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:50.870
and red.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.040
So he starts to write
his letter back.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.010
I received a letter
from Mary telling me

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:09.020
that you say I tried to
steal my child away from you.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.080
Now I want you to
understand that Mary

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.880
is a God-given right of my own.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.240
Hold her as long
as you can, but I

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.030
want you to remember
this one thing.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.180
The longer you keep
my child from me,

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.410
the longer you have
to burn in hell

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:29.790
and the quicker
you'll get there.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.260
Woe be to the
copperhead rabel-- which

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:53.990
is supposed to be rebels-- and
to the slave holding rebels,

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:58.590
for we are making up
about 1,000 black troops.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:03.250
We don't expect to leave
them there, root nor branch.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:07.180
Just hold on as long as you
can, and the worse it will be.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:19.075
I once offered you, offered to
pay you $40 for my own child.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.955
I am glad that you
did not accept.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.170
The day that we enter Glasgow,
I want you to understand,

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.830
Kitty Diggs, my child is my own.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.060
You call my child property.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.505
I have no fear about getting
Mary out of your hands.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.240
And that's how my
Daddy, Spotswood Rice

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.400
came and took me from
slavery all those years ago.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.600
And that concludes my talk.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.100
If you guys have
any questions, I'll

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.896
be more than happy to
answer your questions.

00:43:07.896 --> 00:43:08.864
Thank you.

00:43:12.736 --> 00:43:17.110
AUDIENCE: Are you continuing to
collect stories for the future?

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.250
JOEL CHRISTIAN GILL: Yes.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:23.480
I do have for volume
two-- the funny thing that

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.400
happened when I started looking
for a second set of stories,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.750
is that I discovered there
are uncelebrated narratives,

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:34.107
and then there are uncelebrated
uncelebrated narratives.

00:43:34.107 --> 00:43:35.940
And the uncelebrated
uncelebrated narratives

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.610
are women, and people
who are disabled,

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.600
and people who are from
the queer community.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.470
And so I started to find
stories about those people that

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:48.890
will be included in "Strange
Fruit, Volume Two," which

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.740
will probably be out
in about two years.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.690
I'm doing another series called
"Tales of the Talented Tenth,"

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:59.700
which is from a WEB Du
Bois lecture, about 10%

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.660
to the black population
rising up and leaving

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.760
the rest of them.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.510
And so these are more
action-based stories

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:06.176
about people from
obscure black history.

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:08.740
The first one is
about Bass Reeves,

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.650
who was the first
black US Marshall.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:15.390
Or the most successful
US Marshall in history.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.840
He caught almost 4,000
criminals over the course

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.780
of a 30-year period
in the Old West,

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.359
and no one knows about him.

00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:23.900
Some people think he might have
been the original inspiration

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.830
for the Lone Ranger.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.970
So I'm doing an
entire book about him.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:32.210
And then after that, I'm doing
story in "Tales of the Talented

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.840
Tenth" about Bessie Stringfield.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.130
She was a black woman
from Connecticut

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.990
who over the course of her life,
crisscrossed the United States

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.030
on a motorcycle eight times
in the '30s '40s and '50s.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.510
She was a courier
for the US military.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.097
They called her the
Negro motorcycle queen.

00:44:49.097 --> 00:44:51.180
And I don't know if there's
a Caucasian motorcycle

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.620
queen, just to balance it out.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.711
But she would call
these penny tours.

00:44:55.711 --> 00:44:58.210
She would throw a penny at a
map, and wherever she would go,

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:59.120
she would just drive there.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.290
And when she ran out of money,
she would stop and do tricks.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:02.990
So she's going to
be the second one.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.290
And then in "Strange
Fruit, Volume Two,"

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.775
which will come out after
Bessie Stringfield's "Tales

00:45:07.775 --> 00:45:11.550
of the Talented Tenth," will
be William and Ellen Kraft

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:15.950
who were slaves from Louisiana.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.900
Ellen, his wife,
could pass for white.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:21.880
So on Christmas, because
the restrictions on slaves

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.530
were lightened on
Christmas day, they

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.430
contrived a plan to run away.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.360
And she dressed as a white man.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.490
And she put her arm
in a sling, so she

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:33.865
didn't have to sign anything,
because she couldn't write.

00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:37.220
And they escaped 1,000 miles
from slavery to freedom.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.910
I'm also going to do
Blind Tom Wiggins, who

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.220
was billed as the
last American slave.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:47.244
He was an autistic savant
who was a musician.

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:47.910
He couldn't see.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.540
He was blind.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.930
But he was an amazing musician.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:58.550
And he was basically sold
to a music producer who

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:02.390
then was able to get his
family to contract him out

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.545
until he died in the
early 20th century.

00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:07.420
But he was billed as
the last American slave.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.260
There was actually a famous
court case about him.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.830
But he made amazing music.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.050
He would also do sounds.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.140
They would have
these shows where

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.348
they would have him come out.

00:46:15.348 --> 00:46:17.440
And he would have
people come up and say,

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.480
you play any piece
of music and he

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.467
can mimic the music
right then and there.

00:46:22.467 --> 00:46:24.550
So I'm doing a story about
Blind Tom Wiggins, just

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.750
to name a few.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:30.350
There'll be Cathay Williams,
who was the only documented

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.845
black female Buffalo soldier.

00:46:32.845 --> 00:46:34.720
And the only reason we
know that she actually

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.010
was a soldier in
the Union Army is

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.759
because she applied
for veteran's benefits

00:46:37.759 --> 00:46:40.560
and was denied, even
though they know

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.111
she'd actually
fought in the war.

00:46:43.111 --> 00:46:44.610
So those will be
some of the stories

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:45.901
in "Strange Fruit, Volume Two."

00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:48.675
So I have a full plate
from here until infinity.

00:46:52.488 --> 00:46:54.612
AUDIENCE: So one of the
things that brought me here

00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:56.500
today is that I'm a father,
and I'm looking for things

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.958
that I can share
with my older son.

00:46:57.958 --> 00:46:59.136
JOEL CHRISTIAN GILL: Right.

00:46:59.136 --> 00:47:01.650
AUDIENCE: So we give
him Howard Zinn's

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:06.297
"Young People's History."

00:47:06.297 --> 00:47:08.005
It's kind of a personal
question that you

00:47:08.005 --> 00:47:09.205
can deal with how you like.

00:47:09.205 --> 00:47:10.580
But you have four
kids, you said.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:11.663
JOEL CHRISTIAN GILL: Yeah.

00:47:11.663 --> 00:47:13.309
AUDIENCE: How do
you talk to them?

00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:14.767
How do they understand
this history

00:47:14.767 --> 00:47:16.005
that you're talking about?

00:47:16.005 --> 00:47:19.140
Like these stories are for
the most part triumphant,

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.050
they're about exceptional
circumstances.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.700
But the content
there is horrifying.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.004
So what's that like?

00:47:26.004 --> 00:47:27.670
JOEL CHRISTIAN GILL:
There's two things.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.460
My wife is white.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:33.820
So my children have no
real concept of race

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.190
at all, which is
really interesting.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.269
And when talking to my
son about this one time--

00:47:39.269 --> 00:47:41.310
we were having this
conversation, and I was like,

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:42.810
you've never been
in a fight, right?

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.210
And he was like, nope.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:45.290
Never been in a fight.

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:48.191
And at first I'm like, man,
he's gotta learn how to fight.

00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:49.690
I gotta get him
into this situation.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.856
And I'm like, wait a minute.

00:47:50.856 --> 00:47:53.220
I worked damn hard so
he'd never have to fight.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.969
He'd never have to
worry about this stuff.

00:47:54.969 --> 00:47:57.120
And my kids have no concept
of the things that--

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.297
like any of the issues
that I'm talking about.

00:47:59.297 --> 00:48:00.880
When people actually
raise it to them,

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.837
it seems like it's just
going over their head.

00:48:02.837 --> 00:48:04.420
And so to get them
to understand that,

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.753
I talk to them about this stuff.

00:48:05.753 --> 00:48:07.830
I sort of make these
things amazing.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:09.870
Like, look at this amazing
thing that happened.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:14.880
And like any kid whose
parent does something that's

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.459
interesting to
most other people,

00:48:16.459 --> 00:48:18.250
they've been living
with it all their life,

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.790
so-- I have a
Wacom tablet that's

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:22.609
about this big,
that's at my house.

00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:24.900
It's in the living room, and
I draw on it all the time.

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.660
If my kids' friends
come over, they

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.540
stand behind me the whole time.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.640
And my son is like, I have air
soft guns, let's go outside.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.630
And they're like, no,
this is really cool.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:37.660
So my kids have no
real concept of it.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.330
It's sort of like to give them
an awareness of those things

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:42.960
and to talk to them about it.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.850
My son, who was eight
or nine when I started.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:46.570
He's 12 now.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.820
So he's read all the stories.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:53.280
And he understands them, and
he thinks they're really cool.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.500
But he has a clear
understanding about that.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.610
And I try to make sure
that he understands

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:58.985
those type of things.

00:48:58.985 --> 00:49:01.540
But they are so
sheltered in comparison

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.620
to what I was, that
they don't even see it.

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.790
Which I'm OK with.

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.450
I'm absolutely OK
with my kids not ever

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:07.870
having to think
about that stuff.

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.900
I wish nobody's kids
had to think about it.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.200
Thanks again for inviting me.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.960
I appreciate the time
to come and talk to you.
