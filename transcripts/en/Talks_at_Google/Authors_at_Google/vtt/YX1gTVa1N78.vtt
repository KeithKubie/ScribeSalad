CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Thanks.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.830
Thank you.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.540
So my kind of
usual data shtick I

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.610
think is probably going
to be wasted on you guys,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.660
because you probably
know the basics for sure.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.910
So I'm just going to
run through some data

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.340
that we used especially in
the formative days of OkCupid

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.730
to make the site better or the
sort of things that eventually

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.610
gave rise to the
blog and to the book.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.740
And then I will answer
questions if there are any,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.534
just because I've found
for audiences like this

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:38.950
I'm a bad predictor
of what people

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.325
want to talk about
or hear about.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.920
So I'm happy to answer anything.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.880
There, so, I am one of
four founders of OkCupid.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.740
I still run the
business day to day.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.220
And we started the
site back in 2003.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.394
We had actually all
quit SparkNotes,

00:00:57.394 --> 00:00:59.310
which was on the ninth
floor of this building.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.424
I remember we were in
there before September 11

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:04.840
and then after, so I used to
be able to just walk in, take

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.620
the elevator up, and go to work.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.260
So I had the whole kind
of Homeland Security style

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.140
process getting here today.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.640
And so we started
the site in 2003

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.370
basically as an answer
to the eHarmony,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.430
highly prescriptive
soulmate-oriented dating model.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.470
And I'm not sure exactly how
they run their site these days,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.210
but it used to be
this thing where

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.260
you answer this really
long questionnaire.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.170
Certain answers could
totally disqualify you.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.840
And then in addition, after
you went through that,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.910
they would show you this
very curated but almost

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.410
highly restricted
list of people you

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.120
could talk to that they
thought were perfect for you.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.495
And then if you
didn't like them,

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:46.490
you got three or
five matches a day,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.980
and then it was like, too bad.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.000
We'll see you
tomorrow, hopefully.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.479
So the reaction to
that from us was,

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.520
we want to just make it
kind of open where people

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.853
could find whatever they wanted.

00:01:55.853 --> 00:01:58.020
And of course, as you
guys know, as soon

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.270
as you start asking questions
like what users want,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.300
what do users want, or how
can this person do something

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.750
on the site, you have to
start collecting data.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.389
And the way we did that was
these match questions, which

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.310
just ask kind of
everything under the sun.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.847
It's about religion, and flag
burning, and abortion, and then

00:02:15.847 --> 00:02:17.680
about scary movies, and
brushing your teeth,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.890
and all kinds of nonsense also.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.030
And then we basically-- my
co-founder Chris Coyne did it--

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.804
but together we kind
of refined this idea

00:02:25.804 --> 00:02:27.720
of what it means for two
people to sort of get

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.090
to know each other, which
was our intent for the site.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.850
It's just asking a series
of questions like banter

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.860
and how much your answers
satisfy each other.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.020
And it's pretty simple, and
we put it into a formula,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.984
and it gives out a
percentage even to this day,

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:43.650
although there's been
some slight tweaks

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.840
and we don't always use
that exact formula anymore

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.530
or algorithm.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.940
But so one of the things about
a dating site that is unique

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.790
is that you're trying
to connect people

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.998
with people rather than
people with content or people

00:02:56.998 --> 00:03:00.010
with search results that they
want or people with cool things

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.850
to pin or whatever.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.760
So there's a lot of
kind of bizarre things

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.850
or special things
about a dating site.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.850
So we started this thing
and matching people up,

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.330
and we learned very quickly
that you can have an algorithm,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.720
and you can return 10 of
the say 10,000 people at

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.250
that point that you have
in New York for this person

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.800
to look at.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.085
And regardless of whether the
viewer is a man or a woman,

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:23.668
and regardless of
what the numbers are

00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:26.130
that your algorithm has
output alongside each picture,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.610
and even regardless of
the various biographical

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.020
details attached
to each picture,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.645
they just click on
the hottest picture.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:35.060
So it's what we have come
to call the focus problem.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.040
For this reason,
men and women focus

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.940
on the most attractive
person on the page.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.870
And so in aggregate,
these attractive people

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.492
just get targeted, just bombed.

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:44.950
And they get way
too many messages.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.860
They get grossed out.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.550
It's almost always a
woman in this situation.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.480
They get grossed out.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.590
They don't answer them.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.510
They leave.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.690
Guys don't get replies.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.105
They leave, and it's just
a huge kind of implosion.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.620
And so I guess this
is a good time to ask,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.750
is this slide thing
actually working?

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.102
Because it's not-- there it is.

00:04:02.102 --> 00:04:03.060
This is my first slide.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.910
It was hard.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.450
So we realized really
quickly that we

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.408
needed to solve this
problem, and of course you

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:13.020
could impute how-- you need
to know how hot people are

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.510
so you can manage
the experience.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.510
And you could impute
hotness, obviously,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.260
by who gets the most messages.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.800
That's almost like that would
be the best way to do it.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.362
Except that you have to have
the problem occur that you're

00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:26.070
trying to prevent in
order to prevent it.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.562
It doesn't really work.

00:04:27.562 --> 00:04:29.020
So we need to be
able to figure out

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.750
how hot people are before
they get too many messages.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.041
And so the way you do that
is you just let people rate.

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:34.177
It's very low friction.

00:04:34.177 --> 00:04:36.260
They just volunteer this
information very quickly.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.180
We called it Quickmatch.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.846
It's basically a
knockoff of Hot or Not,

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:41.600
which has kind of resurrected
itself as a knockoff itself

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.017
of Tinder, but way
back in the day

00:04:43.017 --> 00:04:45.558
was just this thing where you
rate one to 10 stars for people

00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:46.410
over and over again.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.368
And that's what we did.

00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:50.980
And we launched it, and we
were getting the information,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.980
and we were managing the
experience or whatever.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.244
But obviously you
pilot histograms

00:04:56.244 --> 00:04:57.910
of how people are
rating things and just

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.080
to see what's going on.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.990
And this is the-- I'll
use this one-- this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.030
is the histogram of female
looks, straight female looks,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.760
on OkCupid.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.400
So this is women
rated by guys and how

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.550
the population sorts itself out.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.780
As you can see, it's
actually on a one to five

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.280
scale it's centered
almost at three.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.630
I think the median here is
2.83, which is very healthy.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.970
This reflects, I think,
the intuitive idea

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.262
of what attractiveness is in
the external world, right?

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:30.928
You have some people
that are very ugly,

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.150
some people that are very
hot, and then most people

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.816
are just in the middle
somewhere, right?

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:37.300
And so this is a sign
that you have devised

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.784
your metric or your
interface pretty well,

00:05:39.784 --> 00:05:40.950
and we are happy about that.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.330
And it also is an odd thing.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.480
It's-- well, never mind.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.570
Well, I was going
to say-- thanks.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.800
So there's this
idea that I think

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.240
is true in a lot of situations
that Photoshop, or retouching

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.410
in other ways, or just
models in general,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.630
magazine covers, have kind
of reformulated the idea

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.240
or have reformulated
the idea about what

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.290
it is to be beautiful.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.998
And you would imagine
that in a situation

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:15.890
where men expect every woman to
be a supermodel, to put it very

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.336
bluntly, that this
curve would be way down.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.960
They would think that
the average woman

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.044
that they see, they would
be shifted way further

00:06:22.044 --> 00:06:23.960
down towards ugly because
they expect everyone

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.340
to be, whatever-- thin, tall,
beautiful, blonde, who knows.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.800
So this is actually
kind of-- the normalness

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.130
of this curve is in its
normality sort of refreshing.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.900
It means that
people haven't taken

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.050
that kind of marketing
image of attraction to heart

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.650
quite as much.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.290
And this is how women rate guys.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.240
It's definitely a
harsher reality.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.350
And in fact, the median there
is like 2.06 or something

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.450
like this, which is
actually a little bit

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.220
deceptive because the
scale starts at one,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.500
so really this is like
half, basically, as hot.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.540
And obviously the first
reaction is all the dudes

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.760
on OkCupid are ugly,
which is a problem.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.730
But we tested it.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.351
We pulled 1,000 random
guys off a social network

00:07:10.351 --> 00:07:12.100
and put it against
1,000 of our own dudes,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.310
and the scores came out
almost exactly the same.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.670
So I don't think that that's
actually what's going on.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.630
And obviously women
are more selective,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.800
and that's how this works.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.520
And an interesting
perspective on this,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.450
I gained an interesting
perspective on this

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.380
when I presented the
slide right after.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.420
A guy who was a behavioral
psychologist, and right

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.350
before this he had
explained this experiment

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.980
that they had run,
him and his team,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.270
a very kind of classic sort
of academic social research.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.570
They got a hot
woman and a hot guy

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.800
to run out into the campus quad,
or walk, and go talk to people.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.712
And the experiment
ran in three phases.

00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:48.920
First phase is they'd go out.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.628
The hot woman or guy
approaches somebody,

00:07:50.628 --> 00:07:52.354
and the end of the
conversation is, hey,

00:07:52.354 --> 00:07:53.520
do you want to go on a date?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.478
That's the proposition.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.420
And the attractive woman
and the attractive guy

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.030
got just about the same number
of yeses from their marks,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.762
so to speak.

00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:02.470
I think it was something
around 85%, 80%.

00:08:04.127 --> 00:08:05.210
Second phase, they go out.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.418
They find people to chat
up, and then the proposition

00:08:07.418 --> 00:08:09.430
there is, hey, do you
want to go home with me?

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.507
And the woman talking
to the men out there

00:08:13.507 --> 00:08:15.090
got basically the
same number of yeses

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.310
as she got asking
them on a date.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.520
They're like, yeah,
I thought that's what

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.436
we were talking about.

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:22.770
And the guy, of course, when
he goes out there and accosts

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.140
women out of nowhere
and then winds up with,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.640
hey, do you want
to go home with me,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.146
got very, very, very few yeses.

00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:29.520
I think it was
something like 5%.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.894
So there you see
a huge disparity

00:08:30.894 --> 00:08:35.350
in the approval rating
of that kind of question.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.630
And then finally, I don't
know how they did this

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.450
with a straight face, but
they ran the same thing again,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.866
and the man went out there,
and at the end he's like, hey,

00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:44.430
do you want to go
have sex with me?

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.380
And he got zero
yeses from women.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.410
The woman goes out
and does this and gets

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.250
something like 70%
yeses from guys.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.326
There were only a few.

00:08:51.326 --> 00:08:52.950
Because again they're
just like, right,

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.033
I mean, that's why you're
talking to me, isn't it?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.600
OkCupid was bought
by IAC in 2011.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.830
They also own match.com.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.760
They also own Tinder.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.430
And you see this kind
of spectrum of judgment

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.470
I guess playing out
in these data sets.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.794
So the proposition on match.com
is much more like, hey,

00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:14.960
do you want to go on a date?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.520
That's sort of
the implicit thing

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.490
behind what's going
on on that site.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.980
On match.com, the blue and
red curves almost overlap.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.529
So men and women sort of
say yes to one another

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.695
basically in the same ratio.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:32.160
Tinder, where it's
a lot more casual,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.555
you see the blue histogram is
slammed way against the y-axis.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.940
That first bar is
the tallest one.

00:09:41.935 --> 00:09:43.560
And OkCupid is
somewhere in the middle.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.210
Some people use it
for casual hook-ups.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.010
Some people use it for
long-term relationships,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.320
and you have a kind
of a compromise.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.070
And I just saw,
especially because there's

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.530
three and three,
I saw an analogy

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.840
in what this man had
been talking about.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.673
This is always good.

00:09:54.504 --> 00:09:56.670
So anyway, so it's this is
kind of data that we use.

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:00.940
Not necessarily the histogram
because there's not a lot

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.394
we can do about
the general trend

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.560
of how men and women perceive
each other on OkCupid.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.180
But we take the results
of your star rating

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.330
and kind of manage
the experience for you

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.240
if you do a search.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.184
We always add
randomness, because I

00:10:14.184 --> 00:10:16.100
think fundamentally
everyone knows and we also

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.430
believe that there's a lot
of serendipity and randomness

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.930
in love.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.340
But we kind of collar it.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.190
If you're a six out
of 10, your matches

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.000
will tend to be like four
to seven, four to eight.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.550
So anytime someone
complains to you

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.000
that all the people
on OkCupid are ugly,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.225
you can kind of
smile to yourself

00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:34.225
about what that implies.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.740
So, we also use this
data in other ways,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.640
mostly because it's such a
low-friction way for people

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.590
to volunteer their
opinions of strangers.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.570
It helps us understand what's
going on with the business.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:54.410
And another important axis
besides gender is age.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.930
And so this is
using the same data,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.850
but it's obviously
sliced a lot differently.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.350
I'll explain it
over here this time.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.270
So the age-- this is
women voting on men.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.060
So the age of the
women is on the y-axis,

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.260
which probably
should be reversed.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.920
And then the age of
the men is on the x.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.370
And so the way to look
at this, and the numbers

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.707
are not exactly deciles.

00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:20.040
They're rounding of percentiles.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:27.660
But this is the sort of
spine, the hottest cohort

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.100
as rated by the women going up.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.440
So you see 20-year-old
women think

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.780
23-year-old guys are hottest.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.940
25-year-old women think
26-year-old guys are hottest.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.430
30 think 30.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.750
35, 34 I think.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.980
But basically it's a
diagonal more or less,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.566
meaning that women think
guys who are their same age

00:11:48.566 --> 00:11:49.440
are the best looking.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.880
And they want a guy to be their
same age until-- women after 40

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.290
are totally cool if the
dude is not over 40.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.760
They kind of stop.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.240
A guy is sort of over the
hill at, say, 39 or 40.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.980
A 45-year-old for
the most part would

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.140
prefer a 39 or 40-year-old.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.630
You can just see
the color is meant

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.504
to add some kind of
topography to this thing.

00:12:11.504 --> 00:12:13.910
And you can see it's kind
of like, well, it's a spine.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:14.826
It's well distributed.

00:12:14.826 --> 00:12:17.980
It's a little hill, ridge
running through the thing.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.950
And this is it
going the other way.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.940
So guys basically
universally thinks

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.950
that basically 20,
21, 22-year-old women

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.970
are the hottest.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.290
Of course that fits our own.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.210
You don't see that many
40-year-old women on magazine

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.280
covers, at least as
objects of lust, for sure.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.220
And that's this
played out right here.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.050
Of course, again, this is
a very low-friction way

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.040
to collect this information.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.960
The guy does not have
to put himself out there

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.900
to contribute this.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.870
You're just sitting there
voting yes, no, or whatever.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.570
And I use the gestural thing
because we ripped that off

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.870
from Tinder about a year ago.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.290
But where you do have
to put yourself out

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:57.030
there is sending a message and
actually hitting on somebody

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.880
or whatever it is,
chatting them up.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.670
And there you see there's pride.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.720
There's fear of rejection.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.580
There's also taboo.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.000
I mean, it has got to
feel weird being 45

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.250
and trying to chat up somebody
who's still in college.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.830
It sounds insane to me.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.520
So you see people compromise.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.730
They compromise between
pride and lust, as it were.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:22.110
It kind of runs a slope
of maybe two or something.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:27.010
So guys message women about 10
to 15 years younger than they

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.760
are as far as where most of
the messages actually go.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.640
And so this is an
example of information

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.890
that we don't actually act on.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.992
Again, getting back to
what I started with,

00:13:39.992 --> 00:13:41.797
we always want
OkCupid to be open.

00:13:41.797 --> 00:13:44.130
And a very easy way to solve
the creepiness problem here

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.270
is just make it impossible
for-- I don't know--

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.950
for 40-year-old guys to even
see 20-year-old profiles,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.122
certainly to message them.

00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:52.330
Obviously you just display
equals none on the button.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.020
But we don't do that
just because we kind of

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.890
try never to bar anybody from
doing anything on OkCupid,

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.860
although we do consider
it from time to time.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.590
But the actual
volume of messages

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.410
that goes in this older
man to younger woman

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.420
is relatively low.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.200
Oh yeah, and one
other thing I guess

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.060
I want to point out about this.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.185
And this is something I
haven't exactly figured out

00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:19.900
is there's this
sort of hill here,

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.310
which is the kind of
youngish dudes thinking

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.584
they're inverse cougars
or hikers, whatever

00:14:27.584 --> 00:14:28.500
you want to call them.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.000
They're waiting to
get snatched up, which

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.160
is kind of a funny point.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.760
Somebody asked
earlier-- actually it

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.551
might have been at
Google when I talked out

00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:39.630
there a couple weeks
ago-- whether this

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.970
was just a weird thing
that's going to float on up,

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.597
a cohort thing that's just going
to be the case for these guys

00:14:44.597 --> 00:14:45.430
through their lives.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.070
But of course longitudinal
data is kind of

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.653
hard to come by,
especially in dating,

00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:51.810
because we have this sort of--
unlike many of the services

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.020
you guys offer, or Facebook.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.980
For example, Google Maps,
or certainly Google Search,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.020
or Facebook totally works
great for you whether you're 18

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.147
or you're 25 or you're
40 or you're 60.

00:15:02.147 --> 00:15:04.230
It's like, people need
dating in a very acute way,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:09.010
but not for very long, because
both in the success and failure

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.224
case for our site,
people leave it,

00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:13.140
which is kind of a weird
thing to think about.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.520
So we definitely get very,
very little actual cohort

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.590
longitudinal data on what
the hell is going on.

00:15:25.214 --> 00:15:26.630
And then I guess
the last question

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.181
I want to talk about,
how as you guys know,

00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:30.930
you measure what's
happening on your site,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.650
and you take some action based
on it that is either obvious

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.190
or that your intuition
hopes that will work out.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.440
And you run some sort of test.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.042
And there's obviously on an
issue of pricing, for example,

00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:46.250
you're just going to look
at total revenue or revenue

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.157
expectation or whatever, LTV.

00:15:48.157 --> 00:15:50.240
It's pretty easy to know
what the metric is there.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.324
But for us-- and
this is something

00:15:52.324 --> 00:15:53.740
that took a while
in evolving-- is

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.280
how do you know when
you make a change based

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.791
on any of this data whether
it's actually good for the site

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:58.290
or not?

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.270
Because something like
retention-- or sorry, well,

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.070
retention, the
classic engagement,

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.849
time on site, even
page views are

00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:06.890
sort of crappy markers
for how well you're doing.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.864
Because if people have spent
seven years on OkCupid,

00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:11.780
unless they're using it
to go on casual dates,

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.020
you've really screwed up, right?

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.190
You've failed, essentially.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.750
And so it took us a
while to realize this.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.320
So then you could
go, well, all right,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.050
what we really want to
do is have conversations.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.091
Because we don't know who
actually goes on dates.

00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:29.859
There's this huge wall
where we know everything,

00:16:29.859 --> 00:16:30.900
and then we know nothing.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.510
It's like this shroud
of ignorance for us.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.252
And so we have to
make a guess as

00:16:35.252 --> 00:16:37.460
to what's contributing
towards people going on dates.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.770
And so obviously messages
has got to be a precursor.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.660
People can't possibly
get together.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.790
There's no smoke signals.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.000
People have to send
each other messages.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.339
Of course you end up with an
extreme power user problem

00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:50.880
there too, because
there will be guys

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.670
who send 1,000 messages,
basically the same.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.530
And so the pure volume
isn't a good one,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.140
so obviously the next step there
is reply rate because that's

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.574
some indication of quality
and the female satisfaction

00:17:01.574 --> 00:17:02.990
with the messages
they're getting.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.781
And I'm using male to
female because that's

00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:06.640
how 80-plus percent
of the messages

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.160
are for first
contacts on the site.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.819
And we were using
that for a long time

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.540
as our sort of metric for any
A/B test involving the UX.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.858
But there's too many
false positives.

00:17:20.858 --> 00:17:22.566
There's too many polite
replies of people

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:26.960
being like, not
interested or buzz off.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.429
So a reply is a
one and then a two,

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:36.720
so then we did one, two, three.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.136
So the reply has
to be good enough

00:17:38.136 --> 00:17:39.770
to elicit a further
message from a guy.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.180
But again, then we
recently upped it four.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.250
So me, you, me, you,
that's our success case.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.709
Because even in the three way,
if a woman writes a guy buzz

00:17:48.709 --> 00:17:51.041
off, there were just too many
false positives of the guy

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:52.360
being like, well, buzz off too.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.650
So, I mean, you all know
how the internet is.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.280
So now we use four ways.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.401
Obviously we could
take it out to n.

00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:02.150
You're definitely more
certain that people

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.150
are having a productive
conversation or at least

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.840
a substantial conversation
the longer you take that out.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.460
But at a certain point, you
start having a false negatives

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.880
problem where people
exchange, yeah, sounds great.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.030
I live in Brooklyn.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.140
Here's my phone number.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.223
And you start losing that.

00:18:14.223 --> 00:18:17.730
So four is kind of an intuitive
guess at what seems best.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.950
That's an irony of
what we're doing

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.500
is that we can't tell
who actually goes

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.280
on dates except in extreme cases
of people coming back to us way

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.264
after they've started
dating long term

00:18:29.264 --> 00:18:30.680
and telling us
that that happened.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.013
Like, hey, my name is Alice,
and I met Bob on your site.

00:18:33.013 --> 00:18:35.270
Thank you, that kind of
thing, which is obviously

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.660
a highly self-selected
and rare thing.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.060
So basically in
doing this work, you

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.500
can see we're
dealing with people

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.566
and personal interactions and
strangers judging strangers.

00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:48.190
And so you kind of
start learning a lot

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.500
just about human nature broadly.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.770
And we started writing about
that stuff on the blog in 2009.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.100
And it occurred to me after
I had exhausted both might

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.780
by patience and ideas
with what OkCupid

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.520
was doing that people at
places like Facebook or Google

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.544
obviously are learning
similar things.

00:19:09.544 --> 00:19:10.960
And so the reason
I wrote the book

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.418
is to kind of tie all this
stuff that's out there together.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.290
I mess around a
little bit on my own

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.210
with Google Trends and Ngrams.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.016
There's a guy, Seth
Stephens-Davidowitz.

00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:21.390
I don't know if
you all know him.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.389
He works at Google out
in California, I believe,

00:19:23.389 --> 00:19:25.670
and he's published a lot
of really amazing op-eds

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.510
in the "Times"
using search data,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.370
aggregated and
anonymized, of course.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.370
So I bring in some of
what he's been working on.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.744
And Facebook's
data team has been

00:19:33.744 --> 00:19:37.110
doing a lot of
social scholarship.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.510
And basically that's the book.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.634
It tries to give
a picture of how

00:19:41.634 --> 00:19:43.800
data is being used to
understand human nature rather

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.630
than the dollars and cents side.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.550
And that is where I'm
going to open it up

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.850
to questions, if there are any.

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:55.490
Yeah, rare, all right.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.125
Oh, please.

00:19:57.304 --> 00:20:00.774
AUDIENCE: You talked about
finding out how hot people are

00:20:00.774 --> 00:20:03.190
and then showing them people
who are in the same category.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.439
So two questions tied to that.

00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:06.270
One is, do you still
use the ratings

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.470
for that, because that
seems like there's

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.830
a lot of other things besides
physical attractiveness

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.930
that might go into that.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:11.740
There's other things
that you could

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.990
use, like click-through
rates where you're only

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.190
seeing a photo, that might
be more directly tied

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.200
to how hot people are.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.340
And the second piece is,
in using that in something

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.510
like Special Blend, is that
the only thing you use?

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.009
You take that and
then randomize it,

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:26.540
or are there other things that
go into choosing how to group

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.287
the people that you show?

00:20:28.287 --> 00:20:30.620
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: I'll answer
your questions in reverse.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.660
Special Blend I'm actually
not exactly sure everything

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.340
that goes into there.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.464
I know there's some jitter.

00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:35.570
There's attractiveness.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.850
There's match percentage.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.665
There might be some kind
of zip code-based thing.

00:20:39.665 --> 00:20:41.790
I honestly don't know
exactly what goes into there.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.690
Basically the
question you're asking

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.981
is, do we believe
Quickmatch actually reflects

00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:50.230
people's physical attractiveness
rather than this more

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.260
abstract idea about
how cool they are

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.880
or attractive they are
in a more general way?

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.164
And the answer to that is, we
have run a test where we just

00:20:58.164 --> 00:21:00.080
have the picture, and
then we have the picture

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.260
plus the stuff around
it in Quickmatch.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.770
And on a per capita
level, the correlation

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.730
between the two ratings is
something like 92% or 0.92.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.402
So it's like your picture
is almost the entire story.

00:21:13.402 --> 00:21:14.860
Granted it is not
the entire story,

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.580
but we definitely
use it as a shortcut

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.724
to this, especially because if
we took all that stuff away,

00:21:22.724 --> 00:21:24.890
people would want that, and
we would have to go then

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.306
create this other
engine to gather

00:21:26.306 --> 00:21:28.230
the same, slightly better data.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.812
And now you have-- I mean,
you know how UXs can be.

00:21:30.812 --> 00:21:32.520
You can't have two
things that are almost

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.910
the same but
different, and then you

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.310
have a problem on
your hands just

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.768
from a User Experience
perspective.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.761
Go ahead, or are you
just standing guard?

00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:42.010
AUDIENCE: No, I have a
question, but let him go first.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.090
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Yeah.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:47.750
AUDIENCE: So, one of the
interesting OkCupid blog

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.390
entries was pulled.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.014
This is the one that was heavily
researched about, OK, this

00:21:52.014 --> 00:21:54.430
is why free dating sites are
better than pay dating sites.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.720
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Sure.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.520
AUDIENCE: And it seemed very
well researched and analyzed,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.480
and I couldn't immediately
see anything wrong with it.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.530
And it was pulled, and
then later you came back

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.440
and said, well, now that we've
seen the insides of things

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.970
after being bought
by IAC, things

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.567
are different but never really
addressed what's different.

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:12.400
What were you wrong
with in the first place.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.380
How do you respond to
yourself and that post

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.430
that you pulled down?

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.390
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Sure.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.840
So the genuine truth
is we pulled down

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.997
the post of our own volition
because they bought us,

00:22:24.997 --> 00:22:26.830
and it was a big middle
finger to match.com.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.788
And these are people that
we have to work with,

00:22:28.788 --> 00:22:30.770
and why preserve that?

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.830
Why begin a relationship where
you have to work with them

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.510
with that on the table, right?

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.450
So it's an etiquette matter.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.170
And then over the course
of working with them,

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.407
the subtext of that post
was that they basically

00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:47.240
don't really care about
getting you a match,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.950
or the site doesn't
work for that.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.912
And I can certainly say I
have learned, for instance,

00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:53.870
we have kind of co-opted
part of their matching

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.120
algorithm on our site.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.670
We go on match questions.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.017
They use this kind of
interesting I guest network

00:23:01.017 --> 00:23:03.350
completion sort of thing that
doesn't use any interests.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.610
It basically looks at if you
and I have a good conversation,

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.645
then it's trying to
figure out the next person

00:23:07.645 --> 00:23:08.436
to recommend to me.

00:23:08.436 --> 00:23:10.852
It looks at the other guys
you've had good conversations

00:23:10.852 --> 00:23:13.310
with, and presuming that they're
similar to me in some way,

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.620
then what women have they
had good conversations with?

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.550
So that kind of extra step out,
and then matches me with them.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.110
And we were using data
from press releases

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.290
and whatever publicly
available stuff we could have.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.700
And you guys can imagine
that that stuff can

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.449
be distorted if you're
a motivated person.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.930
I was a motivated
person, obviously,

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:31.971
working from the outside.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.732
So my opinion of what they
do and how that site works

00:23:35.732 --> 00:23:36.690
has definitely changed.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.648
We've learned a lot about
how to make money off

00:23:38.648 --> 00:23:41.800
of running a dating
site from them.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.880
I mean, I work at OkCupid.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.750
I think it's better,
but I don't think

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:54.300
paying for dating, obviously,
is not categorically a bad way

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.069
to go about it.

00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:55.610
I don't know.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.310
That's pretty much
my honest answer.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.040
My opinion of the
situation has changed.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.940
I have way better information.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.050
And we took it down, and
it will always remain down

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.694
just because there's just
no point to having that out

00:24:11.694 --> 00:24:14.110
there when you're trying to
have a productive relationship

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.095
with people.

00:24:15.095 --> 00:24:16.025
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:24:20.027 --> 00:24:21.360
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Oh, sorry man.

00:24:22.089 --> 00:24:23.630
You sent me over
here, and I'm stuck.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's my fault.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.380
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
I'll go over here.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.303
Let's do this fairly.

00:24:27.303 --> 00:24:28.136
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:28.136 --> 00:24:28.900
Sorry about that.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.500
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Yeah, it's no problem.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.000
AUDIENCE: I just had a
question about the early days

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.512
of OkCupid.

00:24:31.512 --> 00:24:32.470
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Sure.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.330
AUDIENCE: How did you
get your first users?

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.871
How did you achieve
the critical mass

00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:37.444
you needed to get
things rolling?

00:24:37.444 --> 00:24:38.860
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Right, and to be

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.001
clear, OkCupid was a very
linear type of story.

00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:43.500
It was not one of these hockey
stick exponential situations.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.374
We were just kind of cruising
along in a user growth way,

00:24:47.374 --> 00:24:49.540
but revenue-wise we were
about to go out of business

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.850
in 2009, even that late.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:56.430
So part of it was a
cheat, essentially.

00:24:57.492 --> 00:24:58.950
My other three
partners had started

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.790
SparkNotes, and I was
an employee there.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.820
And so we advertised.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.572
We were able to advertise
on SparkNotes and say, hey,

00:25:04.572 --> 00:25:05.530
this is our next thing.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.321
And that obviously has
some kind of cachet.

00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:10.320
So we got an early core
of users, not many,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.132
but some small
five-digit number,

00:25:12.132 --> 00:25:13.840
if I remember, sort
of right off the bat.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.548
And you know it's so
much easier to start

00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:17.000
from that than from 10.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.740
So that helped.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.090
We basically tried everything.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.732
We've never marketed,
so we tried--

00:25:28.732 --> 00:25:30.440
SparkNotes' success
was created basically

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.780
by online tests and
silly viral content,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.425
so we tried OkCupid's
version of that.

00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:36.550
We had it so people could
generate their own tests.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.270
And this is back when blogs
were still kind of a thing,

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.000
or personal blogs
were kind of emerging.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.700
And people would print their
test results or be like, ha ha.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.810
And instead of posting
it to Facebook,

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.351
which didn't exist
at that time, they

00:25:46.351 --> 00:25:49.720
would post it on their blog,
which really helped with SEO.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.140
So when people searched
dating site or whatever,

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.460
they found OkCupid.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.900
We were one of the only free
legit free sites back then too.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.300
So there was a price
proposition there.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.920
And, look, there's a lot of luck
involved in anything like this.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.450
I mean, I think
anybody who pretends

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.130
that they've started a
company and it's successful

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.170
and luck had nothing to
do with it is a madman.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.560
So we kind of sweated it out.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.380
The general stigma
around online dating

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.338
eroded partially because
of what we were doing,

00:26:19.338 --> 00:26:21.610
but just partially honesty
because of Facebook.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.850
People started to
realize their friendships

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.630
and social lives in some
degree ran through, well,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.560
not their phone then,
but the computer.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.890
And that made the
leap to, OK, well,

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.557
I'm already living
part of my life here.

00:26:35.557 --> 00:26:37.181
I'm going to live
other part of my life

00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:39.124
through a computer made
it a lot less weird,

00:26:39.124 --> 00:26:40.040
and that helped a lot.

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:42.315
Yeah.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.180
AUDIENCE: So, the male-female
graph for straight people

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.210
is really interesting.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.299
Have you ever done the same
thing for gay men and lesbians?

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:52.340
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: I have.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.010
I definitely have done it, and I
just cannot remember the trend.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.385
Someone asked me
this, and I know

00:26:56.385 --> 00:26:58.350
that that's a really
shitty answer.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.510
But I have.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:05.989
My experience with this
stuff is that generally guys

00:27:05.989 --> 00:27:07.780
act like guys regardless
of whether they're

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.500
straight or gay.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.250
And women act like
women, so I'm going

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.430
to guess that the two things
are very, very similar.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:16.900
My email is christian@okcupid.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.650
I can confirm that for
you when I get back

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.847
to my actual desktop.

00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:21.930
AUDIENCE: OK, so it's the
person doing the rating.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.388
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.030
If I had to bet on it, I would
say that that's what goes on.

00:27:26.882 --> 00:27:27.590
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:29.301 --> 00:27:30.800
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for coming in.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.267
And-- oh, sorry.

00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:33.350
AUDIENCE: No, you're good.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.016
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
This is good exercise.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.000
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah,
thanks for the talk.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.820
So, you mentioned in
the earlier question

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.040
that for a dating
site to make money,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.920
you need people to
stay on your site.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.737
So either immediate success
or long-term failure

00:27:50.737 --> 00:27:51.570
is not good for you.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.239
So how do you balance that?

00:27:53.239 --> 00:27:55.030
You want people on your
site to make money,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.387
but people won't stay
on your site forever.

00:27:57.387 --> 00:27:57.970
You know that.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.170
So--

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.225
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Yeah,
I mean, here's the thing.

00:28:01.225 --> 00:28:03.600
I don't know if it's true that
people staying on the site

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.100
actually helps.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.975
I mean, it makes you
incrementally more money

00:28:05.975 --> 00:28:08.270
in a certainly very narrow way.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.615
You show more ads
or whatever it is.

00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:11.990
AUDIENCE: OkCupid
is free, right?

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.781
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
There's a freemium thing.

00:28:13.781 --> 00:28:16.110
So basically the site
as it was created,

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.760
that entire functionality
remains free,

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.730
and we've kind of
layered on extra things

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.310
that people can pay for if
they want a kind of easier

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.300
or get rid of the ads, whatever.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.270
So here's the answer
to the question.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.320
It's like, I guess the site
may make more money by doing

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.497
these kind of
Farmville-style tricks

00:28:34.497 --> 00:28:35.580
to kind of keep people in.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.880
They're just churning.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.040
But also this is
where the fact that we

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.870
don't spend on
marketing comes in.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.092
And we would not
continue to grow

00:28:44.092 --> 00:28:45.550
if we do that,
because the only way

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.133
we get a new user
is by word of mouth.

00:28:47.133 --> 00:28:49.470
And if people feel like
they're kind of being gamed,

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.660
everybody has that
feeling, or they

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.680
feel like it's kind
of shitty, but they

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.920
can't get away from it.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.544
They're not going to
tell their friend.

00:28:54.544 --> 00:28:57.740
And more to the point, we
need people to actually go

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.740
on the dates so that their
roommate is like, oh,

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.000
where did you meet
her, or whatever.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.083
The weddings happen, and
hey, where did they meet?

00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:04.202
And the answer is OkCupid.

00:29:04.202 --> 00:29:05.660
That's how people
come to the site.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.470
That's the best possible word
of mouth you could have is

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.760
where a couple gets
married because of OkCupid,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.822
and all 300 people
know that it works,

00:29:11.822 --> 00:29:13.530
and it worked really
well, and it's safe,

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.446
and all of this stuff.

00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:17.460
So it's part of our user
acquisition strategy, I guess.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.420
It's a little bit intention
with our monetization strategy.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.254
But we prioritize we got to
have people come through.

00:29:23.254 --> 00:29:24.670
It's a precursor
for making money.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.700
So we really sincerely do
try to get people on dates

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.284
and off the site as
quickly as we can.

00:29:31.284 --> 00:29:32.700
AUDIENCE: So, a
follow-up question

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.710
to that, so, some
of the dating sites

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.330
might allege that they are
better because they just

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.760
have to sign up you
pay $50 or something.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.210
So in that case,
they might allege

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.806
that OkCupid is
wants to keep you

00:29:44.806 --> 00:29:47.180
on the site versus their site
is better for the end goal.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.138
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: They
might allege that, yeah.

00:29:50.627 --> 00:29:52.960
I'm sure you guys are all
familiar with allegations that

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.595
can be thrown at various
internet companies.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.160
What can I say?

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.745
It's not true.

00:30:03.947 --> 00:30:06.280
I would find it hard to counter
the argument that I just

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.490
made that it is in our interest
to kind of keep people trapped

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.810
and unhappy on OkCupid, if you
believe that because they're

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.940
trapped they're unhappy, which
I think people are savvy enough

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.065
at this point to not-- I
mean, for the exact reason

00:30:15.065 --> 00:30:19.210
that Farmville and Zynga
generally is having trouble.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:23.810
And that kind of the
latest-- I don't even

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.550
remember the word-- but the
iPhone games that are popular,

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.690
and then they get you
to pay for things.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.600
There's some word for
those I can't remember.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.380
In a payment style
thing, there's

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.100
so much churn at
the top of the list.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.320
Whereas we could do that.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.750
We could be number one for a
while, and then we'd be gone.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.680
So that's my two
cents on that answer.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.518
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:30:41.518 --> 00:30:42.476
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Yeah.

00:30:42.476 --> 00:30:43.720
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for coming in.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:43.980
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: My pleasure.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.870
AUDIENCE: And thanks
for creating the site.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.610
My little brother is
getting married in December.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.930
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
There you go, man.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.159
AUDIENCE: Met on OkCupid.

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:49.450
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Right on cue.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.366
AUDIENCE: So it works.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.380
One question I had for
you was I saw the OkTrends

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.887
article that you had where
when people match and close

00:30:57.887 --> 00:30:59.970
their accounts, they say,
oh who'd you match with?

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.511
And they have the questions that
are most common between it's

00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:05.050
like, do you like horror
movies and whatnot.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.050
So when people fill out
what's important to them

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.050
and what's not when they're
answering questions,

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.610
is there any sort
of offsetting that

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.380
goes based off of the
data of the masses?

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.540
So you see a lot of
couples are matching

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.250
based off this question, so the
question has a higher weighting

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.709
even though they might say it's
important or not important?

00:31:21.709 --> 00:31:23.125
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Is your question

00:31:23.125 --> 00:31:25.090
do we use the kind of
successful couples data

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.110
to kind of refactor what's
happening in the algorithm?

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.560
AUDIENCE: Exactly, yeah.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.230
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: The answer
is no, mostly because,

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.694
first of all, that
particular blog post wasn't

00:31:34.694 --> 00:31:35.860
based on what was important.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.610
It was based on the
kind of unexpected--

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:45.190
I ranked the questions that were
easy to ask by how high they

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.455
correlated with success
in couples, if that makes

00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:48.620
any sense.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:52.540
So the expected
number of couples

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.040
that would agree to the horror
movie question, that question

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.410
is answered 50/50.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.070
It's like 50.25% of
the site says yes,

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.300
and whatever, 49.75 says no.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.140
So the expected
number of couples

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.270
that would agree on that
question is about 50%.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.580
However, among all
the successful couples

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.750
we've created, at least in
my data set that I know of,

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.842
I want to say something
like 72% or 74% of them

00:32:13.842 --> 00:32:14.800
agree on that question.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.090
So you can see that
it's a very high number

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.250
to agree certainly
at random chance.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.320
But anyway, to get back to
your question, the people who

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.870
actually come back and
tell us stuff is just,

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.715
it's a small set.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.510
They have to go through
this tree of things

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.390
and then indicate and have to
come back after they've already

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.348
been dating for months.

00:32:35.348 --> 00:32:37.490
It's just very few people
relative to the couples

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.530
that we actually create.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.779
And it's highly self-selected.

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:42.020
They're like OkCupid super
fans, or they're actually

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.686
getting married.

00:32:42.686 --> 00:32:44.502
And a lot of people
aren't coming

00:32:44.502 --> 00:32:45.960
OkCupid to get
married necessarily.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.470
And so we would end up steering
this site in this one direction

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.970
and away from all
these other things

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.860
that people might
be doing on OkCupid.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.430
So short answer is
we don't use it.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.215
And generally we're kind
of deprecating the weight

00:32:58.215 --> 00:32:59.340
that people give questions.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.689
We've found that people, it
really is mood dependent.

00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:04.230
Whereas your answer isn't, but
how important it is to you is.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.430
So there's many
different questions

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.725
that ask basically about
flag burning, for example.

00:33:08.725 --> 00:33:10.850
And people know what they
think about flag burning,

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.542
whether it's November
or August or they're

00:33:13.542 --> 00:33:14.500
in a good mood or what.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.960
You answer the question,
but how important

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.830
it is to you at
that moment, we've

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.160
seen basically there can be
a battery of questions that

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.326
are exactly the same, and
people's importance levels

00:33:21.326 --> 00:33:22.410
are all over the place.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.874
So we're thinking about
bringing that out.

00:33:24.874 --> 00:33:26.540
We've already reduced
one of the things.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.280
Maybe it was just
because there was

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.739
too many options and people
were just clicking randomly.

00:33:29.739 --> 00:33:32.280
But we might move to a more of
a deal breakers type of thing,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.738
which again is like
a yes/no thing.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.320
It's not a how do
I feel about this.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.040
It's like, is this
going to keep me

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.144
from ever wanting to
see somebody who smokes,

00:33:40.144 --> 00:33:41.810
or if you're a
vegetarian who eats meat,

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.790
or who believes in God
if you're an atheist.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.710
These are things
that people already

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.920
know a little bit better
than how important is it

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.010
to you that somebody takes a
shower twice a day or whatever.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.640
It's just like,
pfft, I don't know.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.390
AUDIENCE: Got you.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.020
And just one other quick thing.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.550
What happens when
you skip rating?

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.431
So you have one to five
and then there's the skip.

00:33:58.431 --> 00:34:00.430
What happens when people
skip, like if you see--

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:01.300
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Oh, on Quickmatch?

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:01.925
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:01.925 --> 00:34:03.008
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Nothing.

00:34:03.008 --> 00:34:03.870
It just moves on.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.910
And the skip rates are
pretty independent.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.910
People just get skipped.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.490
It's a pretty noisy indicator.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:14.489
You could treat it
as a zero, but it

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.770
doesn't seem like
that is how it works.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.082
It's like another one
of these mood things.

00:34:19.082 --> 00:34:19.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:21.930
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Yeah.

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.346
AUDIENCE: Hey, I just wanted
to thank you guys for OkCupid

00:34:24.346 --> 00:34:26.420
because I met my
wife through OkCupid.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.000
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Awesome,
great, I like the stereo,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.739
I'm just going to
sit over there.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:29.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know, exactly.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.300
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: That's key.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.909
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no,
that's my comment.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:32.070
Thank you.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.444
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Oh, thanks man.

00:34:33.444 --> 00:34:34.344
That's great.

00:34:34.344 --> 00:34:36.040
All right.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.239
AUDIENCE: What was most
surprising in two senses?

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.384
What did you learn that
was most surprising to you,

00:34:41.384 --> 00:34:43.509
and what have you learned
that when you tell people

00:34:43.509 --> 00:34:47.409
they're like, oh, I had no idea
about myself or about people?

00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:50.110
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
OK, so I'll answer.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.321
I'm very wordy, so the
two sentences maybe I'll

00:34:52.321 --> 00:34:53.529
just use a lot of semicolons.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.840
The most surprising
thing to me was

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.180
when I looked at the racial
data, as an American,

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.880
I expected a certain
amount of bias.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.490
But the depth of it and
the cookie-cutter nature,

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.230
if you think of it
as a matrix, it just

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.813
seemed like you could pull the
same matrix from different data

00:35:09.813 --> 00:35:12.310
sets-- OkCupid, DateHookup,
which is another site we run,

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.185
or match.com, and they're
all just as if they

00:35:14.185 --> 00:35:15.850
had been stamped
by the same thing.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.350
The percentage is different a
little bit, but who likes who

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:20.240
and who doesn't like
who on a racial basis

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.734
is the same across
these data sets.

00:35:21.734 --> 00:35:23.650
Totally different user
acquisition strategies,

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.360
totally different
user interfaces,

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.240
totally different user bases.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.714
And then through
time on OkCupid,

00:35:28.714 --> 00:35:29.880
it's again the same pattern.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.660
And so that sort of pervasive
and persistence of the pattern

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.840
I found very surprising.

00:35:36.032 --> 00:35:37.240
So that's the answer to that.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.350
I think that people seem
to also be surprised

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:43.560
about that because there
is this kind of-- I mean,

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.910
there is a taboo around race.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.750
And if you ask anybody
if they're racist,

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.999
obviously no one is going
to say yes to that question.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.450
Does race matter
romantically to you?

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.810
Very few people would
say yes to that question.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.200
So that, in my experience,
is what's most surprising.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.695
But again, it's like,
you read the paper.

00:35:59.695 --> 00:36:01.070
You grow up in
the United States.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.920
I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.200
Racism shouldn't be
a surprise for sure.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.967
And I think the more you talk to
people who work with big data--

00:36:07.967 --> 00:36:09.800
I'm sure you guys see
this all the time-- it

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.421
often just confirms your
cynical intuition about people.

00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:14.920
But it does add a certain amount
of clarity and specificity,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.162
which can be refreshing
or surprising.

00:36:17.162 --> 00:36:18.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.820
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: I don't
know if that was two sentences

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.170
or not.

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:21.003
It's just a lot of--

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.361
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:22.361 --> 00:36:23.050
I was curious.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.630
Some of those questions
you asked earlier

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.690
that you ask as part of the
profile make a lot of sense.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.815
But how do you come up with
flag burning questions?

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.080
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: How do I come
up with-- oh, flag burning.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.910
AUDIENCE: Flag burning, how
do you pick up the questions

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.150
that you put into the profiles?

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.066
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Yeah,
the question situation

00:36:36.066 --> 00:36:39.270
is a real post-apocalypse free
for all type deal over there.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:40.955
It's an anything
goes environment.

00:36:42.015 --> 00:36:43.390
So, the way the
question starts--

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:46.150
so when you launch a site that's
going to based on questions,

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.530
you can't just be
like, OK, here you go,

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:48.530
and there's no question.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.830
So we wrote 50 or something
like that on our own.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:54.080
So one of the flag burning ones
might be ours that we wrote

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.710
back in 2004, '03.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.650
But we opened it up
so people-- again,

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.858
we wanted people to be able
to find what they wanted.

00:37:00.858 --> 00:37:02.983
So if you really cared
about your significant other

00:37:02.983 --> 00:37:04.982
having a foot fetish, you
can get that in there.

00:37:04.982 --> 00:37:05.820
And it is in there.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.899
And so people wrote
questions and submitted them.

00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:09.690
And I think people have
submitted something

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.860
like 260,000.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.810
We turned it off because
they became so redundant.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.180
And there's only maybe 5,000
that are in circulation.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.720
But the way we prioritize the
questions, again, is automated.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.270
So the ranking heuristic
is, how much information

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:27.380
does each question yield?

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.580
And that is-- again,
to break that out--

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.580
is how important is
the question generally?

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.080
And of course, as
I was just saying,

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.830
importance is a
little bit of a thing.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.490
But I think back
then especially it

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.240
seemed like people
would answer correctly.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.130
So how important on average
is a question, and then

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:42.463
the next important step is
how divisive is the question?

00:37:42.463 --> 00:37:44.790
And what I mean by that is
how much does it segment

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:46.889
the user base 50/50,
the closer the better.

00:37:46.889 --> 00:37:48.430
Because a question
like have you ever

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:50.930
murdered somebody is extremely
important to know the answer,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.170
but everybody
answers the same way,

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.910
so you get no real
information from them.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.000
So under this algorithm,
the best questions

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.482
bubbled up to the top.

00:37:58.482 --> 00:37:59.940
But a flaw in this
that we realized

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.220
is that these similar questions,
because they're similar,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.870
bubbled up to roughly
the same spot.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.770
And so you end up having
somebody coming to your site

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.710
and having to answer a whole
battery of questions about flag

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:10.376
burning that they're
like, what the hell

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:11.870
is going on on this dating site?

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:16.520
And so we went in and did
some editorial, essentially,

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.940
and kind of cherry picked
the ones that were best.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.820
And now it's hard coded.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.559
The first, say, 100, 150
I think, we didn't write,

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:27.100
but we decided where they would
go because they flowed better

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:27.350
together.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.370
You didn't have a bunch of
religion questions clumped

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.578
together and stuff like that.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:36.090
So yeah, the questions is way
more curated than it started.

00:38:38.782 --> 00:38:40.990
And it'll probably stay kind
of like it is regardless

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.490
of what people
submit in the future.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.409
AUDIENCE: And how many questions
do people answer on average?

00:38:45.409 --> 00:38:46.700
Because that takes a long time.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.325
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160
I don't know the median.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.000
There's obviously a
long tail problem here,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.040
but the average is maybe
like 330 or something.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.570
My guess would be the
median's around 200.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.324
So a lot, because
people, they'll browse.

00:39:01.324 --> 00:39:02.740
They've seen some
people, and then

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.156
they just get bored
and just start

00:39:04.156 --> 00:39:05.940
powering through this thing.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.467
But for the site to work,
we only need 10, 15.

00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:10.300
I mean, it could work
without it if you just

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.133
care about pictures.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:12.950
Hi.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.920
Just wondering if
you-- sorry, this is--

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.003
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: It's OK.

00:39:17.003 --> 00:39:18.312
I can hear you.

00:39:18.312 --> 00:39:20.520
AUDIENCE: Wondering if you
saw any interesting change

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.950
in behavior or trends once
Tinder became more mainstream.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.460
Did it have an impact on--

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.459
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Sure,
that's a great question.

00:39:27.459 --> 00:39:29.440
Yeah, I mean, again,
longitudinal or cohort

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.210
data is really hard for us
because people just, they come.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.790
They hate it, or they find
someone they love, or whatever,

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:35.330
and they go.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.246
And we don't know why.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.160
But honestly, this has been
the best year over year

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.252
that we've had
since year over year

00:39:42.252 --> 00:39:43.710
meant building from
almost nothing.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.910
So this has been the
best year we've ever

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.350
had by almost any metric.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.030
So I think there's a
lot of people on OkCupid

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.069
who also use Tinder.

00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:53.235
I don't think it's a winner
take all type situation.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.130
People want dates.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.588
I don't think they
necessarily care

00:39:56.588 --> 00:39:58.200
via which app it comes to them.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.880
And I think more
than anything, Tinder

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.930
has destroyed that last
brick in the stigma wall

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:06.820
around online dating.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.600
I think their user
base is way younger,

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.760
people who, at least as
far as I understand it,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.320
might not have
ever tried meeting

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.010
someone through their phone.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.700
And they're obviously
doing in droves.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.431
And it's kind of
conditioning people to-- it's

00:40:19.431 --> 00:40:21.180
the end of people
thinking meeting someone

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.540
through a phone is
weird, or a computer.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.966
But I think that's
not to say that Tinder

00:40:25.966 --> 00:40:27.090
doesn't present challenges.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:30.977
I think in becoming popular and
playing the role that they've

00:40:30.977 --> 00:40:33.310
played in breaking down the
stigma for an entire segment

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.380
of the world that we
never had access to,

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.800
we now need to be
able to address

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.500
the expectations of those people
better than having profiles

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.110
and this heavy stuff.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.380
Tinder is so light, and so
when someone likes Tinder

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.110
and they're like, I wonder
what else is out there,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.590
we need to make sure that
when they download OkCupid

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.000
because they heard
it was cool it

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.785
fits their expectations
of what it's going to be.

00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:53.910
And I think that's something
that we're working on.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.500
Well, I know that's
something we're working on.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.790
I think that's
something we'll figure.

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:57.456
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:57.456 --> 00:40:59.970
What about the stigma
that Tinder in itself

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.270
has with the more
casual behavior.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:06.590
Are you seeing-- that might
be overall mainstream behavior

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.850
trends anyway, but--

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.850
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: You
know, honestly, I'm

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:16.110
not up to the latest on
what's happening at Tinder,

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:16.780
totally honest.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.770
I don't know what
to think about it.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.740
I think it's a
phenomenal experience.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.270
I remember when
people-- or UX, when

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.710
people, November
of 2012, Sam, one

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.330
of my co-founders
at OkCupid was like,

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.020
hey, what do you think of this?

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:36.500
And he came in.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.080
I was like, shit.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.621
This is cool.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.540
And it's self-evidently
cool and fun,

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.470
which is an amazing
thing for an app.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.480
And there's a lot of
people that aren't

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.980
looking for long-term
relationships.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.880
They're not looking
to get married.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.540
You're 24.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.974
I mean, I remember I
moved here when I was 25,

00:41:52.974 --> 00:41:54.890
and that's the last thing
that was on my mind.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.127
So I don't think it's
necessarily a problem at all.

00:41:58.127 --> 00:41:58.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.360
AUDIENCE: Have you
had any example

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.480
of change in the user
interface depending

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.820
on the location of the person?

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.361
Like someone from
Europe would expect

00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:10.080
to get married maybe
in the 30s, maybe

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.110
someone in the US earlier.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.500
Have you had any example
where you've seen impact

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.770
by changing the user interface
on the amount of users

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.620
that you get?

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.510
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Like one UX might--

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.970
we make a UX change
site-wide, and we

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.990
see that it gains more
traction in Germany

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:26.450
than it does here, for example.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:34.601
The answer is no,
mostly because I

00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:36.100
feel like that's
such a noisy thing.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.580
Again, it's new
people coming in.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.270
And it could just be some
other Zeitgeist issue,

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.570
or maybe Tinder just became
super popular in Germany and so

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.111
people are looking
for the next step.

00:42:48.284 --> 00:42:50.450
If we spend a lot of time
researching that question,

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:51.970
I might believe
what came out of it.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.024
But once you're saying
that, then you probably

00:42:54.024 --> 00:42:55.440
don't ever bother
to look into it.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.480
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.740
AUDIENCE: What
about the questions?

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.390
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: What?

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:59.848
AUDIENCE: What
about the questions?

00:42:59.848 --> 00:43:02.836
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
The questions--

00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:04.960
OkCupid is by far more
popular in the United States

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.140
and then even
outside that in Anglo

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.420
countries, the British
Commonwealth essentially.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.100
And I think a big
limiting factor

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.539
for us has been that
there's so much vernacular.

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:17.205
It's so English.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.520
We have a voice in
a way that, say,

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.040
Tinder does not because it's
just pictures and an interface.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.440
And so that I think
has been a problem.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.260
And we tried to
internationalize way

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.790
too soon, like 2007 or 2008.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:36.190
It was this enormous translator
project, and it was just, pfft.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.520
So we're going to try again.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.524
But it's insightful to realize
that it doesn't transport

00:43:41.524 --> 00:43:43.315
as well, because it
doesn't, unfortunately.

00:43:44.207 --> 00:43:45.540
AUDIENCE: And one more question.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:45.720
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Yeah.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.470
AUDIENCE: When you internalize,
when you go to another country,

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.350
do you go in favor
of hiring people

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.920
from that country to understand
their culture better?

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.420
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.500
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: When
we do, yes, we will hire.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.927
I think if we decide to say
go into Spain-- of course

00:43:59.927 --> 00:44:01.510
OkCupid is available
in Spain, so it's

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:05.025
a little bit of a
misrepresentation

00:44:05.025 --> 00:44:05.900
of what would happen.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.360
But when we decide to
try to make OkCupid more

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.120
popular in Spain,
we will definitely

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.150
hire someone who is
either a Spaniard

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.110
or has spent a lot of time there
and understands the culture.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:16.780
Because dating,
unlike, say, search,

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.420
I imagine people searching for
things in Europe or in the US

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.850
are kind of doing
the same thing.

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.058
I guess there might be
grammatical differences in how

00:44:23.058 --> 00:44:24.230
the thing gets laid out.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.522
But there is actual cultures,
different dating cultures

00:44:26.522 --> 00:44:28.563
that you have to address
that are very difficult.

00:44:28.563 --> 00:44:30.230
In Germany, for
example, they kind of

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.440
reject-- even though most people
certainly can read English,

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.245
they just want it to be
German and feel very Deutsche.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.600
But in the Netherlands,
they don't care.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.640
And in China, for
example, IAC owns

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.610
part of a dating site
in China and is actually

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.265
a call center with a website
that you find people,

00:44:49.265 --> 00:44:50.140
and then you call in.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.649
It's like 3,000 people that
someone will take your call

00:44:52.649 --> 00:44:53.190
and help you.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.960
It's a totally
different deal where

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.160
they have to maintain this older
school village matchmaker vibe.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.640
So it's a weird problem
to have to address.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.440
But anyway, thanks.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.470
Hey.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.560
AUDIENCE: So, all the popular
dating sites to my mind

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.710
had radically different
visions of how

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.160
this system was
supposed to work.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.850
OkCupid had this
dynamic question,

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:15.530
automatic ranking system.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.710
And it seems like there
were all very distinctive,

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:22.530
and I wonder if you
feel like there's

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.350
a phenomenon of
convergence to the mean

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:29.090
or discovery of an underlying
platonic dating site

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.520
that everybody--

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.070
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: I don't know
if mean is the right word,

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.028
but I think there probably
is some convergence.

00:45:34.028 --> 00:45:37.350
Like in any industry, there's
going to be best practices.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.630
And for instance, for
ways to vote on people,

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.080
the swipe gesture that Tinder
came up with is awesome.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.360
It would be stupid
to have a button that

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.882
says no and says
yes at this point.

00:45:46.882 --> 00:45:48.340
You've got to make
it swipe, right?

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.920
Certainly I think
the business model

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.120
differences will stay the same.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.100
That's part of the way
people's-- to someone

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.270
else's question earlier, the
fact that Match asked people

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.117
to pay, I think there's a lot
of people, perhaps justifiably,

00:46:05.117 --> 00:46:06.700
consider that a
marker of seriousness.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.470
If you have paid to
be there, then they

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:09.770
know that you're
not dicking around.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.811
You're not going to troll
them or whatever it is.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.020
And some people want
that assurance for sure.

00:46:15.882 --> 00:46:16.840
I think that will stay.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.220
We'll probably also change
subtly in some ways,

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.760
and there will be
probably more convergence

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.676
as we've started charging
for some things too.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:31.670
In terms of the
UX, I don't know.

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:32.510
Yeah, I don't know.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.110
Dating is the weirdest thing.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.693
It's one of the few
things that people

00:46:35.693 --> 00:46:37.060
will pay for on the internet.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.690
And so people are always
trying to horn in on it.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.292
And it's very PR related.

00:46:43.292 --> 00:46:45.750
You see there's dating sites
out there that are essentially

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.580
a press release
and nothing more.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.380
Like Cupidtino, the
dating site for Mac users,

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.505
it still shows up
in articles about

00:46:52.505 --> 00:46:53.759
the online dating landscape.

00:46:53.759 --> 00:46:55.550
And I guarantee you no
one is on that site.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:57.650
For real.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:01.570
I mean, there was an article
about IAC's dating portfolio

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.120
a week, two weeks
ago in the "Times."

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.314
It's kind of very serious
treatment of what we're doing

00:47:06.314 --> 00:47:07.230
and what might happen.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.420
And in there, they list
as a possible threat

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.400
to the portfolio a
couple legit sites.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.450
And then just with no other
commentary, seacaptaindate.com,

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.035
which is a site
for-- you should all

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:21.841
go check it out-- for sea
captains to find dates.

00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:23.090
And so you're just like, what?

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.470
This is not a site, you guys.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.720
So where this is
going to is I think

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.130
there will be consolidation
and then fragmentation,

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.325
like the way a forest
works after a fire.

00:47:36.325 --> 00:47:37.200
You know what I mean?

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.479
There's always going to be new
and regenerative sites like Sea

00:47:41.479 --> 00:47:42.020
Captain Date.

00:47:44.439 --> 00:47:44.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.910
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Hey.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.285
AUDIENCE: You recently had an
article in the "Wall Street

00:47:48.285 --> 00:47:50.490
Journal" on some
of the experiments

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.020
that were being conducted.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.720
My wife and I were
wondering what

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.610
the nature of those
experiments were

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.490
and whether they were
being run specifically

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:02.557
in January of 2010.

00:48:02.557 --> 00:48:04.640
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Well, I
mean, you guys certainly

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.400
must know that websites
are always testing things.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.130
Certainly when it comes to
a recommendation algorithm,

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.296
whether it's recommending
some news from your friend

00:48:10.296 --> 00:48:12.990
you want to hear on your
Facebook wall or news feed,

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.735
or some search result that is
pertinent to the kidney beans

00:48:15.735 --> 00:48:18.660
that you just searched for, or
whatever you've searched for,

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.410
or who we think you
might want to talk to.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.620
So I guarantee you
there something

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.560
in flux generally then.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.190
That particular
experiment was not,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:31.430
and anybody who communicated
as part of that experiment

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:32.930
was notified
immediately afterwards.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.596
That experiment
occurred basically right

00:48:34.596 --> 00:48:35.950
before I wrote about it.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:41.255
And the experiment was a tweak
to our matching algorithm,

00:48:41.255 --> 00:48:42.130
as you would call it.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.960
But we basically ran
it against placebo,

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.430
which had the effect of testing
it against-- you think of all

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.750
the real-world ways
that people match

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.600
or real-world ideas for
putting people together.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.000
There's birds of
a feather, which

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.040
is things in common, which
is how we generally work.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.080
There's the you're my type and
she's your type type of thing,

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.790
the way match.com does it.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.390
There's opposites attract,
which is essentially

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.060
what got tested
in the experiment

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.690
that you're talking about.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.830
There's also she's
from a good family.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:14.710
You're from a good family.

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:17.175
You're done, kind of
old-world way to do things.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.392
And then there's
many different ways.

00:49:20.392 --> 00:49:22.558
We're always testing and
seeing which one is better.

00:49:22.558 --> 00:49:24.410
So that's kind of what
that was all about.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:25.118
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:26.645
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Hey.

00:49:26.645 --> 00:49:27.960
AUDIENCE: Hey again.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.010
A question for you.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.400
Since you guys were kind of
trailblazers in destigmatizing

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.430
online dating, was
there any hilarious

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.580
stories from the
founding, the startup,

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.580
talking to your parents.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.810
Hey, I'm doing an online
dating site for a living?

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.000
What was something
funny that happened?

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.245
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Something
funny that happened.

00:49:46.245 --> 00:49:47.870
AUDIENCE: That's a
very vague question.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.161
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: No, no,
no, no, it's a good question.

00:49:50.161 --> 00:49:54.910
I mean, you know, certainly
part of OkCupid's voice

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.180
is kind of humorous, and
the book is humorous,

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.120
and I like to tell jokes.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.605
But I'm also a very
grim, focused person,

00:50:01.605 --> 00:50:03.480
just like the other guys
who work at OkCupid.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.739
And so we're just
like [GROWL] sitting

00:50:07.739 --> 00:50:10.030
in there trying to make the
site popular when it's not.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.340
Man, I mean, there's a
ton of nonsense, I guess,

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.590
which I mostly just
remember as a big,

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.705
it's like a primordial
ooze of silliness.

00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:24.090
I don't know.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.057
Mostly in terms of
startup-related stories,

00:50:29.057 --> 00:50:31.640
the things that stick in my mind
are kind of all the missteps.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.540
I remember sitting in the office
when someone was like, hey

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.456
dude, have you heard of
this thing Friendster?

00:50:35.956 --> 00:50:37.030
And we were like, shit.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.170
By the way, just like I remember
sitting in SparkNotes office

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.419
when someone was like, hey,
have you heard of Google?

00:50:41.419 --> 00:50:42.460
And we're like, oh, yeah.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.577
I guess I don't need to
use AltaVista anymore,

00:50:44.577 --> 00:50:47.160
which is what I used to use for
real for all my image searches

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:47.900
especially.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.464
It was better than
anything at the time.

00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:52.630
So when Friendster came
out, we were like, oh, cool.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:53.160
That's awesome.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.534
We should add
friends to OkCupid.

00:50:54.534 --> 00:50:57.890
So we had the basic friend
technology, and nobody used it.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.370
We've tried a blind date app.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:02.430
Nobody uses it.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.570
It's like one of these
things that there's always

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.332
an imperative for a site to grow
and innovate and add things.

00:51:07.332 --> 00:51:09.790
And Google especially has done
this incredibly well, Search

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.620
and then Maps and Gmail
and all this stuff.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:16.170
But for a dating
site, people's need

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.004
for sex or love, that
doesn't really change.

00:51:18.004 --> 00:51:19.378
And it's very hard
to add things.

00:51:19.378 --> 00:51:20.360
It's also very focused.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.151
It's very hard to add
extra things onto it.

00:51:22.884 --> 00:51:24.550
So I know that's not
what you're asking.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:25.230
I mean--

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:29.090
AUDIENCE: I mean, what are your
thoughts on farmersonly.com?

00:51:30.335 --> 00:51:32.710
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: We are
quaking in our mud-covered boots

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:34.700
on that one for sure.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.120
I mean, I guess, yeah, we
had this one-- well, no.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.810
I'm not going to say it
because it's too personal.

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:40.100
There's some funny
personnel stories,

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.766
but obviously that
involves other people

00:51:41.766 --> 00:51:43.770
that I don't want to
talk about, so yeah.

00:51:45.259 --> 00:51:46.300
AUDIENCE: I'll ask later.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:46.990
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
The class of people

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.310
who will work for a startup
with very dubious prospects

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:53.627
and no money is a strange group
of people, I'll tell you that.

00:51:53.627 --> 00:51:54.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:55.285 --> 00:51:56.660
CHRISTIAN RUDDER:
Yeah, go ahead.

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:00.760
AUDIENCE: So, I haven't
checked on the gender options

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.920
on okcupid.com in a while.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.984
Maybe you've changed
it, but I think

00:52:03.984 --> 00:52:05.400
last time I looked,
it was just, I

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.374
am a man/woman
interested in men/women.

00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:08.290
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: Yep.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.100
AUDIENCE: Are there any plans
to include non-binary gender

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:13.610
options?

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.552
Or are their difficulties
in supporting that?

00:52:16.552 --> 00:52:18.010
I can imagine there
might be, but--

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:18.430
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: There are.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.750
And the answer to both
your questions is yes.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.320
That's in progress, and maybe
we're about to launch a test.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.450
When Facebook came out
with the 51 or 57 options

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:29.699
like they did on
Valentine's Day,

00:52:29.699 --> 00:52:31.990
that's kind of throwing down
the gauntlet a little bit.

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:35.690
And it's a question that
many people internally

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.445
are highly interested in
supporting that functionality.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:44.236
But we built the site how
we built it back in 2003,

00:52:44.236 --> 00:52:45.860
and it's kind of like
[EXPLOSION SOUND]

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.385
into the code, the binary.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.430
And it's also not
as easy as simply

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:52.930
displaying what someone is.

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:56.761
You have this discovery
problem, which is at least half

00:52:56.761 --> 00:52:57.510
of the experience.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.260
And so there's so
many types of tools

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.050
that we could roll out
that would give people

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.450
more fine-grained control,
and this is one of them.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:06.340
But people can very
easily blow themselves up

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:13.760
by selecting-- if you're
two-spirited or something, one

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.679
of the ones that's
on Facebook's list,

00:53:16.679 --> 00:53:18.470
you have every right
to have that identity.

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:19.480
And then you also
have every right

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.146
to expect people to
be able to find you.

00:53:21.146 --> 00:53:22.960
And if you put
yourself in as a gender

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.730
that there's not very
many people actively

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:27.040
searching specifically
for that, you

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.279
can describe yourself
in a way, and then

00:53:29.279 --> 00:53:30.820
you basically end
up in a black hole.

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.640
Because no one will
find you, even people

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.290
you would be open to
talking to or dating.

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:39.290
And so the discovery
problem, and that's

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.464
a very specific
example, but the problem

00:53:41.464 --> 00:53:43.630
exists for almost every one
of the ones on that list

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:47.540
is that people have specific
ideas about who they are

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.310
but not necessarily specific
descriptive ideas about who

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.742
they want to date, generally.

00:53:51.742 --> 00:53:53.325
And so you kind of
have this asymmetry

00:53:53.325 --> 00:53:55.210
in what people are
willing to search for

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:56.790
and how people are willing
to describe themselves.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:57.800
Does that make sense to you?

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.383
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:58.383 --> 00:54:00.780
CHRISTIAN RUDDER: OK, so
it's a hard thing to solve,

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.220
and we're working on it.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:06.250
But also our back end kind
of gives us trouble, frankly.

00:54:07.516 --> 00:54:09.275
Oh, OK, cool.

00:54:09.275 --> 00:54:09.900
All right guys.

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.024
Well, thanks for having me.

00:54:11.024 --> 00:54:12.220
And I hope you buy the book.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.130
It's funny and good.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:16.990
And for those of you that use
OkCupid, thank you very much.

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:18.290
And thanks for having me.

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:20.740
[APPLAUSE]
