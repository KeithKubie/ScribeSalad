00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.500
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're going to talk

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.280
about regression lines,
but it's not gonna be

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.000
the first time we're talking
about regression lines.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.510
And so if the idea of a
regression is foreign to you,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.840
I encourage you to watch the
introductory videos on it.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.130
Here we're gonna think about
how we can make inferences

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.930
from a regression line.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.080
And so if the idea of statistical
inference is new to you

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.980
or hypothesis testing, once again,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.760
watch those videos as well.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.940
But let's say we think
there's a positive association

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.280
between shoe size

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.970
and height.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.240
And so what we might
want to do is we could,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.240
here on the horizontal
axis, that is shoe size.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.940
Our sizes could go size
one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.590
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.220
and it could keep going up from there.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.390
And then, on this height,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.490
or on this axis, our y-axis,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.340
this would be height,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.930
so one foot, two feet,
three feet, four feet,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.630
five feet, six feet, seven feet.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.710
And then you could,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.060
to see if there's an association,
you might take a sample.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.710
Let's say you take a random sample

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.600
of 20 people from the population.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.040
And in future videos, we'll
talk about the conditions

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.940
necessary for making
appropriate inferences.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.210
Let's say those 20 people
are these 20 data points.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.790
So there's a young child, and
maybe there's a grown adult,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.840
with bigger feet and who's taller.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.830
And then three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.457
10, 11, 12,

00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.046
13, 14, 15,

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:28.711
16, 17,

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.800
18, 19, 20,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.750
and so you have these 20 data points.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.120
And then what you're likely to do

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.610
is input them into a computer.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.620
You could do it by hand,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.420
but we have computers now
to do that for us usually.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.290
And the computer could try
to fit a regression line.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.430
And there's many techniques for doing it,

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.670
but one typical technique is
to try to overall minimize

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.200
the squared distance between
these points and that line.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.550
And this regression line
will have an equation,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.050
as any line would have.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.240
And we tend to show that as saying y hat,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.920
this hat tells us that
this is a regression line,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.980
is equal to the y-intercept,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.720
a plus the slope times our x variable.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.260
So this right over here would be a.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.370
Now, to be clear, if
you took another sample,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.170
you might get different results here.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.530
In fact, let's call this y
sub one for our first sample,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.520
a sub one, b sub one,
and this is a sub one.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.780
If you were to take
another sample of 20 folks,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.613
so let's do that.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.590
Maybe you get one, two, three,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.120
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.967
nine, 10, 11, 12,

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.607
13, 14, 15, 16,

00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:35.774
17, 18, 19, 20

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.170
and then you tried to fit a line to that,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.150
that line might look something like this.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.560
It might have a slightly
different y-intercept

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.640
and a slightly different slope.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.890
So we could call that,
for the second sample,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.920
y sub two or y hat sub
two is equal to a sub two

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.620
plus b sub two times x.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.190
And so every time you take a sample,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.530
you are likely to get different results

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.590
for these values, which
are essentially statistics.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.160
Remember, statistics are things that we

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.040
can get from samples, and
we're trying to estimate

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.290
true population parameters.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.280
Well, what would be the
true population parameters

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.920
we're trying to estimate?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.650
Well, imagine a world,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.430
imagine a world here,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.600
that you are able to find out
the true linear relationship,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.300
or maybe there is some
true linear relationship

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.760
between shoe size and height.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.950
You could get it if
theoretically you could

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.330
measure every human being on the planet.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.940
And depending what you
define as a population,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.930
it could be all living people

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.090
or all people who will ever live.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.923
This isn't practical,

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.060
but let's just say that
you actually could.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.350
And you would have billions
of data points here

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.000
for the true population.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.820
And then if you were to fit
a regression line to that,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.820
you could view this as the true
population regression line.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.550
And so that would be y hat is equal to,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.440
and to make it clear that here,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.880
the y-intercept and the slope,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.040
this would be the true
population parameters.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.170
Instead of saying a, we say alpha.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.460
And instead of saying
b, we say beta times x.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.890
But it's very hard to come up exactly

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.010
with what alpha and beta are,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.040
and so that's why we
estimate it with a's and b's

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.060
based on a sample.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.880
Now, what's interesting,
with this in mind,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.340
is we can start to make
inferences based on our sample.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.380
So we know that, for example,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.680
b sub two is unlikely to be exactly beta.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.830
But how confident can we be

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.840
that there is at least a
positive linear relationship

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.030
or a nonzero linear relationship?

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.360
Or can we create a confidence
interval around this statistic

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.100
in order to have a good sense of where

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.800
the true parameter might actually be?

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.870
And the simple answer is yes.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.000
And to do so, we'll use
the same exact ideas

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.760
that we did when we made
inferences based on proportions

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.700
or based on means.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.210
The way that you can make
an inference, for example,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.840
for your true population
slope of your regression line,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.290
say, okay, I took a sample,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.400
I got this slope right over here,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.910
so I'll just call that b two,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.320
and then I could create a
confidence interval around that.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.380
And so that confidence interval

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.660
is going to be based on
some critical value times,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.000
ideally, the standard deviation

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.020
of the sampling distribution
of your sample statistic.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.260
In this case, it would be the
sample regression line slope.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.590
But because we don't know
exactly what this is,

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.270
we can't figure out precisely
what this is going to be

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.180
from a sample, we are going to estimate it

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.810
with what's known as the
standard error of the statistic.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.070
And we'll go into more depth
in this in future videos.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.810
And since we're estimating here,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.330
we're going to use a
critical t-value here,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.230
which we have studied before.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.330
And so based on your confidence
level you want to have,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.760
let's say it's 95%,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.500
based on the degrees of
freedom, which we'll see

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.530
will come out of how
many data points we have,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.040
we can figure this out.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.420
And from our sample,
we can figure this out,

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.710
and we can figure this out.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.400
And then we would have
constructed a confidence interval.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.410
We'll also see that you could
do hypothesis testing here.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.340
You could say, hey, let's
set up a null hypothesis,

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.620
and the null hypothesis is going to be

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.308
that there is no nonzero
linear relationship

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:15.300
or that the true population
slope of the regression line

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.740
or slope of the population
regression line is equal to zero

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.630
and that the alternative hypothesis

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.770
is that the true
relationship could either be

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.450
greater than zero, it's a
positive linear relationship,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.750
or that it's just nonzero.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.410
And then what you could
do is, assuming this,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.250
you could see what's the
probability of getting a statistic

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.170
that is at least this
extreme or more extreme?

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.110
And if that's below some threshold,

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.200
you might reject the null hypothesis,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.110
which would suggest the alternative.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.510
So this and this are things
that we have done before

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.840
where you're creating
a confidence interval

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.050
around a statistic or you're
doing hypothesis testing,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.300
making assumptions about a true parameter.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.680
The only difference here
is that the parameter

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.930
that we're trying to
estimate are going to be

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.199
the parameters for a theoretical
population regression line,

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.000
and we're going to do that
using sample statistics

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.223
for a sample regression line.
