00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.310
Of course, we could simply add code that puts a new function property on

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.560
every single new instance as the constructor is running, but

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.430
this would mean we are creating a lot more function objects than necessary.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.820
Let's use the power of prototype chains to save memory.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.860
Recall that in the pseudo-classical pattern, any properties that you want shared

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.570
across all instances go on the .prototype property of the constructor function.
