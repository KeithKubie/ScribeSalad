00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.530
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: So, I'm here
to introduce Cathy [inaudible]

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.190
who you know, is our consultant
for the team board at the Library

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.790
of Congress and Cathy will
introduce Monica Hesse.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.280
&gt;&gt; Cathy: Thank you all for coming

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.130
and I know this is
a little different

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.620
because we are not reading,
reviewing, doing [inaudible].

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.920
I'm OK with that.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.950
So, we still want you
to read [inaudible] copy

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.140
of the teens' book, that's great.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.370
So, keep those reviews coming,
but now, the most important part

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.210
of today is, Monica Hesse is author
of, "The Girl in the Blue Collar".

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.380
And she's also written
two other teen books,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.880
and she's also a writer
to the Washington Post.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.460
So, she has two different
careers going on.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.320 position:56%
I think she works 24/7 or something.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.650
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: 48/7.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.060
&gt;&gt; Cathy: Anyway, I think
[inaudible] enjoy her book,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.780
it's historical fiction
in World War II.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.110
As a girl who is kind of in a
position of having to make a choice

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.520
between just kind of
turning the other --

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.510
look in the other way or helping
some people that really need help,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.020
Jewish during World War II.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.850
So, Monica, thank you
very much for coming.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.700
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: So, I hear some
of you are journalists, yes?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.210
Raise your hand if you
are in a journalist class.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.510
Excellent.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.500
This makes my job so much easier
because I'm going to trust

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.270
that when I run out
of things to say,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690
you guys will be much more
interesting and have lots

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.710
of questions to ask me, yes, yes.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.010
That's true.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.010
And you in the back, you are
not journalists' students,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.480
but you are readers, awesome.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.900
OK. So, I work for the Washington
Post, and that's my day job,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.440
it's been kind of crazy year.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.160
How many of you follow politics?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.010
OK. It's been kind of
a crazy year, right?

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.420
So, this year I got to do things
like go to political conventions,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.890
in Philadelphia and Cleveland
and that was really interesting

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.760
to see the country and what kind
of things people were talking about

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.730
and how sometimes it seemed

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.570
like people are not even
talking in the same languages.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.370
I also get to do other kind of
stuff, like, I went to the Oscars.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.080
So, I always tell people, if we
can't think of anything to talk

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.190
about in the Roman
[phonetic] Historical Fiction,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.260
we can talk about Jennifer
Lopez's but,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.400
because I accidentally touched it
when I was at the Academy Award.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.190
And that is an experience
on to itself.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.520 position:56%
So, when we have time for questions,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.360
I hope the journalist will ask
me questions about journalism

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.660
which I love to talk about.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.190
Is the best job ever.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:15.530
And, but now we'll start by
talking about this book, this book.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.270
How many of you read Historical
Fiction on a regular basis?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.800
How many of you think it sounds
like a really boring genre?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.510
You won't offend me, OK, yes.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.060
So, here what is really
interesting about history,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.390
it keeps repeating itself, and even
when you think that you are writing

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.020
about another time, and you think

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.820
that you are researching
another time,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.680
you are actually researching
right now,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.770
you are actually seeing patterns
come out again and again.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.890
I'm going to tell you what this
book is about and then I'm going

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.290
to tell you what this
book is really about.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.370
This book is about a teenage girl
who lives in Amsterdam in 1943,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.010
when it has become occupied
by the SS, by Nazis.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.510
So, in every street corner she
goes, there are Nazi guards,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.270
dressed in green, and there are
curfews and she's not allowed

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.220
to go out, and people are
disappearing all around her,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.150
because Jewish families are being
taken, and they're being deported

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.390
into concentration camps.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.920
And she makes her living
as a black marker worker.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.130
So, in this age, it's impossible
to get things like cigarettes,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.660
and alcohol and chocolate,
and perfumes,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.870
and these sort of luxury goods.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.870
So, my character Hanika [phonetic],
she makes her living by moving

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.270
around the city, getting
these goods under the table,

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.640
and then selling them for a profit.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.410
And one day, one of her
regular clients asks her

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.900
for help finding something
extra special, and is a person.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.460
And her client says -- I've been
hiding this young Jewish girl

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.900
in my pantry for the
past couple of months

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.050
and she's disappeared,
into thin air.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.030
And so, my character hast to figure
out how to go about searching

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.470
for a girl who is not supposed to
exist at all because she's a Jewish

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.800
and most of the Jewish in
the city have been deported.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.410
So, that's what the book is about.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.220
Is a mystery about trying
to find a missing person

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.190
when you live in a police state.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.900
When the people around you are
being harmed, are being deported.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.760
What the book is really about
is about trying to figure

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.800
out how far you would go
to do the right thing,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.360
and how you know what
the right thing is.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.930
And, how do you forgive yourself

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.300
when you've been doing the
wrong thing for a long time.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.670
Is about betrayals between friends,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.870
and it's about losing
the first person

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.350
that you love in a permanent way.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.220
And raise your hand if you
think like me, whenever I think

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.480
about the Holocaust before writing
this book, I would always think,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.510
I would have been one of the people
who was a part of the resistance,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.120
like obviously I would
have volunteer,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.930
I would have helped hide people,
I would have been a part of that.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.040
Yes? I think is like --
it's so easy to think that.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.170
And here is what's
fascination, it was really hard

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.640
to be a part of the resistance.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.570
You would be imprisoned,
you could be killed,

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.830
your family would definitely
loose it's livelihood.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.060
If you are a character
like my character,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.690
Hanika who supports her family,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.540
being part of the resistance
would probably mean poverty

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.850
and homeliness for your family.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.580
And so, what I think is really
fascinating is that is so easy

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.110
to say what we think we would
do, and then, when we are put

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.640
to the test, would
we really do that?

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.350
And I think about that now, when
we talk about things like --

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.360
when we talk about things
like Syrian refugees,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.960
should we accept Syrian
refugees into the country?

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.230
Because they were having
that discussion 80 years ago

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.920
about whether we should accept
Jewish refugees into the country.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.230
When we talk about,
would we stand up

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.370
and protect people
of different faith?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.360
Would we stand up for our
Muslims brothers or sisters?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.370
They were having that
conversation 80 years ago,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.970
but it was about the Jewish
people who lived among them.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:37.430
So, I totally get that reading
Historical Fiction can seem just

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.230
so [inaudible] and boring, but
I feel like you are reading

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.120
about people, no matter
where people lived,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.050
and that's what I like about it.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.660
For those of you who actually
like Historical Fiction,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.340
do you have any recommendations?

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.640
Did you raise your hand?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.010
What do you like?

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.450
&gt;&gt; The book?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.800
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes, or the
genre or the era, or the time.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.100
[inaudible].

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.510
Oh, what's that about?

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:14.870
&gt;&gt; It's about a girl [inaudible]
country and she [inaudible]

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.480
but she has [inaudible] she lives

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.850
with a forest parent
[inaudible] school [inaudible] how

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.920
to write and read [inaudible].

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.730
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Oh my Gosh,
that does sound amazing.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.730
How else wants to read that book?

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.160
I do. OK. does anyone else have
any favorites before we start?

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.930
No? All right, yes, you.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.970
&gt;&gt; A boy in a [inaudible].

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.590
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Oh,
that's really good.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.400
And that's also World War II.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.060
Yes, that's a great book.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.350
Thank you for recommending that.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.520
So, here's what I thought that
I would do and you guys tell me

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.620
if you have a different way,
you do this more than I do,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.920
you are here all the time.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.220
Tell me if I'm breaking any rules.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.080
I thought that I would read you
a couple of pages form my book,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.060
so you have that kind of a better
sense who the characters are.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.320
And then I want to tell you a
little bit more about how I came

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.100
out with those characters, if
there are writers in this room,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.060
sometimes coming with
characters is really hard.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.780
So, I wanted to pass through some
historic photos that gave me kind

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.520
of a context and background.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.620
And then, we'll do
questions and we can talk

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.940
about whatever you
want for questions.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.950
Does that sound?

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.170
Yes? No? OK.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.790
So, I've got more thumps
up than thumps down,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.250
that's what we are going to do.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.550
I'm going to steal this book,
because I forgot to bring my own,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.200
so, is lucky that one
is sitting right here.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:43.870 position:56%
So, like I said, this book, it opens
with this named character, Hanika,

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:49.300
who has just been asked by this
client, Mrs. Johnson [phonetic]

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.280
to find this young girl
who's going missing.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.820
So, I'm going to read you, just
a couple of pages form just

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.470
after this request has been asked.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.060
OK.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.730
Mrs. Johnson is still
waiting for me to respond,

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.300
standing in the dark space,
where the air [inaudible]

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.000 position:56%
and smells [inaudible] old potatoes.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.640
Hanika, she asks -- you
were hiding someone?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.370
-- I can barely get the words out
as she relishes the secret shelve,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.210
closes the secret pantry door
and lead me back to the table.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.370
I don't know if I'm more
shocked or more scared.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.760
I know this happens, that some of
the Jews who disappear are packed

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.160
like winter [inaudible] in
other people's basements,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.690 position:56%
rather than relocated to work camps,

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.030
but it's too dangerous
to ever admit out loud.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.160
Mrs. Johnson is nodding to my
question -- I was -- in here?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.920
You were hiding someone in here?

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.190
For how long?

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.490
-- Where should I begin?

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.120 position:56%
-- she says, picking up her napkin
and twisting it between her hands --

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.030
I don't really want her to begin at
all, ten minutes ago I was worried

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.440
that Mrs. Johnson might have
called someone to arrest me,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.560
but now I know she was the
one who could be arrested.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.700
The punishment for hiding people
is imprisonment, a cold damn cell,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.460
where I've heard of people
disappearing for months

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.760
without even getting hearings.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.060
And the punishment
for being a person

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.890
in hiding is immediate deportation
-- never mind -- I said quickly --

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.530
never mind, I don't need to
hear anything, I'll just go -- .

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.830
Why don't you sit down again?

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.160
-- She pleads -- I've been
waiting all morning for you --

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.740
she holds a pitcher
of coffee -- More?

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.130
You can have as much
as you like, just sit,

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.410
if you don't help mem I'll
have to find someone else --

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.360
And now I'm conflicted, standing
here in the middle of the kitchen

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.240
as Mrs. Johnson tries
to find someone else,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.730
she could be putting
herself in danger

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.660 position:56%
and me too -- Tell me what happened?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.480
-- I said finally -- My husband's
business partner -- she begins --

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.120
he was a good man, David, he
worked for Hendric [phonetic]

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.410
for ten years, he had a wife,
and they had two daughters,

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.780
Leah [phonetic] who has just
turned 12 and was the family pet

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.530
and the older daughter,
15, independent,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.280
always off with her
friends, Miriam [phonetic] --

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.070
her throat catches
at that last name,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.730
and she swallows before continuing
-- the [inaudible] were Jewish,

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.090
they are not very observant, and in
the beginning it seemed like that

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.060
that would make a difference,
they didn't of course.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.680
In July after the big [inaudible]
where so many Jewish were taken,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.540
David came to Hendric and said he
and his family needed help going

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.300
into hiding, -- and
Hendric brought them here?

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.000
-- I asked -- No, he didn't want
to put me in danger -- she says --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.740
he brought them to the furniture
shop, he built a [inaudible],

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.180
a secret room behind the
false wall in the wooden shop.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.690
I didn't even know
-- you didn't know?

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.360
-- I say -- I can't imagine my
own parents being able to keep

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.510
such a secret from each other -- I
knew Hendrix was spending more time

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.310
in the shop, but I thought he
was just working longer hours,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.380
I thought the [inaudible] had gone
to a safe house in the country,

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.960
I didn't know all of them
were right there in hiding --

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.260
when did he finally tell you?

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.150
-- I asked -- He never told me.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.180
Last month, I was home alone
when I heard knocking at my door,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.680
[inaudible] knocking,
it was after curfew,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.340
I thought Hendrix had
forgotten his key,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.980
but when I opened the
door there was this girl,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.810
this pale girl wearing a blue
coat, she'd grown so much,

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.540
I hadn't seen her in a few years,
and I wouldn't have recognized her

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.980
if she hadn't introduced herself,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.610
she told me that my husband
had been hiding them,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.240 position:56%
but now she needed a new safe space,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.710
she said that everyone
else was dead -- .

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.680
OK, so, that's sort of near
the beginning of the book.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.160
And so, here is what we know,
we know that this girl appeared

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.140
out of nowhere and then she
disappeared into nowhere,

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.820
and we have to figure out where
she went, and that is going

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.800
to involve going all around
the city of Amsterdam.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.800
So, I wanted to show you
some pictures of Amsterdam,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.000
because I'm kind of a nerd,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.810
and I really like [inaudible]
these photos.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:53.170
You know I was talking about trying
to figure out why you would do

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.160
in a situation, would
you be on the good side?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.510
Would you not?

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.070
When I first started to
do research for this book,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.450
this was the first photo
that I came across.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.750
Photos are all messed up.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.050
I'm going to find them.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.070
OK, so, this photo that
I'm going to pass around,

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:28.420
you'll see it has groups of people
walking in the street and some

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.030
of them are walking
on the side walk,

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.330
and some of them are
walking in the middle.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.940
You guys pass up, and
we'll meet in the middle.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.230
So, what's happening is that this
group of people in the middle,

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.530
that's a group of Jewish people

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.200
who are being walked to
a deportation center.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.510 position:56%
And when I say a deportation center,

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.610
you guys know the Kennedy's
Center here in D.C.?

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.910
OK. So, in Amsterdam, there
was a really famous theater,

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.530
called the Dutch Theater.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.910
And, during the time
of World War II,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.430
that became the deportation center.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.800
So, picture the Kennedy
Center, except, instead of going

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.520
to see a place there, they rounded
it up every one of a certain faith

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.120
and they sent them
there until they started

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.730 position:56%
to take them to concentration camps.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.410
So, what's happening in this
picture is that the group of people

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.530
in the middle -- did
anyone not see these?

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:29.360
OK. So, the group of people in the
middle, these are Jewish people

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.440
who are being walked to the
center, and these people

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.730
on the sides, who are they?

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.030
&gt;&gt; Nazis?

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.520
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: No,
they are you and me.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.350
These are regular people, they are
going about their Sunday business,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:52.440
and imagine you are out on Sunday,
you are like going shopping,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.930
and next to you there are
groups of people being walked

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.400
to the Kennedy Center, which
is now a deportation center

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.140
where everyone goes and they
disappear and they don't come back.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.190
And I thought that this
was so interesting,

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:12.620
because this is happening like
right in front of people's eyes.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.250
You know that your
neighbors are disappearing,

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.120 position:56%
they are disappearing right in
front of you, but you have to figure

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.790
out what am I going to do about it?

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.420
Because like I said, is really
dangerous to do anything about it.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.450
So, I really wanted to write a book
from the perspective of someone

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.120
who was in that position, no
that it was happening to her,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.880
the bad stuff is happening
all around her,

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.740
and she has to decide whether or
not she's going to act or not.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.370
And so, the main character,
Hanika, that's her,

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.980
she's one of those
people, just walking alone,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.320
while bad stuff is happening and
she has to decide what to do.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.030
So, when I started to research,
I also started to learn

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.170
about the different kinds of
resistance activities there were,

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.190
and this I thought was
really interesting,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.160 position:56%
because this is a resistance
activity, that was taken up by a lot

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.330
of young people, especially
a lot of young women.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.250
And when I say young --
like your age, maybe.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:20.460
Somehow, I lost --
there it go, thank you.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.790
So, this photo, I'm going to pass
around, this is a teenage girl,

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:32.490
she's caring a purse, you
might notice something off

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.760
about the purse, the first person

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.440
who sees it -- someone
said it already.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.420
did you say it?

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.720
&gt;&gt; There is a camera.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.880
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: There's
a camera in the purse.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.110
So, this girl was a part of
the resistance called the

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.750
"illegal camera" and
the "illegal camera".

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.100
Does everyone see it?

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.990
Do can see the lens in the bottom.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:04.140
What she did, her form of
resistance, she decided was going

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.430
to be to document what
was happening.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:13.870
So, when the secret police
arrested people and beat people

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.940
up on the streets, she was
going to take photographs of it.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.320
Does that remind anyone of
anything happening today?

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.830
You are nodding your head,
what are you thinking?

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.130
[inaudible].

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:32.590
It reminded me of that too,
it reminded me of how we see,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.810
when we see acts of violence we
see people taking photographs.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.970
Did I pass the wrong photos?

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.270
I'm losing my mind.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.640
Am I still sitting on the photos?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.940
Thank you.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:50.430
And I thought that that was really
meaningful is that here is a person

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.890
that -- she's young, she
probably doesn't have a house

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.720 position:56%
to hide people in, but she's decided
that her form of resistance is going

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.530
to be to document it, is
going to be to say, later on,

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.900
if you try to tell a different
story, if you try to say

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.320 position:56%
that something else happened, I am
here to tell you that this happened,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.010
and I can prove that it did,
because here are photographs.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:15.000
And I thought that that was so
powerful, that 80 years ago,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.520
people are thinking about
this as their form of protest.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.820
So, last photograph that
I'm going to pass around --

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.080
so remember I told you
about that Kennedy Center,

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.800
like a deportation center?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.710
This is a picture of that,
this is the back alley,

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:37.200
this is the back alley of
that -- of that theater.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.690
And, this photograph was taken not

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.920
by the girl whose picture
I just showed you,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.900
but by a very similar --
by a similar young girl.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.880
This photograph was
taken by a girl who lived

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.250
in the apartment falling
behind the theater.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.860
And she looked up one day, and she
knew it was a deportation center,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.990
and every day she would see
new groups of people come in,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.750
and one day, she looked up,
and she saw her best friend,

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.780
her best friend was Jewish, and
had disappeared from the school,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.420
and suddenly there she was, in
the alley, behind the theater.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.890
And there was nothing the
photographer could do.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.190
Her name is Lidia [phonetic].

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.490
There was nothing that Lidia could
do, except photograph her friend,

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.770
and say, "this is the
last time that I saw her".

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.350
And her friend did not survive.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.720
Her friend was killed
in a concentration camp.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.620
But, I thought that this
photo was really powerful,

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:38.290
and the girl who's circled
in the photo, if you see it,

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.960
is just kind of blurry, but the
circled girl, is who I picture

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.140 position:56%
when I picture Myriam [phonetic] the
girl that everyone is trying to find

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:53.430
in my book, which is this girl who
was there, and suddenly she wasn't.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:59.390
So, I probably talked way
more than you wanted to know

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:04.410
about occupied Amsterdam in
the 1940s, but I think --

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.160
like I said, I think that when
we are talking about history,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.160
we are really talking about
human behavior, which is,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.680
which is the same through
the decades.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.030
Again, and again, we see
people making the same mistakes

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.040 position:56%
and struggling with the same issues.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.420
So, I'd love to open
it up for questions,

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.860
and they could be questions about
the Netherlands or about writing

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.270
or about books, or -- instead

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.160
of asking questions you could
just tell me some things

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.940
that I should be reading
or learning about,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.640
give me some ideas
for my next stories.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.740
I'd definitely take that too.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.040
Yes?

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:41.610
&gt;&gt; So, I've never really studied
[inaudible] like the Jewish people.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.280
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Oh Gosh, that is
such an enormous question that,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.500
that people write whole books
about it, but, essentially,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.230
have you heard of Adolf Hitler?

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.530
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:54.830
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: OK.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.190
So, after World War I,
the country of Germany was

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:03.950
in a really bad way economically,
a lot of people couldn't find jobs,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.460
a lot of people couldn't
find work, and basically,

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:13.290
this man Adolf Hitler rose to power
by using the escape code [phonetic]

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.670
of the Jewish people, by saying,
"the reason that we can't --

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.890
the reason that the country is
struggling is the Jewish people,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:27.110 position:56%
they took all of your jobs, they are
doing better than you financially",

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:34.070
they became an escape code,
until the whole country in a kind

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.640
of mass frenzy bought into
it, and they were persecuted

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.940
in a really [inaudible] basis.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:45.190
And if anyone else has also studied
the Holocaust, and has a better way

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.430
to describe it in a short hand way,

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.760
I'd love to -- please,
please, jump in.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.430
All right.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.730
Yes?

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.950
&gt;&gt; I have a question about writing.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:00.950
How does it feel to
read your own book?

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.800
Because whenever I read
mine, I always [inaudible].

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.600
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: It's
the worst, isn't it?

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.630
Like every time I read
anything, I think,

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.880
"this is the dumbest thing
anyone has ever written,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.560
why did I do it this way?".

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.470
So, the bad news is,
it never changes.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:24.930
The good news is that we are often
our own worst critics, and also,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.620
the more times you read something,

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.710
the more things you notice
that you would change.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.010
But most people are only going

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.970
to read what you write,
you know, once or twice.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.120 position:56%
So, remind yourself of that, you are
reading something for the 12th time,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.030
and most people are not going
to be as nearly as critical.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.290
Yes. Is anyone else a writer?

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.440
Who know what I'm talking about?

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.820
Yes, OK. How do you feel
when you read your work?

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:54.180
&gt;&gt; When I read the
stuff that I write,

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.980
is like every time I read it
[inaudible] I can read it once,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.760
and notice it the first
time, but then,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.390
[inaudible] I notice
something different

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.030
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: I know, and by
the tenth time, you are like,

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.210 position:56%
haven't I not noticed at all, but is
like, no, you never noticed it all,

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.270
there's always something
you would change.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.570
What do you think?

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.340
&gt;&gt; I actually agree, for me is
the same way, I just keep trying

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.410
to change it to make it
better, then I'm [inaudible].

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.970
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes, yes.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.400
So, the only good news
that I have to say is,

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.540
I've interviewed some really,
really, famous writers and they --

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.930
like Nobel -- like Pulitzer
prize winning writers,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.900
and they all feel the same way,
is not just us, is everyone,

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.410
everyone doesn't like what
they write when they write it.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.120
But, we just learn to let it go

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.320
and no other people are
sometimes better judges

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.280
of our work thank we are.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:59.240
&gt;&gt; Were you always
passionate about writing?

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.450
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: No, not really.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:06.420
You know, I got into
journalism because I have --

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:12.030
I really get really nervous
when I have to talk to people,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.880
I can get really uncomfortable,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.530
and I though journalism would
be a good way to force me

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.360
to have to talk to people.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.170
And if I could just do all
of my reporting and stuff,

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.510
and never actually have to
write, that would be awesome,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.580
but unfortunately,
nobody pays you for that.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.660
So, the writing just became the
thing that I had to do in order

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.830
to get to have those
other experiences.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.550
Yes. Are you -- do you
like the writing part

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.820
or the interviewing part
of journalism better?

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.120
[Inaudible].

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:53.510
What do you like about it?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:26:00.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.380
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.870
But then, sometimes I feel like
when you have had a really good

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.350
interview, when you really
feel like you've learned a lot,

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.290
those are the stories that I
feel the most stressed out about,

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.170
you know, because, you are like,
I really want to do this justice,

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.430
this person was really
interesting, am I good enough?

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.620
Am I good enough to write that?

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:23.000
So, I don't know, if you have any
advice, I'd welcome that advice.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.190
Oh, yes.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.680
&gt;&gt; Did you enjoy writing your book?

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.600
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: So,
I did and I didn't.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.450
When you guys write, I'm
always curious to know

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.260
about people's processes,
do you always start writing

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.210
from the beginning of
whatever you are working on,

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.790
or do you ever start other places?

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.540
&gt;&gt; The beginning for me.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:50.120
&gt;&gt; I start from the top and
then go backwards [inaudible].

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.430
What I want the book to be about.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.100
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: And then you
like fill things in as you go?

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.400
Yes.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.000
&gt;&gt; I usually start with
a character design,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.210
because usually my book ideas,

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.410
either sometimes I'd just
have an idea for something

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:11.130
that I thought would be really cool
or, I'd have an idea of a person

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.720
that I thought would
be really interesting,

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.000
and I'd design the character to
the smallest detail as if like,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.970
if they have glasses how they put
on their glasses, or, and then,

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.290
from that, I design
a story around them.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.590
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:30.220
So, I think that I'm most like
you, where I'd think of a scene,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.730
maybe like a mixture of the two
of you, where I'll have a scene

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.950
that I really want to write
and the character I really want

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.510
to write about, and so,
I'll write that scene,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.520
and then I'll write other
scenes as I think of them.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.180
So, this is a long way of saying,
the beginning of the writing,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.630
is really, really, fun
because I'm writing the things

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.160
that came naturally.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.030
But then later, when you have to go
and fill in the rest, is like, oh,

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.650
there is a reason, that
I saved this until last,

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.490
because it's really hard,
because I don't know how to do it.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.360
So, it's fun in the
beginning, and then,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:11.410
at the end I would give anything
to have it be over with, I think.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.130
Anyone else?

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.850
OK. Wait, OK.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.610
You asked one already,
so you go first.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:20.510
&gt;&gt; We went to the political
convention -

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:26.500
[ Inaudible ]

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.800
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.420
So, someone asked this I
was in a class earlier today

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.840
and I've been thinking about
how to have a better answer,

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.480
but the broadest way that
I can describe is that,

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.620
it just really felt like going into
two completely different universes.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:50.390
It was like visiting two different
countries, and people were not,

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:56.880
people seemed to be afraid of
completely different things,

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.040
and be talking about
completely different things.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.340
I read this study a few days ago

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.410
that I thought was completely
fascinating which said that --

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:13.640 position:56%
it was all about like what Democrats
buy versus what Republicans buy.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.630
And, like they don't even buy
the same laundry detergent,

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.420
and they don't even
go to the same movies.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.530
Like, I was reading that Democrats
are 97 percent more likely

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.170
to go see horror movies, the
Republicans are something

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:31.240
like 80 percent more likely
to go see romantic comedies.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:39.700
And, I think that that's a
really scary and weird snapshot

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:45.430
of the country right now, if we are
not even going to the same movies,

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.640
what can we talk about, what kind

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.180
of common ground can
we find to talk about?

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.690
And that's kind of what struck me

00:29:54.690 --> 00:30:01.250
about the political
conventions is that, you had -

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.130
You were talking to groups of
people who really passionly believe

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:09.090
in what they believed
in, and they were in kind

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.320
of different planets
from each other.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:17.120
So, after you finish up your school
work tonight, figure out a way

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.520
to fix the country
and get back to me,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.090
and let me know what
you figured out.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.420
Did you have a question?

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:31.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, what advice
would you give to people

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.730
who want to become writers?

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.010
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: So,
the first advice --

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:39.180
there's really only like one piece
of advice, and that is to write,

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.660
which sounds really basic, but is
amazing how many people I meet,

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.190
grown up people, who are
like, "I'm a writer",

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.390
but then when you ask
what they are writing,

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:51.100
they are like, "I might write x".

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.330 position:56%
And I sort of believe, that if you
are a writer, you should be writing,

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.330
you should be writing all the time.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:02.240
And, the thing is -- I think a lot
of people think they can't write,

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.000
until they have like
a really good idea,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.450
or until they know how it ends,
or until they know how it's going

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.210
to go -- and that's
just not true at all.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:15.280
Most of what you write on any given
day is going to be really bad,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.380 position:56%
because most of what any of us write
on any given day is really bad.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.660
And I'll have days when
I get up the next day,

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.650
read what I wrote the day before
and delete three fourths of it.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.760
And that's OK.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.200
It doesn't -- your first
path doesn't have to be good,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.420
it's just what you want to do
is get yourself in the habit

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.940
where you are doing it every day,
so that when you don't do it,

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.770 position:56%
it feels like you forgot to brush
your teeth, or feels like you forgot

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:42.060
to wear underwear, it just has
to be like, "I write everyday

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.930
because is part of
planned on what I do",

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.280
and getting good at
it, that comes later.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.470
Sometimes that doesn't
come until a lot later.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:56.860
But, there are zero shortcuts,
you just kind of have to do it.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.160
Sorry.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.080
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask you, what
made you decide on this period

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.850
of time in your book, World War II?

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.150
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.420
So, I read the Diary of Ann Frank
a lot when I was growing up.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.070
Have any of you read the
Dairy of Anna Franck?

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.180
OK, yes, half of you.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:25.250
So, that book is set in
Amsterdam from 1942 to 1944,

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.650
but it all takes place
from inside of one room.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.240
And as I got older, I realized

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.370
that I had read this book probably
ten times, but most of what I knew

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:40.460
about the city was from
within one room looking out,

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.370 position:56%
and I was just really curious to
know what the city would have looked

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.710
like to someone living
on the outside

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.960
and someone trying to
navigate the streets.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.260
[Inaudible].

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.410
Yes, I have.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.230
Yes. Anyone else?

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.530
Yes

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.830
&gt;&gt; So, you say [inaudible].

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.340
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Left, left, OK.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.370
&gt;&gt; So, you say you write all the
time, are you writing anything

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:12.410
that you are planning
on getting published?

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.710
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.010
I just finished a book.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:21.310 position:56%
My next book is for adults, and it's
nonfiction, is about an arsonist,

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.100
is a true crime and
nothing at all like this.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.600
But, after that, I'm going to
start next month on a book,

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.580
another book that's YA
[phonetic] and it's set in 1943,

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.470
but in America, it's set in
an internment [phonetic] camp

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.680
in the United States
that had Japanese

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.630
and German prisoners living in it.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:41.960
Yes. [Inaudible].

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:48.440
What? No. It's this little town
called Cristal City, Texas,

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.190
and the whole town basically
became an internment camp.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.070
[Inaudible].

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.550
Yes, yes. Like they --

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:03.710
I mean, America was not
sodly [phonetic] heroic,

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.990
during World War II, and we
rounded up a lot of own citizens.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.480
So, this book is about some of
the immigrant characters who ended

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:17.350
up being in this internment
camp during the war.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.150
Yes.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:27.350
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.470
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: I don't think
I'll ever write a sequel, I mean,

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:35.500
I think I know what happens
to the characters, but,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:42.870
I feel like they were left at a
pretty complete place in the end.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:48.590
And, I mean I think if I did do
a sequel, it wouldn't be about --

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.920
there are a few characters in this
book who are really pretty minor,

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.410
but in my mind, I know a lot
more about their back story

00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:55.710
and find them really interesting.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.680
So, it would focus
on those characters,

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.740
rather than the essential ones.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.510
Yes.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:47.950
[ Inaudible ]

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.250
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: OK.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.480
So, before I answer, I'm so
curious about that question.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.120
Does anyone else have any --

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.180
does anyone else have
experience with this?

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.580
And what do you guys do?

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.670
You never talk to people
you disagree with?

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.970
Come on.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.770
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes, yes.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:19.490 position:56%
You are right, because the
difference when you are a journalist

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.430
as opposed to when you are taking
to a friend, you are right,

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:29.170 position:56%
I can't be like, well I think that's
wrong, because that's not my job.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.500
But, you know, I think that
the interviews when I'm talking

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:37.940 position:56%
to someone who makes no sense to me,
are the most interesting interviews,

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:44.810
because I'm trying
so hard to understand

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:52.100
where they are coming from, and why
their position makes sense to them,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.310
and what went into making
them have this position,

00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:03.330
that I feel like it's
not hard for me to --

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.650
I never want to tell the
them that they are wrong,

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.130
because that's not my job.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:14.510
My job is just to try to understand
like -- where does this come from,

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.490
and why do you think this way?

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.510
And how can I explain
this to readers in a way

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:23.480
that will hopefully help us
understand each other a little bit

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.670
more, you know, rather than
just having everyone see

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:33.210
like a caricature or like a
cartoon, or a -- you know --

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:38.100 position:56%
I saw a lot of, "I defriended all of
the Trump's supporters on Facebook",

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.550
or like, "I'm not going to
follow anyone on Twitter

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.270
who likes Hillary Clinton".

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:48.060
And, so I feel like my
job, is to introduce people

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.780
to each other a little bit,
and to do that you have

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.670
to really take what people are
saying seriously, the best you can.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.660
I think a hand, but no
face attached to it.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.960
OK.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:11.560
&gt;&gt; In English class,
we learned how to write

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.510
from [inaudible] perspectives,
and I think that [inaudible]

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:21.060
and say [inaudible] unless you
understand how they are feeling

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.360
and maybe [inaudible].

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.660
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Did it work?

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.010
Do you feel like it worked?

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.840
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.140
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: OK.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.200
what was the assignment, were you
writing about a particular issue?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.670
&gt;&gt; Well we did three different
assignments - well, four,

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:42.150
we were like practicing for a test
so we did one from a perspective

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:47.510
of a boy [inaudible] and
we were trying to see --

00:38:47.510 --> 00:40:04.390
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes, which
totally goes back to what I was kind

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.130
of trying to say in the beginning
with what led to this book,

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:14.210
is that is really easy
to look back and say,

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.550
"why did they act like that?

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:19.990
Why didn't more people stand up?

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.750
Why didn't more people help them?

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.050
And yes.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:29.250
&gt;&gt; Was this [inaudible]
than the other books.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.820
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Well, my other
books were science fiction,

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.670
so my other books didn't
need as much research,

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.960
and this needed a lot of research.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.350
So, that was different.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.990
And maybe easier in some ways,
because whenever I was like,

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.980
"I don't know what happens next?"

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.960
I could go to historical sources,

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.200
and they would sometimes
tell me what happened,

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.030
like around this time,
there was a big round of it,

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.800
and that maybe I should
incorporate that into story,

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.670
and that would be really
-- it was really good.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.970
Yes.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] question
[inaudible] girl with the blue coat,

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:07.040
I can't help to think
about the movie [inaudible]

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.090
and that one thing
[inaudible] was lost.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:15.190
Did you make a connection with that
when you came up with the title?

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.110
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: I have such
disappointing news about the title.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.010
I did not come up with it, and
it was not my first choice,

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.240
it was just kind of like, came
out of a brainstorming session.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.780
So, I talked to a school a few
weeks ago, and they were like,

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.070
"we've been doing essays about
the meaning of the title",

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:42.100
and I was like "there is no meaning
about the tittle" I feel so bad.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.400
Yes. Yes.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.050
&gt;&gt; Going back to writing from
someone else's point of view,

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:50.740
we also did a quick time
writing, were we looked at a photo

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:56.550
from during when integration
first started happening.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:02.950
I think it was [inaudible]
and there was --

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:06.130
we had to write first
from the perspective

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.100
of the African American
girl, who's going to school,

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:14.220 position:56%
and it was just three minute
writing, so it was like really fast,

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.260
and, that for most of
us, it was pretty easy

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:24.210
to interpret what she was feeling
because, is like you could relate

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:29.160
to her because people had been like
-- you could think of like also,

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.910 position:56%
like when you are learning bad
[phonetic] history, you are thinking

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.840
of all of the -- how hard it was,
so you learn a lot about that.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.600 position:56%
And then, we had to do -- write
from the perspective of the other --

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.100
this one girl at her school who was
screaming at her in this photo --

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.620
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: I bet
that was really hard.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:53.880
&gt;&gt; It was so difficult just to
think of what she was thinking,

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.810
and you are just like,
why would she --

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.780
I had no idea, and just
to come up with something,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.010
for what she was thinking,
which was so difficult,

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.050
but I also think it was
a really good exercise.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:05.800
So, that was sort of --

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.590
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes, I know
the photo you are talking about,

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.100
and someone actually -- do
you guys know this photo?

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.940
Does that ring a bell?

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:19.690 position:56%
It's a really powerful hard to look
at a photo of this young girl trying

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:22.780
to just go to school and
been yelled at and spited

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:27.470
on by these angry other students.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:32.750
I did read interviews with some
of the other people in that photo,

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.470
they went back and found
them, like 50 years later.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:41.950
And they found that screaming
woman, and she was --

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:47.600
[inaudible] by her
behavior, and felt as terrible

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.110
about it as she should have.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:56.010
And so, we could at list take a
lesson in that, sometimes people

00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:01.630
who even make the worst
mistakes you can imagine, learn.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.310
Yes. Yes.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.140
&gt;&gt; So, have you ever --

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:15.240
at the beginning you said how
you were writing about a time,

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.590
a while ago, but you realized that
you were really writing about stuff

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:23.560
that was going on today in a
way, because they connected --

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.090
and I know you said you
also wrote science fiction.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:32.030
So, I've read a lot of
science fiction and is always

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:36.670
like very futuristic and very
different and whatever, but then,

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:40.750
when you think back to it, there
are all this perfect society that's

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.300
trying to be built and it seems
similar to what it's trying

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.200 position:56%
to be built along -- what was trying
to be built during the Holocaust.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.320
So, did you ever think
about anything like --

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.050
because you typically [inaudible]
science fiction writer that,

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:02.260
or you have been science fiction
writer, that you sort of are trying

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:09.390
to build this utopian
society and then figure

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.770
out like a different
perspective on the Holocaust?

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.070
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Yes, I think

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:15.370
that that's a really
smart connection to make.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.350
I mean, I was not thinking

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:20.000
when I wrote the [inaudible]
science fiction novel.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.940 position:56%
I was not thinking in any particular
time, in world or American history.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.460
But, I think that, a pattern

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.690
in science fiction is we see people
trying to build perfect societies

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:39.710
that fail because their premises
is just so completely flawed.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:43.650
And we do see that in the
United States, in the world,

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:47.430
we see people saying, "things will
be better if only we could do this,

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:49.250
and do this", and then,
whatever this is,

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:53.940
they take it to a crazy extreme.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.110
So, I think that's a
really smart connection.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:00.510
&gt;&gt; I think we have time
for one more question.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:18.200
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.500
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Definitely.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.800
I mean, I was just reading --

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:27.480
have any of you guys read
or heard of "1,000 floor"?

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.360
OK. It's a really popular
book for teenagers right now,

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.250
and I keep hearing people talk
about it, so, I decided to read it

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:40.920 position:56%
and I was so conflicted because, I
was, oh this plot is so interesting,

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:46.440
but, this writing, I'm just, really
not connecting with the writing.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:52.660
And, I think, the best books
are ones where you like both,

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.110
and where you honestly don't
even think about how is written

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.590
because it feels natural,
and it doesn't feel forced.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:01.330
So, I like that, I
like those two grades,

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:06.630
because those are equally important
things that kind of have to work.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.930
Is in here?

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:09.550
Do you want me to tell -- ?

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.640
&gt;&gt; Before we thank Monica, I just
want to make one other thank you

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:19.740 position:56%
which is to an Open Book Foundation,
that is providing books for all

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.670
of you, [inaudible] with you,

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.030
and I want to thank you
for a wonderful program.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.330
&gt;&gt; Monica Hesse: Oh my gosh.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.630
Thank you.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.200
You guys are awesome.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.500
