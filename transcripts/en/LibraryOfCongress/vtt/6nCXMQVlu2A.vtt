00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.790
&gt;&gt; Francisco Macias:
Thank you, everyone.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.090
Hello, and welcome.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.480
I am Francisco Macias from
the Law Library of Congress.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.110
We have had an amazing series
of events in observance

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.050
of Hispanic Heritage Month.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.810
And I would like to thank all my
colleagues for their commitment

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.190
to making 2016 another huge success
in the showcasing of our heritage.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.730
What is additionally
noteworthy for today's program is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.370
that October is also LGBT History
Month in the United States.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.990
So today's program is particularly
significant for two communities

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.830
that embody the American mosaic.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.220
I would like to thank the Hispanic
Division, our natural partner,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.910
the Library of Congress
Office of Equal Employment

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.960 position:56%
and Diversity Programs, the
African and Middle Eastern Division,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.090
the Rare Books and Special
Collections Division, LC GLOBE,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.410
and the LC Hispanic
Cultural Society.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.240
It would be normal for quality
to wane a bit at the end

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.490
of a month-long celebration.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.090 position:56%
But I know this isn't the case here.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.220
In fact, I believe we are
ending on a very high note.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.410
And it is the collegial
spirit of people

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.720
from these custodial
divisions and organizations

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.890 position:56%
that has made possible this program.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.590
Special thanks to my colleagues,
Nicholas Brown and Roberto Salazar

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.230
for their support throughout
the planning

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.790
and execution of these programs.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.880
Both of our guests today are
extraordinary in caliber.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.890
So I will introduce them
in alphabetical order,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.440
Dr. Josiah Blackmore is a
Nancy Clark Smith professor

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.030
of the Language and Literature of
Portugal at Harvard University.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.720
For 22 years, he taught at
the University of Toronto.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.160
In addition to the history
of the sexuality in Iberia,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.050
especially that of Portugal,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.650
his research interests
include the literary culture

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.350
of maritime expansions,
shipwreck narratives, Luso-African

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.860
and counter narratives in the
medieval and early modern periods,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.930
the Galician-Portuguese
lyric schools of the 13th

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.570
and 14th centuries and
modern Portuguese poetry.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.320
He has held visiting
professorships at Harvard,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.940
and at the University of Chicago.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.080
And in 2006, was visiting scholar
at the Ernest Oppenheimer Institute

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.170
for Portuguese Studies
at the University

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.610
of the Witwatersrand's
Johannesburg, South Africa.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.520
And I have to pause there.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.460
His books include "Manifest
Perdition," "Shipwreck Narrative

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.610
and the Disruption of Empire
Moorings" -- pardon me, "Moorings:

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.560
Portuguese Expansion and
the Writing of Africa."

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.540
And in addition, Fernando Pessoa's
English translations of poetry

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.580
of the first-known gay
Portuguese poet, Antonio Botto,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.950
"The Songs of Antonio Botto."

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.400
Professor Gregory S. Hutchinson
is associate professor of Spanish

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.160
in the Department of
Classical and Modern Languages,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.090
an affiliated faculty in the Middle
East and Islamic Studies Program

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.310
at the University of Louisville.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.440
He has published on gender,
sexuality, and queer desire

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.300
in the Spanish Middle Ages,
attributing to edited volumes,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.270
such as "Same Sex Desire Between
women in the Middle Ages,"

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.590
"Queer in the Middle Ages," and,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.320
"Under the Influence Questioning
the Comparative in Medieval Iberia.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.140 position:56%
With Josiah Blackmore, he co edited
the book "We Are Here to Learn about

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.620
"Queer Iberia", Sexualities,
Cultures and Crossing

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.310
from the Middle Ages
to the Renaissance."

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.610
His current research explores the
sites of negotiation between Islam

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.430
and Christianity in
Medieval Iberian text.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.510 position:56%
Please join me in welcoming
Professors Blackmore and Hutchinson.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.700
[ Applause ]

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.030
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Thank you
very, very much, Francisco.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.750
I know -- and thank
you all for attending.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.100
I know Greg and I want to extend a
very sincere and heartfelt thanks

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.630
to the Library of Congress, and to
Francisco Macias for inviting us

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.460
to come, because this
has been something ever

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.500
since we received the invitation
we've been looking forward to.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.180
And we've been exchanging e-mails,
and texts, and at the prompting

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.910
of some excellent questions
that Francisco provided us

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.200
about a month ago,
Greg and I are thinking

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.720
of just having a conversation here
about the book, how it was born,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.180
where we think the field is going;
and we invite your participation.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.300 position:56%
So Greg is going to begin by talking
a little bit about the back story,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.270
the scholarly and disciplinary
back story of "Queer Iberia"

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.970 position:56%
when we first started thinking about
this project in the early 1990s.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.270
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
Thank you, Joe.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.220
And I echo Joe's note of thanks
for Francisco in particular.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.890
I feel like we've become
old friends,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.810
even though today is the
first time we're meeting.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.640
And actually PowerPoint, if you
could bring up the first slide,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.570
which is going to very important.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.820
Joe and I have been talking about
this, and actually not only Joe

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.100
and I but also other colleagues
in our graduate program.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.520
We were both graduate students
at Harvard back in the '80s.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.420
We've been talking about
this topic probably

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.840
for a good 30 years at this point.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.070
And last night we had yet
another animated exchange.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.570
Every time we get together,
we end up talking about

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.190
"Queer Iberia" and its resonance.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.900
Very animated exchange over drinks
at my hotel, leading, once again,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.740
to new ideas and sparking new
interests between ourselves

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.020
in the topic, or what I've come to
call the ""Queer Iberia" project.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.000
for me it all started with what
you see on the screen right now,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.680
which is the volume
that came out in 1980.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.890
John Boswell, I think for
everybody, is the iconic volume

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.040
for anybody who's studied
homosexuality in the Middle Ages.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.600
"Christianity, Social Tolerance
and Homosexuality," for those of us

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.050
who were graduate students
at that point in time,

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.070
a seminal because it
really gave us a sense

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.390
that this is a legitimate
topic of research.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.750
So much so for me that as I was
trying to come up with a topic

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.840
for my dissertation -- here I
was a [inaudible] medievalist,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.160
working with a very renowned
member of the Harvard faculty,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.490
Francisco Marquez Villanueva,
who was my dissertation director.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.710
I in collaboration with
him was trying to come

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.000 position:56%
up with a topic for my dissertation.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.910
So excited about this volume was
I that I marched into his office

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.080
in [inaudible] Library and said
very boldly, "I would like to work

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.340
on homosexuality Hispano
Middle Ages."

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.310
And his reply I'll give it to
you in Spanish first and then,

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.070
the translation, his
reply was, "Pues, pues."

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:28.020 position:56%
And I don't -- Yan [phonetic]
recognizes that accent, "Pues, pues.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.320
[Speaks Spanish]," which
in translation means,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.090
"It would be better not to
leave here, leave Harvard,

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.640
with a sword in the hand."

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.560
In other words, careful with
that topic, careful with working

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.860
on something that still is

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.920
so terribly controversial
in the academy.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.330
I ended up obviously working on
a completely different topic,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.390
it was a song book
from the 15th century.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.060
But Joe and I kept up the
dialogue, and I guess shortly

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.540
after we both had degree in hand

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.150
and had our first professional
appointments --

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.010
well I'm going to turn
it over to Joe.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.740 position:56%
He'll talk about what happened next.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.990
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Well, I
mean, Greg is completely right

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.800
that as graduate students,
this whole conversation began,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:16.360
And it was kind of -- it was like
trying to find form for some ideas.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.880 position:56%
And when the very first professional
conference that Greg and I went to,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.460
we went to it together, which
was Kalamazoo on a conferences

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:31.680
on Medieval Studies, and in the
early '90s, we were noticing

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:40.360
that there was nothing on sexuality
studies in medieval Iberia,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.530
participating in then current
discussions of an evolving field.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:53.210
So we decided that maybe we
could put together a small panel

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.200
at Kalamazoo to think
about some of these issues.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:07.650 position:56%
So in 1994, we had our panel,
"Queer Iberia", and four presenters;

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.780
we had invited four presenters,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.700
who ended up being
contributors to the volume.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.400
At the time, this was unheard

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.370
of in Hispano medievalism
in Iberia studies.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.230
This was a topic no
one was touching.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:32.610
And the response was so vibrant
in May of 1994 at that conference

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.090
that we decided we needed
to do something with this,

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:42.440
something to take it beyond the
conference circuit and integrate it

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.410
into a larger scholarly
conversation.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:52.110
And that's when we came up with the
idea of simply a volume of essays.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.600
We ended up -- I remember our first
talk was at the airport in Toronto.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.760 position:56%
You had come up and you were going
back to Chicago, and we were sitting

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.360
in Terminal One, and we decided
this might be a thing to do.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.140
And from that point on, the
volume took on a life of its own.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:19.350
So we eventually -- we worked
up a proposal, we submitted it

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:26.700
to several presses, and we want
to give a shout-out here today

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.980
to Duke University Press and
the then assistant editor,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.600
Richard Morrison, who --

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.640
Duke responded it was in
about a week's time, I think,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.780
and they were so excited about this

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.220
that it was exactly what two
young scholars at the beginning

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.930
of their careers needed
to push something forward.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.230
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
But I should add

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.590
that Duke already had a
demonstrated commitment

00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:00.010 position:56%
to queer Hispanisms I guess is the
best way to put it, with two volumes

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.650
that had come out previously,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:06.440
"Entiendes Queer Readings Hispanic
Writings," which came out in 1995,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.330
followed by "Hispanisms and
Homosexualities" in 1998.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.050
So this is one of the reasons
why we gravitated towards Duke,

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.910
because of that demonstrated
commitment to queer Hispanisms.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.010
But not queer Hispano-medievalism.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.520
Really, the inquiry of
both of those volumes began

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.140
with the early modern period.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.230
Nothing had been done
in the Middle Ages.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.980
And if anything had been
done on medieval sexualities,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.450
it tended to move in one of two
directions, either sexuality

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.800
in the Middle Ages was limited
exclusively to heterosexuality,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.220 position:56%
it was the study of heterosexuality,
or if there was any treatment

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.380
of queer sexualities,
it was through a kind

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:53.810
of sensationalistic framework,
taking sodomy, for example,

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.860 position:56%
and sensationalizing it, rather than
naturalizing it, and making it part

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.540
of a spectrum of sexualities
in medieval Iberia, so.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.450
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Yes, yes.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:09.590
So one of the questions Francisco
asked us to think about is,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:15.040
"Why "Queer Iberia"," in
addition to what we've just said.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.780
And the subtitle -- to us one
of the most important words

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:25.010
of the subtitle is "crossings,"
because in Iberia, of course,

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:31.850
there are borders and frontiers
of many kinds; cultures,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.450
sexuality, language, religion.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:42.630
And these borders suggest
something very rich and faceted

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.240
that we wanted to explore
as a whole.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.470
So between the kingdoms of
what is now modern-day Spain,

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.090
and the kingdom of Portugal,

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:59.850
which came to have its current
political boundaries in 1248,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:05.670
we were looking to think about how
there was a certain fungability

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:11.210
[phonetic], or precocity, as
opposed to walls and obstacles.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:19.250
So it very much was a project of
border crossings of many kinds.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.670
And I think when we were
putting together the volume

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.180
and doing our own essays,
we certainly felt that.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.880 position:56%
And in the past 17 years, that's one
of the things I think that people

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.410
at least have said to me most of
all is how much they appreciate

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:42.760
that Iberian perspective
as a historical reality,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.190
as a methodology, as a
critical methodology.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.050
So it was something we became very
invested in, wouldn't you say?

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.350
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Absolutely.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.490
I would also say that our queering
of medieval Iberia really --

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.720
we ended up contextualizing it
through a different kind of query,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.810
a cultural query that had
already been a bit realized

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.340
by Americo Castro.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.150
Americo Castro is one of the
great Hispanics [phonetic]

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.910
of the middle 20th century.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.240
He proposed a radically
different reading of the medieval

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.190
and early modern context in
Iberia, one which took him

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.680
to far greater consideration
the 800th year presence

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.560
of Islam in Iberia.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.890
And you can see on the map that's

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:31.650
on the screen right now the
furthest most northern region --

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:37.190
or border between Christian
Europe and what was

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.220
at that time Muslim Europe.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.950
The Muslim presence in Iberia
began in 711 with a crossing

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:50.460
of Arabic peoples along with Berber
peoples into the space of Iberia,

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.390
moved to the -- virtually
to the border with France,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.660
and progressively over the course

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.570
of several centuries the Christian
north began pushing southward.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.160
But that border -- as Joe implied,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.340
that border was always a porous
border, one not simply of conflict,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.580
but also of cultural negotiation.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.420
Medieval -- if you switch to the
next side that will give us a sense

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.950
of medieval Castro's
notion of medieval Iberia.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.340
This probably summarizes it best.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.490
It's from his Espania
in Historia Spain

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.080
and its history that
came out in 1948.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.780
He says that the most
universal aspect

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.130
of Hispanic character
traced their roots

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.180
to lifestyles forged
during 900 years

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.720
of Christian Islamic
Jewish intermingling.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:41.550
This brought rise -- this, as we
call it, the "cultural queering

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:46.980
of Iberia," the destabilizing
of Iberia as centered in Europe,

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.730
this brought rise to
immediate response in the part

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.950
of more nationalist
leading scholars,

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:58.710
such as Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz,
who re-described Iberia

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.370
in the context of Europe and
moreover, portrayed Iberian Spain

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.300
in particular as the
shield of Christian Europe

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.910
against the Islamic intrusion.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:15.140
And eventually, that
re-conquest that what was termed,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.440
the "Christian re-conquest
of Spain,"

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.390
it eventually had its culmination
in 1492, red-letter year,

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.440
we just celebrated it
I guess the other day,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.460
the discovery of the New
World, but also for Spain,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.990 position:56%
a red-letter year in other respects.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.420
The conquest by the Catholic
monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabelle

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.940
of the last foothold of Islamic
Iberia in the Iberian Peninsula,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.690
which was Granada, the Kingdom of
Granada, the expulsion of the Jews

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:52.430
from Spain, and this
confluence of events

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.370
for many contemporary scholars of
a nationalist leading represents

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:01.930
that moment when Spain
recovered its original identity.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.730
It finally expelled that Semitic
presence from the space of Iberia

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.150 position:56%
and reasserted its Spanish identity.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:17.920
For us that was the model for our
own queering, our own destabilizing

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.550
of Iberian sexualities
in the Middle Ages.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:27.110
And what gave this further weight
is a comment that came in one

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:32.340
of Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz's
later works in 1983.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:37.310 position:56%
Speaking about the re-conquest, one
of the consequences, the re-conquest

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.360
for him was that homosexuality,
as he put it,

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.470
which was so widely
practiced in Moorish Spain,

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:48.060
would have triumphed had
the Christians not managed

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.670
to expel the Muslims from Spain.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.490
So Sanchez-Albornoz was
also setting up that border

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.730
between Christian Spain
and Muslim Spain,

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.130
as a border between
heterosexual Spain,

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.970
represented by Christian
Spain, and homosexual Spain,

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:10.220 position:56%
represented by alandanos
[phonetic], or the Islamic presence.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:17.050
These were all provocations
for us, and gave further weight

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.300
to the project that
we were engaging in.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.430
And I would say I've
been very critical of the

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.250
"Queer Iberia" project since then,

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.090
and probably far more
critical than Joe.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.550
Joe has become one of the great
cheerleaders of this project.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.190
I had ended up criticizing
parts of it.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.530
One of the parts -- one of
the defects I see in the

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.840 position:56%
"Queer Iberia" volume as it came out
is that while some of us do engage

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.820
with the cultural aspects
of medieval Iberia,

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:48.730
it doesn't really come to the
fore that kind of intersection

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.610
of sexual non-normativities
with the othering

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.360
of the Semitic presence in Iberia.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.130
And one of our challenges I think
as we move forward with this

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.350
"Queer Iberia" project is
to pull into the project

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.900
that constant cultural negotiation
that's taking place throughout the

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.300
medieval Iberian context.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.380
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
Yes, definitely so.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.680
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
Joe, I'm sorry.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.800
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
No, I agree completely.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.880
One of the questions Francisco
asked both Greg and me is to think

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:28.090
about specific contributions,
if we had favored contributions.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:37.730
And it's -- we both agree that we
cannot single out one contribution,

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:43.300
for a lot of good reasons.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.000
When I think back on this
project, among other things,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.780
it was just like an amazing
scholarly collaborative party.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:00.800
The collaborative aspect on
this is what we treasured then

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.540
and treasure now.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.530
One, we like so much the fact
that we were able to get scholars

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.660
of different critical,
and methodological,

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.450
and disciplinary stripes into
the volume, literary scholars,

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.660
cultural historians, historians,

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:24.280
scholars of religion
and spirituality.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:31.830
So that collaborative
aspect is so strong,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.380
and it's one of the things
we're simply most proud of.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.680
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
Yes, absolutely.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.730
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: When we look
back on that, and what a group

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.870
of people working together even
though with different ideas.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.840
I remember once we
were thinking about --

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.400
and I just now remembered
this, we were trying to decide

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.720
when we were going to do
the collection of essays,

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.970
should we publish this, say, as
a special issue of a journal,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.450
or should we try to
publish it as a book?

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.770
And one of my colleagues said,

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.260
"Articles are good;
books are better.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.040
Nothing like a book
to make a statement."

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.500
And so we thought, "Well, we're
going to gun for the book then."

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.350
So when -- and I think the
collaborative multidisciplinary,

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.590
multi-methodological approach

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:27.360
that the volume represents shows
the agility of Iberian studies

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.290
as a field to engage in different
kinds of persuasive scholarship

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:38.250
to push at borders, to cause
crossings, to find paths.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.320
So I think we're -- I would
say I don't think either one

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.810
of us could have done this alone.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.860
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
No; absolutely not.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.030
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
And that's one of the --

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:54.940
what came to my mind the most
and has been with me since 1994

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.530
when we did that session
at Kalamazoo.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.170
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: And I
would say as well that the energy

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.480
that came out of our dialogue,
starting with that conversation

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.280
in the airport in Toronto.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.920
Joe has an incredible
memory for these details.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.130
I'm always struck when
we chat because he brings

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.420 position:56%
up things I've completely forgotten.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.190
But the energy that came out of

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.910
that dialogue is really
what gave us the --

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.710
how can I put it, the
cajones, I guess, to --

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.560
[laughter] as very junior scholars,
to move forward with this project.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.530
And in fact we --

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.460
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: And in
fact, you know, here we were,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.540
I was two years into a
non-tenure track position.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.410
I didn't even know if my position
was going to become tenured track.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.430 position:56%
Greg was in a tenure track position,
but seriously, pre-tenure scholars.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:46.640
And I mentioned this project
to a senior colleague,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.860
and the answer was very preemptory,
"Joe, if you do a book with 'queer'

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.610
in the title, that would
be professional suicide."

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.800
And I thought, "Wow,
what do I do now?"

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.880
Right? I listened to my
seniors in the field as guides.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:10.100
But we were so -- here again, this
collaborative aspect between Greg

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.910
and me, and between us
and our collaborators,

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:19.980
really gave us the oomph to say,
"Well, but we believe in this."

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.730
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Among senior
colleagues as well, senior scholars

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:28.220
in the field; and I think that was
what ended up being most important

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.420
to us, and gave us the wherewithal
to move forward is the fact

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.320
that so many senior colleagues
in the field, whether in history,

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.750
or in literary studies stepped
up to be part of this volume.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.960
They recognized in this volume
something that would be --

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.160
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
Yes, that's right.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.670
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
Groundbreaking.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.970
And --

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.270
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Yes.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.890
So the reception -- this is a
way of us leading into the idea

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.970
of the reception of the
volume, which Greg is going

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.870
to say some things which are
really quite interesting,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:04.080 position:56%
because the reception in North
America, and the reception in Spain,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.410
and the reception in Portugal,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.060
those are very interesting
parts of the story.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.830
Greg's going to talk about some
of the more contentious reviews

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:18.620
by North American scholars
in Spain and Portugal,

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:24.100
going to mention a
few of these as well.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.910
As the volume made its way into
libraries and onto people's desks

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.270
to read both in North
America and Iberia itself,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:42.210
every once in a while, we would get
contacts, scholars, young scholars

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.320
in Portugal and Spain,
writing us saying, "Wow,

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.210
we never thought we would
see something like this."

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:55.680
Because at the time, it was not
possible for someone in Iberia

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.610
to take on something called
""Queer Iberia"," right?

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:05.930
And I remember getting e-mails from
high school teachers in Portugal

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.800
and Spain, saying, "This
is something that finally,

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.530 position:56%
this is coming out in a major press,
but it still would be very hard

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.770
for us -- " meaning
Portuguese or Spanish nationals,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:24.720
to do this because it was
so risky in an academy

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.550
that was still very
traditional, very traditional.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.010
But Greg's going to talk
about some of the reviews,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.150
which are really interesting,
I think.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.270
And these reviews -- in fact,
our conversation last night,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.750
we spent most of the time
talking about these reviews

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.210
and what they mean to us
now almost 20 years later.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.160
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Well, and
I'll add to what Joe just mentioned

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.530
about the reception here in
the States, especially from --

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.510
or in Spain and Portugal
from high school teacher.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.190
Here in the States, I'm
still struck by the fact

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:59.540
that when I attend conferences,
graduate students, new colleagues

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.690
in formation, when they meet me

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.720
and they hear my name,
are kind of star struck.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.630
I'm amazed by that.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.310
And then I realize that
"Queer Iberia" is now part

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.860
of the reading list for
many graduate programs

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.810
in Hispanic Studies.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.580
And I'm delighted to see
that there is still interest,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.540 position:56%
and that there's still a possibility
these younger scholars moving

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.740
forward the "Queer Iberia" project.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.590
That's something that Joe and
I are completely invested in.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:32.120
But I think among the most critical
-- among our American colleagues,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.300
the most critical were
the historians.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.350
And Joe and I were coming
out of a program of literary

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.760
and cultural studies at
Harvard, the historians --

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.030
and we'll mention no names
because actually, they sort of --

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.600
they verge on the same
criticisms in particular.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.910
And to my mind, in hindsight, many
of them are legitimate criticisms,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.890
and yet I think they can all
be contested to some extent,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.820
and serve as new impetus
as we move forward.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.570
One of the criticisms was this
notion of Iberian exceptionalism,

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:08.850
that we were portraying
"Queer Iberia" as exceptional

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.460
within the context
of medieval Europe.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.430 position:56%
And this is predicated on the notion
that's brought up my Americo Castro.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.390
We saw that previously, Americo
Castro is also talking about Spain

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.180 position:56%
as being essentially different from
Europe because of that intermingling

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.660
of Christians, Muslims, and Jews.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:33.730
As our historian friends -- want to
say -- one of them actually said,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.660
"Well, Americo Castro went out --

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.640
nobody over the age of 60 is still
talking about Americo Castro."

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.440
Another one said, "Oh, here we
go again, Spain is different."

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:51.200 position:56%
And yet, and yet, Spain and
Portugal, Iberia in the Middle Ages,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.830
is to my mind different
in many respects.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.700
And sexuality is being
negotiated and mediated

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.150
through a different
cultural context.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.390
It does, to my mind,
make a difference,

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.060
and is something we do
need to tease out more

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.350
and more as we move forward.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.720
What's interesting as well, Joe and
I talked about this, Americo Castro

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:19.520
in the 21st Century, that review
came out back in the 1990s.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.450
Here in the 21st century, in 2016,

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.980
we are still talking
about Americo Castro.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.240
He is still coming to the fore
in scholarship, and being --

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.360
if only to be contested, but he's
still a point of contention enough

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.650
so that we're being
energized by that discussion,

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.300
whether we're talking about
sexualities, or cultures,

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.740
or crossings in the
Iberian Middle Ages.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.440
I should mention Americo -- we're
both probably, I like to say,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.550
"intellectual grandchildren"
of Americo Castro.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.760
He was the teacher of our teachers.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.750
And so we are, in some respects,
very close to Americo Castro,

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:05.890 position:56%
and he still is essential to the
way we read the Iberian Middle Ages.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.700
I don't know if you want to
add anything to this notion

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.760
of Iberian exceptionalism.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.660
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Well, I
think it would be just the say

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.740
that when we think about
the kingdoms of Spain

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.680
and Portugal we do have
different histories there.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.870
And it is the case
-- Southern Portugal,

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:32.850
you had the Muslim-Jewish-Christian
mix, but certainly not

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.350
to the extent, at least,
that you did

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.130 position:56%
in the Al-Andalus, but it was there.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.490
So you have in Portugal a
very interesting situation

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.970
where oftentimes -- and
this is something I'll get

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:52.610
to in just a few minutes,
documentary evidence

00:29:52.610 --> 00:30:01.700
or archival sources for medieval
Portuguese, forms of queerness

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:07.450
in all of the ways we tried
to define that in the volume,

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.360
are somewhat harder to come by.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.880
And I'll get back to that in a bit.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.770
But I think you wanted
to talk about some

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.320
of the reviews themselves, right?

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.620
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Well,
actually I wanted to --

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.900
that was one of the next points,
one of the issues raised is

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.540
that the volume wasn't fully
representative of Iberia,

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.770
but rather focused principally
on the kingdom of Castile

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.920
and what would become
of the Spanish state.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.680
And Joe obviously as a scholar
in Portuguese, has a few things

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.240
to say about that as well.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.540
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Yes.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:45.870
Well, again, the documentary
evidence for the kinds

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.660
of queerness we're studying in
this volume tends to be scarce,

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.270
up until the late --
or up until the mid --

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:57.630
beginning of the 17th century.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.050
Right; so you have a much more --

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.830
and then with the Inquisition
you have --

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.980
and the records of the
Portuguese Inquisition,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:12.660
you have a treasure trove
of documentary evidence.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.430
But nonetheless, my own piece,

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.780
which was on the medieval
Galician-Portuguese lyric,

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:25.790
to me is one of the most vibrant
expressions of these crossings

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.020
and borders that other
scholars talked

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.220
about in different ways
having to do with Castile

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.770
or other kingdoms of Spain.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.410
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Yes.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.710
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: So.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.500
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: I think
probably one of the best comments

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:45.920
that came out of historical
review was one that makes the case

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:55.380
for contextualizing queerness in
the local and in the particular.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.560
And as we move forward
with this project

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.560
that makes more and
more sense to me.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.260
Yes; I do admit we cultural
scholars and literary scholars tend

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.210
to speak in broad strokes.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:12.600
And the historian does keep
us true to the task of trying

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.820
to determine what is going on.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.030
And whatever is going
on in terms of sexuality

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:21.620
in the Middle Ages does need to be
negotiated, not in broad strokes,

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.090
but within the particular as well.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.640
So it keeps us honest.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.860
And I delight in that kind of
dialogue we've been establishing

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.450
between historians and
cultural scholars as well.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:36.480
But as one of our colleagues
mentions,

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.790 position:56%
we tend to compartmentalize literary
studies, and cultural studies,

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.780
and historical studies in
different compartments.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.170
Whereas in the Middle Ages,
there was really no distinction

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.620
between history, and
literature, and culture.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.350
And from our contemporary
perspective,

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.740
by imposing those
compartmentalizations onto areas

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.310
of research and areas of knowledge,

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.910
we in some respects are not
being true to the Middle Ages.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.850
So the challenges move in
several different directions,

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.590
and all of it continues
to be negotiated,

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.970
and I think in very powerful ways.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:16.220
The Spanish reviews, I think --

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.520
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
Yes, yes, go ahead.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.820
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: And that's
what you want me to get to.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.120
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
That's what I want.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.420
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
The most interesting.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.650
We didn't realize that we would end
up in the popular press in Spain.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:27.640
I think that's the next slide.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.090 position:56%
"Sero [phonetic] Magazine," which is
a gay rag, I guess is the best way

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.410
to put it, it's along the lines

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.210
of "The Advocate" back
in the '80s and '90s.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.680
I guess "The Advocate" was being
published through that time period,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.390
and up to the present as well.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.700
"Sero" the Spanish response

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.830
to a magazine along the
lines of "The Advocate."

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:52.530
And we ended up actually --
"Sero" gave us a very brief review

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.280
in "The Advocate," if you push
the button, this will come up,

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.970
which I thought was illuminating.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.580
We had made the assumption
-- as we edited this volume,

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:07.340
we had made the assumption that we
were speaking for Iberia as well.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.930
And the review in "Queer"
-- you have to go forward.

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:15.090
The review here in "Sero Magazine"
talks about [speaks Spanish] --

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.670
I'm trying to get the word,

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:23.010
the exact word there,
[speaks Spanish] --

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.310
[ Speaking in Spanish ]

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.610
&gt;&gt; [Speaks Spanish].

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.060
Thank you very much, [speaks
Spanish], monolithism, there we go,

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.980
in our use of queer theory.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.570
In other words, it was an Anglo
-- as the review here puts it,

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:41.020
"an Anglo-Saxon import," which
for us would be Anglo-American,

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.430
the Anglo-American
School of Queer Theory.

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:48.680
Here we were, colonizing the
Iberian past, speaking in the name

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.710
of Spanish and Portuguese scholars.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:57.390 position:56%
My argument would be that really the
queerest part about "Queer Iberia,"

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.700
in terms of queer theory, the
queerest part was the title.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.360 position:56%
And that really in individual pieces
in "Queer Iberia," there were a few

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.830
of us who were actually
engaging in query theory,

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.430
[speaks Spanish], as
we put it in Spanish.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:19.840 position:56%
And so I think the challenge of this
review, though, is a pertinent one

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.860
for us, and that is to get
greater collaboration on the part

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.900
of Portuguese and Spanish scholars

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.250
in this long-term "Queer
Iberia" project.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.550
Move forward?

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.950
Probably one of the most amazing
experiences that came out of the

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:39.390
"Queer Iberian" project was our
collaboration with Juan Goytisolo.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.130
Juan Goytisolo is, in essence,
has been for a long time the kind

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:48.810
of the gadfly of Spain's
national Catholicism,

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.230 position:56%
the Nacional Catholicismo that came
out of Franckewitz [phonetic] Spain.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.980
He had gone into exile in Paris,
is currently residing in Morocco,

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:01.230
and from his [speaks
Spanish] in exile

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.710
from the Spanish cultural
establishment, he has written works

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:11.030
that at every turn compromised
that notion of essential Spanish --

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.610
Catholic Spanish identity.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.490
Juan Goytisolo jumped
onboard immediately with the

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:20.980
"Queer Iberia" project,
wrote his own review,

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.450
which came out in [speaks Spanish],
one of the major publications

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.900
in Spain, defending the project,
but defending it specifically

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.930
from the perspective
of Americo Castro.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:36.330
Juan Goytisolo is very much in
line with the Castro project

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.590
of decentralizing Spain,

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:43.500
destabilizing that nationalistic
notion of Spanish identity.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.030
The review that he wrote
calling -- which was titled --

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.040
[ Speaking in Spanish ]

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.720
against an anemic reading
of Spanish literature,

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.980
ended up being anthologized
in this volume

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:03.100
which I think summarizes
Juan Goytisolo's own project,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.400 position:56%
"Pajaro que Ensucia su Propio
Nido," which is in essence "The Bird

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.280
That -- " how can I
put that politely,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.720
"The Bird That Soils its own Nest."

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.140
And he saw himself as that bird
that was soiling with every purpose

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.000
of soiling, soiling
the nest of Spain.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.280
And so he very incorporated -- very
quickly incorporated "Queer Iberia"

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.140
into his broader project

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:32.930
of destabilizing essential
Spanish identity.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:39.480
What's curious is that certainly,

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.090
whereas the [inaudible]
review understood our project

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:49.820
as an importation of Anglo-Saxon
queer theory, Juan Goytisolo

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.120
and a few other reviewers

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.840
as well understood it the way we
intended it, as something very much

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.670
in line with the Americo Castro
project of destabilizing.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.740
He understood it specifically
from that perspective,

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:09.390 position:56%
and sees us as allies, and sees the
full project as allies in the effort

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.910
to destabilize Spanish history.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.010
So we were delighted
by that collaboration.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.640
And actually, Goytisolo took
this review on the road.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.680
He presented it at New York
University at my old home campus

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.150
at that time, the University
of Illinois in Chicago.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.910
And the review keeps
going republished,

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.470
not only this volume,
but elsewhere as well.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.820
So I think it's very much
in the forefront in his mind

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.520
as he moves forward with his
own destabilizing project.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.990
What's interesting, I was
walking through the halls

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:46.880 position:56%
of the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid
two years ago with a colleague

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.280
in Hispano Medieval Studies.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.620
And in the entryway, you have
the full array of winners

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.230
of the Cervantes Award,
awarded to those authors

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:03.610
in Spanish language literature who
have achieved the highest echelons.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.850
And I made comment -- made
mention to my colleague, "Well,

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:10.390
one day we will see Juan
Goytisolo's portrait here

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.690
in the Biblioteca Nacional."

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.770
And his response was, "I doubt it.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.560
I doubt it," the notion
being someone

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.980
like Juan Goytisolo could never
possibly win the Cervantes Award.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:27.990
Lo and behold last year, [laughter]
Juan Goytisolo was awarded the

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.570
Cervantes prize, and this
is actually the portrait

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.240
that is now hanging in
the Biblioteca Nacional.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.670
But of course, for
something like Juan Goytisolo,

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:40.570
he is suddenly becoming canonical,
which makes him very nervous.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.370
[Laughter] So we'll see how this
plays out over the long term.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:44.670
Anyway so --

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.430
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: I'm wondering
if now would be the time just

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:52.110
to mention how -- and I want to
make a comment on the cover image

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.680
for the book that we're
going to return

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.690
to at the very end
of our presentation.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:02.240
That it was very gratifying
over the years

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:10.270
to see how this project
came to motivate other work.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:15.310
And what I mean by that is in
2001, so this was two years

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:20.460
after the book was published, there
was a conference at the University

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.980
of Pennsylvania organized by
Michael Solomon, called "Return

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.300
to Queer Iberia," where scholars
who hadn't participated --

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.320
a lot of scholars who
hadn't participated came

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.760
to speak about their own work.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.090
I never thought when Duke
University Press contacted us now

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:41.700
about eight years ago saying that

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.990
"Queer Iberia" is going
to a second printing.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.200 position:56%
You know, when does that ever happen

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.110
with an academic book
on Iberian studies.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:57.190
And many projects since then have
been one way or another taken a cue

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.560
from our book, which we
find very gratifying.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:07.240 position:56%
Gary Chestaro, who was our classmate
at Harvard, published a collection

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.560
of essays several years
ago called "Queer Italia,"

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:18.180
and he acknowledges us, which
that was very nice of him.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.140
A book, "A Queer in Iberia"
has come out recently,

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:26.220
and now a new volume
is in preparation,

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.520
"Queer in the Mediterranean."

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.970
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: "Queer
in the Mediterranean," yes.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.120
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
So these have been,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.530
to us, very gratifying moments.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.860
And it's just an interesting
anecdote, I think,

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.510
how that cover image came about.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.810
This is pure [inaudible].

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:49.210
When we were getting ready to
publish the book and the editors

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:53.030
of Duke said, "We'd like
to have a cover image

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.200
that really speaks to
what you're doing."

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.230
So I took that as a challenge to go

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.230 position:56%
into the Thomas Fisher Rare Book
Library at the University of Toronto

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.420
and see what I could find.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.480
And I remember I had
walked in and I was --

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.000
had a list of books
I wanted to consult.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.190
And I noticed on the shelves
from across the table --

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:20.850
I was sitting in a multivolume
history of printing in Spain,

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:27.330
that had one volume was
dedicated to each city where --

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.220
that had a printing press or
that somehow had an imprint

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.980
on especially early modern books.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.980
And so I just pulled
"Sevilla" off of the shelf,

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.530
and the book fell open to that.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:49.250
[Laughter] And what that is, it is
a [inaudible] romance that exists

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.560
in a unique copy of the
Hispanic Society of America

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.840
in New York, Oliveros de Castilla.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.260
And by reading the description,
it was almost too good to be true.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:07.390
Number one, there were a series
of woodcuts for each letter

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:13.260 position:56%
of the alphabet that were reproduced
in this printing catalogue.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:17.640
And so there, for series Q,
you can see the Q beneath,

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:25.040
those two young men
represent Spain and Portugal.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.700
And to the right, you can see
minarets off in the background,

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.680
and to the left you can
see a Christian church.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.100
And I hope I'm not revealing
too personal information

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.350 position:56%
about our wonderful editor,
Richard Morrison, [laughter] who had

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:47.530
that Q tattooed on
the back of his neck.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:53.310 position:56%
[Laughter] So but we just thought
it was so serendipitous that that --

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:59.000
I believe in signs
and that was a sign.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.300
[Laughter]

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.600
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Absolutely.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.900
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
So that's the story

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.730
of the cover image
of "Queer Iberia."

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.270
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Well,
very quickly, whereto from here,

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.610
what work remains to be done.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:17.070
And one thing I do want to mention
is that while research has exploded

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:23.890 position:56%
in early modern Iberian
sexualities, both in Latin American,

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:29.910
and in the Peninsula, medieval
Iberian sexualities I would say

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:33.190
really has gone -- has moved
forth in fits and starts.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:36.280
But there's a reason for
that, and that reason is 9/11.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.580
I think after 9/11, many of us

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.560
in Hispano medieval certainly felt
a pull in a different direction.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.560
If we intended to politicize
our queering of Iberia

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.440
through this volume, our political
sensibilities were being drawn

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.860
in a different direction,
of pointing to a period

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.070
in world history when Christianity

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.420
and Islam were negotiating,
were collaborating.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.990
And much of my scholarship
-- as Francisco mentioned,

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.900
much of my more recent scholarship
looks at spaces of confluence

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.000
between Christianity and Islam
in the Iberian Middle Ages.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.750
So those of us who would have
probably moved forward in the field

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:20.110
of sexuality ended up being
pulled in different directions.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:24.360
What's interesting is that now
I'm trying to pull myself back

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.220
into the center between the
two, looking at sexualities,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:34.380 position:56%
the negotiation of sexualities, in
particular between Islam and Iberia.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:39.630
But as I said not much
really has been done in terms

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.610
of the "Queer Iberia" project.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.250
And Joe wants to talk a
bit about what still has

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.260
yet to be found in the archives.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.520
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Well, I think
that we'd like to say clearly

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.910 position:56%
for everyone here, and to anyone who
might be watching this on YouTube,

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.890
we still need to rattle this cage,
right; that we're not at a --

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.890
I think there's a lot
of work to be done,

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.210
a lot of very exciting
work to be done.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:08.960
Greg's going to give some ideas
about that in just a second.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:15.560
One of the aspects that we
became convinced of early

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.670
on was essentially what we like to
call the "archaeological aspect"

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.810
of the book, that is
simply presenting evidence,

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:26.790
documents that people
did not know about,

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.270
or did not know about
in a certain way.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:35.460
And I think there is still a
lot of archival work to be done,

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:40.690
both in Spain and Portugal,
digging through archives.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.680
I love doing that, right, I
love that sense of discovery

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.980
with the text and [overlapping] --

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.320
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: And I'm
sure nobody here enjoys that.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.230
You just don't understand
in the least.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.530
[Laughter]

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:50.830
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.130
So that definitely there is
an archival aspect of this

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:56.270 position:56%
that I would want to encourage, both
established and younger scholars

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.230 position:56%
to approach with appetite and verve.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:04.900
Because I think that there's still
a lot of discovery to be done.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.840
Greg's going to talk a little
bit about work to be done

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.640 position:56%
on the Spanish side of things, and
then I'll go back to the Portuguese.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.940
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Well,

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.200
and if you go I think it's
two slides down the road.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.410
Let's see, maybe past this one.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.480
Let's take a look at [speaks
Spanish] very quickly.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.630
One of the things that -- as
Joe mentioned, one of the things

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:28.630
that we intended to do through the
"Queer Iberia" volume is give voice

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:31.820
to queer subjects in
the Iberian past.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.670
And certainly through
Joe's work on the --

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:39.390
I'm not sure we can translate
this on YouTube, so we'll leave it

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:42.350
in the Portuguese, the
[speaks foreign language].

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:43.650
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Okay; yes.

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:44.950
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: His work

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.020
on the Galician Portuguese
[speaks Spanish] brings forth these

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:53.540
fascinating, fascinating queer
subjectivities, moving forward

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:59.990
into the historical documentation
of interesting friendship,

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:03.240
reliances between kings
and their favorites,

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.070
and into the early modern period

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.600
with what you see now being
the so-called monja alferez,

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.130
or the non-lieutenant.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:11.840
This is -- and I'm going
to call him [inaudible],

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.780
and I'm going to use the masculine,

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:18.650
because I think it's important
to return to this story.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.630
Mary Elizabeth Perry, the
historian, brilliant historian,

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.010 position:56%
worked on this figure in particular;

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.220
and her chapter is
included in "Queer Iberia."

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.830
She tells about the non-lieutenant.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:34.040
She opts to switch back and forth
between the masculine pronoun

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.420
and the feminine, this
in recognition

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:42.220
of Irouso's [phonetic] constant
crossing of gender boundaries.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.880
Irouso was born in Northern Spain,

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.000
was sent to the convent
very quickly.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.820
At the age of 14, she escaped from
the convent, dressed as a man,

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.520 position:56%
assumed the name "Francisco Loyola,"
and lived his life from that point

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.070
on as a man, moving to the New
World, getting into bar brawls,

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.700
getting very close
to marrying as well.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.290
Coming back to Spain, after
having been discovered

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:17.390
as not really being a -- having
the masculine gender at birth,

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:22.570
that's a good way to put it, he
was brought before the Inquisition.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:26.010 position:56%
And it was finally determined by
the pope himself, finally determined

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:30.980
that he could indeed live his life
as a man; and he died as a man.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.660
What I think is most
interesting about the text --

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.650
and I've given it to
you in the Spanish,

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:39.160
is in the narrative it's
told by Irouso himself.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.790
You can see, if you
can read closely --

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.790
and I've left it in the
Spanish because we lose it

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.680 position:56%
in the translation into the English,

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.000
she begins the text,
"[Speaks Spanish].

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.740 position:56%
I was born Dona Catalina de Irouso."

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.760
A little further on,
"Y yo muchahca."

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.290
She had an encounter
with another nun

00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:59.810
who would abuse her in the convent.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.500
"Y yo muchacha," and
"I, a young girl."

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:08.020
But there's a point in the
text when Irouso assumes,

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.830
embraces a masculine identity.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:15.260
And what's curious is that the
pronoun changes at that point.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.140
And he says, "[Speaks Spanish].

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:24.910
When I entered [inaudible],"
using the masculine, "entrado."

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.210
Further on, "[Speaks Spanish].

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:31.030
I named myself, I embraced
this gender."

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:35.480
And who are we to determine
the gender of Irouso?

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.990
Who are we even to impose the
moniker, [speaks Spanish],

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:43.590
which keeps his gender
indeterminate.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:45.930
No, no; Irouso made
the determination.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:47.830
Irouso embraced gender.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.780
Irouso lived the gender.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:54.360 position:56%
And to my mind, we need to return to
these stories, multiple stories --

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.630
if you read the inquisitorial
documentation, multiple stories

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:04.600
about subjects from the
past making determinations

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.010
about their own sexual
and/or gender identity.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:11.580
We need to return to
this documentation

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.930
and really bring contemporary
trans-theory to bear

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.740
on these subjects from the past.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.300
So that's certainly
one of the directions

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:26.040
that a newly-invigorated
queer Iberia project,

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.320
one of the areas we need to explore

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.960
with greater verb,
as Joe has put it.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.260
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Yes, yes.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.670
And we think also, at least as we
get to the end of the Middle Ages

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:40.200
and the transition into
the early modern period,

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.740
the trans-Atlantic enterprise,

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.980
which offers some very
interesting possibilities, I think,

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:53.610
on the Portuguese side of things
-- I'm thinking of a fairly old

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:58.900
but still definitional book Richard
Trexler's, "Sex of Conquest."

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:04.140
I'm think of [speaks French],
or "Perverts in Paradise,"

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.400
as it was translated into
English and published.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.570
The work of my late Toronto
colleague, David Higgs,

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:18.090
who was doing work on early
modern male homosexuality

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.360
in Portugal and in Brazil.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:29.190
So these areas with -- I would
probably say with the exception

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:35.330
of Irouso and Barbara's essay,

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:40.990
that trans-Atlantic queerness
is something that we just kind

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:44.150
of hinted at and touched
upon in the volume.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.130
And I think there's a
lot to be done with that.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.500
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: And
the burning question for many

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:56.070
of our colleagues in studies of
sexuality, where is the lesbian?

00:52:56.070 --> 00:53:01.620 position:56%
Many feminists have talked about
the lack of documentation of lesbian

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:07.800
or same-sex sexualities between
women in the medieval past.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.930 position:56%
Well, a lack of documentation can be
explained very readily by the fact

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:14.330
that what was being
legislated against was sodomy.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.480
And sodomy was principally
a sin committed between --

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.040
or it was exclusively a sin
committed between two men.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.710
If you move onto the
next slide very quickly.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:26.720
I wanted to give you
some manuscripts as well,

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.900 position:56%
which of course makes Joe and Lee
very excited to look at manuscripts,

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.200
to feel manuscripts, and also

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.360
to see these manuscripts
now being digitalized

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.380
so that we have ready
access to them.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.990
This is the law code of [speaks
Spanish], which was pulled together

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:43.620
by Alfonso X in the 13th
century, or complied by order

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:49.040
of Alfonso X. This
is the iconic title

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.100
which condemns the vice
or the sin of sodomy.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.780
And what's interesting is that the
formulation is strictly in terms

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.340
of male-male sexuality,
"[speaks Spanish].

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:03.600
Sodomy is the sin in which men
lie with other men," no mention

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:09.070
of women whatsoever until
the 16th century in addition

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:10.390
of the [speaks Spanish]
by Gregorio Lopez.

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.000
Gregorio Lopez includes
the original text

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.950
with the Latin gloss
surrounding the text.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:21.980 position:56%
And we can see -- next slide; we can
see that the he makes an addition.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:25.730 position:56%
He says in the note you can see at
the top, he says, "[Speaks Spanish],

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:29.770
and also with women who happen

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:35.290
to commit the same
sin with other women."

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:41.670
What's interesting here, though,
is that it's still conceived

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:47.040
of as an active sin,
as an active act.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:56.350
In other words, the one who was
sinful in this act is the woman

00:54:56.350 --> 00:55:00.440
who penetrates the other woman.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:08.340
So it's still understood in
terms of an active sodomy,

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:13.060
of a woman's appropriation
of the male prerogative.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.040
So there's so much more to
be teased out of these texts,

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.700
so much more that we need to do.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:23.190 position:56%
Not only in terms of our archaeology
of queer subjectivities in the past,

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.210
but those mechanisms of control

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:28.570
by which these sexualities
are being configured,

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.620
or through which these
sexualities are being configured.

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:37.380
I would love to see
scholars look more diligently

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:42.390
at the archival record for same-sex
desire between women in the past.

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:46.120 position:56%
Because if it's not being -- if
it's not cropping up in [inaudible],

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:50.280
if it's not being legislated
against, that does mean

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.640
to some respect that it's
happening legitimately,

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.440
that it's listened [phonetic],

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.550
that that there's an area
that's not being legislated

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:01.160
within which these same-sex desire

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.370
between women could
be actively pursued.

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:09.410
And we need to find ways of
documenting same-sex desire

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:12.700
between women in the
pre-modern period.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.000
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: I wonder

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.980
if now will be a good
time to go to our final --

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:19.200
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Yes,
absolutely; very final one.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:24.800
Go past that one.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.440
One more. There we go.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.740
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: So Greg?

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.970
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Ah,
returning to the cover image.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:39.100
David Halperin came out a few years
ago with a book by the name of "How

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:44.310
to Do the History of Male
Homosexuality," and he renders

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:49.020
in far more complex terms
the notion of friendship

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:51.650 position:56%
and male-male sexuality in the past.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:54.960
The question we pose to
ourselves as we look at this --

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.410
as we read Halperin's
scholarship and take a look

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:05.380 position:56%
at this woodcut is what sexuality is
being represented by this woodcut,

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.280
or what genders are being
represented by this woodcut,

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.570
what subjectivities are being
represented by this woodcut?

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:18.300
So this cover image, which actually
is not even mentioned in any

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.770
of the essays in the volume,
and in fact, we were remiss

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:24.280
in not including it -- we
simply have an acknowledgment

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.160
of the Hispanic Society of
America, but we completely forget

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.850
to identify the source of this
woodcut in the volume itself.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.250
However, it does incite
us to go back

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.180 position:56%
and reexamine not only this woodcut,

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.100
but the broad genre of
romances of chivalry.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.130
And the visual representations
of friendship,

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:48.760
or male-male relationships, or
female-female relationships,

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.780
whether visual and textual.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:57.310
And what I love is the fact that
one of our reviewers makes note

00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:00.330
as well as the cover image.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:03.180
And I will go ahead and
translate very quickly

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:09.780 position:56%
from the Spanish the two Oliveros de
Castilla on the cover end up being

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:15.300 position:56%
in the final analysis much more
than a mere decoration or a dormant.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.960
Without a doubt, more efforts,
such as the "Queer Iberia" body,

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.500 position:56%
more efforts are needed so that we
end up understanding among ourselves

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.800
or all of us, we end

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.370
up understanding what actually
is happening in that glance

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:33.020
between the two of them,
and in the holding of hands.

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:38.090
So here's one of our colleagues
in Spain in Iberia itself looking

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:41.310
at that image and projecting
forward areas --

00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:45.650
potential new areas of research,
and potential new collaborations

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:48.640
between Iberia and the
Anglo-Saxon school,

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.690
or the Anglo-American school.

00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:55.350 position:56%
Fruitful areas of research that
will begin exploring the broad range

00:58:55.350 --> 00:59:00.200
of queer subjectivities, also an
effort -- and I want to say this,

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.590
this is important as
well, an effort not

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:05.540
to sensationalize these
queer subjectivities,

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.600
but rather to pull them out of
-- as one of colleagues has said,

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:12.440
"Out of their closets of wonder,
and to naturalize them as part

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.780
of the broad range of sexual

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.200
and gender identities
in the Iberian past."

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.500
So --

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.800
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Good.

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.660
Francisco, I wonder if we
could take a few questions.

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.960
&gt;&gt; Francisco Macias: Sure.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.580
We may have time for just one or
two questions before we wrap up.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.130
And then we want to
invite you to stick

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:34.140
around for a book signing
afterwards.

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.440
Yes, sir.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, George [inaudible] from
the College of William and Mary.

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:41.990
I'd like to thank you for
starting with John Roswell,

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.530
an alumnus of our college.

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:47.310 position:56%
And tomorrow we start our homecoming
weekend, and as always we start

00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:49.250
with the John Roswell
Memorial lecture.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:50.570
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
And your college is?

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:53.590
&gt;&gt; George: The College of William
and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:57.220
Also want to agree with Joe
that [inaudible] [laughter].

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.070
The [inaudible] was very happy

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:03.460
to republish the results
of that conference.

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.760
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
Yes; absolutely.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.060
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
That was excellent.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.360
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Absolutely.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.660
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore:
That was very good.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.960
Thank you.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.060
&gt;&gt; And it's still the first of
our list of online resources.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:17.550 position:56%
It's available online at [inaudible]
website, and we're grateful

01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:19.180
to continue to offer that --

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.480 position:56%

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:26.260
The 15th anniversary of
publication of that "Return

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.750
to Queer Iberia" series,
and we're really grateful --

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.050
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson: Right.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.350
Oh, boy.

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.650
&gt;&gt; To have that on our website
as one of the authors --

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.950
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Well,
here is a -- thank you, George.

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.850
Here is a perfect example
of what I am talking

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.120
about scholarly collaboration.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.710
[Speaks Spanish], which is
an award-winning journal

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.930
of Hispano medievalism under
George Greeney [phonetic]

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.870
as editorship has been
more than accommodating.

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:53.840
And that kind of scholarly
collaboration is really priceless.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.680
So thank you, George.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.230
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
And I should say as well

01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:01.170
that [speaks Spanish] was a very
willing potential first site

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:04.580
for the publication of
the original volume.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.690
We -- George was more than
ready and more than willing

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.390
to publish [overlapping] --

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:10.790
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.250
But we came back; we came back.

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:13.550
&gt;&gt; We lost to Duke.

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.230
It's okay [inaudible]
"Queer Iberia,"

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:17.530
so thank you for [inaudible].

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:18.830
&gt;&gt; Gregory Hutcheson:
Thank you, George.

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.670
Thank you, George.

01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:22.740
&gt;&gt; Francisco Macias: And I believe
that's all the time we have today,

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.500
folks, but please stick
around for the book signing,

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.690 position:56%
and to chat with them a little more.

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:28.990
Thank you so much.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:30.290
&gt;&gt; Josiah Blackmore: Thank you.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.090
Thank you, Francisco.
