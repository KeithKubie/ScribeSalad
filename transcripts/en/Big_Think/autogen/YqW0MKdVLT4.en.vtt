in the ground I was actually right out
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.840
in the ground I was actually right out
of graduate school and I was actually

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850
of graduate school and I was actually
 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.010
of graduate school and I was actually
interviewing for jobs and I had to pitch

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
interviewing for jobs and I had to pitch
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.229

started doing more research into it and
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.910
started doing more research into it and
I realized that my god this is I don't I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
I realized that my god this is I don't I
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.609
I realized that my god this is I don't I
don't want to pitch this for a 10 minute

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
don't want to pitch this for a 10 minute

on it and so at that point I really
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.679
on it and so at that point I really
started fundraising through grants or

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
started fundraising through grants or
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.870
started fundraising through grants or
into finding individuals who were

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
into finding individuals who were
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490
into finding individuals who were
interested in that subject matter but

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
interested in that subject matter but
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.999
interested in that subject matter but
with children underground I think it was

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009
with children underground I think it was
 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.320
with children underground I think it was
my god in the beginning I was temping

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
my god in the beginning I was temping
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.859
my god in the beginning I was temping
for a while I was doing it and finding

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
for a while I was doing it and finding
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840
for a while I was doing it and finding
all sorts of ways to make ends meet

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
all sorts of ways to make ends meet
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420
all sorts of ways to make ends meet
until I i received a grant from the the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
until I i received a grant from the the
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.700
until I i received a grant from the the
source foundation and that was really

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
source foundation and that was really
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.740
source foundation and that was really
what enabled me to make the film and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
what enabled me to make the film and
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380
what enabled me to make the film and
support myself at the live at the same

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
support myself at the live at the same
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.080
support myself at the live at the same
time and then once i received that then

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
time and then once i received that then
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.539
time and then once i received that then
then more funding came in but i think

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
then more funding came in but i think
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.050
then more funding came in but i think
it's um it's doing what you need to do

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
it's um it's doing what you need to do
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.960
it's um it's doing what you need to do
in order to make to start and then once

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
in order to make to start and then once
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.609
in order to make to start and then once
you start and you build momentum then

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
you start and you build momentum then
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.319
you start and you build momentum then
people start getting involved and you

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
people start getting involved and you
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.030
people start getting involved and you

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
figure out a way I think to do and find
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.709
figure out a way I think to do and find

certain foundations and people who are
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.139
certain foundations and people who are
interested in it but with my first film

know close to a hundred different
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.990
know close to a hundred different
foundations and before I actually

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
foundations and before I actually
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.260
foundations and before I actually
received that one grant would

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270
received that one grant would
 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.800
received that one grant would
abled me to make the film I think if you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
abled me to make the film I think if you
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.290
abled me to make the film I think if you
focus on I think you need to stay true

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300
focus on I think you need to stay true
 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.000
focus on I think you need to stay true
to your subject matter and stay true to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010

your story and your vision and if you
 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.030
your story and your vision and if you
start thinking about the money it's

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
start thinking about the money it's
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.700
start thinking about the money it's
going to make and and how then I think

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710
going to make and and how then I think
 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.440
going to make and and how then I think
that it's a different it's a different

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
that it's a different it's a different
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.430
that it's a different it's a different
beast entirely and I think that the most

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440
beast entirely and I think that the most
 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.630
beast entirely and I think that the most
important thing is is is is telling the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640
important thing is is is is telling the
 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.400
important thing is is is is telling the
story in in the truest way and and and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410
story in in the truest way and and and
 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.780
story in in the truest way and and and
keeping your focus in that way and not

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
keeping your focus in that way and not
 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.300
keeping your focus in that way and not
thinking about thinking about how much

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310
thinking about thinking about how much
 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.740
thinking about thinking about how much
money is going to make in the box office

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750
money is going to make in the box office
 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.200
money is going to make in the box office
box office I mean that has a place as

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210
box office I mean that has a place as
 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.230
box office I mean that has a place as
well and you know for certain films um

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240
well and you know for certain films um
 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.230
well and you know for certain films um
but I think even i think that the focus

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240
but I think even i think that the focus
 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.540
but I think even i think that the focus
has to be on on the storytelling and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550
has to be on on the storytelling and
 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.850
has to be on on the storytelling and
your objective because you're with the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860
your objective because you're with the
 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.110
your objective because you're with the
films that I'm dealing with you're

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120
films that I'm dealing with you're
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.090
films that I'm dealing with you're
dealing with people's lives and it's

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100
dealing with people's lives and it's
 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.660
dealing with people's lives and it's
completely different I think for me

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670
completely different I think for me
 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.890
completely different I think for me
that's putting the cart before the horse

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900
that's putting the cart before the horse
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.780
that's putting the cart before the horse
I mean I think the focus for a young

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
I mean I think the focus for a young
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.930
I mean I think the focus for a young
filmmaker it's really just following the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940
filmmaker it's really just following the
 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.730
filmmaker it's really just following the
story that you feel is so important to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740
story that you feel is so important to
 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.570
story that you feel is so important to
tell what and you feel passionately

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580
tell what and you feel passionately
 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.400
tell what and you feel passionately
about that and I think that has to be

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410
about that and I think that has to be
 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.500
about that and I think that has to be
the first thing once you lose that then

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510
the first thing once you lose that then
 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.090
the first thing once you lose that then
then I think that you are a part of the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100
then I think that you are a part of the
 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.740
then I think that you are a part of the
millions you were just trying to get

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750
millions you were just trying to get
 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.600
millions you were just trying to get
something out there but I think people

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610
something out there but I think people
 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:53.680
something out there but I think people
respond to to to honesty and and 2 to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690
respond to to to honesty and and 2 to
 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.270
respond to to to honesty and and 2 to
the filmmakers passion you know and I

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280
the filmmakers passion you know and I
 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.470
the filmmakers passion you know and I
think that comes through the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480
think that comes through the
 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.570
think that comes through the
storytelling and so I think that that

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580
storytelling and so I think that that
 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.790
storytelling and so I think that that
has to come first i think that if you

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800
has to come first i think that if you
 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.100
has to come first i think that if you
put that first then everything else will

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110
put that first then everything else will
 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.280
put that first then everything else will
follow and then you'll figure out a way

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290
follow and then you'll figure out a way
 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.140
follow and then you'll figure out a way
down to get it out there and people will

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150
down to get it out there and people will
 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.780
down to get it out there and people will
respond to to what you've done but it's

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790
respond to to what you've done but it's
 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.910
respond to to what you've done but it's
difficult for me to actually think of it

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920
difficult for me to actually think of it
 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.250
difficult for me to actually think of it
that one
