00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
important is that we try to do this a
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
important is that we try to do this a

collect a little of data I look at that

collect a little of data I look at that
but<00:10:38.500><c> then</c><00:10:38.620><c> you</c><00:10:38.650><c> have</c><00:10:38.830><c> to</c><00:10:38.950><c> make</c><00:10:39.160><c> a</c><00:10:39.190><c> decision</c>

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:39.550 align:start position:0%
but then you have to make a decision
 

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
but then you have to make a decision
based<00:10:39.640><c> on</c><00:10:39.850><c> that</c><00:10:40.000><c> so</c><00:10:40.240><c> what</c><00:10:40.390><c> we</c><00:10:40.540><c> do</c><00:10:40.840><c> at</c><00:10:40.960><c> blinkers</c>

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.290 align:start position:0%
based on that so what we do at blinkers
 

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.350 align:start position:0%
based on that so what we do at blinkers
we<00:10:41.410><c> call</c><00:10:41.590><c> this</c><00:10:41.680><c> data-driven</c><00:10:42.130><c> intuition</c><00:10:42.760><c> which</c>

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
we call this data-driven intuition which
 

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
we call this data-driven intuition which
basically<00:10:43.720><c> means</c><00:10:43.990><c> we</c><00:10:44.110><c> we</c><00:10:44.650><c> collect</c><00:10:44.980><c> data</c><00:10:45.160><c> but</c>

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:45.970 align:start position:0%
basically means we we collect data but
 

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
basically means we we collect data but

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.190 align:start position:0%

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
and it failed spectacular so that can
 

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
