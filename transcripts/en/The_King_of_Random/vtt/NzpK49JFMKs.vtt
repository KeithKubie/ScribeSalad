00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.840
Hey Guys! Welcome back to King of Random cooking.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.600
Today we're whipping up a batch of DIY survival style fire-starters

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.480
using items you can probably find around the house.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.340
The materials for this project are pretty simple,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.140
I just went down to the grocery store and picked up some of these cotton facial cleansing pads

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.800
And i'm going to melting down and reusing this old candle I've had sitting around

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.700
but if you really wanted to, you could use a box of crayons.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.700
Now I recently went down to a survival seminar, where they were selling flint and steel fire-starters

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.520
The idea is you strike the two together and make sparks

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.860
and you can you can use that to ignite the tinder of your survival fire.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.180
The thing is, the units they were selling, were anywhere from 20 to 40 dollars.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.000
Which I think is a little on the high end.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.720
But I did get one of these things.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.000
This is a ferrocerium rod which is basically a glorified version of a little flint that you would find in a thumb strike lighter.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.700
Now ferrocerium is a synthetic alloy combining alot of diffrent metals.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.360
now the idea is that you take some kind of steel striker.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.220
and run it down the side and it produces hot sparks.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.100
Now, I don't have any steel strikers but I do have an old hacksaw blade

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.500
and I found that these things work just as well.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.820
Now the first thing we need to do to start making these wax impregnated cotton fire starters is to simply throw our candle in a pot and melt it down.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.360
You can also just throw it in the microwave for about four minutes,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.740
that seems to work just as well.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.960
So, here we are guys. Our wax is completely melted and we've got quite a bit of it here.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.420
It's actually a lot more than we need.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.040
So, for convenience, we're gonna pour some out into a plate so it's about a quarter of an inch deep

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.680
and then we're gonna use that to soak our cotton pads for just a second on each side.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.860
And we are gonna need a place to let our wax fire starters cool down

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.540
and, ideally, we would use wax paper or aluminum foil but I couldn't find any so were just using a Ziploc bag.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Alright, here we go.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.380
Let's get started with these White Cloud cotton squares.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.400
These are 100% cotton and typically used by women for applying make-up and cleansers.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.360
Now what were gonna do is take these pads and dip them into the wax just so they get a light coating on either side.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.440
And it would be good to have a pair of tweezers,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.640
but I couldn't find any of those either so I'm using a fork.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.840
Alright, here we go. Test number one.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.180
We're just gonna dip a little bit on that side there, flip it over, a little bit on that side, and pretty much call it done.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.960
Set that off to the side on our Ziploc bag...

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.180
...to cool down.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.910
number two whoops I guess that'll work
too you could just pop them in and scoop

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.810
them out I think the key is we just
don't want to have too much wax on there

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.780
Now for variety I picked up some of these cotton rounds

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.920
these are also 100% cotton and are used for facial cleansing.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.209
are the kind of things I've seen other
Preppers using on the Internet as well

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:41.670
Dyanne just enough to get the wax in
there and drips it off this one here I'm

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.280
just going to try one side we're just
going to let that soak for a second then

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.150
take it out so it's wax infused on one
side cotton on the other but you can

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.420
already see that wax poking through and
while it's taking up all these cotton

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.599
pads I couldn't resist picking up a box
of tampons as well these things are

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:04.040
mostly made of cotton so we may as well
throw them in the mix as well beautiful

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.609
that looks amazing

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.660
alright guys it's been about 5 minutes
our wax has cooled down and it looks

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.880
like our firestarters are ready for
testing

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.480
now just for comparative purposes I have
some of the original cotton and some of

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.440
the wax infused cotton just so we can
see the difference in the burn times so

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.959
test number one we're just going to see
if you can use some sparks to actually

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.290
ignite this cotton at all so I'm just
going to fluff this up so it exposes a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.019
little more surface area making it
easier to light and we're going to start

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:53.930
a timer and see how long that burn let's
light it up first try

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.969
Cotton's burning you can see that little
fluff took off and no no time flat I

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.739
don't see a whole lot of flame because
this cotton is compressed there is some

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.239
flame down here but it's burning very
quietly okay we're getting some more

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.109
orange flame up here and I suppose if
you lifted this up off the ground a

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.439
little bit you can get it to burn a
little bit hotter to start your fire at

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.070
this point most of the pad has been
consumed we're just going to wait until

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.490
the flame actually goes out and there's
the last little bit of flame there we'll

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.840
stop that we'll call it 50 seconds so
we've got about 50 seconds maybe a

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.259
minute on the top end with one of these
cotton facial cleansing pads but that

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.770
was with no wax so let's try the wax
infused version and see if there's any

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.370
difference this pad here has the wax on
one side and the cotton on the other so

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.150
we're just going to fluff up the cotton
side the same as we did before to catch

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.250
the spark alright got on the first try
last time let's see we can do that again

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.120
there we go and it's off

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.730
the thing I know it's about these flat
pads the flame doesn't get very high

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.250
everything's so compressed and I think
the air is having a hard time getting to

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.590
it so we really need to do is stick some
sticks underneath it so it has a little

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.790
bit of leverage
that's the healthier flame than we found

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.390
the last one for sure you know if I
flatten that back out again

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.970
the first thing I notice is the flame
there's a lot more orange and a lot

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.600
healthier and it seems to be burning
quite a bit slower we're already at 43

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:50.680
seconds and we haven't even drink
through an eighth of that pad yet so we

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.610
just cross seven minutes in 30 seconds
you can see our pad is charred now and

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.850
the flame has moved over to just the
edges so I think we're running out of

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.340
the wax I think it's kind of on its last
legs here

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.480
I wouldn't expect to see more than about
another minute of burn time that's

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.260
pretty good okay so there's a crossover
for 10 minutes it's been over 10 minutes

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.530
guys and the flame is still going now at
about nine minutes I flipped the pad

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.040
over and found that the cotton on the
bottom hadn't burned yet so once I was

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.160
exposed to the air it took off and gave
us another full minute of good burn time

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.210
we are coming up on eleven minutes here
and we still got a little flame going

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.030
it's almost gone there's the 11 minute
crossover and that flame is just about

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:43.450
gone I think this is it five four three
two it's done stop

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.100
eleven minutes in 17 seconds so we lit
our cotton pad and it burned for 50

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.200
seconds we lit our waxen fuse pad and it
burned for 11 minutes in 17 seconds so

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.110
looking at the comparison here it looks
like that little bit of wax increase of

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.160
the burn time thirteen and a half times
that's pretty dramatic especially in a

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.210
survival situation now in addition to
using feminine hygiene products I also

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.140
tried dipping some wax cotton balls as
well as some paper towel the wax cotton

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.320
balls work great because you can split
them in half fluff out a little bit of

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.280
the cotton and strike it off the paper
towel will not so much the wax is a

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.790
great fuel but it's a terrible tinder
and it acts as a barrier preventing the

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.760
sparks from getting to the cotton so to
get the best use out of these fire

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.970
starters we need to leave a little bit
of white cotton exposed somewhere that

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.810
we can use as an initial starter now
this disc I coated on both sides and we

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.170
found that the wax acts as a barrier and
prevents it from igniting in order to

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.950
get this to light up I think we need to
snap it in half and expose some of those

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.400
cotton fibers on the inside roughed them
up and get them to a position where they

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.460
can capture a spark and hold on to it
you're getting break them into pieces

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.590
and use it for multiple fire starters

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.770
there we go
so guys good news these wax fire

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.280
starters are working really well one
question on my mind is how waterproof

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.790
are they what would happen if we took
one soaked it in a glass of water and

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.020
then broke apart and tried to start it
would it act any differently it's making

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.190
tea have this soaking for about 60
seconds in a glass of water now if we

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.600
break it open and expose some of those
cotton fibers let's see if we can get to

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.440
let off it is a little damp I can feel
that it's it's moist

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:21.080
let's see how that affects the
performance all right here we go

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:28.169
first try and there we go
despite being soaked in a glass of water

00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:41.759
for 60 seconds to still it off on the
first try that is pretty cool so guys

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:44.370
based on our experience here today this
is what we've learned

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.759
we found that burning cotton by itself
works really well but it burns in a

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:51.120
flash and does we produce a whole lot of
heat but if you take a little bit of wax

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.779
from something like melted crayons or
melted candle you can increase the

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:58.709
amount of time it burns by about 1300
percent and not only that but you get a

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:02.339
lot stronger and hotter flame as well
we found that soaking one side of our

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:05.730
pad in wax works better than soaking
both sides because the wax acts as a

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.940
barrier to any sparks flying and making
it a lot more difficult to relate to

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.269
tinder it's very important that we keep
part of our tinder that white Cotton's

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:15.600
fluff so we have something to fluff up
to catch a spark and cause it to ignite

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.680
we dipped our firestarters in water and
let them soak for about 60 seconds and

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.500
found that as long as we could crack
them open and fluff up some of the wax

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.670
and fuse cotton on the inside we could
still get them to ignite we also tried a

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.000
wide variety of different cotton
materials from facial cleansing pads to

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.180
cotton volve and found that they all
seemed to work really well although I

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.329
can't recommend using tampon because for
some reason that just feels a little

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:40.019
wrong so there you have it guys that's
how to turn ordinary household items

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:44.040
into improvised survival tinder that
will burn over 10 times longer and get

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.519
your fire going a lot faster thanks for
joining me for this experiment I'll be

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:51.110
looking for you the next one talk to you
then

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.350
currently wind resistant as well
