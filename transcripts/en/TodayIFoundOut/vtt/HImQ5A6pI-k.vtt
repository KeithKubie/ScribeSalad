00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.490
Why is it Called a “Medicine Ball”?

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.590
Medicine balls, for those of you who haven’t
been to a gym or never accidentally kicked

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.140
one thinking it was like a soccer ball (true
story), are heavy weighted balls coming in

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.650
a variety of sizes and weights (with the biggest
we could find ringing in at a whopping 150

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
pounds) with a diverse range of fitness applications.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
But why exactly are they called medicine balls
when, at its core, a medicine ball is just

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.400
a big heavy ball?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.180
For starters, medicine balls are noted to
be one of the most diverse pieces of exercise

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.250
equipment one can own, useful for toning almost
every part of the body, and are also extensively

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.330
used in various forms of physical therapy.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.760
While details are sparse on the history of
medicine balls, we can reliably track their

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.830
usage back around 3000 years, where they were
used by Persian wrestlers looking to become

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.830
stronger.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.040
In Ancient Greece, Hippocrates considered
them to be an essential tool for helping injured

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.760
people regain mobility and he advised people
to use them as a general, all purpose way

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.260
of remaining healthy.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.300
This all brings us back to the origin of the
name.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.680
The word “medicine” was long synonymous
with the word “health”.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.500
For example, it’s noted that Renaissance
physician Hieronymus Mercurialis advised that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.110
people of all fitness levels should use what
we would recognise as medicine balls in his

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.020
book De Arte Gymnastica, as part of what he
called “medicinal gymnastics“.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.920
The use of the word “medicinal” in this
case was to highlight how the exercises could

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.580
be used as both a way of healing injuries
and preventing them in the first place through

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.060
general fitness.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.549
Although devices we would recognise as being
medicine balls have been commonplace for millennia,

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.990
the word itself is only a few hundred years
old, being attributed to one, Professor Roberts

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.970
way back in 1889.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.820
According to a Scientific American article
from the time, Roberts coined the term “medicine

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.450
ball” in reference to the fact that using
the ball “invigorates the body, promotes

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.120
digestion, and restores and preserves one’s
health“.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.900
As “health” and “medicine” were considered
to be synonymous terms at the time, calling

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.340
it a “medicine ball” was natural enough.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.790
Today, we still refer to medicine balls as
such, even though the terms “health” and

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.050
“medicine” aren’t as synonymous as they
once were.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:40.120
“Health ball” also doesn’t quite have
the same ring 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:03:04.409
to it.
