00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go over it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It looks temptingly like there might be a few left angle brackets,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
like this one or that one, but if you look carefully,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you'll see that those are both part of the comment, so it's as if they were never there,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so we don't see any left angles.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We do see a left angle slash over here at the end of the string.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Any right angles?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Yes, right here at the absolute tail end of the string,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but note that this one in here did not count.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Any strings?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"World" looks super tempting, but again, it's inside the comment, so it does not count.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Word--and I've intentionally chosen these so that they conflict a little--

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
word, both "hello" and "confusing" totally apply.
