00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.610
We all have an inner dialogue inside our mind
- reminding yourself to pay your cellphone

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.680
bill, or even rehearsing a tough conversation
with a friend. But what if that voice becomes

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.680
voices that are out of your control?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.819
Psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed a theory
that, not so long ago all humans heard voices

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:22.609
- created internally from the right hemisphere
of the brain, but perceived as external from

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.710
the left hemisphere (bicameralism). As a result
these voices were perceived as communication

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.270
from the gods. But around 1000 BC, with the
rise of modern consciousness, these voices

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.390
became recognized as our own. Some psychiatrists
believe that the brains of schizophrenic people

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.740
may revert to this state, and not recognize
some of their thoughts as their own.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.850
Schizophrenia is a disease of the nervous
system, affecting approximately 1% of the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.579
population. To be clear, schizophrenia is
not the same as having ‘multiple personality

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.251
disorder’. Symptoms often include hallucinations:
from seeing things that aren’t there, to

00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:01.440
delusions such as a higher belief in conspiracy,
higher rates of depression, and most notably

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.640
hearing voices. Auditory hallucinations occur
in many disorders - from simple sounds to

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.600
words or names being called - but the voices
heard in schizophrenics are quite different.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.149
They are often associated with their current
mental state, and can be quite hostile, accusing,

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.200
threatening or persecuting (58); ultimately
embodying many of their fears.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.229
A 2006 study of over 3000 schizophrenic patients
found that genes related to immune function

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.869
may play a role - specifically the complement
component 4 or C4 genes. C4 is a gene involved

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.639
in trimming the synapses in the brain; for
example, teenage brains undergo a process

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:43.630
known as ‘synaptic pruning’ in which unused
connections are cut away to aid in our brains

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.350
efficiency. But in individuals with schizophrenia,
this C4 gene may be overactive and cut down

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.130
areas that are involved in planning, cognition
and thinking. Links have also made between

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.389
microbes in the gut - after all, the microbes
that live within us have also been shown to

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:03.200
modulate immune response and impact brain
development. One study found that lactic acid

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.259
bacteria were significantly more abundant
in people with schizophrenia, while another

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.070
found that the prevalence of lipid and glucose
abnormalities is much higher in patients with

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.070
schizophrenia.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.780
And while diagnosing schizophrenia is primarily
based on behaviour and reported experiences,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.530
research has found the cause to be a combination
of these genetic factors along with some environmental

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.120
stressors like growing up in an urbanized
area, minority group position, and even cannabis

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.340
use as THC can exaggerate psychotic response
in some individuals with genetic risk or developmental

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.340
trauma.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.000
Currently, medication for schizophrenia mostly
focuses on combating hallucinations and delusions

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.260
but, unfortunately, 49.5% of schizophrenia
patients don’t end up taking their medicine.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.341
This is why genetic research is so important
to combatting this disease. Of course, some

00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:54.860
people can and do recover through a combination
of medication, counselling and support which

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.780
can greatly reduce the symptoms.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.790
On AsapTHOUGHT we talk about how mental health
stigma is a serious issue in our culture and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.910
the media. Many of us negatively contribute
to the stereotyping of mental illness without

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.230
even realizing it - so we break down 5 ways
we can all reduce mental health stigma right

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.950
now. Check it out with the link below.

recommend the book “Schizophrenia: Understanding

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.950
Symptoms Diagnosis &amp; Treatment” which tackles
much of the stigma tied to schizophrenia and

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.230
how it affects those with the condition. You
can get a free 30 day trial at audible.com/asap

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.030
and choose from a massive selection! We love
