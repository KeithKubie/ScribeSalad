00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.490
So the answer to this question is, of course, 46. If

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.360
we started with 46 originally, we doubled our DNA, we duplicated our

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.210
chromosomes, and then we went through a division. So each daughter

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.740
cell will have 46 chromosomes total. Just like the mother originally had.
