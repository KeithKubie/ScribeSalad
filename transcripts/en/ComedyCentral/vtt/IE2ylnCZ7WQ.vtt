- Thank you for
being here of course.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.737
- Thank you, Chris,
thank you, thank you.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.071 align:start size:97% position:3%
And also thank you to everyone
who has donated to the

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.573
Reading Rainbow Kickstarter.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:10.844 align:start size:94% position:6%
So far you all butterflies
in the sky in my heart.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.045
- Yes,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.646
(clapping and cheering)
you guys crushed it.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.815
I'm so glad, this actually

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.219
gives me faith in the
internet and humanity.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It does, doesn't it?
- It is nice, yeah.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.722 align:start size:88% position:13%
- But there are still
some doubters out there.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.090 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Do you want me to murder
them, I'll kill them.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.025 align:start size:94% position:6%
I will kill them for you.
- No, no no.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.893 align:start size:72% position:28%
(laughing)
- Okay, sorry.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.328 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So.
- Sorry I got excited.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:32.198 align:start position:0%
- I wanted to show your audience
the effect on a generation

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.000 align:start size:88% position:13%
of kids who grew up
without Reading Rainbow.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.834
- Alright.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.538
- To do that I am going to
read you some words I found

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.473
on urbandictionary.com.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.610
(audience laughing)

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.445
And their definitions.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:46.279
- Sure.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.280
(audience laughing)

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.882
- Okay, so craydar,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.019
craydar is defined as
a man's ability to see

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.988
whether or not a
woman be cray cray,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.256
(audience laughing)

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.090
or not.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.059
- Yeah, sure, of course.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.695
- Okay so comedians my
question for you is how

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.532 align:start size:88% position:13%
is the word book defined
on Urban Dictionary?

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
Is it?
(audience laughing)

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:11.171 align:start size:97% position:3%
A, an object used as a
coaster to increase the height

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.505
of small children or
increase the stability

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.440
(audience laughing)

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.607
of poorly built furniture?

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.443 align:start size:84% position:16%
And before you answer
I must point out

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start size:94% position:6%
that on
urbandictionary.com height

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.848
is spelled H-I-G-H-T.
(audience laughing)

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:22.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This guy didn't
have Reading Rainbow.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.150
- I'm just sayin'.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.951 align:start size:88% position:13%
- If you guys had
Reading Rainbow height's

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.752
spelled right there.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.088
- I'm just sayin', or B

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.457
is it an object your
grandma uses to hit you

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.525 align:start size:97% position:3%
when you interrupt her
viewing of an episode of NCIS?

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:33.760
(audience laughing)

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.794
- Yeah, you don't
want to do that.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.363
- Or is it C, an object

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.465
hobos use to start fires?

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.299
(audience laughing)

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.600
(bell rings)

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.769
- [Chris] Feels like
all of them, Jimmy.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.671
- I'm uncomfortable
with all of them.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.905
(audience laughing0

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.141
I'm a fan of B, I'm
gonna go with B.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.810
- Alright, the correct
answer is in fact A.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.579
- [Audience] Oh.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.847
- No points.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.281
Here's a little trick
to spot the real one

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.283 align:start size:97% position:3%
@midnight look for the
spelling error that's the one

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.184
that came from the internet.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.253
(laughing)

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.456 align:start size:88% position:13%
These people did not
know what a boooo-k was.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.858
(audience laughing)

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.326 align:start size:97% position:3%
