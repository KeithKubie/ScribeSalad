00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.434
Voiceover:Let's explore what it means

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:04.333
to subtract numbers.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.700
So let's say that I want to figure out

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.933
what 4, what 4 minus 3 is.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000
4 minus 3.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:20.367
So one way to think
about this, is you start

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:21.933
with 4 objects.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.600
And so let me just draw 4 objects.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:35.600
So there I have 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.300
And when I ...

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.133
So this is the 4 objects right over here.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.966
And when I say minus 3, or if I'm going

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:45.366
to subtract 3 from the 4, one way to think

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.833
about it is, I'm going to take 3

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.733
of these 4 objects away.

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.867
So let's do that.

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:52.833
So I'm going to take away 1, I'm going to

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:56.400
take away 2, and I'm going to take away 3.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:01.666
Notice, I took away 1, 2, 3 objects.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.133
So how many do I have leftover?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.001
Well, if I start with 4 and I take away 3,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.033
I subtract 3, 4 minus 3, I am left

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:16.533
with, I am left with, 1
object, right over here.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:22.333
So 4 minus 3 is equal to, is equal to 1.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:23.767
Fascinating.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.066
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:34.733
Let's figure out what 5,
what 5, what 5 minus 2 is.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:36.334
And let's write it this way.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.900
Let's say we want to figure out something,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.766
some question mark, some question mark ...

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.200
Actually, let me just clear this out.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.733
I'll just do it right over here, actually.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.200
So let's say we have some question mark.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.333
So there's some unknown
number right over here.

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.400
So I'll just put a
question mark over here.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:58.100
And we say that unknown
number is equal to,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.633
is equal to 5, 5 minus 2.

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:07.600
Minus 2.

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:09.866
Minus 2.

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.200
So what is this going to be?

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:13.233
Well let's visualize it.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.033
This means I have 5 things and I'm going

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:17.766
to take away 2 of them
and this is going to be

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:20.366
what I have leftover after I start with 5

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:22.333
and take away 2.

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:33.400
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 things.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:36.734
Now I am going to take away 2 of them.

00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.668
So I'm going to take away 1 and 2.

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.467
So I took away 1, 2 objects.

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.600
So how many do I have leftover?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.234
Well, I have leftover these, these ...

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:50.666
Let me do this in a different color.

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:57.466
I have leftover these purple
things right over here.

00:02:58.034 --> 00:02:59.266
So how many is that?

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:00.933
How many do I have leftover?

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:07.466
Well, I have leftover 1,
2, 3 of my original 5.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.400
So something is equal is 5 minus 2.

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:12.333
That something is 3.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.334
3 is equal to 5 minus 2.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:21.000
Let me just replace this with a 3.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.600
So we see that 3 ...

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.735
Actually, let me do
the 3 in the same color

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:26.800
as this green.

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:32.500
So we see that 3, 3 is equal to 5 minus 2

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.133
or we could say that 5
minus 2 is equal to 3.

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:37.400
Either way.
