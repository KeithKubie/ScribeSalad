00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.330
Next demonstration is another piece of symmetry
breaking,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.720
makes rather different patterns.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.420
Instead of happening in a sandy desert, it
happens in a dish full of chemicals.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.720
It's called the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.020
(Bee Zed) BZ reaction if you're English, (Bee
Zee) BZ reaction if you're American.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.320
Belousov was a Russian chemist who in 1956
discovered

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.580
that some chemical reactions can oscillate.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.580
They can change from one state to another
and back again repeatedly.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.580
He got very excited about this.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.000
He sent his paper in for publication and the
journal said:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.560
"That can't happen. That's impossible."

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.940
"You must have got your experiment wrong,
can't publish it."

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.320
And about 10 years later another Russian called
Zhabotinsky

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.520
refined the experiment to the point it
was absolutely clear it really did work.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.480
And they said, OK, perhaps you can publish
after all.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.180
I'm going to demonstrate the Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.200
Over here I have four chemicals that we have
already mixed up.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.000
Sodium bromide, sodium bromate, sulphuric
acid and melonic acid.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.920
And there's a fifth chemical I'm going to
add which is a colouring,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.380
which will show us exactly how the reaction
is progressing.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.540
Mix them all together.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.260
And it's a sort of brownish colour.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.780
And a good shake and it turns blue, which
is a good sign.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.780
And I pour it into the dish here.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.500
And then I'll give it another shake.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.520
And now it's going brown.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.440
Which is also a good sign.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.180
And now we'll wait for a second and see if
it will do what I want it to do

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.920
and in fact it has already started.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.100
Of it's own accord, little blue dots are appearing..

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.120
And those dots are spreading and forming blue
patches.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.940
And as the patches grow,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.620
inside them, we see little red dots which
grow

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.360
and inside those are blue dots which grow.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.620
And the whole thing just keeps growing and
spreading.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.800
And this amazing pattern appears, like magic,
from nowhere.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.540
But it's not magic, it's symmetry breaking.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.760
The uniform symmetry of the stirred up, shaken
up dish is unstable.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.300
It won't stay that way.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.420
Tiny little bubbles, little specks of dust,
something start out those blue patches.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.560
And once they've started, we just get these
beautiful patterns,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.340
which grow and grow.
