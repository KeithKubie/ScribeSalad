you're not gonna help us out with that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
you're not gonna help us out with that
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.100
you're not gonna help us out with that
are you so it's very serious concern of

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110
are you so it's very serious concern of
 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.729

and if everybody we're talking about

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110
and if everybody we're talking about
 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.600
and if everybody we're talking about
climate change that we were talking

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610
climate change that we were talking
 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.610
climate change that we were talking
about Ebola we'd be working on climate

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
about Ebola we'd be working on climate
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.180
about Ebola we'd be working on climate
change pretty steadily also so I'm it's

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190
change pretty steadily also so I'm it's
 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.020
change pretty steadily also so I'm it's
another lesson

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
another lesson
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.780
another lesson
you know we on on my side of it in the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790
you know we on on my side of it in the
 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.930
you know we on on my side of it in the
science education world I mean this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
science education world I mean this
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.490

whole thing is so frustrating the United

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500
whole thing is so frustrating the United
 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.259
whole thing is so frustrating the United
States used to be the world leader in

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269
States used to be the world leader in
 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.509

are anti science you're setting the us

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600
are anti science you're setting the us
 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.240
are anti science you're setting the us
back and then ultimately setting the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250
back and then ultimately setting the
 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.729
back and then ultimately setting the
world back so we should support the

the risks and go to the hot zone we
 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.970
the risks and go to the hot zone we
should support African governments and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980
should support African governments and
 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.620
should support African governments and
