00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.300
After the fall of
the Soviet Union,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.690
and even China's migration
to a market-based economy--

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.750
even though they call
themselves Communists,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.250
their economy is now,
essentially, capitalist--

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.040
there's been a general
consensus around the world

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.680
that capitalism
is the way to go.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.520
And just to put my bias out
there, right from the get go,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.550
I am in that camp.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.190
I would consider
myself a capitalist.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.450
But what I want to do in this
video is do a little bit more

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.960
of a nuanced discussion
of capitalism

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.520
versus, say, socialism.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.450
Because I feel like there
has been-- especially here,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.730
in the United States,
and in the West--

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.570
a knee jerk reaction
against anything

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.650
that even has a whiff of the
government getting involved

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.192
or even a whiff of socialism.

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:46.900
So I want to think
more about what are we

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.260
trying to achieve with
the capitalist system.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.990
And where we could
fall into the things

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.440
we don't want to achieve if some
of the aspects of capitalism

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.130
are allowed to go on
without any type of controls

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.589
or, maybe, some
type of regulation.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.004
I don't want to
advocate anything.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.330
I just want to give, maybe,
a framework for thinking

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.230
about it.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.500
So you ask any capitalist,
including myself, you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.870
say, well, what's
good about capitalism?

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.200
And I would say,
well, you know it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.950
aligns everyone's incentives.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.180
So it's good incentives.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.000
If you work harder,
you can earn more,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.770
you can generate a
capital for yourself.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.970
You can use that to improve
your standard of living.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.990
You can reinvest that capital.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.840
So it's a good
incentive structure.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.510
I'm not saying that
everyone is motivated purely

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.840
by the desire to earn.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.140
I think there's plenty of people
in the world who are motivated

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.140
for the desire for social
good, for elevating mankind.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.780
But the general census
in a lot of parts of--

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.860
is that those type of things
are specific to certain domains.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.000
But, in other domains, if
someone's running a trucking

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.340
company, it's not clear that
someone would run a trucking

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.000
company optimally just
for the good of mankind.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.360
Maybe they would run some
type of nonprofit that way.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.150
But a trucking
company, or a farm,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.640
or something like
that, who knows.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.919
So in general, you have a
good incentive structure.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.630
There's also this notion
in a capitalist economy

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.710
that it's a meritocracy.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.950
It is meritocracy.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.030
And I'm going to,
actually, put a box

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.160
around this because a
meritocracy, in my mind,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.630
is super duper important.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.840
Because even if you talk
to us-- almost everyone

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.260
is a fan of a meritocracy.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.360
Even the communists were
a fan of a meritocracy.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.520
They would give exams
to people and have

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.650
the people who were
successful have

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.680
more authority within
the communist regime.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.450
So a meritocracy is something
that everyone lays claim to.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.720
And actually a lot of
socialists or communists

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.190
would claim that extreme forms
of capitalism, when the wealth

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.900
disparity becomes two extreme
or where you have inherited

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.700
wealth, actually goes against
the idea of meritocracy.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.930
So let me actually put
meritocracy here as well.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.420
And we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.690
And then the other
ideas is that you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.120
have innovation in capitalism.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.370
And these are all related ideas.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.580
That if the incentives
are good, if capital

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.730
gets in the hands of people
who are most deserving of it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.400
because they've somehow earned
it, they've somehow innovated,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.775
that can also lead to innovation
because the right people

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:25.760
are handling the capital.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.770
Now, if we go to the
socialist side of things,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.280
they'll say, well, look, there's
a social cohesiveness to this.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.780
So let me write this down.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.096
And I won't speak
to the-- I don't

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:39.470
claim what I'm going to do in
this video is comprehensive

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.070
of all of the pros
and cons of either.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.660
I just want to give a little
bit of nuance to the discussion.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.470
So social cohesiveness.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.050
You won't have this
situation where

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.590
you have a gazillionaire
sitting behind a walled compound

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.090
with armed guards
and their people

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.520
right on the other side of
that walled compound starving

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.182
to death.

00:03:58.182 --> 00:03:59.890
And these people don't
even, necessarily,

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.460
view themselves as part
of the same society,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.360
that they somehow have a
responsibility to each other.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.310
And that is happening in
some parts of the world

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.600
where you have severe
disparities in wealth.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.370
The rich people don't
even view themselves

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.360
as the same species as the
poor people or even vice versa.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.120
You have the other
idea of-- and I'll

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.850
put this in quotes-- fairness.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.350
And I'll put it in quotes
because one could say,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.627
well, it's fair if you make
more, if you work harder,

00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:32.460
you should get more.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.355
If you innovate more,
you should get more.

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:35.730
And then their
notion of fairness

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.070
says, well, yeah, but look
sometimes this wealth gets

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.819
so extreme. sometimes
you have this notion

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:40.770
of inherited wealth.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.270
Generation after generation.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.190
Old money.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.504
What's fair about that?

00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:45.920
That people are
just randomly born

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.906
into a situation where they can
just extract the interest off

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:50.530
of their wealth and
never have to work.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.720
And other people have
to work super hard

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.920
and they really
get nothing for it.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.160
So this notion of fairness,
I'll put it over here as well.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.500
Fairness.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.690
Because there's
arguments for either.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.410
And so, like I
said, I'm definitely

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.910
biased to the capitalist
side of things.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.860
I think there is an
importance to these things

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.480
that we have on the
right hand side.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.250
But the reality,
at least what we've

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.530
seen in the economic
experiments of the 20th century,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.760
is that even though communists
and socialists might speak

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.760
to these types of
things, to a large degree

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.160
there's less social
cohesiveness.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.650
The senior communists
in the Soviet Union

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.260
would drive fancier cars.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.760
And they did have a very
different lifestyle then

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.880
the workers.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.400
And they would hide
that lifestyle.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.320
And then it would lead
to a lot of hypocrisy.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.620
In general, the extreme
forms of socialism-- not

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.130
clear that it was a meritocracy.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.260
It might have been just
the best people climbing up

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.730
the party ladder that
get to the top as opposed

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.850
to the people who would
innovate and actually

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.650
produce in a better way.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.420
But with that said, I
want to give fair warning,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.980
that capitalism, if it goes
unchecked in certain ways,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.220
it could also lead to those
same problems of socialism.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.690
And the main problems
there, when you

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.460
think about good incentives.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.230
I think the incentives,
and once again,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.380
I'm giving my opinion
here, the incentives

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.810
work out well when you
have a bunch of competitors

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.150
who can compete and innovate.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.400
And it makes complete
sense that, let's say,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.000
that this person comes
up with an innovation.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.670
And because they
have that innovation,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.980
they're able to provide a better
good that's cheaper to society.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.230
And so they make more profits.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.370
And it seems
reasonable that person

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.050
should get more profits,
and more wealth, and grow.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.910
And it could even
be good for society

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.380
because this person's
an innovator.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.630
Maybe there was an
element of luck there.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.160
But it seems like they're
competent at managing

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.070
these resources.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.600
So it's good for society to give
them more resources to manage.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.380
The areas where it becomes
less clear that capitalism

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.540
is unambiguously
good, is a situation

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.090
where this person becomes
out right dominate.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.537
So let's say that this person
becomes so big that none

00:07:08.537 --> 00:07:10.620
of these other players can
even compete with them.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.536
So they all disappear.

00:07:11.536 --> 00:07:13.670
This person can just
undercut everybody.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.160
And all the other
players disappear.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.140
And this is the
situation of a monopoly.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.385
And the problem here is,
when this guy had competition

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:25.670
he had every incentive
to work harder.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.990
He had every
incentive to innovate.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.720
It was a meritocracy because
the person who innovates well

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.900
grows the fastest.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.890
But once you get to
a monopoly stage,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.650
and everyone else
has died down, this

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.580
is the only player in the
economy, then all of a sudden,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.170
he has no incentive to innovate.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.050
This corporation or this person
can just keep raising prices.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.060
There's no competition.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.935
There's no one else to say,
hey, I can have a better product

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.640
or I can sell it to you cheaper.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.246
And so it actually goes against
the ideas of innovation.

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:54.620
That's why it's
really important.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.828
And that's why it's part
of, especially in the United

00:07:56.828 --> 00:08:02.740
States, the economic system that
you try to break up monopolies.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.634
That you don't like
monopolistic practices.

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:08.050
The other risks
that you have when

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.700
you start having a lot of
wealth and a lot of influence

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.470
in one entity, or one
person, or one corporation--

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.490
and this can happen in a
democratic or even a non

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.940
democratic regime-- is that,
the control of resources

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.630
aren't just control
of those resources.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.320
Aren't just control of land,
and buildings, and railroads.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.194
They can also use it to
influence government.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.510
And in the United
States, this has

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.010
been institutionalized
in the form of lobbying.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.090
And when you have
excess resources

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.840
and you can influence
government in this way,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.919
you can get the
government-- so let's say

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.490
this is the government
over here-- to,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.410
essentially, do things for you.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.660
So it works to your advantage.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.160
And may be allowing
you, eventually,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.800
to become a monopoly.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.940
So you can view this
as crony capitalism,

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.569
where lobbying can be a
form of legalized bribery.

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:03.860
And in that way, you kind of
own the elected officials.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.370
I'm not saying that this
is happening everywhere

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.180
but it could happen.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.096
And in that situation,
you have the government

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:09.280
acting on behalf of these.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.880
And, once again, it goes against
the idea of a meritocracy

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.940
because when you have
this cycle developing,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.300
maybe this person right over
here has the innovation.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.300
But this person
doesn't have the clout,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.750
doesn't have the influence
with the government.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.710
And so this guy gets
the government contract

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.400
for the planes.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.190
Or this guy gets the tax
benefits from the government

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.370
so that he can be
even more competitive.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.640
He can undercut this
guy even though this guy

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.824
has the innovation.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.240
The other element-- and I could
talk about this for hours.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240
And these are just
things to think

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.350
about-- are the idea
of inherited wealth.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.160
And I'm not saying
that inherited wealth

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.450
is a bad thing.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.300
But there's this idea
that, let's say, someone

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.460
through their competence,
maybe competence

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.111
with a little bit of
luck, is able to accrue

00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:53.110
a huge amount of wealth.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.870
And maybe they're not
even a monopolist.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.890
But they're able to get
a huge amount of wealth.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.070
But they were able to do
it-- that they're really

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.140
good managers.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.090
They're kind of these
really smart dude.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.730
He can he can really manage
a lot of resources well.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.460
The question arises
is, what happens

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.530
when this person passes away?

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.400
In a very purely
capitalist situation,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.760
you pass this onto
your children.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.130
So you pass this
onto your children.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.560
And the issue here is, one, what
did this person do to earn it?

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.950
And also from a society's
point of view, maybe

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.130
this person here is a dummy.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.660
Maybe there was
another kid over here

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.520
who was born at the exact
same time, who is way smarter

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.110
and who-- but this kid is now
in control over 100 gazillion

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.800
dollars.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.270
And he can completely
mismanage the resources

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.160
so that they're
completely wasted.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.610
And so you have this idea
of-- over time-- inherited

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.810
wealth in a
capitalist society can

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.530
go against the ideas
of meritocracy.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.940
It can go against the
idea of good incentives

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.910
because if this guy
inherits enough money,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.320
he has no incentive to work.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.350
Why should he have to study
hard and go and tackle

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.360
math and all that?

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.990
He's inherited
enough money that he

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.470
gets millions of dollars
just off of the interest.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.510
Why should he educate himself?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.297
He got daddy's or
granddad's money.

00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:21.505
And so it also goes against
the idea-- and why should

00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:22.296
he try to innovate?

00:11:22.296 --> 00:11:24.056
Why should he ever do anything?

00:11:24.056 --> 00:11:25.930
He could maybe just hire
some of these people

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.790
and give them a minimum
salary, whatever it takes.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.780
And so it goes against these
ideas of fairness and all that.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.780
And I'm not saying that
I'm against inheritance.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.390
I'm just saying this is
something to think about.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.820
And there's some, probably,
threshold of inheritance

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.370
that it starts to undermine
some of these ideas

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.160
of a meritocracy, and good
incentives, and fairness,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.720
and all that.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.095
And that's why I
think it's funny

00:11:46.095 --> 00:11:51.150
when people who call themselves
"old money" are proud of it.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.770
They view themselves
as, somehow,

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.310
being part of a better caste
because "old money" means

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.350
that you did not earn
the money yourself.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.650
That your granddad or you're
great grandad earned the money.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.140
And you've just happened to be
born in this family and are,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.280
essentially, just living
off of the interest.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.930
And it's funny because
they'll talk about "new money"

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.924
as if they're not as
good as old money.

00:12:11.924 --> 00:12:13.590
But at least in new
money people-- maybe

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.280
it was through
luck, but maybe it

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.210
was through competence or
innovation-- this is something

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.730
that, at least in my mind,
I'd respect more than old.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.410
Old money, you've done nothing.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.120
What's the difference
between old money,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.760
or a king and a queen, or
the aristocracy of Europe,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.520
that goes against a lot of the
philosophical underpinnings

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.780
of what the United
States is even based on.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.780
So I'll leave you there.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.210
I just want to add a
little bit of a nuance

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.043
to the conversation.

00:12:37.043 --> 00:12:38.590
And I will say--
I'll say it again--

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.910
I come to this conversation
with a capitalist bias.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.610
But I'm hoping
that this gives you

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.950
a little bit of more nuance.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.850
So that instead of
saying, capitalism

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.830
is an unambiguous
good and socialism

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.180
is an unambiguous bad,
these are the things

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.120
that we should try to promote.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.370
And to do that, we do
have to do some things,

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.440
like make sure that
everyone is educated

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.320
so that we can
have a meritocracy.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.270
If everyone is educated, then
you have a level playing field.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.240
You have this notion
of equal opportunity.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.940
And that does involve some
type of, on some scale,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.390
redistribution of-- at least
in the form of education.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.210
Maybe you do need some way
for people to get health care.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.060
You don't want people
dying in the streets.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.080
I'm not going to
take a stance here,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.980
but I'm just showing
you that you can't just,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.040
even though I do consider
myself a capitalist,

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.960
you can't just say
that everything

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.600
has to be purely
capitalist and you

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.240
can't have any notion of
government intervention.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.640
You maybe want the
government to invest

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.380
in things like
long-term research.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.400
Where they don't have
an immediate profit

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.220
motive, but 50, 100
years down the future

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.520
it might allow the society
to thrive or whatever else.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.280
So I'll leave you there.
