FILIP: Oh, hi.

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.250
I'm Filip from the Flutter team.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.550
And I'm here to introduce
"The Boring Show."

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a show where two
engineers sit down and build

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.790
apps in Flutter from scratch.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.600
The show is unedited, so you
see all the mistakes we make,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.320
all the dead ends, and
how we get out of them.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.630
It's an opportunity for
you to see Flutter being

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.390
used in more complicated apps.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.000
We take viewer suggestions
on what features

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.490
and apps to build next.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.369
If you have a lot of time
and like boring things

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.620
like watching butter
melt or doing your taxes,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.214
you'll love this show.

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:42.130
