1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
Are some bands like west side story where you can continually revitalize the

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.450
production,
right.
With different actors.
Different actors.
Okay.

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.140
A whole lot of Shakespeare going on.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
but you have to kind of replicate the initial sound or do you,

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.360
cause I'm sure all of Beethoven's early orchestras are dead.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.440
Devin fried chips because I don't think you can say this because this was a part

7
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.130
of my youth van Halen was a part of my youth.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.900
I mean we used to Jude the van Halen logo on our notebooks in high school along

9
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.560
with the rolling stones like the mouth and you know,

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.150
all the kiss logo.
When it switched over to Sammy Hagar,

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.510
it became a different thing.
It was a different thing.

12
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.270
There's a whole different pivot.
I mean it wasn't,
it wasn't a bad thing.
No,
no.

13
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.300
It was the stem thing.
Shane,
all of Shams lyrics contain love.
Yes.

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.070
Okay.
Why can't this be love?

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.360
And I ain't talking about love.

16
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:04.290
We right back with more fighting after this.
Yeah.
I mean,
come on.

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.490
Who Do I jog with?
I don't,
I run who's my running partner?

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.190
Yeah.
Run on with the devil.
Hello.
Okay.
You want to keep going?
Yeah.
Keep going.

19
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.160
Should I jump?
Should I jump jobs?
Might as well jump.
Thank you.

20
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.810
Yeah.
I mean,
come on.
I know it's a questions in love Ra.
Great.

21
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.340
Uh,
classically that's Schunarrah.
Yeah.
Okay.

22
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.190
Um,
but I'm,
I'm not well adjusted.

23
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.200
Nobody in my job ever was much less,
kept it this long and I faced it,

24
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:45.090
embraced it in the strong,
yeah.
You followed a choke Joe.
No,

25
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.830
it's all right there in the lyrics.
Yeah.

26
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.960
Even using what are considered classic music parlor tricks,

27
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.970
taking a very shad lyric and positioning it against a very happy piece of music.

28
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.060
The music is romping itch,
itch,
itch,
a heavy metal,
Rumba,
booboo,

29
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.050
Doo,
Doo Doo Doo Doo,
Doo doop and lyric is she's crying.
Yeah.

30
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.000
Jamie's crying.
You didn't notice that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

31
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.400
It's,
uh,
if there's a sense of,

32
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.230
if there's a sense of larceny does chaos too in the lyric.

33
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.110
There's a sense of a Itch,
uh,

34
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.000
music for after midnight when we're all guilty.
Joe.
Yeah.
Whereas,

35
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.150
and again,
nothing wrong with the Sammy Hagar thing,

36
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:33.920
but it moved into a mall crowd.
It was a different sort of a vibe.
It was,

37
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.880
it was a good vibe for a lot of folks,
but it was a different vibe.
Um,
I mean,

38
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.340
I don't have anything against Sammy Hagar.
I think he's wonderful.

39
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:44.850
I was loved that song.
I can't drive 55 he's got some great shit,

40
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.380
but I never listened to the van Halen with Van Hagar.
I just didn't listen to it.

41
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.880
To me it was like I was an end of an era.
For me,
it's two different folks.
Yes.

42
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.410
I wanted to be the art project,
not just where one.
Yeah.

43
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.410
So by placing my,
everything we've discussed,

44
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.240
if you think of it as cross training,
that's a great rationale.
Why'd you do that?

45
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.030
And then you did this at why,
let's cross train.

46
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:11.440
It's going to reinform your sound.

47
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.020
It's going to reinform the way your stagecraft,

48
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.540
how you even walk out on stage,
your choice of what to wear,

49
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.930
who follow what.
Your sense of humor especially.

50
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.110
Well that's a great way to look at what you were talking about with the west

51
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.520
side,
west side story analogy because it kind of went on,

52
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.520
but it Kinda didn't.
It's like if you took west side story in the,

53
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.870
he changed the story.
You can't change the story,
but you can change the voices.

54
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.330
Okay.
But it would be a different story.

55
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.740
Like the van Halen story became a different story.
All right.
Here,

56
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:46.540
I'll venture this.
Okay.
Uh,

57
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.550
one of my favorite freeze dried bands in history is toto.

58
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.000
Why's,
why freeze dried?
Well,
all freeze dried coffee looks the same

59
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.800
and it's great.
I've been camping and man,
there's nothing better than I had.

60
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:06.430
Just a cup of fresh freeze dried in the rural,
in the wrongest places.
That's fun.

61
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:10.810
Some context,
it's the best thing you get ever hand.
That app owns a good song.

62
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.730
It's an amazing,
so that Smithsonian level,
yes.
Song.
Okay.

63
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:18.250
Rosanna and so forth.
Toes.
Amazing.

64
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.600
Any of the fellows could walk up to me and I wouldn't recognize him.
No.

65
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.970
You know what I said would not recognize them.

66
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.410
Verus say is the greatest genius in all of music in that regard.
Steve Miller,

67
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.140
nobody knows who the fuck Steve Miller is.
Steam old janitor line,

68
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.590
but me and he had some,
every woman knows those songs and if you stay,

69
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.550
if you even,
uh,
start to play du Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,

70
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.360
Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,
and everybody goes getting ready to sing.
Yeah.

71
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:51.700
Tanga love.
I mean,
God damn,
he had some jams but that guy could go anywhere.

72
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:56.320
And then there are artists where you just can't replace it.

73
00:04:56.321 --> 00:05:01.321
Rod Stewart are Channel One of the best vocals in history of any genre together.

74
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.220
Oh yeah.
That's a no weight division thing and yeah,
one of the all time greats.

75
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.020
The Ali's probably Rod Stewart.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,
his songs,

76
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.730
you can have other people sing them,

77
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:16.570
but in something other now journey,

78
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.850
I would recognize the guitar player,

79
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:23.800
but that's just because I listened to that kind of,
that part of the band.
Okay.

80
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.170
My favorite part of the orchestras,
the Gong,
just want to clarify that,

81
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.110
but uh,
uh,
Steve Perry who sang for journey.
Okay.

82
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.940
Um,
was not so much a personality as an eloquent sound.
Yes.
All right.

83
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.560
So it's a universal sound,

84
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:46.561
and if you even get close to it is it is part of every prom,

85
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.430
every wedding,
every going in and coming out party.

86
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.900
Okay.
If you're going into the,
into the army,

87
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.620
that's the last song band's gonna play.
You're coming out of jail.
They're gonna.

88
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.250
Your girlfriend's going to pull you,
throw your bag to the side and run.

89
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.690
You've seen the movie.
Yes.
Okay.
Even Tony Soprano,
we're not sure what happened,

90
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:13.340
but it happened to journey.
Yes,
true.
That's right.
Yeah.
Right.

91
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.710
Okay.
That's very significant.

92
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.480
You can't play a David Lee Roth Shawn and still worry about Tony Soprano.

93
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.640
That's true.
Your half of your mind is going to go,
wait a minute.

94
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:28.500
The lone ranger just walked into the same diner that Tony is.

95
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.370
It's why I have no acting career.
