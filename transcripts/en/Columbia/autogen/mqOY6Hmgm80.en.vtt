the bus rapid transit system in the late
80s but there are actually many ideas

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370
80s but there are actually many ideas
 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.580
80s but there are actually many ideas
before that the idea of turning

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590

fish for trash and would be treated the

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709
fish for trash and would be treated the
 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.800
fish for trash and would be treated the
same as fish actually more valuable so

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
same as fish actually more valuable so
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.240
same as fish actually more valuable so
instead of fishing for a fish they

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250
instead of fishing for a fish they
 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.220
instead of fishing for a fish they
should fish with a trash that's making

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230
should fish with a trash that's making
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.620
should fish with a trash that's making
it difficult for the fish to live and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630
it difficult for the fish to live and
 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.180
it difficult for the fish to live and
eventually then they could fish again

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
 
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.770

the private initiative there there is a

00:32:28.659 --> 00:32:28.669
the private initiative there there is a
 

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:30.610
the private initiative there there is a
pressure to build always in the same

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:30.620
pressure to build always in the same
 

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:38.020
pressure to build always in the same
space so and this is it never there is

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:38.030
space so and this is it never there is
 

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:44.049
space so and this is it never there is
no way so they asked our group to say is

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:44.059
no way so they asked our group to say is
 

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:49.090
no way so they asked our group to say is
it possible to have an idea about the

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:49.100
it possible to have an idea about the
 

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.770
it possible to have an idea about the
design how the new design of San Paulo

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:52.780
design how the new design of San Paulo
 

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.649

how we could have new possibilities and
 

00:32:56.659 --> 00:33:01.260
how we could have new possibilities and
not having to pressure the same spaces

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:01.270
not having to pressure the same spaces
 

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:05.399
not having to pressure the same spaces
so we worked in a in this idea and

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:05.409
so we worked in a in this idea and
 

00:33:05.409 --> 00:33:07.659
so we worked in a in this idea and
probably the studio here they are

00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:07.669
probably the studio here they are
 

00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:11.820
probably the studio here they are
working in better ideas but the ideas is

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:11.830
working in better ideas but the ideas is
 

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:18.130
working in better ideas but the ideas is
not it's not having a periphery you can

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:18.140
not it's not having a periphery you can
 

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.060
