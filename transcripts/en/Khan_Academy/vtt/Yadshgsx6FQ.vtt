00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.370
- [Instructor] A food
scientist wants to estimate

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.210
the difference between
the mean weights of eggs

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.880
classified as jumbo and large.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.090
They plan on taking a
sample of each type of egg

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.750
to construct a two-sample t interval.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.800
Which of the following are conditions

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.290
for this type of interval?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.150
So before I even look at these choices,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.140
and they say choose
all answers that apply,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.870
so it might be more than one,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.930
let's just think about what the conditions

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.420
for inference for this type
of interval actually are.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.760
So we've done this many times
in many different contexts,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.540
and so we first of all
have the random condition.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.150
And that's the idea
that each of our samples

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.000
are random or we are conducting
some type of an experiment

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.700
where we randomly assign folks
to one or eggs in this case

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.840
to one of two groups.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.960
In this case we are taking two samples,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.760
and we would hope that they
are truly random samples.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
The second is the normal condition,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.160
and the normal condition
is a little bit different

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.330
depending on whether
we're talking about means

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.430
or whether we're talking
about proportions.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.150
The random condition is
essentially the same.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.900
The normal condition when
we're talking about means,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.420
remember they're looking at the difference

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.250
between mean weights of eggs,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.530
is you would want your,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.230
there's actually several ways
to meet the normal condition.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.430
One is is if the underlying
distribution is normal.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.840
The second way is if your sample sizes

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.020
for each of your samples are
greater than or equal to 30.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.160
So if your first sample size
is greater than or equal to 30

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.640
and your second sample size is
greater than or equal to 30.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.120
Or even if the underlying
data you don't know

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.010
if it's normal or if it isn't normal,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.450
and even if you aren't able to meet these,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.340
as long as your sample
data is roughly symmetric

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.530
and not skewed heavily
in one way or the other,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.330
then that also roughly
meets the normal condition

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.760
when we're dealing with means.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.020
And then the third condition,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.800
and we see this whether
we're dealing with means

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.070
or proportions or differences of means

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.530
or differences of proportions,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.710
is the independence condition.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.920
And this is the idea that either

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.740
your individual observations
are done with replacement

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.590
in both of your samples

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.750
or that the sample size
for both of your samples

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.410
is no more than 10% of the population.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.690
Then you have met this condition.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.100
So with that little bit of a review,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.380
let's see which of these apply.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.820
They observe at least 10
heavy eggs and 10 light eggs

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.710
in each sample.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.750
So this actually is the normal condition

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.520
when we are dealing with
proportions, not for means.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.160
So I would rule this out.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.260
It's a good distractor choice.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.670
The eggs in each sample
are randomly selected

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.730
from their population.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.270
Yep, that's the random
condition right over there,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.350
so I would select that.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.430
They sample an equal
number of each type of egg.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280
So this is a common misconception,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.222
that whether we're dealing
with means or proportions,

00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:00.820
when we're thinking about the
difference between say means

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.380
or the difference between proportions,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.606
that somehow your sample sizes
have to be the exact same.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:07.360
That is not the case.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.790
Your sample sizes do not
have to be the exact case.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.130
Or do not have to be the exact same.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.940
So we would rule this out as well.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.190
So right over here,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.410
they have listed the random condition.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.979
They could've also listed
the normal condition

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.133
and the independence condition.
