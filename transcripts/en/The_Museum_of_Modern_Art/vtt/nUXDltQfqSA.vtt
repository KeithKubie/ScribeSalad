00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:07.554
Male: This introduction to lithography

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:09.654
will show the artist's drawing process,

00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:11.969
materials that are used on drawing

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.030
a lithographic stone,
the process of printing,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.560
and the details and subtlety
that can be achieved

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.319
in the printing process, as well as

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.923
a close-up look at prints themselves.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.324
Lithography, or stone
printing, is an intricate

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:28.122
printmaking process that revolves around

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:30.174
grease and water resisting one another.

00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:33.070
An artist will draw with a greasy material

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.570
on a lithographic stone.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.655
Once we've established a
drawing, or grease, on the stone,

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:42.291
we chemically treat the
stone with materials

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:45.317
like gum arabic to establish the areas

00:00:45.317 --> 00:00:49.319
where water goes; rosin and
talc, to help us through

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.373
what we call an etch, or it's basically

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:54.949
to establish the drawing
down inside the stone.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.372
Once the grease is pulled into the stone

00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:59.347
we can replace the drawing material

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:02.090
with any colored greasy
ink that we would like.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.963
The basic drawing materials that we use

00:01:04.963 --> 00:01:09.328
from a historic standpoint
are things like lithopencils.

00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:12.442
It's a pencil and it's
in this sort of format.

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:14.407
The lower the number, the greasier

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.673
and waxier that material is.

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:19.409
If you want a fine hard line, you use

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.711
a higher number because
that's a harder material.

00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:27.499
Lithographic crayons are in this format.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.489
The suface of a lithocrayon
is such that you can

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:33.629
use it for rubbing or for a fine line

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:36.939
and it can be shaped,
also, to fit your needs.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.158
They come in varying sizes
and hardnesses as well.

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:42.794
The surface of a lithographic stone is

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:44.608
a very seductive surface to draw on.

00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:47.574
It's responsive and it's also sculptural.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.444
Because the stone in and of
itself is receptive to water,

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.737
so if I dampen the stone
it absorbs the water,

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.946
and it's also receptive to grease,

00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:56.659
which means it will
suck the grease down in.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.941
It allows me to put drawing material down

00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.406
and then remove it with
things like razorblades,

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:05.059
an X-ACTO knife, sandpaper, so it allows

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:07.587
you to draw in a more
sculptural way rather than

00:02:07.587 --> 00:02:10.791
having the limitations
of a piece of paper.

00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:14.390
This is a lithographic
stone with a drawing

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.370
by artist Steve Johnson on it.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.838
It was a drawing done
with a lithographic crayon

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.664
directly on the surface of the stone.

00:02:20.664 --> 00:02:22.834
This stone is made from limestone.

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:26.788
It is completely open, as we call it,

00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:28.204
which means it's receptive to grease

00:02:28.204 --> 00:02:29.454
and water at this state.

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:32.640
If I were to put my thumbs
on the surface of the stone,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.150
that would become image area

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.680
because of the grease from my skin.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.954
It's a fairly delicate drawing surface

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:40.403
from that standpoint,
but it's also a positive

00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:43.258
in the sense that every fine mark that you

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:45.046
can put down with a greasy material

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:46.884
will hold in that fidelity.

00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:50.218
In this process it's
what's called a first etch,

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:53.688
and right after that we will
remove the drawing material

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:56.801
and apply printing ink to it,

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.572
which is what's called proving the stone.

00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:01.823
Now the drawing material
has a small amount of talc

00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:05.989
and rosin attached to it,
and it's ready to be etched.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.062
We first apply the gum
arabic to the stone.

00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:11.202
This is to start to establish

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:13.498
the non-image area of the stone.

00:03:13.498 --> 00:03:15.023
What we're trying to make sure is that

00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:16.620
the whites of the stone stay that way

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.056
and they receive gum
arabic, which will help

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:21.166
them receive water later on.

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.887
Once the stone has begun to receive

00:03:24.887 --> 00:03:28.974
the gum into it, we
can apply the acidified

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:32.602
gum arabic in this case, which is TAPEM.

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:37.413
That acidification with
tannic acid helps keep

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:40.646
that gum arabic permanently
bonded to the stone.

00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:42.666
I'm also being very gentle at this point

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.160
as to not scrub or disturb the drawing

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.500
material that's on the stone.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.406
Once I've etched the stone,

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:53.658
I'll remove some of that material

00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:56.667
and replace it with fresh gum arabic.

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.576
This is what we call
cooling the stone down.

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:01.357
It's basically reducing the quantity

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:03.824
of acid on the surface of the stone,

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:05.907
so that when we buff in the gum arabic

00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:07.734
into a very thin and even sheet,

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:09.437
we don't run the risk of having

00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:12.438
too much acid remaining on the stone.

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:17.401
We use cheesecloth to
buff this in very evenly.

00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:19.484
Next, we'll be washing this drawing

00:04:19.484 --> 00:04:20.995
material out with lithotine.

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:25.225
It's a greasy solvent, which
is a refined turpentine

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:28.203
made specially for lithography.

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:29.630
The drawing material will be replaced

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.625
with asphaltum, which
has also been thinned

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:33.835
with lithotine, to create a greasy,

00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:36.957
very [anchor]-receptive base for the ink

00:04:36.957 --> 00:04:39.137
on the roller to replace it with.

00:04:39.137 --> 00:04:43.731
At this point, your
drawing will disappear.

00:04:43.731 --> 00:04:46.164
It's not actually gone,
and what you can see

00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:49.617
is a residue or a ghost
image as we call it

00:04:49.617 --> 00:04:51.312
there on the surface of the stone.

00:04:51.312 --> 00:04:53.395
That is where the stone is being converted

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:56.978
to soap, or oleo-manganate of lime.

00:04:56.978 --> 00:04:59.051
Right now, when we buff the asphaltum

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:00.535
down onto this, we're going to replace

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:02.261
that drawing material, which is in effect

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.174
grease sticking to grease.

00:05:04.174 --> 00:05:05.737
It's the grease-loving area of the stone,

00:05:05.737 --> 00:05:07.708
or the oleophilic area of the stone

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:10.016
accepting new grease.

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:13.045
When a stone has been etched properly

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:15.346
you'll be able to see a fairly clear

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:18.269
ghost image on the surface of the stone.

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.544
What will be happening next is that

00:05:20.544 --> 00:05:23.138
we are going to wet the
surface of the stone.

00:05:23.138 --> 00:05:26.326
I will go over it with a
wet towel and a dry towel.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.711
Kate will sponge that surface

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.787
and I will apply ink
immediately to the stone

00:05:30.787 --> 00:05:32.155
and that will bring up our image.

00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:47.204
(roller sounds)

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.797
In the beginning, we're not actually

00:05:56.797 --> 00:05:59.338
interested in transferring ink to paper.

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:00.911
We're actually more interested in forcing

00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:05.000
ink into the stone so that
it can start to fill up

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.974
the greasy reservoir where it was.

00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:08.028
Yeah, go ahead, Nance.

00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:10.075
You can see only a very
small amount of ink

00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:11.643
has actually been
transferred because we're

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:15.221
starting to push ink into the stone first.

00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:17.443
It's an average of four to six newsprints

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.174
for any given particular stone

00:06:20.174 --> 00:06:21.852
to come up to a full inking.

00:06:26.273 --> 00:06:28.792
When printing on a
dampened sheet of paper,

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:31.714
we can achieve a different tonal range

00:06:31.714 --> 00:06:36.054
based on the softness of that paper.

00:06:36.054 --> 00:06:38.028
What we want to do is match that

00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:39.284
movement and flow of the hand.

00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:40.936
What I'm looking for when I look at this

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:43.578
is to see if it feels as if a hand

00:06:43.578 --> 00:06:45.315
has moved across that surface with

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:46.437
a drawing material.

00:06:46.437 --> 00:06:48.434
If it has and if it
maintains that character,

00:06:48.434 --> 00:06:51.355
then I would consider
that a good impression.
