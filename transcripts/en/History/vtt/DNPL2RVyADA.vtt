00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.795
Bladesmiths, this
is the sharpness test.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.839
To see how sharp the edge of
your friction folders are,

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.884
I will take your fiction folder
and deliver some ham slices.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:10.885
Greg, you're up first.

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:12.429
Let's do this.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.265
[music playing]

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:24.023
That's deep.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:27.902
Well, Greg, your
blade is very sharp.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:31.156
Your friction folder
will cut the job.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.615
Jacob, you're next.
You ready?

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.075
Yep.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.828
[music playing]

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:46.212
Well, Jacob, your
blade cuts well,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.673
but it's kind of
blocky to hold on to.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.676
Overall, though,
your edge will cut.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:52.385
Good job.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.845
Thank you.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:54.971
Flood, you ready?

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.723
I'm absolutely ready.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.017
[music playing]

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.027
Ham slices, anyone?

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:13.782
The minute I grabbed onto the
handle, it did all the work.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.325
Your blade, sir, will cut.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.743
Thank you.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.703
Bladesmiths, welcome
to our strength test,

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.371
the green bamboo chop.

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.957
I'm going to take each
your friction folders,

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:25.752
and I'm going to
very violently strike

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.214
into this very tough
bamboo 10 times.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.841
I don't really care what
your knives do to the bamboo.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.552
I want to see what the bamboo
is going to do to your knives.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.012
Greg, you're up first.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.096
You want to have some fun?

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:37.847
Yup.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.767
Let's do it.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.561
[music playing]

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:01.621
Well, Greg, we've got
some edge damage here.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.414
You've got a very,
very fine edge, which

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.250
we saw on the sharpness test.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.793
But this whole
section right here now

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.170
is rolled over back and forth.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.089
It was comfortable in the hand.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.759
And having that long
tail in your tang there

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.928
allowed me to reach down
further and actually

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.680
generate more velocity.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.807
You got edge damage, but
other than that, good job.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.058
Thank you.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.729
Jacob, you ready?

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.024
[music playing]

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.833
OK, Jacob.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.918
Your edge held up fine.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.879
You got that nice,
steep grind on there.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.046
That worked very well.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:55.550
It's proportionately awkward.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.346
Holding onto it, it's
covering my entire palm here.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.223
So it's a little
tough to hold on to.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.893
But the blade held
up beautifully.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:05.935
Nice job.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.270
Thank you.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.438
Flood.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.689
I'm curious to
see what happens.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.565
So am I. Let's find out.

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.911
[music playing]

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.260
Flood, this is a
beautiful piece.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.262
Thank you.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.472
I see what Doug meant.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.223
As soon as you
pick it up, you can

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:48.436
index it perfectly right where
the sweet spot is to hold it.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:53.942
Your edge, after that,
is still razor sharp.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.361
Bladesmiths, the judge's
deliberation is complete.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.862
They've made their
final decision.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.948
The Bladesmith
leaving the forge is--

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.787
Greg, your blade did
not make the cut.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.288
Greg, you've got
a great design there

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.706
and a comfortable handle.

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.792
But what it came down to
is the significant edge

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.169
damage your blade took
during the strength test.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.713
And that's why we're
letting you go.

00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:17.257
Greg, please
surrender your weapon.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.095
I wish I would
have put a little bit

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.555
better geometry on my blade to
make it better for chopping.

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:26.641
But I feel like I
represented myself very well

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.810
as a craftsman, and I kept
a good head on my shoulders

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.520
throughout the
whole competition.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.231
My plan for the future is to
make some high-quality blades

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.941
and potentially apply
from my journeyman test.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.651
But the first thing I'm
going to do when I get home

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:37.652
is drink a beer and take a nap.
