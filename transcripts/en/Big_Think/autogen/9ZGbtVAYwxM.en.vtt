can be used to spread a genetic trait

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849
can be used to spread a genetic trait
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.259
can be used to spread a genetic trait
through a population quickly and

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269
through a population quickly and
 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.029

research lab in California was recently

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
research lab in California was recently
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.640
research lab in California was recently
able to use this kind of strategy to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
able to use this kind of strategy to
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.310
able to use this kind of strategy to
spread a trait through a population of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
spread a trait through a population of
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.950

fruit flies in a laboratory setting very
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.990
fruit flies in a laboratory setting very
quickly and I think what what amazed

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
quickly and I think what what amazed
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.169
quickly and I think what what amazed
many people many scientists was that was

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
many people many scientists was that was
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.010
many people many scientists was that was
how efficient this was at creating a

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020
how efficient this was at creating a
 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.840
how efficient this was at creating a
effectively a new strain of fruit flies

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
effectively a new strain of fruit flies
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850
effectively a new strain of fruit flies
that had a different different genetic

that had a different different genetic
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.389
that had a different different genetic
trait in every individual I think that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
trait in every individual I think that
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.010
trait in every individual I think that
you know this this you know potential to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
you know this this you know potential to
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.330
you know this this you know potential to
use that kind of spreading of a genetic

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
use that kind of spreading of a genetic
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270
use that kind of spreading of a genetic
trait is is both exciting in terms of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
trait is is both exciting in terms of
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.100
trait is is both exciting in terms of
controlling vectors that could spread

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
controlling vectors that could spread
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.260
controlling vectors that could spread
disease but it also makes a lot of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
disease but it also makes a lot of
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420
disease but it also makes a lot of
people nervous because of the potential

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
people nervous because of the potential
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.849
people nervous because of the potential
to spread the trait that might become

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
to spread the trait that might become
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.250
to spread the trait that might become
something that would be deleterious

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
something that would be deleterious
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170
something that would be deleterious
somehow in the environment so for

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
somehow in the environment so for
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.080
somehow in the environment so for
example imagine that we're possible to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
example imagine that we're possible to
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.929
example imagine that we're possible to
spread a trait that that wiped out

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
spread a trait that that wiped out
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.109
spread a trait that that wiped out
mosquitos or were you know created a

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
mosquitos or were you know created a
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.929
mosquitos or were you know created a
created a population of insects that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
created a population of insects that
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.719
created a population of insects that
were somehow damaging in the environment

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
were somehow damaging in the environment
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.510
were somehow damaging in the environment
I think that those are those are

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520
I think that those are those are
 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.300
I think that those are those are
applications of this technology that are

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310
applications of this technology that are
 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.190
applications of this technology that are
very important to discuss and to think

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
very important to discuss and to think
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.130
very important to discuss and to think
about before we sort of forge ahead and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
about before we sort of forge ahead and
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.810
about before we sort of forge ahead and
release animals like that into the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
release animals like that into the
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.260
release animals like that into the
environment so for for for people that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
environment so for for for people that
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.390
environment so for for for people that
have seen Jurassic Park or if you have

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
have seen Jurassic Park or if you have
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.450
have seen Jurassic Park or if you have
kids like me you've seen it many times

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460
kids like me you've seen it many times
 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.340
kids like me you've seen it many times
you know it's it's sort of a really

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
you know it's it's sort of a really
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.950
you know it's it's sort of a really
interesting idea sort of this was

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
interesting idea sort of this was
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690
interesting idea sort of this was
Michael Crichton's idea in the in the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
Michael Crichton's idea in the in the
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.340
Michael Crichton's idea in the in the
book and then in the movie to think

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
book and then in the movie to think
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.859
book and then in the movie to think
about being able to take bits and pieces

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
about being able to take bits and pieces
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.350
about being able to take bits and pieces
of DNA that come from extinct animals

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
of DNA that come from extinct animals
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.660
of DNA that come from extinct animals
and somehow piece them back together

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
and somehow piece them back together
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.660
and somehow piece them back together
perhaps using sequences of DNA from

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
perhaps using sequences of DNA from
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.870
perhaps using sequences of DNA from
existing animals to create genomes that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
existing animals to create genomes that
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.050
existing animals to create genomes that
would allow you know once extinct

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
would allow you know once extinct
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.710
would allow you know once extinct
animals to to be alive again and you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
animals to to be alive again and you
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.770
animals to to be alive again and you
know could that really be done and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780
know could that really be done and
 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.420
know could that really be done and
and I think that you know the CRISPR

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430
and I think that you know the CRISPR
 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.690
and I think that you know the CRISPR
technology offers scientists a tool now

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700
technology offers scientists a tool now
 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.600
technology offers scientists a tool now

the level of was in the film Jurassic

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
the level of was in the film Jurassic
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.420
the level of was in the film Jurassic
Park but but you know in principle could

allow introduction of new genes into

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880
allow introduction of new genes into
 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.300
allow introduction of new genes into
existing genomes that would recreate

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
existing genomes that would recreate
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.180
existing genomes that would recreate
animals that have traits that have been

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190
animals that have traits that have been
 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.820
animals that have traits that have been
lost by extinction and so you know a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830
lost by extinction and so you know a
 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.260
lost by extinction and so you know a
number of scientists have been thinking

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
number of scientists have been thinking
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.940
number of scientists have been thinking
about this I think George church is one

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950
about this I think George church is one
 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.559
about this I think George church is one
of the one of the prominent scientists

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569
of the one of the prominent scientists
 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.240
of the one of the prominent scientists
who's been discussing this in the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250
who's been discussing this in the
 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.790
who's been discussing this in the
context of the extinction of woolly

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800
context of the extinction of woolly
 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.680
context of the extinction of woolly
mammoths you know could you actually

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
mammoths you know could you actually
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.729
mammoths you know could you actually
take DNA that's been sequenced from the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739
take DNA that's been sequenced from the
 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.920
take DNA that's been sequenced from the
remains of woolly mammoths and use

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930
remains of woolly mammoths and use
 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.920
remains of woolly mammoths and use
elephant DNA to recreate these animals

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930
elephant DNA to recreate these animals
 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.190
elephant DNA to recreate these animals
somehow and you know it's it's a it's a

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200
somehow and you know it's it's a it's a
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.140
somehow and you know it's it's a it's a
sort of a fascinating idea now whether

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150
sort of a fascinating idea now whether
 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.610
sort of a fascinating idea now whether
that would actually work I think there's

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620
that would actually work I think there's
 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.470
that would actually work I think there's
a lot of technical challenges to doing

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480
a lot of technical challenges to doing
 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.809
a lot of technical challenges to doing
that experiment but could we do things

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819
that experiment but could we do things
 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.600
that experiment but could we do things
like bringing back the carrier pigeon or

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610
like bringing back the carrier pigeon or
 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.880
like bringing back the carrier pigeon or
you know animals that might have been

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890
you know animals that might have been
 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.699
you know animals that might have been
have gone extinct of very recently and

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709
have gone extinct of very recently and
 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.500
have gone extinct of very recently and
where we could we have close genetic

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510
where we could we have close genetic
 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.080
where we could we have close genetic
relatives that we could actually study I

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090
relatives that we could actually study I
 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.360
relatives that we could actually study I
think it's a you know to me it's a it's

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370
think it's a you know to me it's a it's
 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.330
think it's a you know to me it's a it's
an interesting idea because of the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340
an interesting idea because of the
 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.569
an interesting idea because of the
potential for understanding genetic

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579
potential for understanding genetic
 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.870
potential for understanding genetic
networks and the you know what what what

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880
networks and the you know what what what
 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.900
networks and the you know what what what
genes are really doing how they how they

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910
genes are really doing how they how they
 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.729
genes are really doing how they how they
really give rise to certain traits I

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739
really give rise to certain traits I
 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.350
really give rise to certain traits I
mean I think that one thing to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360
mean I think that one thing to
 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.410
mean I think that one thing to
appreciate is that in most cases the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420
appreciate is that in most cases the
 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.690
appreciate is that in most cases the
traits that we observe in animals or in

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700
traits that we observe in animals or in
 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.240
traits that we observe in animals or in
ourselves are coming from interactions

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250
ourselves are coming from interactions
 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.310
ourselves are coming from interactions
with many many genes it's not just one

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320
with many many genes it's not just one
 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.229
with many many genes it's not just one
gene that gives rise to you know

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239
gene that gives rise to you know
 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.000
gene that gives rise to you know
somebody's height or intelligence or

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010
somebody's height or intelligence or
 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.680
somebody's height or intelligence or
anything else it's really a whole

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690
anything else it's really a whole
 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.840
anything else it's really a whole
network of genes better interacting and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850
network of genes better interacting and
 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.970
network of genes better interacting and
to start to understand that I think

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980
to start to understand that I think
 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.979
to start to understand that I think
would be very exciting and potentially
