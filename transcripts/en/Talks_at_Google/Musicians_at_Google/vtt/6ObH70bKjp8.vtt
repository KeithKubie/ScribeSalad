MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please give
a warm welcome to Kino Kimino.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.489
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:12.939
KIM TALON: Thanks, Matthew.

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:17.821
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:28.300
You guys are so polite.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.390
Does anybody bad work here?

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.510
Like, are there
any bad kids here?

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.478
You guys are just--

00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:38.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:41.810
I could tell, like, there's
one bad person that I

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.500
saw while we were playing.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.250
I think it's you, and it's
not because you're just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.500
standing right in front of me.

00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:55.008
Um, OK.

00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:14.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.104
Thank you.

00:07:16.104 --> 00:07:17.520
We're going to
play one more song.

00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:23.900
And I feel like now I
must be really feeling

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.582
the rebelliousness of Google,
because my guitar string broke

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:29.540
and that never happens.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.906
SPEAKER 1: You're the bad woman.

00:07:30.906 --> 00:07:31.572
KIM TALON: What?

00:07:31.572 --> 00:07:33.030
SPEAKER 1: Now
you're the bad girl.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.164
KIM TALON: Now I'm the bad girl.

00:10:41.293 --> 00:10:43.012
Thank you.

00:10:43.012 --> 00:10:44.970
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please
help me welcome back

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.796
to the stage, Kim Talon.

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:48.284
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.028
Thanks so much for
joining us here.

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.547
KIM TALON: Thank you.

00:10:55.547 --> 00:10:57.130
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Great performance.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:57.950
Really enjoyed it.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:58.960
KIM TALON: Thank you.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.459
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Fantastic stuff.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.416
The new album is called
"Bait for Sissies."

00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:03.790
KIM TALON: "Bait
Is for Sissies."

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.077
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
"Bait IS for Sissies."

00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:06.910
What does that mean?

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.080
KIM TALON: Oh, you're going
to ask me that question?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.413
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I am going
to ask you that question.

00:11:10.413 --> 00:11:12.500
It's a good place to start.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.911
KIM TALON: Well, I suppose the
simplified answer-- otherwise

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:19.410
we could have a conversation
for a couple of hours about it.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.701
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well, it
is called Talks at Google.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:29.610
KIM TALON: It comes
down to maybe not making

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.450
the courageous
choice, I suppose.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.360
So there's the literal
definition of bait,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.664
and then there's what we
would consider to be bait.

00:11:40.664 --> 00:11:42.080
I'm not explaining
this very well.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.680
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: People bait?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.100
KIM TALON: Yeah, people bait.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.810
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:46.530
Thank you.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:46.720
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: OK.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.970
KIM TALON: This is a
little early for us,

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.870
so my mind's not--

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.699
I haven't talked to that
many people yet today.

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:53.490
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Sure, sure, no problem.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.410
So Kino Kimino-- is
it accurate to say

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.290
this is the third notable
project that you've

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.530
put your energy behind?

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.156
KIM TALON: Yes.

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:04.613
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
But you've been

00:12:04.613 --> 00:12:06.000
grinding away for many years--

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.625
KIM TALON: Yes.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:09.085
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: --a decade
or more in the Indie scene,

00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:09.960
or Independent scene.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.626
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.140
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Do
you find a difficulty

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.880
in the nomenclature of that,
like Indie versus Independent?

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.060
Do you get people
who are like, hey,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.270
you know, you've worked
with bigger named people,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.270
or bigger named artists.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.550
You're not independent
any anymore,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.275
but you still fit
in Indie as a genre.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.510
KIM TALON: Well, first of all,
I don't hear the word "Indie"

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.660
that much anymore.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.490
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I
think it's better that way.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.270
You probably shouldn't.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.365
KIM TALON: So that's nice.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.720
But you know, I think all
the projects I've done

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.280
are so underground in a way
that, like what you're saying,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.740
can I be Indie if I'm
not really Independent?

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.770
Well, I really am
pretty Independent

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.009
and have always been.

00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:54.550
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, and I think

00:12:54.550 --> 00:13:00.700
it shows a lot in terms of the
sort of multimedia approach

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.800
to yourself as an artist.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.230
It's not all in on the
music-- you guys also

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.940
spend a great deal
of time creating

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.730
these videos for all the
songs, like what we just saw.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.390
And there's a lot of
artistic creativity

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.790
that is channeled in
that direction as well.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.910
What motivates you to sort of
dabble in all of these mediums?

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.730
KIM TALON: Lack
of label support.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:29.310
I mean, I would hire out
people to make videos and do

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.690
all the other parts that
musicians have to do--

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.700
band pictures, or just
all the media part of it.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.150
But I just never
had full support

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.690
from a record label the
way that I would like to.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.590
So it's kind of just like,
what could I do with my iPhone?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.397
What can I do with
my friend who's over?

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.730
Like, what can we make that
doesn't cost a lot of money?

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.930
That kind of thing.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.070
So you know, like sometimes
they say lack of resources

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.975
sometimes leads to
the most creative--

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:04.350
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Necessity
is the mother of invention.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.030
KIM TALON: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.640
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
OK, that's great.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.100
How long ago was it when
you made the transition

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.010
from California here
to New York City?

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.650
KIM TALON: It's
been a few years.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.066
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
The reason why

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:21.180
I ask is because I know as being
an artist and musician as well

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.270
in the Brooklyn scene and having
been doing that for the past 10

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.360
years, I've seen a
lot of evolution.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.000
So I'd like to talk about the
evolution that you've seen--

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.850
the differences between what
it was like out in California

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.990
and then coming here.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.950
And it triggered in me this
morning, I remembered a quote,

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.790
and I think it was 2010, Patti
Smith said that if she could

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.780
give advice to young artists who
wanted to move to New York City

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.750
to really dive into their art,
her advice would be don't.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.190
Don't go to New York City,
in the thinking that New York

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.020
City's done, or
it's over-saturated,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.872
or it's just not the place.

00:14:56.872 --> 00:14:58.830
KIM TALON: Well, it's
certainly over-saturated.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.830
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
let's talk about that.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.220
So you came from another--

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.170
that whole LA-Southern
California scene

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.170
is also wildly over-saturated
with independent music.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.930
KIM TALON: Yeah, but
not to the same degree.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.396
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: In what way?

00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:12.645
KIM TALON: There's less bands.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.610
I feel kind of bad saying this,
because I love Los Angeles.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.750
And maybe it's just my
personal experience,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:27.630
but I've seen a higher
quality here of--

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.210
I wouldn't say musicianship,
but a lot of the bands

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.450
are working really hard and
writing really good songs.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.940
Maybe it's just more
my taste, I think.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.520
New York, the sound
here or in Brooklyn

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.760
is a little more gritty.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.110
And in LA there was
a lot of music around

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.580
that was a little too
pretty for my taste.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.880
So it could just be a
personal preference.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.870
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Sure, but
that grit sort of comes out.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.710
It definitely comes out in
the sound and in the music.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.630
And a lot of people who
have talked about your work

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.720
before or reviewed
the music before,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.980
they tend to fall into this
vein of common adjectives,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:17.190
things like relating it to
the whole Riot Grrl stuff.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.240
Indie gets thrown around a lot.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.890
Grunge gets thrown around a lot.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:25.060
And I think that that's probably
lazy writing a lot of the times

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.140
more than anything else,
but how much of that

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.520
adjective stuff do
you self-ascribe,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.430
versus how much of it do
you find is just laid on you

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.060
and you don't have
much exit from?

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.010
KIM TALON: I think it's
the same kind of thing

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.060
like when people talk
about you, or people

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.440
say you're a nice person,
you're a this kind of person,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.690
or you're that kind of person.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.023
You don't really think about
the way people think of you

00:16:50.023 --> 00:16:53.833
unless you're a weirdo, I guess.

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:56.620
So, like, for me, I don't
really think too much

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.140
about what people say.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.820
It's not that I'm
past that, or I

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.130
don't pay attention, or
get offended or happy when

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.750
people say good or bad things.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.477
It's just that it really plays
no role in my consciousness.

00:17:09.477 --> 00:17:10.810
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Interesting.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.960
So let's dive a little bit
deeper into the Brooklyn scene.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.140
You guys have done a
lot of playing around

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.480
out there with a lot
of local level talent.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.390
And you said you find bands that
are just fighting, fighting,

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.450
fighting to get any sort of--

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.310
carve out their
land on the ground.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.590
Do you find that
that motivates you

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.750
more to keep pace with that?

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.020
Is it overwhelming
at times as a band

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.620
doing everything yourself to see
all these people who are maybe

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.400
accomplishing more and or less,
or doing less and seemingly

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.537
accomplishing more?

00:17:43.537 --> 00:17:45.370
KIM TALON: Well, there's
a couple of things.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:50.339
First of all, I lead a
pretty isolated life.

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.380
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Difficult to do in this city.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.338
KIM TALON: My choosing.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.570
I think I'm a little
over-stimulated by the city.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:03.220
And my reaction to it is to
sort of not go out too much,

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.770
and just write at home
and stuff like that.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.920
And then the other
part of it is,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.600
there's so many bands,
that to feel affected

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.550
by the climate of
all of that, you'd

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.920
have to really be paying
attention, and I'm not.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.500
I'm not really that interested.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.430
I'm interested, and I love
going to see bands that I like.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.940
But I'm not--

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.940
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It's
difficult to really cut

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.840
through--

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.570
KIM TALON: I'm not interested in
the sociological aspect of it,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.400
I suppose.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.440
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Yeah, it's strange,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.100
the sort of divisions of
pie that Brooklyn has.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.060
I find these genre
kids group off

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.010
in this direction and
play in these venues

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.510
with these other bands.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.990
And these communities
are supportive

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.806
inside their community, but
isolative of each other.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:01.650
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.490
I mean, now that I think
about it a little more

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:11.870
and think about my detachment,
there is one part of it

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.730
that I am interested
in and that I

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.720
have been paying attention to,
and that is the female aspect.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.470
Because I've always loved
playing with female musicians,

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:26.330
and I love listening
to female artists.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:32.840
And I don't know why, but I just
have always been drawn to that,

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.030
and I love female bands.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.640
And when I moved to
Brooklyn, I realized, wow,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.649
there's so many more all-female
bands compared to Los Angeles.

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.690
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.160
KIM TALON: And I'm
sure all over the world

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.190
there's more women doing
all kinds of things,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.782
but that's one thing
that I notice here.

00:19:52.782 --> 00:19:54.740
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Again,
maybe it's something

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.650
to do with the concentration
that that stuff shows up?

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.080
KIM TALON: Yeah, I mean,
there's a lot of people here.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.460
There's also a
lot of women here.

00:20:04.182 --> 00:20:06.646
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Hopefully, about half.

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:09.230
KIM TALON: I think it's a
little bit more than half.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.590
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Hey,
more than half sounds great.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.040
Let's go back to the
album for a minute.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.100
So "Bait Is for Sissies," you
had some very interesting help

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.920
in the production and
recording of the record,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.760
that in the form of Lee
Ranaldo and Steve Shelley

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.500
from Sonic Youth.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.250
How did that
relationship come to be,

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.210
and how did the efforts
to get this album made

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.744
play out with those two?

00:20:36.744 --> 00:20:37.410
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:42.630
So, it was interesting
to me as well.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.220
So basically I had
spoken with this producer

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:50.300
named John Agnello years
ago about making a record.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.830
But I was still
on the west coast

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.729
and I just couldn't pull it
together to come over here.

00:20:54.729 --> 00:20:56.270
But I really wanted
to work with him.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.860
He's an amazing guy.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:05.000
And then when I came
to New York to live,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.940
I called him and we
talked on and off

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.310
about making a record together.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.780
And he was asking me who I
wanted to use for the record.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.530
And I was kind of at a
loss, because I'd always

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:23.420
played with my friends in LA and
I did not know many musicians

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.670
in New York at all.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.810
So we kind of joked
around, and the idea

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.380
of using some of the Sonic
Youth guys was thrown out there.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.700
And John was like, OK,
well, give me your demos

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.490
and I'll send them
over to those guys.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.390
And if you guys only knew
how horrible my demos are.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:47.210
I recorded them on my bed.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.990
I'm just not great
at recording at all--

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.150
and then for some reason,
like, 10 backup vocal tracks,

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.000
and stuff like that.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.690
But I guess they liked them.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.230
I was very happy.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.570
I called my mom right
away and was like,

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.160
the guys from Sonic
Youth liked my bad demos.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.420
And then it just kind
of evolved from there.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.545
It happened really quickly.

00:22:21.446 --> 00:22:23.990
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Do you
find that working with them

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.450
changed the process for you?

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.000
You talked a bit about
recording bad demos

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.480
and approaching it that
way, and then the DIY

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.240
background of your music.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.160
In this situation
now where we're

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.820
bringing in really
established players,

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.980
I'm sure it was a great
studio environment

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.500
that you were able to
work in with the producer.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.740
Did you find that there
were impacts to the way

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.500
that you would go through
the process because of that?

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.650
Were you more
conscious about the way

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.670
you were making things
sound or making decisions

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.480
because these legends
were in the room?

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.520
Or did it play out just like,
oh yeah, some nice guys that

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.170
are here to play some songs?

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.500
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.790
Well, a couple things.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.270
Well, first of all, the
main difference that

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.640
comes to mind when you
ask that question is we

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.500
didn't use a click
for the drums.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.330
And I had always
recorded with a click

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.420
because I suppose I didn't
feel confident enough

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.640
to go off the click.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.240
So that was one difference.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.910
And then, obviously,
I felt nervous.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.650
I'd been listening to
Sonic Youth forever.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.590
But it was weird.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.660
And that's the weird
thing about music

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:47.100
for me is it just seems
like another limb to me.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.060
And I should have
felt more intimidated,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.740
and I think I should have felt
more scared, but I didn't.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.060
And actually for one or two of
the days, John, our producer,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:05.760
had to go out of town and I
had to produce the [? Lee ?]

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.520
days, which you can
imagine I was like--

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.627
But he was really sweet.

00:24:10.627 --> 00:24:12.210
And he was like, OK,
what do you want?

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.130
What do you want on this chorus?

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.421
What do you want on this verse?

00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:17.880
And I feel really
comfortable producing,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.910
because I've done it a lot
and I actually love producing.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:26.520
So it actually gave me way
more creative freedom, at least

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.080
for that part of the record,
to really experiment and play

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.019
around.

00:24:32.019 --> 00:24:33.060
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Nice.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.779
And now that the record is out--

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:37.320
KIM TALON: Yeah, it
came out in June.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.361
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah.

00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:40.800
The plans to push
and promote, I know

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.570
you guys have maybe a couple
of local things coming up,

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.044
but we're looking at
maybe winter touring?

00:24:46.044 --> 00:24:46.710
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:52.080
So we're going to be doing a
tour around the Million Women

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.074
March.

00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:54.490
They keep changing
the name of it,

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:55.710
so I don't know what
it's called today.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.210
But anyways, we'll
be at the March

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.030
in D.C. And then
the night before

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.970
we're playing in Philadelphia,
and we're just organizing shows

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.380
around the March.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.265
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So,
somewhere in the Northeast?

00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:06.900
KIM TALON: Yeah, East Coast.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.210
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: For
people who have been watching

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:14.020
and saw the performance, if
you're not going very far west,

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.570
or maybe they're in
Europe, something

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.820
like that, where is a
good place for people

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.190
to be able to consume the
art that you guys have

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.560
been creating?

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.610
KIM TALON: Well, you can
go to KinoKimino.com,

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.020
and we're on
Facebook, Instagram.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.630
I Twitter every once in a
while, but I don't really

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.470
know what to say.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.572
What do musicians
say on Twitter?

00:25:33.572 --> 00:25:35.280
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Things to fill space.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.988
KIM TALON: Right.

00:25:35.988 --> 00:25:38.104
Yeah, that's not my forte,
but we are on Twitter.

00:25:38.104 --> 00:25:40.020
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I
think that's pretty much

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.980
what anyone says on
Twitter, just like,

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.910
oh, fill some silence.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.120
KIM TALON: Yeah, we've got
a bunch of videos on YouTube

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.950
and you can buy the record
on Amazon iTunes, all that.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.950
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Let's
talk about the videos.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.444
So there's a lot of things out
there, and one of the things

00:25:56.444 --> 00:25:58.610
that I've noticed-- and it
carries over a little bit

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.380
to the music, but specifically
with the videos-- is it always

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.370
seems that there's one sort
of, like, "Where's Waldo"

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.000
element of like, find the
thing that's different.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.580
Find the thing that stands out.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.680
And I know that other people
have thrown the Dada movement

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.560
references, or Dada-ism,
into the mix as well.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.520
Is that a conscious thing?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.890
Or is that just, hey, this
would be a good idea to do

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.200
and it happens to
relate to that,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.034
or other people perceive
it relating to that?

00:26:32.034 --> 00:26:33.950
That's not a very
well-worded question, is it?

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.420
KIM TALON: I understand
what you're saying.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.540
I would say it's just a result
of your parents raising you

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.370
without a filter.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.870
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: OK.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:48.850
And do you find your
fans are attracted

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.150
to that stuff, relate
to that stuff, maybe

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.950
they miss that stuff?

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:58.440
How important is it as a
Kimino-ist in the world to key

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.380
in on those elements?

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.130
KIM TALON: That's an
interesting question.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.379
I've never thought about that.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.360
I think that an important
part of making art in any way

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.310
is just trying not to think
about your audience too much

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:18.550
and just doing what's
organic for you.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.690
So when you are
asking me basically

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.150
are people getting this
stuff, or who's getting it,

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.750
or how important is that,
I don't really know.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.520
It seems like some
people are getting it,

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.040
because people, at
least for this record,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.910
have responded really nicely.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.220
But I don't know.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.510
Did I answer your question?

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.220
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
A little bit.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:40.620
KIM TALON: A little bit?

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.619
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I
just wonder how much of it

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.400
is baked into--

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.990
art is two things.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.340
Art is the artist's intention.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.080
Art is what the viewer sees.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.360
I wonder how much of
the tongue-in-cheek,

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.120
the comedic elements,
the Dadaist elements,

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.690
are baked in from your
intention, and how much of it

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.910
is just what the
audience is perceiving.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.050
KIM TALON: Oh, no, no, no.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.520
It's definitely what I'm doing.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.310
It it's not perception.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.650
I feel like in a lot of
ways it's selfishly probably

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.020
just to amuse myself maybe.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.452
Or maybe it has something
to do with one of the songs,

00:28:15.452 --> 00:28:16.410
or something like that.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.320
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Are
there plans for more videos?

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.060
KIM TALON: Well,
Jordan, our drummer, she

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.747
wants to make a video for
the song called "Bloodbath."

00:28:29.747 --> 00:28:31.080
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: "Bloodbath."

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.440
So we'll keep an
eye out for that--

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:32.830
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:33.960
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
--on the YouTube page.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.582
We do want to open
it up for Q&amp;A. So

00:28:35.582 --> 00:28:37.290
if anyone in the
audience has a question,

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.710
please make your
way to a microphone.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.680
While they're doing that,
can you take a moment

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.130
and introduce the band that
was here with us today?

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.440
KIM TALON: I'd love to.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.710
So this is Jordan.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.460
She plays drums.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.950
That's Tara.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.510
She's playing the
white guitar over here.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.390
And that's Cindy,
and she plays bass.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.400
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And how did
you come together as a band?

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.204
KIM TALON: I think just through
each other and mutual friends.

00:29:04.204 --> 00:29:05.870
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
That Brooklyn scene?

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.680
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.929
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Excellent.

00:29:07.929 --> 00:29:09.340
We do have a question.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I
know in prior bands

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.600
you've collaborated
with other artists,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.730
including Reggie
Watts and Alice Talon.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.300
How did you get
together with them,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.537
and what was that process like?

00:29:24.537 --> 00:29:26.870
KIM TALON: How did I get
together with Alice and Reggie?

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.490
KIM TALON: So I met
Alice on Craigslist.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:43.190
And I met Reggie at--

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.580
there's this weird jazz
band that was performing

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.950
at the House of Blues in LA.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.550
They're really famous.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.200
I feel bad now.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.010
It's like some band related
to that band Lettuce--

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.440
like one of those
kind of jazzy, funky.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.000
I don't know what
I was doing there.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:05.930
I think I met Reggie
backstage at that show,

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.610
and then we just became friends.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.850
And he'd stay with me when
he was in LA because he was

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.210
living in Brooklyn at the time.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.120
And then we kind
of swapped places

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.111
and moved to opposite
coasts at the same time.

00:30:19.111 --> 00:30:20.736
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Let's go over here.

00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:23.430
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
where the "mashed potato"

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.570
line in "Passion" comes from.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:31.660
KIM TALON: Oh, man,
that's a good question.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:37.290
I think that it was like, I have
certainly gone through phases--

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.780
and this also happens to
me weekly and monthly--

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:46.710
of thinking that love and
romance is just ridiculous,

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:53.170
and my sort of romantic
leanings are equally ridiculous.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.480
So just kind of like
passion is blank.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.590
It's like mashed potatoes.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.250
It's like, I don't
know, curtains.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.940
It's wires on the floor.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.955
Am I answering that?

00:31:06.955 --> 00:31:07.830
Does that make sense?

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:08.330
OK.

00:31:13.436 --> 00:31:15.060
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
The mashed potatoes

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.610
is kind of a very
apparent moment of--

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.100
KIM TALON: I hate that mashed
potatoes are now becoming

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.355
like my international symbol.

00:31:24.355 --> 00:31:25.730
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Yeah, you got

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.290
to watch out for that stuff.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:32.280
People will meme you so quickly.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.830
What should it be?

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.410
If it's not "passion
is a mashed potato,"

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.980
what is the line that you would
like people to hang around?

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.180
KIM TALON: I think
you've got a good point.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.745
Maybe we should
just leave it be.

00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:44.620
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Just run with it?

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.610
KIM TALON: Yeah.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.350
You can't think of your
own nickname, right?

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.809
That's, like, not OK.

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:53.600
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So, future merch booths

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.340
at Kino Kimino shows--

00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:00.529
t-shirts, vinyl, CDs,
mashed potatoes to go.

00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:02.570
KIM TALON: I did for that
video you guys watched,

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:07.580
I had about seven boxes of--

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.540
have you guys seen those
dry mashed potatoes?

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.060
They come in boxes and
they blow up so much,

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.310
so we had so many
mashed potatoes.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.400
And we were staying
at, like, a love hotel.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.740
You know what I
mean by that, right?

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.895
Like, those hourly hotels.

00:32:25.129 --> 00:32:27.420
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: With,
like, the theme rooms, right?

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.044
KIM TALON: Right,
with the theme rooms.

00:32:29.044 --> 00:32:31.280
So we had, like, a
sink full of mashed.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.017
It was, like, such a mess.

00:32:34.017 --> 00:32:36.350
I still have-- I don't know
what to do with those boxes.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:37.580
I don't want to eat them.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.170
Maybe I should have
them at my shows.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.794
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Yeah, there you go.

00:32:40.794 --> 00:32:43.412
The struggles that we
go through for art.

00:32:43.412 --> 00:32:45.620
Well, we thank you very much
for playing for us today

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.990
and for taking the
time to come and visit.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.960
Again, you guys visit
KinoKimino.com, check them out

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.010
on YouTube, and look
for the tour this fall.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.090
"Bait Is for Sissies"
is the new record.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.710
Thank you once
again, Kino Kimino.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:59.043
KIM TALON: Thanks for having me.

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:01.150
[APPLAUSE]
