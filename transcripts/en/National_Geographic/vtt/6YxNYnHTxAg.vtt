00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.600
[music playing]

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.500
This is one of the
deadliest places on earth.

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:09.700
Every known virus is here.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.667
It's going to seem
very claustrophobic.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.700
People panic.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.567
They scream.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.333
You need to be straight
with me, can you do this?

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.600
[music playing]

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.300
Jaax, something I need
you to take a look at.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:35.500
What are we testing for?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.166
Ebola Zaire.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.533
Ebola has never been
detected on US soil.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.800
There's a first
time for everything.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
I have a husband, two kids.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200
We have a duty to protect them.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.300
You always fight so hard.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.200
[music playing]

00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.533
Hole.

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.734
Hole, hole.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:02.934
Oh my god.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:06.400
[music playing]

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.166
You're scaring the
hell out of me, Nanc.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.266
I need to get back in there.

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.633
And there's a chance
that it's Ebola.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:17.533
They may already be in
the midst of an outbreak.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:21.500
What did you do?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.900
Do you have any idea what
kind of panic this would cause?

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.867
There's no cure, no vaccine.

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:32.867
Mortality rate is 90%.

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:33.867
It's here.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.767
You brought it back here?

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:40.433
It spreads through
bodily fluids.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.834
When we show each
other affection

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.767
It's learning.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:49.166
It's evolved.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.834
It will wipe us out if
we don't get ahead of it.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:53.166
Woah.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.433
You're going to
get us all killed.

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:59.367
I'm trying to
keep my family safe.

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:00.834
I won't cover this up for you.

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:02.600
