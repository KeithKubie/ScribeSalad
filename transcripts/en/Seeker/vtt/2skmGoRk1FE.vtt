00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.670
Have you ever noticed that the attractive
kids in high school always got better grades

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.670
than you?

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.720
Yeah well science has found out why!

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.140
In a recent study published in the journal
Inside Higher Ed, researchers found that college

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.140
professors gave more attractive students better
grades, specifically the ladies.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.470
The study found that women who were rated
as less attractive had slightly lower grades

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.670
than their better looking peers.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.431
It’s a small difference, the authors describe
it as “the difference from an A-minus to

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.431
a B-plus.”

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:38.440
But interestingly, and perhaps more tellingly,
this “grade punishment” as the researchers

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.690
called it, disappeared when the women took
online classes.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
The researchers believed it was a mix of professors
investing more time into better looking students

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.899
and simply giving better grades to prettier
people.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.670
And these better looking students probably
got the same treatment in high school too

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.640
according to a book on the topic.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.469
In an analysis of data from almost 9,000 high
school students, researchers found that yet

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.600
again, the prettier students had better grades.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.040
But being the BEST looking didn’t matter
so much as being better looking than average.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.640
Those who weren’t as attractive were more
depressed and had fewer friends, issues that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.810
could affect school performance.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.580
But being hot doesn’t necessarily mean you
get the best grades.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
While they did have better grades… they
also got more distracted.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.550
By dating and partying, which of course offset
some of the gains in grades.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.070
It’s just well… society treats you better
if you’re considered hot.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.470
There are tons of studies that support the
fact that pretty people have an edge in society

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.750
outside of school as well.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.410
Attractive people are paid more, perceived
to be more intelligent and heck, one study

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.450
published in the British Journal of Developmental
Psychology found kids trust attractive people

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.450
more!

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.549
But, it’s not because hot people are smarter,
better qualified for a job, or more trustworthy.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.060
Instead, it comes back to people's belief
that attractiveness correlates with intelligence.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.610
This is called the Physical Attractiveness
Stereotype.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.780
And this is a worldwide phenomenon.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.720
One study published in the Journal of Cross
Culture Psychology found that Koreans thought

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.690
that attractive people were more trustworthy
and concerned for others, values highly prized

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.690
in their culture.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.999
But looking good isn’t all it’s cracked
up to be.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.980
A study published in the Journal of Social
Psychology found that if a woman was considered

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.129
good-looking she was less likely to get certain
jobs, especially the more traditionally masculine

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.919
ones with titles like “manager of research
and development, director of finance, mechanical

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.279
engineer and construction supervisor.”

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.669
Researchers called this the "beauty is beastly"
effect.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:34.529
So I guess you should follow that old saying,
“you shouldn’t judge a book by it’s

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.529
cover”.

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.109
Unless that book is getting better grades
then you for the same exact work, then maybe

00:02:38.109 --> 00:03:13.949
you should say something.
