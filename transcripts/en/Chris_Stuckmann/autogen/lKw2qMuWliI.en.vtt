actually add some

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009
actually add some
 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.679
actually add some
to the movie and in all honesty because

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:37.689
to the movie and in all honesty because
 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.209
to the movie and in all honesty because
like there are certain horror films that

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.489
you out of it but insidious chapter 2 is
the kind of movie where I do feel like

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:47.499
the kind of movie where I do feel like
 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.100
the kind of movie where I do feel like
they can get a little bit goofy because

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110
they can get a little bit goofy because
 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.999

obviously anyone who sits down and

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009
obviously anyone who sits down and
 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.469
obviously anyone who sits down and
actually thinks about the movies like

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479
actually thinks about the movies like
 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.839
actually thinks about the movies like

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.679
but I really like the way they handled
the more goofy aspects of the movie and
