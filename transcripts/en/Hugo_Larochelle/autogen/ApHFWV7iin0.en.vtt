00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.980
 these capsules we will see the proof by 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.240
 resolution 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.360
 so we finally saw the three tools 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.389
 which we needed to know the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.009
 substitution the unification then the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 transformation into normal form 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.910
 conjunctive to finally see a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.310
 commented what we can do a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 proof by resolution then a proof 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 by resolution will proceed as follows 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.880
 so let's imagine that from a formula 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 or a set of formula f1 in 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.760
 want to show that these formulas 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 implies another formula f all this 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 we will do in advance and we will 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.110
 transform our rooney our or our 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.320
 formulas f1 into a set of clauses 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.730
 in the form of nice amendments then of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.079
 that we will add the negation of f2 that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 will convert in normal form 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.070
 conjunctive also we will add that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.059
 in our club center so in fact 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.930
 it's a bit like doing a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.080
 evidence by contradictions where we assume 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 the negation of what we are trying to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.409
 contrary to what we are trying to prove 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.689
 we will know if we do not arrive 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 contradiction in the proof not 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.200
 resolution the contradiction is going 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.130
 correspond to the deliberation of a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.229
 empty clause and it's claude dilain on 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.850
 wants to get it by applying so 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.979
 repetitive at what is called the rule 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.259
 of resolutions that we want to see in his 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.759
 instinct and so what are we going to do this 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.530
 that we will take our clauses in our 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.930
 knowledge base we are going to have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.439
 added the negation of what we are trying 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 to prove 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.009
 and here we will apply the judgment of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 resolution by taking fathers from 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.869
 clauses by getting new clauses 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.280
 we add to our set our base 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.659
 of knowledge and we will do this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.030
 until we get to what we're going 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.290
 call the clause quickly I'm counting 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.470
 will describe in a moment and we do 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.390
 this until that's so if we 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.500
 happens to demonstrate the empty lacrosse it's 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.630
 that it has been shown that f1 implies f2 and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 then if we come to a moment when finally 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.659
 we are no longer able to apply a 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.420
 new way of solving rule 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.569
 to generate new clauses but 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.469
 in this case in f1 m 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.290
 the icp to f2 so what is this rule 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:20.170
 of resolution goodbye two cases the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.549
 first case this is the case we call 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.930
 propositional so it's some 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.030
 thing I did not come to talk about but 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.579
 the propositional logic is in 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.019
 makes a special case the logic of 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.109
 first order is the logic of 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.700
 first year where the predicates do not 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.409
 take no arguments of which crap 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 then in fact it's basically a 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.209
 cock in the near body or yop to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.239
 two variables the logic of first 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.540
 order but without quantified variable 14 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.060
 so the resolution rule in the kop 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.349
 propositional goes as follows imagine 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.409
 that I have two clauses that we will call 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:58.159
 clauses per year the first klaus and 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:01.370
 the addition of and clothes p1 until 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.430
 pn and then the second klaus and 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.750
 the addition of the clauses of mclaude q1 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.459
 up to qm 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:14.269
 as well as the assistant there with in addition 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.629
 the addition with the negation of peace in 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.000
 p1 who has it literally first of my 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.739
 first clause is the rue de la 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.040
 resolution says that I can take these 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.590
 two clauses here here and the from 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.680
 expands generating a clause that is going 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.669
 call a clause resolving you who is going 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.319
 to contain p2 until peace is only a 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.019
 until you like it so that's going to be the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.819
 disjunction of all of these literal 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.329
 so has all the other theroux who 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.359
 involves pop and finally offered to 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.629
 morocco we will find the rule modus 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:53.150
 we have seen previously in a 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:57.579
 other capsule because we can take 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:03.919
 so cursed though said let's lose f1 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:05.239
 implies f2 and f2 can be combined 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.299
 together as claude barral for 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.169
 get like no forgiveness proof of f1 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.879
 so f1 involved two and f1 can be 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:17.120
 combined together to get the butt 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.590
 sales halls f2 so if these words 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.019
 available it is we have seen 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.940
 previously pointed out that f 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.560
 involved two in normal form 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.550
 connective c 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 the negation of f1 or f2 but if we 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.100
 rent ff since we have f 1 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.580
 finally we see that we are the negation of 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.370
 f1 then f1 so we can get like 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.090
 close solving all the others 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.970
 coasts in my my first clause 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.520
 here my second here my other words c 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.320
 montayral cf2 here I have no other 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.290
 so what I get is well and truly 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.330
 f2 so me having already made a case 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.750
 particular of the queen of resolution 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:04.190
 in the propositional kop and 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.620
 now we are ready to move to 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.750
 resolution rule but when we have 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.150
 more general predicates with 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.550
 variables so clauses that were 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.440
 obtained from logic formulas of 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.770
 first order with magic no one has 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.280
 two clauses compares then combined 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.860
 so a cause first clause she 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.900
 contains the predicates l1 to l 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.919
 aisne then a clause m that counted 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.640
 as predicted that m 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.630
 1 until mn so now let's imagine 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.330
 Also, I can find myself 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.310
 literal is so the case of the father who 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.870
 is part of then until the groin one 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.060
 other literal m 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.479
 helm which is part of the m1 up 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:48.470
 same who are such that I can 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:52.419
 find a teta unifier or a 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:58.160
 substitution does so between unifying 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:00.650
 between them what is the negation of m 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.289
 so a head-to-tail substitution if I 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.240
 payroll applies is it case where is the 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.590
 negation of mails I get the same 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.160
 thing so can I am able 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.570
 to unify lk and the negation of mm so 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.270
 if I am able to find a pair 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.229
 like that but I can get the 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.830
 closerie jauldes sale from the east 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.110
 of m 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.370
 which will match one more time two 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.380
 parts first is l1 up to l 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.360
 groin but without alcohol 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.250
 so they have up to the horizon 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.000
 and then she as more healthy 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.710
 to the groin so that's my first 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.090
 part my second part that goes 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.270
 invoke m 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.990
 1 to mn but 100 m 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:48.320
 so she m1 up to m / m -1 and then 1 is 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:52.520
 the most unfair knn pardon m 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.110
 mb yes and so kind a new clause 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.960
 who will be the disjunction of all and 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.910
 liteo there but it's going to be the breeding ground where 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.370
 I will apply to each of his 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.080
 lateral mass substitution gold in 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.130
 did my clause that counted all that is 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.440
 she and all and m 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.880
 I'm going to apply the substitution to 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.380
 this clause so I'm going to apply the 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:14.000
 solution to each each of the littorals 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.190
 so that's the rule the definition of 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.220
 the general rule to get from 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.979
 of two clauses a clause solving you 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.200
 we look at example if I have two 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:28.490
 parent clauses she who would be the 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.850
 negation of mourning x or animal x that a 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:35.660
 other transparent that would be a big 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:39.310
 arm that would even I call m which 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.510
 is the negation of Greek animal or dy 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:45.650
 so in the intention that had in 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:47.419
 rise it would be she a ca would l2 that 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:52.010
 it would be m 1 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:53.690
 it would be a lot like a clause 

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:58.220
 solving that I can get from 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:08:00.590
 of that these masks x or size x and that 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.639
 it's because I notice it's the 

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:07.400
 drug negation 

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:10.870
 x ah no sorry i the animal g x here and 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:15.169
 I have the animal negation and pure play 

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:18.830
 unified animal x with the negation of the 

00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:20.960
 negation of an animal and therefore animal y I 

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.240
 can unify them using the upg y 

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.490
 equal x so I just want to take it there 

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.479
 replace by x I get on the 

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:31.250
 negation of an animal y then I apply 

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:33.860
 parents the denial of negation of a 

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.930
 animal is there that I apply suspicion 

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.839
 there is gallix I really get a 

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:41.029
 animal x and so that means that I 

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:44.420
 can take the other coasts so 

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:46.730
 in this case l1 and mm 

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.950
 put them in my clause solving then 

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.820
 apply my ip so i have to 

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:54.210
 replace y with x 

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.250
 so die y among others will become taïx 

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.750
 in my clause resolving then the 

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.180
 drug negation and that transpires 

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.950
 an allegation of doc and so this is a 

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.750
 reservation clause that I can get a 

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:08.340
 combine l &amp; m here in my example 

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.770
 notice that two parent clauses 

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:15.600
 may have multiple clauses 

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:17.340
 solving according to the choice of my 

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.700
 literal she copy m 

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:24.260
 it happened sometimes two from the 

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:31.590
 same pair of klose parents to get 

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:34.080
 more of a sales clause then the 

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.120
 resolution rule as it is 

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.040
 described until now is correct 

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.410
 so we always get expressions 

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.970
 which are logically drift abl of our 

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.660
 knowledge base but finally is 

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.930
 not complete 

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:51.000
 some clauses that would not happen 

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:52.560
 to prove and against to get a 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.850
 resolution rule or proof of 

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.030
 resolution that completes 

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:59.850
 we have to get what we call 

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:03.180
 must use factorization the 

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:07.740
 factoring that corresponds to learning 

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:10.560
 so if we have two lives potting that in 

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.060
 the same klose have an ip a rpg so we 

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.640
 is capable of a bride in bars 

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.670
 of the opg do a factorization that's 

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.140
 actually replaced literal apart from the 

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.750
 result of their unification 

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.540
 so we're a factor that's the result 

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:29.310
 of this transformation there then see 

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:35.880
 for example if I have my closed the clause 

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:36.830
 next so that of z or p2 x or pdf of 

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.940
 there 

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:42.060
 well in fact i can get like 

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.070
 factor that second country of f2i is 

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:48.000
 noticed that I am able to unify p 

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:51.060
 2 x with pdf of y to a substitute for 

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.310
 experts fbi y so would have happened to 

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.200
 me to take this clause lopy of 

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.760
 generate a new clause that will be a 

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.570
 factor that's called a factor that 

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.670
 would be that aids or pdf of it is 

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.060
 so to get a rule of 

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.370
 resolution that 

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.500
 complete and be able to prove 

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.770
 all that is logically shores 

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.210
 from my knowledge base 

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.520
 I have to allow myself to do 

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.920
 this update the needs is either 

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.440
 before or after applying the rule 

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.310
 resolution to generate 

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.070
 new clauses 

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:26.230
 so that's more in my research 

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.970
 when I combine I make the choice of 

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.860
 claude that I combine years said of 

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.910
 resolutions can give new 

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:35.680
 clauses to eventually arrive at the 

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.180
 the plain clause of the empty clause but in 

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.850
 more of that I can do some 

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.470
 factorization to the needs from a 

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:46.120
 clause to get his factor that has 

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:48.460
 added based on knowledge you 

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.010
 see example start with a 

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.810
 example imagine that I have the fact that 

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.090
 all dogs are animals to 

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.500
 first-order logic we could 

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.330
 first rank after a crisis like for 

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.030
 any geek this jogging get involved animal 

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.210
 x also imagine that I have that all 

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:06.040
 animals will die so for all there 

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.720
 animal implies to go there a logical 

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.840
 of the first role but I also note 

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.880
 that I come to fido who so is a 

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.440
 dog with the logic of first hours 

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.720
 recreation like the price of the dog code 

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.000
 and fido but your house that I want and 

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:23.170
 prove that fido are going to die 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.140
 eventually and so to do that I 

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:30.430
 have to prove that die fido and 

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.900
 deliverables from my three daughters 

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.020
 to the first order logic that I have 

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.020
 right here 

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.260
 so to make his family's formula 

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.820
 my knowledge base here I take 

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.070
 the denial of what I'm trying to 

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.880
 prove to know that the negation that 

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.710
 fido will die so the denial of david 

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.510
 o I put fire in normal shape 

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:57.970
 connective so with a little practice 

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.710
 we quickly see then that all these 

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.990
 formulas also can translate into 

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.220
 form in my conjunctiva under this 

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.820
 form there so I leave myself as 

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:10.150
 exercise do it from everyone and we're going 

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:12.640
 start our proof by resolution in 

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.230
 combining departure of Klose together for 

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.040
 try to come to clause 8 

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.280
 first thing I could do 

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:23.360
 it's taking clause 1 and 2 here and 

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.940
 here is applied the rule of resolution 

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:31.120
 using the upg and that's gary gray 

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:34.820
 so actually I have in an animal 

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.800
 xj6 the negation of mid-animal friends 

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:39.860
 I can resume the negation of his 

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:43.060
 and combine it with animal x unify it 

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:45.680
 with the Greek upg requirement so I get 

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:50.090
 as close before the denial of 

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.550
 john y or day y so its dogmas there because 

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:56.690
 that I take x more load by y 

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:59.150
 exfo was substituted by y is i have a 

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:02.120
 fifth clause in my base of 

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:04.400
 knowledge that I can combine with 

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:08.630
 cats here to bring me closer to their 

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:10.520
 empty clauses to this is precisely I can 

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.520
 take my clause my new clause has 

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:20.210
 combine it with clause 3 by doing 

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:23.660
 unification also like that because 

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:25.760
 that in 3 g fido dogts that I can 

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.940
 unified with negation of negation 

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.310
 of 2 gears is that when changing Greek 

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:34.670
 by fido actually these charges there by 

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:36.740
 fido I stop unfaithful mastiffs if I'll have 

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.080
 two negations that would give me mastiffs 

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.930
 fido that would be unified with videos 

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.240
 here is what's left is dailly 

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:48.080
 Greek where I apply the substitution y 

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:51.290
 equal fido devotes daifi water and 

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:54.700
 finally I could combine 6 with 4 

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:57.140
 then apply the rule resolution i 

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.840
 now scoci i have exactly 

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.240
 so I have negation of die fido that I 

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.880
 can confirm that I can combine with 

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.040
 die fido with the arrival of resolution 

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.640
 since I am doing the negation of die fido 

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:13.820
 I get in the videos here 

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:17.660
 there is more a4 and a6 pardon 

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.530
 of literals a4 and a6 so the clause 

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:23.090
 resulting 

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:26.910
 this is the empty set and so I 

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:30.150
 well and truly demonstrated that especially the 

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:33.260
 the empty clause that die fido and is 

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:36.360
 derived abl logically from 

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:42.050
 September there so I demonstrated that fido 

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:45.300
 are going to die are an example can more 

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:49.860
 complete it's once again our 

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:55.290
 example based on rome so here we want 

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:56.460
 demonstrate that marcus to Caesar the first 

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.590
 what we do is we take 

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.960
 all of our facts they've filed down 

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:03.030
 conjunctive format we did it 

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.900
 previously no I will not do them here I 

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.180
 just want to show 

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.010
 oh no sorry when just done 

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:12.150
 here is taking the whole different 

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:16.500
 natural language for omitted a logical 

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:18.510
 first order and the logic of the 

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.450
 first order also proved that 

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:26.970
 marcus to seize it is proved the 

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:28.230
 predicate hai marcus 16 years so when 

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.520
 I did here is that I passed 

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.350
 directly to the normal form 

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.380
 connective that has been demonstrated in a 

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:36.510
 previous capsule 

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.430
 and when one has to do is add 

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:41.010
 the clauses of the negation of 

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.690
 the approved expression namely to ymare 

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.790
 that Caesar so I add his negation 

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:47.700
 ie the negation of highmark 16 

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.350
 years and negation of mercus lines Caesar 

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.420
 in close normal conjunctive it is 

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.190
 exactly the same thing so we are 

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.350
 singer not too much work to do 

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.000
 then the rest of the clauses here is the 

00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:00.410
 clauses in conjunctive normal form the 

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.410
 derivative contract and previously 

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:07.920
 so let's do another meal resolution 

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:11.010
 so first thing we could 

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.380
 do is take 2 and 3 and help 

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.780
 the handsets in sum with the rule of 

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.990
 resolution we see that with the upg etc 

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:23.220
 without equal marcus we are able 

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:25.470
 to unify to unify pump and a marcus 

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.320
 with the negation of the negation of 

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.670
 pumping an accent that gives us the 

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.880
 time closery that only contains 

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:35.190
 Roman ex years to which we apply our 

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.540
 substitution etc are equal marcus so 

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.540
 it gives roman marcus 

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:43.929
 then from that I can take 10 and then the 

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:49.539
 combined with 6 so I notice jérôme 

00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:51.820
 and marcus here then in 6 jerome an ex 

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:55.659
 cat with a negation the front so I 

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:57.789
 should be able to get it there 

00:17:55.659 --> 00:18:01.120
 Just that juni firmin ex cat with 

00:17:57.789 --> 00:18:03.519
 roman marcus not replaced x4 by 

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.070
 marcus and so I can add the clause 

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:10.269
 which contains the other coasts of the 

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:11.590
 clause 6g no doubt the summer road to the 

00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:13.419
 clause say so that's only the 

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.730
 potting soil of croatia what will do 

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:18.999
 part of the clause results so I 

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.860
 the loyal obtains marcus caesar or hi hi 

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:22.749
 Marcus Caesar and that's because and what 

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:26.110
 cap once again the result clause 

00:18:22.749 --> 00:18:28.840
 must replace by marcus because of my 

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:33.279
 super g here allowed me to apply husband 

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:36.490
 of resolution I could take 11 and 

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:40.960
 combined with nine we notice in nine 

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:44.110
 I also got fed up that Caesar I'm going 

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:48.340
 no need to do substitution 

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.919
 allows me to get loyal marxisant on 

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:53.110
 the self I can take 12 

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:55.320
 combined with 7 12 which my new clause 

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.909
 that I can combine with this here 

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.950
 actually I notice a loyal here 

00:18:57.909 --> 00:19:03.269
 with a negation forward so in 

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:08.289
 charge in substance bloodless by marcus 

00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:09.700
 then exercise by Caesar I am able 

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:12.279
 to obtain as resulting close 

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.379
 the set of other literals here in 

00:19:12.279 --> 00:19:16.570
 this house where I replace bloodless by 

00:19:14.379 --> 00:19:18.700
 marcus and ixis by Caesar so it's me 

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.769
 gives negation people marcus or a 

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.999
 negation caesar leaders or a 

00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:27.639
 negation of murder marcus season 

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:30.970
 then I can take 13 and then combined 

00:19:27.639 --> 00:19:34.539
 with 8 so in eight days mark that 

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.490
 I murdered ancient Caesar marcus and 

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:38.230
 here I have the negation of murder marcus 

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.149
 16 years old I can apply 

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.190
 stopping the resolutions I have not 

00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:44.950
 will substitute negation of 

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:48.279
 marcus or negation leaders 16 years by 

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:51.100
 a negation people marcus negation 

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:53.210
 Caesar leaders 

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.910
 then of self I can take my 

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.640
 new clause 14 combine it with 4.4 

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.710
 ranking leaders Caesar I have soul 

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.200
 denial of Caesar people so I get 

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:06.440
 as close resulting negation people 

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:10.820
 marcus and finally negation people 

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:13.400
 Marcus I can combine that with worried 

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.180
 people marcuse to finally get the 

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.390
 empty clause 

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:20.050
 so i have to demonstrate that marcus to y 

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.050
 grab 

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:29.120
 in addition to proving that f2 is 

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.900
 a logical consequence of a set of 

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.510
 tf1 formulas 

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.220
 we can also exploit the trace of 

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.960
 evidence process to find this is 

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.770
 what values ​​of variables that me 

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:42.770
 allow to deduce f2 from f1 

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:45.410
 is what we actually do that's all 

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:47.270
 to simply wave a predicate that we're going 

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.940
 that we decided to call rep for 

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:52.100
 response with the variables that are 

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:55.040
 involved in the clauses of the 

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.490
 denial of f2 and we have more than the 

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.320
 evidence 

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.420
 then we apply the evidence by 

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.220
 resolution that one stops when one has a 

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.530
 clause that rather than obvious contains 

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.640
 only the predicate or the literal 

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.610
 dir 

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:10.850
 so let's see an example again 

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:12.980
 with our example of Rome so 

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:17.990
 imagine that if we want to know 

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:21.320
 who is here in gold in this case if 

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:22.640
 our ninth clause that we have here 

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.580
 will add we said it's true like 

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.950
 follows the lacrosse one would like to prove in 

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:32.660
 is that there is an x ​​such that at 

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:34.250
 ix of Caesar is true his negation so we 

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.570
 must introduce the negation of the 

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:39.680
 denial of existence 

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:44.060
 exciser hays it's for all x the 

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:50.600
 negation of surpluses after that 

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:53.830
 after ardizas sion so after having 

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:57.980
 put this conjunctive format what we 

00:21:53.830 --> 00:22:02.030
 would get it's the negation of hays 

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:04.070
 etc. this season and finally we're going 

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.720
 add 

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:08.850
 in the clause we will add 

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.260
 response with the variables that is found 

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.560
 in the clause when 6th only 

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:18.030
 accept and so we did 

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:22.740
 except negation of hai exceeds 6 years or 

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:24.390
 answer except so now we're going 

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:27.320
 to prove by resolution 

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:29.760
 from this set of clauses there 

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.860
 so I'm going to go a little bit more 

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.990
 quickly since the proof is felt 

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:37.230
 I can combine two with 3 for 

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:39.330
 get roman marcus again I 

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:42.290
 can combine 10 with six to get 

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:45.810
 loyal marcus Caesar or haï mercus 16 years 

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:49.100
 I can combine an eleven with 9 for 

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:52.730
 get loyal marcus caesar or answer 

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.470
 marcus so noticed that now 

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:57.750
 by combining with nine games comes 

00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:02.550
 to introduce in my proof the predicate 

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:06.420
 answer with x 7 x is here was was 

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:08.790
 substituted by marcus so we see that at 

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:12.930
 the end we'll know that the hic this 

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:17.310
 that allowed me to unify the hated the 

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:19.790
 Russia it was the value of x so me 

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:23.040
 allowing a unification it was 

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:25.020
 marcus here we will drag that until the 

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.990
 end of proof 

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:33.720
 so from 12 if I combine with 

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:35.460
 sep i can get the clause here very 

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.710
 little to combine with 8 to get a 

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.750
 new clause that I can combine 

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.700
 with 4 to hold a clause a little more 

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.220
 short and finally that I can 

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.140
 combine with one to get a clause 

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.800
 which only contains the so-called core price 

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:51.930
 answer is my proof is over so 

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.510
 I have shown that someone who is 

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.510
 Caesar and this person is marcus
