This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the BuyPower Card from Capital One.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.630
Every purchase brings you closer to a new
Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac vehicle.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.580
What makes someone a risk-taker?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.410
And is it embedded in our personalities - or
is something we can change over time?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.570
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I gotta
say, it’s pretty amazing just how different

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.320
and complex people can be.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.720
When we think about someone’s personality,
for example we’re usually evaluating them

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.570
on a scale of certain aspects: humor, compassion,
outgoingness - but what about adventurousness?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.280
What is it about our biology, that makes some
of us risk takers - and some of us not?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.570
It turns out, like most things in life - the
answer isn’t black or white.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.870
It’s more like, a rainbow of colors that
are constantly changing, for each new phase

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.870
of life we enter.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.390
In reality, everyone has different reasons
for why they choose to take risks - so people

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.710
who are cautious in some areas, may actually
embrace taking risks in others.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.199
Elke Weber is a psychologist and business
professor at Columbia University, who developed

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.450
the "domain-specific risk propensity" model.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.290
It theorizes that everyone has a unique risk
propensity, spread out among five categories:

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.829
financial, health/safety, recreational, ethical,
and social.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.409
And your willingness to take risks, she says,
can vary widely from one category to the next.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.799
It’s the gender divide, though, that really
explains the underlying reason for risk-taking.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.279
Obviously there are exceptions, but generally
speaking, men tend to take more risks than

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.969
women - and especially financial and recreational
risks.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.399
It harkens back to a “culture of honor,”
where men feel like they need to defend themselves

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.119
and assert their masculinity, in order to
protect their honor.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.419
And taking risks, is a big part of that.

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:51.579
But according to Andreas Wilke, an expert
on risk-taking and decision-making, there’s

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.489
also a sexual aspect to it.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.880
Because men have more intra-sexual competition
than women do for sex, they feel the need

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.359
to advertise their sexual fitness through
daring exploits.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.829
So “if you compare the behavior of a single
adolescent male,” he says, “with his behavior

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.060
when women are watching, you can see how the
risk increases.”

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.459
Sure enough, people - and especially men - tend
to become less risk-seeking as they get older,

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.120
and as they enter into stable relationships.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.930
But that’s not to say that women aren’t
risk-takers either.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.480
In fact, studies have consistently shown that
women tend to take more social risks than

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480
men.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.159
Things like moving to a new city, wearing
unconventional clothes, changing careers later

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.500
in life, or expressing unpopular opinions
during a business meeting.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.860
What’s especially interesting, is other
research showing that experiencing discrimination

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.489
or rejection leads people to take more chances.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.159
So if women feel as though they’re operating
under a patriarchal society, it makes sense

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.969
that they might take even more social risks,
as a way of tacitly fighting back.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.969
Of course, out of all the risks you should
take - financial ones probably aren’t the

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:51.969
best idea.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:52.969
