00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.580
And just wrapping things up here, I want to cover a few of

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.700
the other special selections besides .enter using a Venn Diagram that

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.210
Mike Bostock uses in his great blog post, Thinking with Joins.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.630
We can think of these circles and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.870
their overlap representing the state of things right after our

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.190
data bind when we're considering what type of special selection to make.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.260
The left circle here, shown in blue, represents our data file.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.720
In this case data.tsv.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.590
And the red circle here represents our HTML page or

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.440
SVG elements on that page indexed.html.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.730
And the intersection between these two represents the HTML elements

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.770
currently on our page that have already been bound to and associated with

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.300
a row from our data file in the previous join made with .data.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.600
And knowing what I've mentioned about the .enter selection,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.790
everything in this blue corresponds to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.270
all the rows of our data that are not yet present on our webpage.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.950
Which we will then add elements to a webpage for each one.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.430
The purple can be thought of as the update selection.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.060
And while there's not an explicit .update we need to call,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.950
this section simple corresponds to elements already on our page from our

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.260
prior selection to the data bind, which you might update their data values, or

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.893
their styling implicitly by leaving out a .enter or .exit selection.
