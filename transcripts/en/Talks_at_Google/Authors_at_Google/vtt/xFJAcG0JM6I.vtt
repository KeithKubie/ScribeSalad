MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.010
Welcome to another installment
of "Leading at Google." Today,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.440
I'm proud to introduce Gautam
Mukunda, who is an assistant

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.079
professor at the Harvard
Business School.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.320
He received his PhD from MIT in
political science and an AB

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.880
in government from Harvard.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.650
Before graduate school, he was
a consultant at McKinsey,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.860
where he focused on the
pharmaceutical sector.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.310
His research focused on
leadership, international

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.880
relations, the social and
political implications of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.210
technology change.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.370
Today, he'll be talking about
his new book, "Indispensable,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.440
When Leaders Really Matter,"
which you can get in the back

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.560
for a very Googly price.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.810
Please welcome Gautam Mukunda.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.670
GAUTAM MUKUNDA: Well,
good afternoon, I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.560
guess, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.930
It's a real pleasure
to be here.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.950
So thank you very much
for inviting me.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.290
I'm lucky I have one good
friend in the audience.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.150
And I hope I'll have more by
the time this talk is over.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.160
So as Alex told you, my name
is Gautam Mukunda.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.890
The name of my book, which
just came out--

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.590
we have a problem with the mic?

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.720
No.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.750
--just came out last month, is
"Indispensable, When Leaders

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.690
Really Matter." And so I always
like to start this talk

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.260
by asking people if there's
anyone on the roster up there

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.870
who they want to know who that
is, because what I discover is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.330
that every audience gets
some of the people.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.760
But so far, I've never had an
audience that gets all of the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.960
people on this set.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.210
Above Napoleon.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.900
Ah, so that's Judah Folkman,
who's a cancer researcher, who

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.770
lived in Boston and died about
four years ago, who I'm

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.230
actually going to talk
about today.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.980
He's actually one of my favorite
people in the talk--

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.210
really, really remarkable
human being.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.200
One of the few people I've
profiled who I actually met

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.480
just before he died.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.080
Anyone else?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.390
Who are the two guys between
Welch and Churchill?

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.160
Between Churchill--

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.150
oh, and Jack Welch.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.420
OK, so that's Jamie Dimon, who
is the CEO of JP Morgan Chase,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.550
probably the most powerful man
in the financial world who

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.190
doesn't work for a government.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.630
And that is Sir Jackie Fisher,
who was a British admiral who

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.560
completely revolutionized
naval warfare.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.430
He, actually, is also profiled
in the book.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.400
And Fisher is the most famous
admiral to have never fought

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.930
or won a battle.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.130
And he has this sort of
incredible charisma that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.040
historians fall in love with,
even though he actually never

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.850
commanded anything in battle.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.100
Let's get started.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.460
So my research in my book
is actually about a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.460
pretty simple question.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.900
And it's one that I'm pretty
confident that all of you have

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.840
thought about at least once,
probably in those classic dorm

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.350
room debating sessions.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.000
And the question is
simply this--

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.340
do individuals make
a difference?

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.170
Is it possible for a single
individual, a leader, to be in

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.010
the right place at the right
time, where the fact that that

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.140
person was there changed
the course of history?

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.270
So it was that person and not
any of the other people who

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.750
logically could have
been in that place.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.630
So when could someone
like that be in

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.720
a position of power?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.550
Under what circumstances does
a person who makes a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.390
difference, who changes history
for better or for

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.700
worse, gain power?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.860
Very good and very
bad leaders.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.790
So let me give you an example of
what I mean by just how big

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.730
individual impact
can really be.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.780
This is probably the ultimate
example, I think, in modern

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.450
history of a single individual
changing

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.000
the course of history--

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.960
Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.550
Napoleon is given his first
major command in the French

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.580
military in 1796, because
he assures the French

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.050
revolutionary government that
he has no significant

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.430
political interests.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.490
He wins a series of brilliant
victories in Italy, is

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.520
defeated in the Middle East,
returns to France, and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.470
suddenly acquires political
interest, because he

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.040
overthrows the French
government.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.220
And he becomes the undisputed
ruler of France, probably the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.520
most powerful nation in the
world, at the age of 30.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.920
In 1799, Napoleon strides France
and then Europe like a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.260
colossus and plunges the
continent and, really, the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.090
world, into 16 years
of warfare.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.250
When we think about the Second
World War, we think about

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.510
Hitler, who's sort of the single
person probably most

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.900
responsible for causing it.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.140
But we don't call the Second
World War Hitler's War.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.500
We call this entire era of
16 years the era of the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.620
Napoleonic Wars.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.640
So in 1815, Napoleon has
been defeated once.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.720
He's been exiled to the
island of Elba.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.110
And then he returns.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.810
And he lands in Southern
France.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.019
And the general of the French
armies, who actually was one

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.300
of Napoleon's former
subordinates, promises that he

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.250
will capture Napoleon and
bring him back to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.020
Paris in an iron cage.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.360
So he goes down to the front
with his troops.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.380
And they meet Napoleon.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.430
And Napoleon walks up to the
soldiers-- one of the most

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.060
dramatic moments you can
imagine, right?--

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.270
and he puts his chest against
their bayonets.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.040
And he says, "Soldiers of
France, I am here." And they

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.270
throw their weapons down and put
him up on their shoulders

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.760
and carry him in triumph back
to Paris, where he promptly

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.870
takes over the French government
once again.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.270
And so then this news arrives
at the Congress of Vienna,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.960
which was actually meeting in
the Netherlands at the time.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.320
And the news arrives
at the Congress.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.100
The Congress has met to
determine what Europe will

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.790
look like with the end of
the Napoleonic Wars.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.650
So meeting in this conference
for the first time ever in the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.740
same place is the head of the
British government, the czar

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.680
of Russia, the emperor
of Austria,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.150
and the king of Prussia--

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.910
four of the five most powerful
people in the world all

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.830
meeting at the same time.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.210
And when the news arrives that
Napoleon has retaken Europe,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.650
the czar of Russia, the absolute
ruler of the largest

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.000
nation in the world, turns to
the Duke of Wellington, the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.120
British soldier who's proven
himself to be the only

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.690
commander who can meet
Napoleonic generals on even

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.870
terms and win, and says to him,
"My Lord Duke, only you

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.160
can save Europe."

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.220
And then the Congress
declares war.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.130
Austria, Prussia, Russia, and
Great Britain declare war, but

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.710
not on France.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.620
They declare war on
Napoleon, by name.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.510
Four countries versus
one person.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.370
So this, to my mind, is
individual impact that's about

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.950
as large as it's possible
to imagine--

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.700
one person who completely
transforms the course of

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.790
European history.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.130
But how does someone
like that happen?

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.750
What's the circumstances where
you get something like that?

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.260
So let me step you through
my answer.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.180
I'm going to suggest to you a
theory that I call leader

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.800
filtration theory that explains
when individual

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.740
leaders who really make a
difference can take power.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.560
I'm going to give you a
statistical test to validate

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.150
that theory, some historical
examples, and talk you through

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.210
how the same theory can apply
in business, in science, and

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.770
implications for your
own types of work.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.680
So starting off with leader
filtration theory.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.110
So the funny thing about leaders
is that practitioners

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.420
and social scientists have
completely different ideas

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.160
about them.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.400
If you're in business, in
politics, in the military, if

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.140
you're a reporter, if you're a
historian, you universally

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.760
believe that you cannot
understand events unless you

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.970
understand the leaders who are
in charge of the organizations

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.300
that are doing those things.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.110
But if you're a social
scientist, social scientists

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.600
almost uniformly argue that
leaders don't matter, that who

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.670
is in charge of an organization
actually has very

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.830
little importance.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.680
And this is probably the single
largest gap between

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.760
academics who study
organizations

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.200
and everyone else.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.770
So why?

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.630
Why do political scientists,
management theorists,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.400
economists, why do they all
say leaders don't matter?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.720
And they have three reasons.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.970
And they're three very
powerful reasons.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.200
The first one is this idea that
every organization has

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.150
external constraints.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.120
You guys know this, although
maybe Google knows this less

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.600
well than almost any
other organization.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.390
It's the idea that you cannot
do whatever you want freely,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.320
because your competitors
will counteract you.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.430
You can't set your prices at
whatever level you want,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.220
because your competitors
will undercut you.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.720
Internal constraints.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.180
A leader can't do anything he
or she wants, even if the

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.280
external environment won't
stop them, because every

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.790
organization has politics,
every organization has

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.530
interests, every organization
has groups inside it that will

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.840
push back against certain
initiatives.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.430
But we can all think of examples
where that's not

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.840
true, where those two forces
aren't that important.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.330
So it's the third one that
really does the work.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.590
The idea is that leaders are
almost always chosen.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.830
Leaders of important
organizations, large and

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.190
powerful organizations,
are selected through

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.800
some sort of a process.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.680
So the ideal example of this is
General Electric, sort of a

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.390
classic American corporation.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.325
There are more shares of General
Electric outstanding

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:16.720
than for any other corporation
in the United States.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.780
Been successful for 100 years.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.370
And the way GE chooses its
managers, it doesn't hire

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.670
anyone from outside.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.050
They work their way up the
ranks of GE for 20 years.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.520
And at the end of the day,
you've got five finalists, and

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.760
GE picks one of those.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.870
So if you think about that
process of constant, repeated

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.460
evaluation over decades, what I
say is that , when you think

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.140
about those five finalists-- and
this is the social science

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.210
theory, in general--

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.390
there are two things you should
take away from that.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.710
The first one is this idea that
all five of these people

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.960
are probably going to be
really good at the job,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.670
because if they're not, how
did they get there?

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.285
If GE was not good at picking
leaders, how could GE have

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.940
been successful for 100 years,
if it wasn't able to identify

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.640
people who would actually make
pretty good managers?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.210
But I say the second thing you
should believe about those top

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.600
five people is that it doesn't
matter which one of them get

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.310
chosen, because how different
could they possibly be?

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.740
They've all spent two decades
being evaluated by GE.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.520
And they're close enough to what
GE thinks of for what its

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.680
ideal CEO would look like
that they've made it

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.520
to the final five.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.600
So it probably doesn't matter
this much which one you pick.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.630
So this is what I mean
by leader impact.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.440
It's the counterfactual.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.530
You take the person who did
become the leader, and you

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.260
compare him or her to the person
who might have become

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.180
the leader.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.290
The most plausible alternatives
and the impact is

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.790
the marginal difference between
what did happen and

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.290
what could have happened, what
most likely would have

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.700
happened if this alternative
person had been chosen.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.860
And this, to me, means
that impact is

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.290
high risk, high reward.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.570
If we're defining impact as
someone has an individual

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.130
impact when they do something
that almost anyone else in the

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.310
same situation would not have
done, what do we know about

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.720
those kinds of decisions?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.340
What I'd say is that we know
that they're either great--

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.320
you do something that all the
experts tell you is a bad

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.790
idea, and it turns out
you were right.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.470
And we look back and say, wow,
that person's a genius.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.830
That's a remarkable
achievement.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.930
But most of the time, if you
do something and all the

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.050
experts tell you that's
not a good idea,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.350
well, they're right.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.070
That's what makes you
an expert, right?

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.330
So the worst decisions are
equally the ones where a

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.030
leader of an organization says,
we're going to do this,

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.850
and everybody says, well,
that's a bad idea.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.720
And it was a bad idea,
and it's disastrous.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.190
So leader impact isn't just
a positive thing.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.140
This is the idea that leader
impact can be great,

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.000
or it can be awful.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.110
So how do we think through about
when you get a leader

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.100
who really does make a
difference, who does have that

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.210
kind of impact?

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.220
See, it's most organizations,
especially big ones, have a

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.680
pool of people who might
someday get to the top.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.920
I call this the candidate
pool.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.860
And you almost think of it like
everybody in the company.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.610
Over time, these people
are evaluated.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.900
They're filtered.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.160
They're exposed to what I call
the leader filtration process.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.020
And this process is evaluating
these people and saying, is

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.120
this person what we're
looking for?

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.300
If he or she is not, then they
get pushed out of contention

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.800
for running the company
or the country.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.720
And if you look at the recent
primaries for the United

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.640
States presidential nomination,
this, I think, is

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.400
actually a pretty good summary
of what happens.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.860
If you looked at the Republican
primaries, where

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.410
they were trying to choose
a nominee, they

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.490
weren't picking a winner.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.540
They were picking losers--

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.950
you drop out, then you drop
out, then you drop out.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.290
And there's one person left
standing who passes through

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.550
all the filters.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.800
So this process determines
who is going to leave the

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.250
organization.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.730
And it combines both random
and non-random elements.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.880
So what I mean by that is
non-random elements are things

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.540
that tell you what this person
will actually do if you give

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.530
them power, how smart they are,
how good a manager they

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.980
are, what their beliefs are, are
they risk takers, are they

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.820
conservative, all these things
that we really, really care

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.840
about when we think about, are
we going to give this person a

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.120
position of authority.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.100
But there are also random
elements, things that have

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.810
absolutely no impact on what the
person is going to do, but

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.850
that still play a big role in
determining whether they're

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.070
going to get the job or not.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.170
A classic one of these
is height.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.140
Fortune 500 CEOs are
almost always tall.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.480
They're almost always
over six feet tall,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.970
almost universally so.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.280
No one thinks that height
makes you a

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.530
better manager, right?

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.250
No one thinks that, gee, only
someone who's over six feet

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.410
tall should be the CEO of
a Fortune 500 company.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.330
But somehow, these companies
always end up picking the

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.010
people who are six feet tall.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.860
So height is a classical
random factor.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.390
But you can think of any number
of others that have the

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.360
same effect, right?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.370
So this process, over
time, homogenizes

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.850
the candidate pool.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.290
It makes the people who, as they
survive the filter, look

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.560
more and more similar.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.660
But because it's random, there's
a random element, they

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.720
don't get identical.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.100
They just get more and more
similar, where people have

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.120
different probabilities of
passing through the process

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.250
based on the non-random
elements.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.520
The non-random elements
are the ones that

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.920
tell you your odds.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.030
But there's a mixture.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.530
So over time, you can think of
the pool as being divided into

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.000
two groups.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.710
I call the first
of them modals.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.370
They're people who have a good
chance of being chosen.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.000
They are a close fit for what
the process is actually

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.670
looking for, which might be
intelligence, it might be

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.700
managerial ability, it
might be height.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.230
Whatever it is, they're
a close fit.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.470
And then there are the people
I call the extremes, the

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.740
people who aren't
like the modal.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.810
The random elements are
shuffling them back into the

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.245
mix, because they keep
having an effect.

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:34.330
And what I'd say is that the
modals are all similar.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.430
That's what it means
to be at the mode.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.620
The extremes probably have
nothing in common, except for

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.640
the fact that they're
not like the mode.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.880
They're different.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.430
That's the key.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.510
They're just different.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:51.260
So the process over time, you
get relatively fewer extremes.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.600
You go through, and eventually,
you pick a winner.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.740
Could be a mode, could
be at the extreme.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.230
And if you want to know if
someone is going to have a

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.420
high impact, what you want to
know is, which one are they?

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.150
It's that simple.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.010
You want to know which
one they are.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.110
So how do you know?

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.350
I'd say that the way we think
about that is go back to this

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.770
idea of filtration.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.590
The more thoroughly someone has
been filtered once they've

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.280
won, before they won, the more
thoroughly they were

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.090
evaluated, the smaller the
likelihood is that he or she

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.080
was actually an extreme.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.050
You're a likely modal if you've
had a long career

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.800
inside the organization, you've
been evaluated for a

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.150
long time, you're frequently
evaluated, no major failures,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.120
within an old and established
corporation-- that's why I

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.500
always pick GE, it's the perfect
example for this--

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.730
from a large pool of candidates,
because there's a

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.590
lot of people to
choose between.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.355
Unfiltered leaders are just
the mirror image of that.

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:44.110
It's that simple.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.880
They're the flip side, the
people who haven't been

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.930
evaluated, who haven't been
inspected, who've somehow come

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.130
in from the outside, people whom
you just don't know all

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.410
that much about, about what
they're going to do before you

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.660
put them in charge.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.620
And then, of course, once you
put them in charge, they're

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.680
affected by these same two
ideas, that the power of force

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.150
one that constructs them from
the outside and the power of

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.380
force two that constructs
them from the inside.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.380
But sometimes, they can still
make a difference.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.870
So that gives me
two predictions

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.330
about unfiltered leaders.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.800
The first one is that they
deviate from the norm, and

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.050
they do what others
would not do.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.710
So their performance is going
to vary more, do either very

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.430
well or very poorly.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.770
And the second one is that
they'll have a high impact,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.530
they'll do things that
are different.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.330
So we can test the first one
statistically and the second

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.680
one historically.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.050
That's how we go through
the metrics.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.500
What does the statistical
test look like?

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.310
This is a rough test.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.210
But it's designed to be just
indicative, largely because of

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.780
the importance of the
historical test.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.260
So what I looked at was
presidents of the United

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.490
States, something that's
obviously very relevant now,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.240
in late October in 2012.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.740
Historians have ranked
presidents of the United

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.670
States, every president of the
United States, about 13 times

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.100
over the last 60 years.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.940
So every four years, not by
coincidence, they go through

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.460
this exercise of looking at the
presidents and saying, who

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.750
did really well and who
did really poorly?

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.140
Now, the striking thing about
these rankings is they've been

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.090
done many times by many
different groups of

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.630
historians, who've been asked
many different questions about

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.340
how should you rank the
presidents, by what criteria,

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.650
by what categories, and the end
result is always the same.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.220
The rankings always come out to
be basically the same from

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.520
person to person to person.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.730
This, when you think about it,
is not that surprising.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.540
Pretty much everyone agrees
that Abraham Lincoln and

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.890
George Washington should
be at the top.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.540
And most people agree that
Franklin Roosevelt should be

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.170
at the top.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.310
And just about everyone agrees
that James Buchanan should be

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.910
at the bottom.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.390
There's not a lot of debate
about these things.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.855
Once you stretch the time period
out for a long period

00:16:39.855 --> 00:16:42.480
and we look back in history,
yeah, Abraham Lincoln saves

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.380
the country, he probably
did well.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.850
And by the way, the only major
change in that over the last

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.500
60 years is Dwight Eisenhower.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.210
Eisenhower shoots up the
rankings over time.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.000
As we get to know more and
more about what happened

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.270
inside the Eisenhower
administration, our view of

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.870
that administration changes
completely over time.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.430
So these rankings have been used
by psychologists before

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.109
as a way of testing theories
about leadership.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.440
And the idea here is the
prediction is simple.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.990
If you take all those rankings
and average them out--

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.530
though you really don't have
to do that, because they're

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.230
always basically the same--

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.390
the unfiltered leaders should
be at the top and the bottom

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.619
of the rankings,
disproportionately.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:18.869
It's that simple.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.589
So how do we pick whether a
president is filtered or

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:24.579
unfiltered?

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.099
What I say is go back to this
idea of evaluation and think

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.890
about how you evaluate
someone before

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.015
you make them president.

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:33.630
What I've said is that, look,
being sheriff of a small town

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.980
doesn't tell you a lot
about what this

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.020
person is going to do.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.070
What we want to know is
positions in national

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.340
political office, positions
where the political elites,

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.920
the people who really know, as
much as anyone can, what it's

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.160
like to be president, get to
see you and see, OK, how do

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
you handle things
under pressure?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.740
What are you like when
the chips are down?

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.430
What are you like when
the cameras are off?

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.750
So when you're not showing off
for the public, how do you

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.940
really act?

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.950
How do we really get
to know someone?

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.950
You can't know someone
in a job interview.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.210
That's not possible.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.770
You can't know someone through
a reporter's filter, because

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.190
you put on a false face.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.010
We all do when we're trying
to impress people.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.320
To get to know someone, you've
got to spend time with them.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.690
And so the idea here is time
in filtering positions,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.890
national prominent positions.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.880
I use eight years in
the United States.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.900
Eight years, to my mind,
just makes sense.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.110
Two presidential terms.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.400
In most states, that's two
terms as a governor.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.710
This feels like a fairly long
span of time to get to

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.930
evaluate someone and know what
the real effects of their

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.120
decisions are.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.450
In the United States, there are
three things-- because our

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.530
political system is, by world
standards, kind of odd--

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.710
that come up that don't affect
you in other countries.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.430
The first one is vice
presidents.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.870
In the United States, you can
become vice president.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.850
If a president dies, the
president goes to the top, and

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:49.820
nobody gets a vote.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.000
You don't get to say, well,
that's an awful choice.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.280
So there's no filtering there.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.910
It just happens automatically.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.980
And we can all think of vice
presidents who've been picked

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.470
for extraordinarily random
reasons, where no one was

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.070
thinking, oh, well, gee that
might be the next president.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.970
That's who we want.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:02.660
That happens.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.790
There are two exceptions.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.340
Gerald Ford and Harry Truman
were both picked as vice

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.510
president in the sure and
certain knowledge that they

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.270
would soon be president
of the United States.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.990
But in general, that doesn't
happen very often.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.160
The second thing is, in the
19th century, the United

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.280
States had dark horse
candidates, where the

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.590
political conventions would
all get together.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.590
And there'd be lots
of candidates,

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.910
and they would deadlock.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.740
And someone would end up winning
whom no one thought

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.700
should be the nominee, who got
no votes on the first ballot.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.900
So again, I say that's not a
filtered candidate, because

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.390
clearly, people aren't looking
at this person, saying, I want

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.360
them to be president of the
United States, because nobody

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.590
was voting for them until all
the people who they really

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.990
wanted were knocked out
of the process.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.190
And the last one comes up less
in the United States, but it's

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.400
theoretically important--

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.340
this idea of family
advantages.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.300
You come from a rich and
powerful and prominent family.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.580
And the idea here is that, when
you come from that kind

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.860
of a background, every
achievement you have leading

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.390
up to the time you get to become
president is of less

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.540
informational value than those
achievements would be from

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.360
someone who doesn't have those
advantages, because it was

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.450
easier for you to get those
things than it would be for

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.400
someone else.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.720
So it looks like you've done
really impressive things.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.570
But it's harder for us to know
what they tell us about what

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.110
you are really like, the real
underlying capabilities that

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.320
we care about, because once
you are president, those

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.910
family advantages aren't going
to help you out anymore.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.600
All right, so if you look at
all the presidents of the

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.570
United States--

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.440
and I code all the ones who are
worth looking at, because

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.830
William Henry Harrison--

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.550
really, what's the point?

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.110
He was president for two
weeks before he died.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.850
We don't really care.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.860
So if you look at all of them,
what you see is a remarkable

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.750
degree of variance in the amount
of time they spent in

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.210
office filtering positions,
from Gerald Ford--

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.540
24 years--

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.410
all the way to Chester Arthur,
probably the most random of

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.380
all American presidents,
who had one year

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.820
before he became president.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.440
So there's a big,
big split here.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.810
And if you see, that's
my eight-year cutoff.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.530
So the thing about that cutoff
is it doesn't matter.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.080
If you move the cutoff to six
years, not a single data point

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.950
flips from filtered
to unfiltered.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.730
If you move it to nine years,
none of them flip.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.540
So there's just a really nice,
natural break in the data that

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.570
tells us that we really are
dealing with two populations

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.680
that seem to be pretty
distinct.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.530
So if you look at the chart, the
visual the chart, I would

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.920
say, is that this is one of
my happiest moments on the

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.060
project, when I put this
together, because the visual

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.090
is what you'd think it
would look like.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.330
You get unfiltered presidents
at the top, unfiltered

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.940
presidents at the bottom, and
not many in the middle.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.030
So statistically, what are the
odds that you would get that

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:33.560
distribution?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.950
I used the Monte Carlo
simulation to test that.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.690
And what I found out was it's
statistically significant at

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.440
the 99.97% level.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.390
Those of you who have social
science training know that in

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.480
the social sciences,
you never see--

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.800
you don't even see
99% statistical

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.680
significance, much less 99.9.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.830
And if you're curious--

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.130
I'm guessing, at Google, people
will be curious--

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.140
I'm happy to step through more
of the math on that and all

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.070
the sort of tests of rigor
and validity that I

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.930
did on top of that.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.980
But this is the simple answer
for how we did that test.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.755
All right, so let's take
a look at the history.

00:22:06.755 --> 00:22:09.080
The history, I'd say,
that's the fun part.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.480
That's where you really get
into the nitty-gritty of

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.080
what's happening here.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.330
So I'm going to take you through
two presidents of the

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.490
United States.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.460
The first one is one who's very
famous, who we all think

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.185
of as a great person and a great
president, but who, I

00:22:22.185 --> 00:22:25.870
argue, as president, actually
had a very low impact--

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.510
Thomas Jefferson.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.160
So Thomas Jefferson is about as
thoroughly filtered before

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.400
he became president as
it is possible for a

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.615
human being to be.

00:22:33.615 --> 00:22:35.650
He was a member of the
Continental Congress.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.800
He was America's envoy to France
at a time when that is

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.710
the most important diplomatic
position the United States

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.050
has, like equivalent to
Secretary of State.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.330
He was then the first
Secretary of State.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.030
He was Vice President of the
United States to John Adams.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.770
And then he became President
of the United States.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.850
He is an extended evaluation
by other political elites.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.840
He was a man of extraordinary
gifts, John Kennedy famously

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.780
quipped in front of a dinner
in honor of American Nobel

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.040
Laureates in the 1960s.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.690
He said that this is the
greatest assemblage of talent

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.740
ever to be in the White
House since Thomas

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.570
Jefferson dined alone.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.530
So very gifted man, but a
very well-evaluated one.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.870
So Thomas Jefferson's elected
president in 1800, in what is

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.560
probably the single strangest
and most confusing of all

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.380
American presidential
elections.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.980
And this is because of a mistake
the founding fathers

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.220
had made in drafting the
Constitution, where presidents

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.210
are elected by the electoral
college.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.770
And the way they did it was the
person who got the highest

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.970
number of votes came in first,
and the person who got the

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.660
second highest number of votes
came in second and became the

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.770
vice president.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.090
And they didn't differentiate
between votes for president

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.750
and vice president.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.930
So in the election of 1800,
Thomas Jefferson--

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.060
his running mate
is Aaron Burr--

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.330
Thomas Jefferson ties his
own running mate for the

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.170
presidency.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.280
This, to put it mildly,
is odd.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.710
It gets even more complicated,
because Thomas Jefferson--

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.360
remember, the person who came
in second in the electoral

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.870
college becomes the
vice president--

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.370
Thomas Jefferson was the sitting
vice president at the

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:09.100
time, running against his
own president, John

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.330
Adams, in the election.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.200
I can only imagine what those
Cabinet meetings were like.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.980
So this became an enormous
political struggle that goes

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.330
through dozens and dozens of
rounds of votes in the House

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.440
to decide the president.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.020
But at the end of the day,
Jefferson does beat, again,

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.430
his own vice presidential
nominee, Aaron Burr, and

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.610
becomes President of
the United States.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.260
And he becomes president largely
because everyone

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.710
agrees that he's the person who
deserves to be president.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.890
He is the person people thought
they were voting for

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.430
when they cast their
ballots, if not

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.800
for this fluke mischance.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.990
So I'd say that Jefferson's
the clear most probable

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.660
winner, and he is the
clear modal pick.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.550
He is the baseline.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.200
So then, who are the
alternatives?

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.510
Who else could have
been President

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.890
of the United States?

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.450
I'd say there are really
two people.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.470
The first is James Madison.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.810
James Madison was the second
most important Republican at

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.460
the time Jefferson was the head
of the Republican Party,

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.680
which is now the Democratic
Party.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.630
He was the second most
important Republican.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.350
He was the person Thomas
Jefferson actually had wanted

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.770
to run for president.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.260
Jefferson said, Madison,
I don't want to run.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:08.670
You do it.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.360
Madison said, no, you
have to do it.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.020
You have to run.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.820
And the other alternative is
John Adams, the sitting

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.180
President of the United States,
the person who might

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.190
have won the election
if things had been

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.250
a little bit different.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.700
So if we want to find out what
Jefferson's impact was, we

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.480
have to compare him to what
Madison and Adams would have

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.710
done in the same situation.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.080
So how do we do that?

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.640
So we look at Thomas
Jefferson again.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.460
So Thomas Jefferson is the
fourth ranked president in the

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.670
historian surveys.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.680
This makes him a big problem for
my theory, because how do

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.140
you have a high impact if you're
so thoroughly filtered?

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.260
How are you the top
ranked person

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.610
without having an impact?

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.460
So Jefferson is the fourth
ranked president for a really

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.380
simple reason-- the Louisiana
Purchase.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.450
If you double the size of your
country peacefully at trivial

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.750
cost, historians
say, good job.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.400
Well done.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.710
This is a great thing.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.690
So the question is, what did
Jefferson have to do with the

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.710
Louisiana Purchase?

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.090
Is he responsible for
the purchase?

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.020
Or if somebody else had
been there, would

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.310
it still have happened?

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.850
So this is the chronology.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:11.620
Jefferson sends somebody to
Paris to negotiate a purchase

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.010
of land from France, but not
the purchase of Louisiana.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.570
This person is sent to negotiate
just the purchase of

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.060
the city of New Orleans.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.070
As far as we can tell, not a
single person in the United

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.190
States ever discussed the
possibility of buying the

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.480
entire territory of Louisiana.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:34.450
This person, before he arrives
in Paris, before he even shows

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.900
up, Napoleon's foreign minister
comes to the American

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.930
ambassador who is resident at
the time and says, how would

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.650
you guys like to buy
all of Louisiana?

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.890
Unsurprisingly, the American
ambassador says, well, sure,

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.600
that sounds like a great idea.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.870
And so my argument appears
pretty simple.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.200
How can you say Jefferson was
responsible for it if his guy

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.460
hadn't even shown up yet?

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.350
So then it comes back.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.460
The news of the purchase
arrives in Boston.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.080
And this is not incredibly
controversial.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.390
When the news arrived in Boston
of the possibility of

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:13.640
the purchase, the city set off
a fireworks celebration in

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.560
order to say, what an incredible
opportunity for the

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.740
United States.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.490
It goes to a vote to
ratify the treaty.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.350
And the biggest single obstacle
of the successful

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.370
ratification of the treaty is
Thomas Jefferson, because

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.350
Jefferson believed that the
Federal government did not

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.580
have the power to get territory,
to expand territory

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.320
of the United States, and
so wanted to pass a

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.590
constitutional amendment.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.890
Napoleon, who, remember, had
overthrown the government of

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.680
France, was not exactly
sympathetic to constitutional

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.890
arguments and basically said,
look, either stop talking

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.150
about this, or I'm going to
pull out of the treaty.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.145
And so Madison went
to Jefferson and

00:27:46.145 --> 00:27:47.040
said, stop doing this.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.930
This is too important.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.820
You need to stop causing
problems.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.250
And the treaty passes,
and the United

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.640
States purchases Louisiana.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.290
So we know that Madison would
have done the same thing,

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.800
because Madison is the guy who
forced Jefferson to do what he

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.620
did to cause the treaty
successfully.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.070
If you look at John Adams,
well, John Adams

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.160
was no longer president.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.890
But he wrote in private letters
that he supported the

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.270
purchase and would
have done it.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.750
And we know that his son, John
Quincy Adams, who was a

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.250
senator at the time, crossed
party lines to vote in favor

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.920
of Jefferson's purchase on
multiple occasions, something

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.170
that's basically inconceivable
he would have done if his

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.070
father disapproved of the
purchase in the first place.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:25.400
So my argument here isn't that
Jefferson was a bad president.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.370
He clearly was a very
good president.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.640
This level of diplomatic skill
and the flexibility in the

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.350
negotiations with Congress to
get this through was a huge

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.920
asset for the country.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.840
But vice president, Secretary
of State, governor of

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.900
Virginia, ambassador
to France--

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.480
you should expect this guy
to be a good president.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.980
They spent a long time
evaluating him.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.650
How could he not be a
good president after

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.240
such a period of time?

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.590
So the argument here
isn't that he

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.600
wasn't a good president.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.450
It's that he had a low impact,
because James Madison was also

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.120
going to be a pretty
good president.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.560
James Madison succeeded
Jefferson as president and

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.030
would have done the
same thing.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:07.710
So if that's low impact, what
does high impact look like?

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.140
Let's take a look at
Abraham Lincoln.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.720
I personally think Abraham
Lincoln might be the most

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.600
fascinating person
who's ever lived.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.760
So think about how Abraham
Lincoln becomes President of

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.690
the United States.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.880
There's a big movie about him
coming out soon, so people

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.550
might be more familiar
with this soon.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.130
But national elites knew
amazingly little about Abraham

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.750
Lincoln before he became
president.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.310
He has one term in the House.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.250
He's run for the Senate twice,
and he's lost both times.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.410
Many of you, I'm sure, remember
Barack Obama's

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.225
incredible speech at the
Democratic National Convention

00:29:35.225 --> 00:29:37.730
in 2004, the one that sort
of instantly made

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.440
him a national celebrity.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.070
So in 2004, he was running
for the Senate.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.170
He wins that election.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.730
And in 2008, four years later,
he runs for the presidency.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.190
And he's got four years in
the Senate as a platform.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.690
Abraham Lincoln similarly has
an incredible dynamic speech

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.660
that helps to make him
a national figure.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.530
But Lincoln lost his
Senate race.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.910
So the way to think about just
how obscure Abraham Lincoln

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:05.010
was, is he's Barack Obama in
2008 if Obama had lost the

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.660
2004 Senate race to be senator
from Illinois.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.550
And he's running
for president.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.670
So his big rival there is
Stephen Douglas, who is the

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.270
Republican senator from Illinois
and is the Democratic

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.790
Senator and would be the
Democratic nominee for

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.220
president in 1860.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.615
He's the man who beat Lincoln.

00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:24.270
And he's going to be the
Democratic nominee.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.870
So he's the guy the Republicans
know they have to

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.240
beat straight-up in the election
if they want to win

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.710
the presidency.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.960
So Lincoln's nomination is
incredibly unlikely.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.120
He's generally dismissed as
a fringe candidate for the

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.080
nomination.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.005
And a bunch of fluke
circumstances, basically, are

00:30:38.005 --> 00:30:39.400
what enable him to win.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.510
The first is a raid by a
man named John Brown.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.030
That's his picture there, in
Harper's Ferry in Virginia.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.350
The raid was designed to set
off a slave insurrection in

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.660
the southern states.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.960
The raid failed miserably,
was a complete failure.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.030
But it terrified moderates,
people who weren't all that

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:58.260
fired up about slavery, in the
North and made them much, much

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.410
less likely to vote for anyone
who's perceived as an

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.200
anti-slavery radical.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.240
Lincoln's national record was
so short that he was able to

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.450
convincingly portray himself
as the most moderate-- that

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.330
is, the least anti-slavery--

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.810
Republican.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.840
The second element is the
location of the convention.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.340
The convention is put in
Illinois, in Chicago.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.240
Lincoln is from Illinois.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.900
So why is the convention
in Illinois?

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.790
And the answer is the Republican
National Committee

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.810
voted to put it there.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.290
The vote was carried by one
vote over Missouri.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.360
And the argument that won the
day for Illinois was that

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.710
there were no significant
Republicans from Illinois, so

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.090
it would be neutral territory
where none of the contenders

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.900
would have a home
field advantage.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.850
But of course, one
of them does.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.000
And Lincoln's team takes
advantage of that in, let's

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.150
say, a fashion we don't normally
associate with

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.650
Abraham Lincoln.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.490
So it's in Chicago.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:58.120
Lincoln's team goes out, and
they recruit people from all

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.050
across the state.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.530
And the way they recruit them
is they get the people with

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.020
the loudest voices.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.730
And then they print fake
tickets and stack the

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.180
convention the audience
with these people.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.240
So every time Lincoln's name is
mentioned on the floor of

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.150
the convention, these guys are
all taught to start whooping

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.820
and hollering and screaming and
shouting so loudly that

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.490
the windows of the building
actually start to shake.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.080
It's an enormous psychological
battle.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.400
And then Lincoln's campaign
manager is a

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.290
guy named David Davis.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:34.495
Now, Davis is such a novice that
he has never even visited

00:32:34.495 --> 00:32:37.800
a convention before.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.190
So the guy who really should
have been the presidential

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.880
nominee is this man, William
Henry Seward, two-term

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.950
governor, two-term senator,
founding father of the

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.090
Republican Party, man of
international reputation,

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.910
among the foremost anti-slavery

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.210
voices in the country.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.050
If you're going to pick a person
to lead the country

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.180
through its moment of greatest
crisis, which 1860 undoubtedly

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.860
was, William Henry Seward
is the man you pick.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.460
Seward's campaign manager
is a man gloriously

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.770
named Thurlow Weed.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.250
Thurlow Weed is the finest
political operative of his

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.350
generation.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.650
Think of him as the
Karl Rove of 19th

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.470
century American politics.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.790
So you've got the best political
operative of his

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.000
generation versus a guy who's
never even shown up at a

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.050
convention.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.250
This should not be
an even match.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.610
But what this guy knows is,
because he has the home field

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:29.120
advantage, he knows that the
convention will be chaos, and

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.730
he goes to the people in
charge of the seating

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.930
arrangements.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:37.540
And he has New York, Seward's
delegation, with Weed in it

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.650
seated between two other
delegations that are

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:42.950
pro-Seward.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.530
And by doing that, he knows
that when the negotiations

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.450
have to take place, [? those ?]

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:46.570
[? two ?]

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.520
[? then ?] are going to flip
states and choose a final

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.710
winner, Weed will be physically
unable to the work

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.300
his way across the convention
floor to talk to other people.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.740
So if you ever think that
everything in American

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.400
politics is calm and rational,
just remember that the seating

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.540
arrangements of the convention
floor in 1860 helped to decide

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.300
who would become President
of the United States.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.280
The final thing were favorite
son candidates.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.650
That's candidates who have
support from a single state

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.800
and are not plausible contenders
for the national

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.449
election, but who have enough
votes to stop Seward from

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:17.261
winning on the first ballot.

00:34:17.261 --> 00:34:18.830
So you have a ballot.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.960
Seward's way in the lead,
but there's no winner.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.840
And then Lincoln's campaign
manager goes to Simon Cameron,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.230
the governor of Pennsylvania,
who controls the Pennsylvania

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.870
delegates, says, if you flip to
Lincoln, Lincoln will get

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.770
enough momentum that he'll
overtake Seward, and he'll win

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.440
the election.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.030
And Simon Cameron is a man so
famously corrupt that, a few

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.949
years later, when he was in
Lincoln's Cabinet, he was

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.239
accused of being willing
to steal anything

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.219
but a red-hot stove.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.070
When the person who accused him
of that, Lincoln forced

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.050
him to apologize, he said,
I'm sorry, you would

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.350
also steal the stove.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.210
So Cameron says, what
can you give me?

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.730
And Lincoln telegrams his
campaign team, "Make no deals

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.130
that will bind me." Says, "Make
no deals." Lincoln's

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.160
campaign manager says,
Lincoln's not here.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.800
And he says to Cameron, if you
agree to support Lincoln,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.890
we'll put you in the Cabinet.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.680
Cameron does.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.250
Lincoln becomes the nominee, and
then he becomes President

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.150
of the United States.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.100
And Lincoln sticks
to the deal.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.750
He makes Cameron Secretary
of War.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.510
So I say that there are
lots of ways you

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.580
can tell this story.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.430
And it's a fascinating
and a fun story.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.410
Actually, I'm only skimming
the surface.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.100
The book will tell you a lot
more of the details.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.850
And they are every bit as crazy
as the ones I've talked

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.000
about here.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.580
But this is not a story about
picking the person most likely

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.970
to win the Civil War
for the North.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.280
This is a story with just random
element after random

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.430
element adding up.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.390
So then, what's the impact?

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:47.440
I said, we don't want to cause
a chain of events.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.430
In 1864, we don't know what the
world would have looked

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.360
like if Abraham Lincoln had
not been president.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.820
So let's look at the first

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.560
decision he makes as president.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.180
The very first decision is at
the crisis over Fort Sumter.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.030
Sumter is a fort in
Charleston Harbor.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.780
It's besieged by South
Carolina militia.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.120
It is basically one of the only
two Federal possessions

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.240
in the seceded states.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.670
Seward's policy is
to give it up.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.630
He says, let's give the fort to
the South, and we'll break

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.800
what he calls the secessionist
fever.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.950
He says, they're not serious.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:14.750
They're only bluffing.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.560
They don't really want
to leave the country.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.850
And if that's not true, then
what we should do is start a

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.720
war with Spain and France.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.080
And if we do that, then in the
war, everybody will rally to

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.910
the flag, and the South
will come back in.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.030
Lincoln doesn't think so.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.230
So Lincoln doesn't make a
position [INAUDIBLE], but it's

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.180
clear that he's not going
to do what Seward wants.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.340
And so Seward tries to seize
control of the government.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.270
Remember, Seward is the guy
with the international

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.200
reputation.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.360
Lincoln is the hick from the
small town in Illinois.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.490
That's the way Seward
thinks of it.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.020
No one knows who this guy is.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.690
And so Steward sends Lincoln
what is probably the most

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.205
remarkable document
ever received

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.770
by an American president.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.250
So you guys have
all seen memos.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.230
I'm not going to read the
whole thing to you.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.740
But I want one sentence
to get emphasized--

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.820
"Either the president must do it
himself or devolve it upon

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.570
some member of the Cabinet.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.760
It is not my especial province,
but I neither or

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.520
seek to evade nor assume
responsibility."

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.760
You've all read memos.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.460
This message is really clear.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.930
He's telling Lincoln, make
me the shadow president.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.470
Let me make all the decisions.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.000
And you just sort
of sit in front.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.790
So he's completely misread
his man, of course.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.440
But think about this.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.990
How could he have read
Lincoln successfully?

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.640
He has no data.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.820
One term in Congress.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.590
And so what Lincoln says to
him is, "We can do many

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:35.440
things, but whatever must be
done, I must do it." But

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.500
instead of causing a feud with
his Secretary of State, what

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.720
Lincoln does is his skills with
management of people are

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.410
so extraordinary that a few
months later, Seward tells his

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.780
wife, "I am enormously glad that
President Lincoln is here

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.900
to guide the country
in this crisis.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.060
Of all of the men in the
country, he is the best of

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.020
us," the only person
who could do this.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.810
So then Lincoln does
his master stroke.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.910
Some people in the Cabinet
wanted to give up the fort and

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.580
let the South go peacefully.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.360
Some people had wanted
to fight right away.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.820
And the country, the North,
is not unified at all.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.630
Maybe a third of people in
the North actually want

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.520
to fight this war.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.640
Most of the rest are sort of,
it's just not worth it.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.290
Think about how bad this
war could get.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:20.950
It's not worth it.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.190
Let it go in peace.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.440
And what Lincoln does
is he sends food.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.990
And he sends it publicly,
instead of trying to sneak it

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:30.680
past the guards.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.930
And by doing that, he puts the
decision in the hands of the

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.150
South Carolina radicals as to
whether they're going to stop

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.330
the food from getting
to the fort.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:40.460
And they choose to do it.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.930
They just fire first.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.050
And by firing first, they
unify the country behind

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:46.420
Lincoln in the war effort.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.450
Think about what the United
States was like on September

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.570
11 or what it must have been
like on December 7, 1941.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.960
When somebody shoots at your
flag, partisan political

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.940
differences vanish for
a little while.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.150
And so Lincoln suddenly
has a unified North to

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.360
prosecute the war.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.615
Without that, it's impossible
to imagine how he could have

00:39:03.615 --> 00:39:04.740
fought it successfully.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.790
So I'd say that Lincoln's impact
here is the Civil War

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:12.760
either doesn't happen or is lost
if Abraham Lincoln is not

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.020
President of the
United States.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.830
It's hard to imagine, again,
more impact than

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.830
that from one person.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.610
All right, so if that's
politics, how about in

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:21.890
business and science?

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.910
Let me give you one example
of each, quickly.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.350
This is Albert J. Dunlap,
my pick for worst

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:30.320
CEO in human history.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.700
He built a record of moving from
company to company as a

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.370
turnaround artist, where
he would slash costs.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:39.520
He eventually ends up at Scott
Paper, where he slashes cost,

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.750
raises profits, and sells the
company to Kimberly Clark for

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.750
three times what it was
worth when he was

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.260
initially hired as CEO.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.100
Seems like an incredible
success story, right?

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.080
So the problem is--

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:51.760
well, we'll see.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.060
So Dunlap is then hired to
become the CEO of Sunbeam.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.070
Sunbeam's just a consumer
products company, pretty

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.330
profitable, nothing special.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.800
They think it needs someone
to really improve things.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.160
And the way he's hired is a
member of Sunbeam's board

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.720
reads a magazine profile of
Dunlap and says, this might be

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.770
our guy, has a four-hour
meeting with him.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.130
Dunlap then meets with
representatives of the two

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:14.800
biggest investors in Sunbeam--

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.630
not the investors, just
their representatives.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.460
And he's hired with carte
blanche to do anything that he

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.220
wants at Sunbeam before most
members of the board of

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.820
directors even know he's
under contention.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.965
He's in their consideration
to be CEO.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.400
I would say this is probably not
how you want to evaluate a

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.190
CEO before you hire
him or her.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.890
And the reason is there are a
few things that the board

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.130
didn't know that they probably
should have.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.580
Divisions Dunlap had run
historically did poorly right

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.840
after he left.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.440
He had been fired after seven
weeks for insubordination from

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.690
one of his jobs.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.140
He'd been fired as president
of Nitec for his abusive

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.480
management style.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.050
They actually sued him for it.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.400
But the suit collapsed, because
Dunlap had also

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.590
engaged in massive
accounting fraud.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.270
And the accounting fraud was
so pervasive that it caused

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.690
the company to go into
bankruptcy, which made them

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.280
stop the lawsuit.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.870
And the way Dunlap was able to
continue his career and get

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.380
hired by places like
Kimberly Clark and

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.930
eventually Scott is simple.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.330
He didn't list these companies
on his resume.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.910
These sort of incidents were
discovered by "The New York

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.110
Times" in an investigation a
couple of years after he was

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:23.000
fired from Sunbeam.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.430
When Kimberly Clark had bought
Scott, what they'd basically

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.060
been was the greater fool.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.160
They'd spent three times as much
to buy this company, but

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.590
when they bought it, they
discovered that to make it

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.410
worth anything at all, they
would have to undo everything

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.940
Al Dunlap had done as CEO
of Kimberly Clark.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.880
Oh, by the way, this is how
Dunlap's management style--

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.360
I hope Google doesn't
work like this--

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.130
Dunlap ordered the head of HR
to his office, threw a chair

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.140
at him, swore at him constantly,
and then threw him

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.210
back out of the office without
actually giving him an

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.420
opportunity to say a word.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.830
And he did all of this in
front of the person's

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.320
subordinates.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.310
If that ever happens to
you, it's a good sign

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.900
to leave the company.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.300
So that's how Dunlap likes
to run a company.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.140
And so it's a disaster.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.400
His usual trick is he gets
hired, then he arranges an

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.250
acquisition.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.180
But that doesn't work here,
because he's such a celebrity

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.450
that when he gets hired, the
stock price spikes up.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.000
And suddenly, Sunbeam
is too expensive for

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.520
anyone to buy it.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.530
So he tries to arrange
a merger on his

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.980
own with other companies.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.030
And at the same time, he's using
really questionable,

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.570
really fraudulent accounting
practices to

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.530
goose Sunbeam's numbers.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.980
And in the due diligence
investigation that people do

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.250
through the M&amp;A, everything
comes out.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.620
Everything falls apart.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.840
Sunbeam's shares start
to plunge.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.950
The board questions Dunlap as to
what on Earth is going on.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.600
Dunlap's response is that
Sunbeam's largest shareholder

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.630
is involved in a conspiracy
to drive down the price of

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.820
Sunbeam's stock.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.130
The board is understandably
baffled as to why Sunbeam's

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.610
largest shareholder would be
trying to decrease the value

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:55.950
of his holdings.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:57.870
And he's fired.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.590
Dunlap essentially resigns
in disgrace.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.840
And Sunbeam files for
bankruptcy in 2001,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.070
essentially ceases
to exist as an

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.410
independently operating company.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.610
So let's say that Dunlap did
the exact same things at

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:14.060
Sunbeam that he did at Kimberly
Clark, that he, in

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.320
fact, had done many
times in his past.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.270
But he wasn't discovered.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:22.110
So the thing here is this is the
classic case of the worst

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:24.620
possible scenario when you hire
an unfiltered leader.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.640
Anyone at his previous
organizations could have told

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.640
them that this is the worst
possible person to hire.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.360
Anyone could have
told them that.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.500
But the sort of information you
need to know what someone

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.280
is like, that they like to
throw chairs at their

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.030
subordinates, that doesn't
filter across organizational

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.290
boundaries very well.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:42.180
That's gossip.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.390
It's the gossip you trade in
the halls, which can be

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.340
enormously valuable,
but doesn't go

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.120
from place to place.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.770
So here you have this case
where-- this is, by the way,

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:56.790
the title of a book about Al
Dunlap, which was my favorite

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.930
business book cover
of all time--

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:03.200
"Chainsaw Al." And maybe all you
really need to know about

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.900
Al Dunlap's personality is
that "Chainsaw Al" is the

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.450
nickname he gave himself.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.820
But how about science?

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.830
So what I'd say is that science
is actually the most

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.540
difficult case for personal
impact, because science is

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.260
about discovering a natural
world that exists independent

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.570
of our own observations.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.260
It's just out there.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.640
So is it possible for a
scientist to have this kind of

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.370
huge impact?

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.230
Let me give you an example
of one who I think did.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.355
So what does filtration look
like for a scientist?

00:44:33.355 --> 00:44:34.800
My argument is that what
it really looks

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.590
like is peer review.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.220
We are all familiar with the
peer review process.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.000
And this, to my mind, sounds
a lot like filtration.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.510
It's particularly peer review
for grant applications,

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.120
because grant applications
are forward-looking.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.790
So if you submit a grant
application, other scientists

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.346
read it, and they say, well,
this is good experiment, this

00:44:52.346 --> 00:44:53.620
is a bad experiment.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.850
So here's the problem.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:00.120
A revolutionary experiment is
one that tells you that what

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.840
you know about the
world isn't so.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.110
It tells you that
your long-held

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.200
theories are not correct.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.020
So the people who are doing
peer review believe these

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.920
long-held theories.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.730
They're going to get 1,000
different proposals for ideas

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.980
that disprove long-held
theories.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.800
And at least 999 of those
proposals are wrong.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.170
They will fail.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:24.900
One of them might succeed.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:29.390
But it looks just as unlikely as
the other 999, doesn't it?

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:32.350
So the odds of that sort of
revolutionary experiment being

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:36.050
funded tend to drop the more
thoroughly you review

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.430
experiments.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.750
So Judah Folkman is a surgeon.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.710
He's the first Ohio State
graduate to go to Harvard

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.540
Medical School, which
he did at 20.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.950
Between his second and third
years of medical school, he

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.750
took a year off to do research,
which many medical

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:50.720
students do.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.700
In his case, the way he spent
that year was by inventing the

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.680
implantable pacemaker.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.390
And in fact, 3M's first ever
commercially released

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.090
pacemaker was based on Judah
Folkman's design.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:04.210
So this is a pretty remarkable
man, to do that at 22.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.830
He's drafted into the Navy.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.480
And while he's in the Navy, he
does research on blood, to

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.860
create an artificial
blood substitute.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.000
And to do that, you worked with
cancers, with tumors.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.390
And what he discovers about
tumors is that unless they

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:21.300
have a blood supply, they
stop growing very fast.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.430
So Folkman has an idea,
a lightning

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:24.120
bolt, you might think.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.010
He thinks, maybe tumors aren't
dangerous unless they emit

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:30.830
some sort of a chemical that
causes capillaries to grow

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:33.450
into the tumor and feed it
and allow it to grow.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.520
But he doesn't know what
the chemical is.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.380
And the common view in the
cancer research community at

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.560
the time is, nothing
interesting

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.940
happens with blood vessels.

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.960
They're just dumb tubes.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.000
That's the line people use.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.880
So when he suggests this, that
we should do experiments on

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.550
this, nobody buys it.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:51.250
He doesn't have one day of
formal training as a cancer

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:51.910
researcher.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.540
He's a surgeon.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.590
Folkman's idea is this-- he
calls it angiogenesis.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.810
He says that this is the term
you use for this ability to

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:02.540
generate capillaries that
grow into the tumor.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.380
But he can't identify
the factor.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.510
His ideas gain no traction.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.530
Proposals and grants
are rejected.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:11.230
Only two papers published,
both in minor journals.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.680
Eventually, the publicity gets
so bad that when he speaks at

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.600
a cancer research conference,
150 people get up and walk out

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.840
in protest, because
the conference is

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.620
wasting their time.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.740
And an investigation of his
work, an independent

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.650
investigation launched by
Children's Hospital, where he

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.510
is the chief of surgery,
concludes that his research is

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.680
"of no value." That's the
quote-- "of no value."

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.800
And so the hospital tells
Folkman, you have to either

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.220
resign as chief of surgery or
give up cancer research.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.600
You have to do one of the
two, because you're

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.520
embarrassing us so much.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.170
Folkman resigns as
chief of surgery.

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:44.880
This is the marginalia in
one of Folkman's grant

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.960
applications, where he says,
this is the limit.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.600
We do not want Folkman
to build an empire.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.530
So the way he does his research
is he negotiates the

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:58.070
first ever corporate partnership
for biomedical

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:59.680
research between a corporation
and university.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.560
This is a multi-billion-dollar
industry.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.390
Almost every major university
does it.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:06.380
Folkman invented that with
Monsanto at Harvard.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.470
In 1979, PNAS publishes a paper
proving that his idea

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.530
about the factor is correct--
there is a factor.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.360
In 1980, he proves that
angiogenesis can be inhibited,

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.470
that you can stop capillaries
from growing.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.150
In 1989, the factor is
identified by a different

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.000
research team after 24
years of searching.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.500
In 1998, the first patient is
successfully treated using an

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.140
angiogenesis inhibitor.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.750
Folkman dies in 2008.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:37.010
And when he dies, 1.2 million
people are being treated by

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.710
drugs based on his idea.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:42.930
So the argument here isn't that
angiogenesis would never

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.320
have been discovered
without Folkman.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.880
I think it certainly
would have.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.260
But the way I tell the story
is I don't see any way for

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.780
angiogenesis to be discovered
nearly as quickly as it was

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.560
without Folkman, because he was
alone on this issue, not

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.090
for a month or two,
but for decades.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:05.080
All right, so a few quick
applications.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.350
The idea here is when you're
choosing leaders, picking an

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.520
unfiltered leader is a gamble.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.430
Sometimes, they're going
to be a genius.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.460
Sometimes, they're going to
be a disastrous failure.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.640
And there are many, many
more ways to fail than

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.030
there are to succeed.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:20.260
That's part of life.

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.960
So the odds are they're probably
going to fail.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.260
So if you need to innovate,
you might want one.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.850
If you're desperate, if your
company is about to go

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:31.650
bankrupt, well, there's no
outcome worse than bankruptcy.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.190
So you might want one, because
maybe he or she is the only

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:35.530
person who can save you.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.180
If you're in an environment
of limited losses

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.550
and unlimited gains.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:40.540
So if you're a venture
capitalist and you're

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.320
investing, the most you can
lose is the amount of your

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.400
investment.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.210
But your gain is you might
invest in Google.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:49.670
So you'd probably be much more
willing to take gambles than

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:51.990
you should be in a different
environment.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:55.250
You want to avoid false signals,
things like family

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:59.090
wealth, that make someone seem
like they're familiar and

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.300
highly evaluated, even
when they aren't.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.350
You want to match people
with situation.

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:05.820
Another key idea here is the
idea there's no such thing as

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.160
a best leader.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.300
A lot of these people have
preferences that take them to

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.690
success in one environment and
would have taken them to

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:13.206
failure in another one.

00:50:13.206 --> 00:50:16.200
The idea here is it's not the
best leader you want; it's the

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.940
right leader, the person who
matches this environment and

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.190
this situation.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.240
So if you want to be a better
leader yourself, it

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.080
says, know your type.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.190
Know yourself.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.550
Understand whether you are
filtered or unfiltered,

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.010
because filtered and unfiltered
leaders succeed and

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.760
fail for dramatically
different reasons.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.910
Filtered leaders fail when the
external environment changes

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.060
and their old ways of doing
things don't work.

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.150
And so they need access to those
unfiltered insights.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.740
Unfiltered leaders fail because
they don't know the

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.130
organization they're running.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.590
They don't understand
how it works.

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.160
They don't have the insider's
knowledge that you really need

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.860
to get an organization to
operate successfully.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.940
The final thing here is, in the
book, I talk about a bunch

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:01.310
of different leaders, some of
whom, I say, would've been

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.830
disastrous under any
circumstances, and some of

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.440
whom were enormously successful,
but in a different

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.060
set of circumstances would
have been disastrous.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.220
They just had preferences that
worked really well, that

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.145
aligned with that situation.

00:51:11.145 --> 00:51:13.090
And in a different circumstance,
their bias would

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:14.290
have failed.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.060
But are there people who are
just genuinely great, who seem

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.150
to be able to succeed in any
circumstance where a human

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.855
being, it's possible for
them to find success?

00:51:22.855 --> 00:51:24.060
I say there are a few.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.360
The two I talk about most often
are Lincoln and Folkman,

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.550
I think, are the two who really
do seem to have that.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:30.980
And what makes them unique, I
would say, goes back to this

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.560
idea of, where do these
people succeed, and

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.990
where do they fail?

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:37.360
Unfiltered leaders are
able to do what other

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.530
people would not do.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.890
Everyone tells them,
this is a bad idea.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.730
And they do it anyway.

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:46.175
So that's incredible levels
of self-confidence.

00:51:46.175 --> 00:51:48.630
Think about just how much
self-confidence you have to

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:53.150
be, when the stakes are this
high, to keep going forward.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:56.490
But at the same time, somehow,
when all these people around

00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:00.230
them say, well, this is a bad
idea, they're able to listen

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.580
and say, well, maybe it really
is a bad idea, and avoid the

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.850
kind of catastrophic mistakes
that could otherwise have

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:08.020
destroyed them.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.700
So this is the paradoxical
combination of supreme

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.190
self-confidence and supreme
intellectual humility, the

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:18.300
ability to acknowledge that
you might be wrong.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.720
Abraham Lincoln, I think,
embodies this

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.970
more than anyone else.

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.350
His second inaugural is, in my
opinion, the greatest speech

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:25.210
any American has ever given.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:26.400
Every bit of it is
worth studying.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.835
But let me give you one
clause in particular.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:36.270
"With firmness in the right,
as God gives us to see the

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.460
right."

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.830
So the Civil War is awful
beyond words.

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:43.370
Tens of thousands of people
die It goes on for years.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:46.150
It's impossible, in a modern
context, to imagine just how

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:49.090
horrendous the carnage was.

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:50.650
And Lincoln didn't
have to do that.

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:52.120
He chose to do it.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.580
That's firmness in the right.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.120
But he's also the person who's
able to say, I might be wrong,

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.342
and change course when
it seems he is wrong.

00:53:00.342 --> 00:53:03.020
And so the second half of that
clause is just as important--

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.620
"as God gives us to see it."
Being the person is able to be

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:11.260
both of those, both supremely
self-confident and supremely

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.280
humble, is, to my mind, the
hallmark of the people who

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.170
were great, not just lucky.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.420
Thanks very much.
