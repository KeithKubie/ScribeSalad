00:00:00.414 --> 00:00:02.237
(quiet music)

00:00:02.237 --> 00:00:04.755
Female: We're in the MoMA stores looking

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:08.670
at a poster of 1913 designed and printed

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.444
in Amsterdam by Louis Raemaekers.

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:17.554
This is a dramatic use
of very simple means,

00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:20.246
two colors lithographically printed,

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:24.037
and it shows this new integrative approach

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:26.932
to the combination of image and text.

00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:30.909
It's a political poster
which takes the form

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:36.568
of this giant creepy spider and web.

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:39.467
This is protesting the Tariff Act

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:42.023
that the Netherlandish government

00:00:42.023 --> 00:00:44.522
had introduced raising levies on

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:48.827
the everyday products
featured in the poster.

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:51.747
You can see here the cocooned prey

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:56.753
of clothing, tools and food

00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:00.326
that were subject to these tariffs.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.576
The use of the spider feeds off

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:06.283
a quite visceral sense of discomfort

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:09.464
that we have with spiders.

00:01:09.464 --> 00:01:13.210
What's new about Raemaekers' image

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.441
is that it really exploits
the kind of microscopic

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:22.229
scientific scrutiny of small insect life,

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.806
the hairy legs and the talons at the end

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:29.486
attached to this gossamer web.

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:31.989
This style of poster, the symbolic

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:35.069
and metaphorical use of animal life,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.114
and the whole subject of tariffs

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:40.613
are indicative of the tensions,

00:01:40.613 --> 00:01:42.107
both economic and aesthetic,

00:01:42.107 --> 00:01:46.416
that would erupt during
the first World War.

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.974
Raemaekers' techniques using

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:51.381
animal political imagery

00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:53.052
was so effective in World War I

00:01:53.052 --> 00:01:54.887
that in fact the German government

00:01:54.887 --> 00:01:56.054
put a bounty on his head

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:58.506
and he was forced to take flight

00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.259
from Amsterdam for London.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.259
(quite music)
