1
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.450
Like a boss. Keep forgetting this show. I started the watch.

2
00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:13.900
I watched the first three episodes and I absolutely fucking loved it and I

3
00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:18.670
tweeted about it. It was a cartoon from Japan, I guess that called Anime,

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.930
which I did know that,

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.250
but I didn't realize it was such a divisive thing to say that you like to show

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.730
that was anime. I feel like is animated,

7
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.470
like the Emo of fucking cartoons.

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.310
Like I tweeted that, I liked the show called one punch man.

9
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.543
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

10
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.060
<v 0>all right. And the fucking responses that I got, I got, dude,</v>

11
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.240
are you fucking drunk? Oh my God, you're in the enemy.

12
00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:00.120
And then other people just like this, it's like to create this day. However,

13
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.710
I just liked the show. I've watched enough for the same type of shit.

14
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:09.650
And I was scrolling through and I was like, what the fuck is this show?

15
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.740
And I looked and it had five stars, four and a half, five stars,

16
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.130
which is why I really hope Netflix doesn't go to thumbs up, thumbs down,

17
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:20.940
like I said, because it's so fucking, you know, stubbing your toe,

18
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.420
thumbs down. Adolf Hitler, thumbs down. I mean,

19
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.190
what did the thumbs down is this is a big gap between Hitler and you know,

20
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.920
stop and your fucking toe. Um, anyway,

21
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:34.530
so I put this thing on and what I loved about the show,

22
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.310
<v 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.860
<v 0>aside from the fact that I really thought it was funny that you actually kind of</v>

24
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:44.861
got like a sense of what young people feel like in Japan as far as their view of

25
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:51.160
going into the corporate world was very similar to the empty feeling unless

26
00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:54.310
you're a fucking sociopath over here.

27
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:58.750
I find like a very like common thread to that and to basically give the overall

28
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.650
thing the superhero in it. He's not a super, he doesn't want to be a superhero

29
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.410
<v 2>when I'm out fighting monsters,</v>

30
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.140
I never feel as if my heart's really in it anymore.

31
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.600
I mean I just do the hero thing as a hobby.

32
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.180
<v 0>Alright.</v>

33
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.940
And he fucking trained really hard cause he wanted to be the strongest guy in

34
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:20.820
the world. And in his training he lost all his hair,

35
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.370
which is hilarious and he's really self conscious about it.

36
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.070
But he ended up developing like this punch.

37
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.890
And no matter what monster he runs into,

38
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.570
he doesn't give a shit whether they kill him.

39
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:35.400
He's just completely devoid of any like passion or emotion.

40
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.970
Like what happens to you when you get shoved into a fucking cubicle.

41
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.093
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.281
<v 0>and uh,</v>

43
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.540
and he's got this one punch and he just fucking can punch so hard that no matter

44
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.620
how fucking bad ass the monster is, he gives them one,

45
00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:12.850
somebody said they should have called the show, the right they have Fred.

46
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.340
He gives them the fucking fire in the fucking,

47
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.750
in the face is Eddie Murphy says in the face,

48
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.923
<v 1>the</v>

49
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.250
<v 0>um, and their fucking head explodes and the monsters that he fights,</v>

50
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.030
you also get more of an insight into where people's heads are at,

51
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.200
uh, in Japan. And it was like, you know, one of the monsters you fought with,

52
00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:50.180
some giant virus sent here by the Earth to get rid of all the humans because of

53
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:52.550
what we'd done to the planet. So there's environmental thing.

54
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.190
Then my favorite one was this guy who was crab man. He was half, like up top.

55
00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:01.460
And he was all a crab and then the bottom he was,

56
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.460
he was half a guy and he was in put the bottom half.

57
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.570
He's in his bare feet and tidy. Whities Ben,

58
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.160
<v 1>you're a new businessman already hating the daily grind.</v>

59
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.880
I ate too much crap and turned into this crab Alon Day.

60
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.370
You should be crapping in your pants right now.

61
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.110
Why aren't you running [inaudible]?

62
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.160
<v 0>And the guy's like, oh, I ate so much crab meat that I became a fucking crab.</v>

63
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:27.870
And to me he represented the upper 1% corporate guys, you know,

64
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.710
on some power lunch. Just eaten all the fucking Sushi, just take, take, take,

65
00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:35.070
take, take, nothing spiritual about them. So he gave him me all right there,

66
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:35.904
Fred

67
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.250
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

68
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.050
<v 0>And then he fought this fucking Lei and she had command of all the mosquitoes</v>

69
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.680
and she'd sit the mosquitoes on everybody suck all the blood out of you and all

70
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:58.840
your fucking energy. And then it would make her stronger.

71
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.140
And to me it's like all this is a gold dig in blood sucking whore.

72
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.790
<v 1>All right, come on.</v>

73
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:09.790
That wasn't nearly enough love to satisfy my niece.

74
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.490
Now go get some more for me.

75
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.970
<v 0>And then once she got it to do it to all the animals and everybody there,</v>

76
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.620
she didn't need them mosquitoes anymore.

77
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.080
She told all the mosquitoes to go fuck themselves. And I'm like,

78
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.820
slash this is also somebody who becomes successful and forgets where they come

79
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.190
from. And they look at everybody where they used to be.

80
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.670
It's like a bunch of fucking p ons,

81
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.180
a bunch of little insignificant little mosquitoes.

82
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.420
<v 1>Hi, I no longer need my tiny little helpers. I mean,</v>

83
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.400
look at how strong guy be calm,

84
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.900
<v 0>right? It's a lot of levels to it or you.</v>

85
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.490
He just get fucking high and watch this baldheaded dude fucking punch half a

86
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:55.060
crab in the head. He wants you to explode. I enjoyed it.

87
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 3>Oh, oh, oh. [inaudible] keep it up.</v>

88
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:06.170
Let me see the uh, oh, the Manet comes in,

89
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.510
parade, comes to town, going down. Broadway is a one way street.

90
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.430
When would you have a way I go.
