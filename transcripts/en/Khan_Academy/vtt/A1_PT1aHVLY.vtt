00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Instructor] In the last video,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.810
we numerically studied how changes in

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.390
productivity or cost might affect

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.790
your marginal cost, your
average variable cost,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.020
your average fixed cost,
or your average total cost.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.050
In this video, we're gonna
think about it visually.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.240
So, we constructed these curves several

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.180
videos ago to visualize
how average fixed cost

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.450
trends over time.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.790
As you take that fixed
cost and you spread it

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.170
over more, and more, and more units,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.090
you see that that just
asymptotes toward zero

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.850
as you get more and more units.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.050
You see your marginal cost curve,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.030
and this is something that you'll

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.550
typically see in a lot of textbooks.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.600
It's kind of u-shaped.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.100
And we talked about where it intersects

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.710
the average variable cost.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.120
That's where the average variable cost

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.930
goes from trending down to trending up.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.290
So it hits that minimum point,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.280
and the same thing happens
at average total cost.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.960
It hits the bottom of that
u of average total cost.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.090
It goes from trending down to trending up.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.200
And then over time, this
difference that you see

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.450
between your average total cost

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.810
and your average variable
cost, that difference

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.860
right over there, that is
your average fixed cost.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.930
And so, since your average fixed cost are

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.070
asymptoting downwards, you see that this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.100
difference between average total cost

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.040
and average variable cost
gets less and less over time,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.120
that they are going to, over time,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.250
converge to each other as your average

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.460
fixed costs gets closer, and closer,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.470
and closer to zero.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.170
But now let's think about how these curves

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.930
might be impacted if you have changes

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.270
in productivity or cost.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.320
So let's start with a
change in your fixed costs.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.310
Let's say your rent goes up.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.330
What would happen then?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.540
Pause this video and think about

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.640
what would happen visually.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.700
Well then your average
fixed cost would shift up,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.920
and it might look something like this.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.520
Your average fixed cost might
look something like this.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.970
And then, which of these other curves

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.820
also have fixed costs embedded in it?

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.570
Well, your average total
cost is a combination

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.930
of your average variable cost and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.400
your average fixed cost.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.810
So the amount that your
average fixed cost went up

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.210
for any quantity, your
average total cost would

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.750
also go up that amount for that quantity.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.940
So it would look something like this.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.600
It would look something like this.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.050
And once again, just as before,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.680
it will trend downwards
until you intersect

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.160
with your marginal cost curve.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.420
And then it'll start trending upwards.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.940
So a change in your fixed costs,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.150
either upwards or downwards,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.790
would affect your average fixed cost

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.850
and would affect your average total cost.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.180
The reason why it doesn't affect

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.360
your average variable cost is because

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.560
your average variable cost are taking out

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.550
out your fixed costs.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.070
They're just thinking
about the variable costs.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.020
And your marginal costs are thinking about

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.560
a difference in costs
between two different

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.860
states of output.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.900
And the fixed costs
are in either of those,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.813
so they will cancel out.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.190
What would be a change
in your variable costs?

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.420
Let's say you have to give
everyone a pay increase.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.400
Well then your variable costs will go up.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.180
And your variable costs might look like

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.460
something like this.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.280
They will just shift up.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.350
And once again, they will trend downwards

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.740
until you intersect with
your marginal cost curve,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.030
and then you will trend upwards.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.740
Now, a change in your variable costs

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.660
will also affect your marginal costs.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.530
Because as you produce more output,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.210
well then you are likely to incur

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.360
more incremental costs.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.457
So then your marginal costs,

00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:20.880
and I know this is getting very messy,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.540
might start looking something like,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.890
might look something like that.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.440
So, big picture, changes in productivity

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.500
would likely affect your
average variable cost,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.240
likely affect your marginal cost,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.730
and of course, average variable cost

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.650
feeds into average total
cost, so that would be

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.970
impacted as well.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.820
But changes in just your fixed cost

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.150
would affect your average fixed cost curve

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.963
and your average total cost.
