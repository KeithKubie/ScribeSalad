00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.230
The average age of an apple in a U.S. grocery store from the day it was picked

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.040
until the day it gets into your mouth is 11 months.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.180
And this is usually shocking to people.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.860
And it's because we've designed the system.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.780
The last big push for agriculture was more cheap food.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.880
And we've optimized maybe not for the best goal: the goal of transport, the goal of cheapness,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.870
but not the goal of nutrition.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.480
The goal of environmental stewardship, which is now forefront in a consumer's mind,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.320
who says, "Where did my food come from?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.660
How good is it for me?"

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.040
And those questions require so much more information.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.600
This is Caleb Harper, a research scientist
at MIT.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.310
As the son of farmers who advised him to get out of the family business and into tech instead,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.330
Caleb decided to merge the two worlds.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.750
We design things that we call food computers.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.860
And the reason I call them that is because
I want to engender that imagination,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.900
that curiosity.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.220
A food computer is essentially a box that
controls and designs a climate.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.300
If you think Star Trek or you think Willy
Wonka, that's exactly what we're going for.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.540
It's a tabletop machine and technology platform that lets you program a climate

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.639
for the crop you want.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.569
The build components and instructions are accessible and that’s exactly what Caleb

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.579
and his team have in mind.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.549
We're focused on open source technologies

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.210
because we believe that that next revolution in agriculture has to be based on open science.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.969
That was one of the big misses from technology in the last 30 years was keeping it proprietary,

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.459
keeping it closed.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.580
I have an IP strategy, which is to put everything in the public domain.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.380
The Open Agriculture Initiative released their first prototype in 2015, giving curious potential

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.340
farmers a chance to experiment.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.460
They’ve tweaked the design since, and released their newest version, the PFC.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.820
Basic tinkering skills not included.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.300
The smallest one behind me is for the maker, the student, the enthusiast, the home body,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.860
the hacker, the scientist that wants to get
involved in their own house

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.500
or in their own labs.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.460
The parts include circuit boards, sensors,
lights, and cameras to monitor the plant.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.620
A seed has so much embedded technology inside of it already.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.820
So when you take a certain set of genetics and you put it inside of a certain phoneme or

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.420
climate, it will express something.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.570
That's called a phenotype.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.810
We want to understand under what conditions do those genetics express flavor, nutrition,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.480
size, color.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.350
And it has a lot more to do with its environment than its genetic predisposition.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.390
So we design CO2, and temperature, and humidity, and light spectrum, and light intensity,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.540
and minerality of the water, and oxygen of the water, then trying to make sense

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.480
out of what happened.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.480
The results get converted into a digital climate recipe, that can be uploaded

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.400
for anyone to use.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.560
If you want to build a food computer, first
know that you are on the front lines

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.080
of what we call the nerd army.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.360
Now the project is spread across 65 countries, 3,000 collaborators, and we're starting to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.260
build a base of knowledge that will actually be viable for machine learning.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.320
Machine learning and artificial intelligence can make sense out of all the data these food

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.420
computers generate, tweaking the recipes and helping create a shared language

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.560
for indoor farming.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.120
The power of that is that all of a sudden, agricultural research is not docked geographically.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.790
It doesn't have to be Ag research is only
relevant in Iowa to Iowa.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.600
All of a sudden, Iowa can become a digital climate and that digital climate can be shared

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.560
across 10,000 food computers.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.540
Inside Caleb’s lab are these enormous food servers, where they’re tackling

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.880
even bigger questions.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.459
We're looking at the effects of predators,
the effects of climate change.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.039
And all of this has a big effect on the ultimate result of what that plant has to offer you

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.720
in terms of flavor and nutrition.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.580
And with climate change starting to impact the world’s food supply, companies are starting

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.640
to pay close attention.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.260
70% of the world’s hazelnut trees are grown in Turkey and lately they’ve been hit hard

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.100
by hail storms and freezing temperatures.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.439
Ferrero, the company behind your favorite
hazelnut spread, is working with Caleb’s

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:41.050
team to see if they can grow hazelnut trees in new locations.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.009
We ran a matrix of different genetic varieties of hazelnut trees.

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.160
And then we subjected them to South African climate, to Chilean climate,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.940
and to Australian climate.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.999
Out of these 12 varieties, we found one that not only survived but thrived in these kinds

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.460
of high heat intensity situations.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.820
It's totally novel.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.320
But let’s get one thing straight, this box
isn’t exactly going to be your own custom

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.330
grocery store.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.320
I don't believe that the future holds food
computers in every house

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.860
that feeds them everything they need.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.809
But what's really cool is we're learning about the genetic difference between human to human.

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:24.189
And that's providing so much insight into
what you should eat versus what I should eat,

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.029
versus what someone else should eat.

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.060
Then I see a food computer in every home, because it'll grow something very,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.240
very specific to you.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.520
And it'll be used much more like a pharmacy rather than a constant food source.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.770
By putting the controls directly into your
hands, Caleb hopes that this is only just

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.689
the beginning of a micro-farm revolution.

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.780
Can you imagine anything more important than food?

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.130
How we're all going to eat in the future and that we can't see above that to see some big

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.880
common understanding?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.200
Making some of this open, interoperable across all these different disciplines

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.720
will be better for the world.
