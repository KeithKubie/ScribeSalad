- We started by looking WMD's,

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.041 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
which at the time I assumed

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.376 line:0%
yourself on a dating site.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.111 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
(laughter)
Right.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.345 line:0%
I remember thinking
why are we searching

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.414 line:0%
for white middle
aged dads in Iraq?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.949 line:0%
(laughter)

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.884 line:0%

- He is a person of color
and he's more sensitive to

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:27.327 line:0%
issues of bigotry and
I think he's gonnna be,

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.896 line:0%
he doesn't want to equate Islam

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:32.766
with extremist violent people.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.168
- Is it harder because he's
a secret muslim from Kenya,

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.569
does that make it harder?

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.805
(laughter)

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.407 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'll give you guys
the opportunity

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:43.676 align:start size:84% position:16%
to ask me any one

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.080
- Islamophobia sexism.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.914
I'd say...

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.321 align:start size:94% position:6%
Let's get rid of the
