00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.600
Welcome to the presentation
on level one exponent rules.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.150
Let's get started
with some problems.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.870
So if I were to ask you what 2
-- that's a little fatter than

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.080
I wanted it to be, but let's
keep it fat so it doesn't look

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.260
strange -- 2 the third times --
and dot is another way of

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.230
saying times -- if I were to
ask you what 2 to the third

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.820
times 2 to the fifth is, how
would you figure that out?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.610
Actually, let me use a skinnier
pen because that does look bad.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.120
So, 2 to the third
times 2 to the fifth.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.610
Well there's one way that I
think you do know how to do it.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.150
You could figure out that
2 to the third is 8, and

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.380
that 2 to the fifth is 32.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.840
And then you could
multiply them.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.010
And 8 times 32 is 240,
plus it's 256, right?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.530
You could do it that way.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.550
That's reasonable because it's
not that hard to figure out 2

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.520
to the third is and what
2 to the fifth is.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.150
But if those were much larger
numbers this method might

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.770
become a little difficult.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.520
So I'm going to show you using
exponent rules you can actually

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.340
multiply exponentials or
exponent numbers without

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.715
actually having to do as much
arithmetic or actually you

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:18.120
could handle numbers much
larger than your normal math

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.780
skills might allow you to.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.060
So let's just think what
2 to the third times

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.670
2 to the fifth means.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.940
2 to the third is 2
times 2 times 2, right?

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.200
And we're multiplying that
times 2 to the fifth.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.160
And that's 2 times 2
times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.200
So what do we have here?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.870
We have 2 times 2 times
2, times 2 times 2 times

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.780
2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.640
Really all we're doing is we're
multiplying 2 how many times?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.920
Well, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.410
So that's the same thing
as 2 to the eighth.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.050
Interesting.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.200
3 plus 5 is equal to 8.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.360
And that makes sense because 2
to the 3 is 2 multiplying by

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.400
itself three times, to the
fifth is 2 multiplying by

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.540
itself five times, and then
we're multiplying the two, so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.980
we're going to multiply
2 eight times.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.720
I hope I achieved my goal
of confusing you just now.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.580
Let's do another one.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.130
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.780
If I said 7 squared
times 7 to the fourth.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.550
That's a 4.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.180
Well, that equals 7 times 7,
right, that's 7 squared,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.430
times and now let's
do 7 to the fourth.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.090
7 times 7 times 7 times 7.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.780
Well now we're multiplying
7 by itself six times, so

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.590
that equal 7 to the sixth.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.130
So in general, whenever I'm
multiplying exponents of the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.620
same base, that's key, I can
just add the exponents.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.520
So 7 to the hundredth power
times 7 to the fiftieth

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.440
power, and notice this
is an example now.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.750
It would be very hard without
a computer to figure out what

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.320
7 to the hundredth power is.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.190
And likewise, very hard without
a computer to figure out what

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.050
7 to the fiftieth power is.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:32.730
But we could say that this is
equal to 7 to the 100 plus 50,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.790
which is equal to 7 to the 150.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.430
Now I just want to give you a
little bit of warning, make

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.630
sure that you're multiplying.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.150
Because if I had 7 to the 100
plus 7 to the 50, there's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.590
actually very little
I could do here.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.440
I couldn't simplify
this number.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.710
But I'll throw out one to you.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:04.810
If I had 2 to the 8 times
2 to the 20, we know we

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.570
can add these exponents.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.500
So that gives you 2
to the 28, right?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.820
What if I had 2 to the
8 plus 2 to the 8?

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.890
This is a bit of a
trick question.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.030
Well I just said if
we're adding, we can't

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.900
really do anything.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.530
We can't really simplify it.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.670
But there's a little trick
here that we actually have

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.980
two 2 to the 8, right?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.080
There's 2 to the 8 times
1, 2 to the 8 times 2.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.240
So this is the same thing as 2
times 2 to the 8, isn't it?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.150
2 times 2 to the 8.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.940
That's just 2 to
the 8 plus itself.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.030
And 2 times to the 8, well
that's the same thing as 2 to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.170
the first times 2 to the 8.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.500
And 2 to the first times 2 to
the 8 by the same rule we just

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.040
did is equal to 2 to the 9.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.080
So I thought I would just
throw that out to you.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.280
And it works even with
negative exponents.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:13.840
If I were to say 5 to the
negative 100 times 3 to the,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.370
say, 100 -- oh sorry, times
5 -- this has to be a 5.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.140
I don't know what my
brain was doing.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.150
5 to the negative 100 times
5 to the 102, that would

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.890
equal 5 squared, right?

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.930
I just take minus 100 plus 102.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.940
This is a 5.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.080
I'm sorry for that
brain malfunction.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.860
And of course, that equals 25.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.210
So that's the first
exponent rule.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.760
Now I'm going to show you
another one, and it kind of

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.900
leads from the same thing.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:55.280
If I were to ask you what 2 to
the 9 over 2 to the 10 equals,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.940
that looks like that could
be a little confusing.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.720
But it actually turns out to be
the same rule, because what's

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.110
another way of writing this?

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.360
Well, we know that this is also
the same thing as 2 to the 9

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.710
times 1 over 2 to
the 10, right?

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.460
And we know 1 over 2 to the 10.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.700
Well, you could re-write right
this as 2 the 9 times 2 to

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.850
the negative 10, right?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.270
All I did is I took 1 over 2 to
the 10 and I flipped it and I

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.990
made the exponent negative.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.330
And I think you know
that already from

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.660
level two exponents.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.090
And now, once again, we can
just add the exponents.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.300
9 plus negative 10 equals 2 to
the negative 1, or we could

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.000
say that equals 1/2, right?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.730
So it's an interesting
thing here.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.110
Whatever is the bottom
exponent, you could put it in

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.800
the numerator like we did here,
but turn it into a negative.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.760
So that leads us to the second
exponent rule, simplification

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.860
is we could just say that this
equals 2 to the 9 minus 10,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.190
which equals 2 to
the negative 1.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.160
Let's do another
problem like that.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:16.400
If I said 10 to the 200 over
10 to the 50, well that

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.640
just equals 10 to the 200
minus 50, which is 150.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.870
Likewise, if I had 7 to the
fortieth power over 7 to

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.940
the negative fifth power,
this will equal 7 to the

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.420
fortieth minus negative 5.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.230
So it equals 7 to
the forty-fifth.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.310
Now I want you to think about
that, does that make sense?

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:54.480
Well, we could have re-written
this equation as 7 to the

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.180
fortieth times 7 to
the fifth, right?

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.806
We could have taken this 1 over
7 to the negative 5 and turn it

00:08:02.806 --> 00:08:06.640
into 7 to the fifth, and that
would also just be 7

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.160
to the forty-five.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.810
So the second exponent rule I
just taught you actually is no

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.390
different than that first one.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.810
If the exponent is in the
denominator, and of course, it

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.210
has to be the same base and
you're dividing, you subtract

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.570
it from the exponent
in the numerator.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.390
If they're both in the
numerator, as in this case, 7

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.580
to the fortieth times 7 to the
fifth -- actually there's no

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.370
numerator, but they're
essentially multiplying by each

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.420
other, and of course, you have
to have the same base.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.690
Then you add the exponents.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.700
I'm going to add one variation
of this, and actually this is

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.360
the same thing but it's a
little bit of a trick question.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:56.470
What is 2 to the 9
times 4 to the 100?

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.190
Actually, maybe I shouldn't
teach this to you, you have

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.480
to wait until I teach
you the next rule.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.900
But I'll give you
a little hint.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:09.570
This is the same thing as 2 the
9 times 2 squared to the 100.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.320
And the rule I'm going to teach
you now is that when you have

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.610
something to an exponent and
then that number raised to

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.930
an exponent, you actually
multiply these two exponents.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.980
So this would be 2 the
9 times 2 to the 200.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.020
And by that first rule
we learned, this would

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.760
be 2 to the 209.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.140
Now in the next module
I'm going to cover

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.940
this in more detail.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.650
I think I might have
just confused you.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.050
But watch the next video and
then after the next video I

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.400
think you're going to be ready
to do level one exponent rules.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.930
Have fun.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:42.500
