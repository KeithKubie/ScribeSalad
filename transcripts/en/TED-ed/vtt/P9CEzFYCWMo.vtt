00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:11.691
In 1963, a 21-year-old physicist 
named Stephen Hawking

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:14.869
was diagnosed with a rare
neuromuscular disorder

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.589
called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
or ALS.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.018
Gradually, he lost the ability to walk,

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:23.328
use his hands,

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:24.737
move his face,

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:26.760
and even swallow.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.856
But throughout it all,
he retained his incredible intellect,

00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:32.267
and in the more
than 50 years that followed,

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:36.829
Hawking became one of history’s most 
accomplished and famous physicists.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.458
However, his condition went uncured

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:44.279
and he passed away in 2018 
at the age of 76.

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:46.049
Decades after his diagnosis,

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.078
ALS still ranks as one 
of the most complex,

00:00:49.078 --> 00:00:50.279
mysterious,

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:53.918
and devastating 
diseases to affect humankind.

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:57.868
Also called motor neuron disease 
and Lou Gehrig’s Disease,

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:03.440
ALS affects about two out of every
100,000 people worldwide.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.450
When a person has ALS,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.769
their motor neurons,

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:11.018
the cells responsible for all voluntary 
muscle control in the body,

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:13.050
lose function and die.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.695
No one knows exactly why
or how these cells die

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:20.360
and that’s part of what 
makes ALS so hard to treat.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.436
In about 90% of cases,

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:26.520
the disease arises suddenly, 
with no apparent cause.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.378
The remaining 10% of cases are hereditary,

00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:34.909
where a mother or father with ALS passes 
on a mutated gene to their child.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.595
The symptoms typically first appear 
after age 40.

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:43.626
But in some rare cases, like Hawking’s,
ALS starts earlier in life.

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:49.625
Hawking’s case was also a medical marvel 
because of how long he lived with ALS.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:55.194
After diagnosis, most people with 
the disease live between 2 to 5 years

00:01:55.194 --> 00:02:00.101
before ALS leads to respiratory problems 
that usually cause death.

00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:04.115
What wasn’t unusual in Hawking’s case
was that his ability to learn,

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:04.955
think,

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.076
and perceive with his senses 
remained intact.

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:12.405
Most people with ALS do not experience
impaired cognition.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:16.005
With so much at stake 
for the 120,000 people

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.396
who are diagnosed with ALS annually,

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:22.036
curing the disease has become one of 
our most important scientific

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:23.876
and medical challenges.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.716
Despite the many unknowns,

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:31.036
we do have some insight into how ALS 
impacts the neuromuscular system.

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:36.085
ALS affects two types of nerve cells 
called the upper and lower motor neurons.

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:39.024
In a healthy body, 
the upper motor neurons,

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:40.923
which sit in the brain’s cortex,

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:44.464
transmit messages
from the brain to the lower motor neurons,

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.435
situated in the spinal cord.

00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:49.875
Those neurons then transmit 
the message into muscle fibers,

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.836
which contract or relax in response,

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.778
resulting in motion.

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:57.235
Every voluntary move we make occurs

00:02:57.235 --> 00:03:00.736
because of messages transmitted 
along this pathway.

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:03.997
But when motor neurons degenerate in ALS,

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:06.976
their ability to transfer 
messages is disrupted,

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:10.777
and that vital signaling system 
is thrown into chaos.

00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:14.146
Without their regular cues, 
the muscles waste away.

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:17.073
Precisely what makes 
the motor neurons degenerate

00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:19.961
is the prevailing 
mystery of ALS.

00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:24.529
In hereditary cases, parents pass genetic 
mutations on to their children.

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.761
Even then, ALS involves multiple genes

00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:31.132
with multiple possible impacts 
on motor neurons,

00:03:31.132 --> 00:03:34.121
making the precise triggers
hard to pinpoint.

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:38.832
When ALS arises sporadically,
the list of possible causes grows:

00:03:38.832 --> 00:03:39.640
toxins,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.472
viruses,

00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:41.273
lifestyle,

00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:45.191
or other environmental factors 
may all play roles.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.540
And because there are 
so many elements involved,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.399
there’s currently no single test that
can determine whether someone has ALS.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.480
Nevertheless, our hypotheses 
on the causes are developing.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.772
One prevailing idea is that certain
proteins inside the motor neurons

00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:03.641
aren’t folding correctly,

00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:05.730
and are instead forming clumps.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.491
The misfolded proteins and clumps 
may spread from cell to cell.

00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:13.471
This could be clogging up normal
cellular processes,

00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:17.551
like energy and protein production, 
which keep cells alive.

00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.291
We’ve also learned that along with 
motor neurons and muscle fibers,

00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:24.350
ALS could involve other
cell types.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.161
ALS patients typically have inflammation 
in their brains and spinal cords.

00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:34.280
Defective immune cells may also play 
a role in killing motor neurons.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.352
And ALS seems to change the
behavior of specific cells

00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:41.031
that provide support for neurons.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.923
These factors highlight 
the disease’s complexity,

00:04:43.923 --> 00:04:47.961
but they may also give us a fuller
understanding of how it works,

00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:50.130
opening up new avenues for treatment.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.142
And while that may be gradual,
we’re making progress all the time.

00:04:54.142 --> 00:04:56.280
We’re currently developing new drugs,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.231
new stem cell therapies 
to repair damaged cells,

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:03.591
and new gene therapies 
to slow the advancement of the disease.

00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:06.041
With our growing arsenal of knowledge,

00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:09.002
we look forward to discoveries
that can change the future

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:11.011
for people living with ALS.
