COLT MCANLIS: Hey everyone,
thank you for your time today.

00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:03.790
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.780
Today we're going to talk about
the next five billion gamers.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.325
And I got to tell
you, this is really

00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:11.660
an important topic for me.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.014
Because I love video games.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.430
Does anyone else
love video games?

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.790
Like you love-- like
it's part of who you are.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.290
Yeah?

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.040
Round of applause?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.281
Thank you.

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.780
And when I mean, I
love video games,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.113
I don't mean I just go home
and I just play video games.

00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:32.350
No, I mean I-- video games
molded me as a human being.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.850
Right?

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.016
So you've got to understand.

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:37.070
I grew up in the deserts
of Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.450
[SOMEONE HOOTS]

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.400
One guy.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.570
Nice.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.000
Now while Vegas is a
nice place to visit,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.630
it's a really crummy
place to grow up.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.296
Because as a kid,
there's really nothing

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.930
to do except dig
holes in the dirt,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.700
catch lizards, and
really figure out

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.530
creative things to
do with sunburn.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.570
Like, that's it.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.130
Right?

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.010
For me, video games
were what I did.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.764
They were who I was.

00:00:57.764 --> 00:00:58.680
They taught me things.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.360
They educated me.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.054
They let me see how
to solve problems,

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:03.970
that my princess was
always in another castle.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:11.420
This is me at age 12.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.200
And I put this up
here first off to show

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.814
that I did have hair at
one point in my life.

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:17.730
But more importantly,
because this is actually

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.790
the most influential picture I
have throughout my entire life.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.610
This is actually
the exact moment--

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.580
I had just completed Super
Metroid on the Super Nintendo.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.220
There's my handy Nintendo Power
that helped me through it.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.240
This is the exact
moment that I decided

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.270
that I was going to make video
games for the rest of my life.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.350
It was right there.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.990
Right there.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.620
We caught it on camera.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.150
The spark happened.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.320
I said, video games
matter so much to me

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.930
that this is all I want to do.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.890
And since then I've been
losing my hair slowly

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.130
but we've been doing that.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.410
Now as I've grown up with
video games since that date,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.810
video games have
grown up as well.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.685
So a lot of us, when we
started-- a lot of us

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:56.684
here in my age
group-- sorry, right?

00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:58.850
You started out with the
early consoles and arcades.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.760
Anyone remember
putting the quarter

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.420
on the arcade, like
I got next dibs.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.320
Round of applause, come on.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.530
We can't see your
hands on the screen.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.392
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:06.774
Yeah.

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:09.190
I remember I almost got into
a fight in an arcade one time

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.210
because a dude wasn't
honoring the quarter code.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.830
And I'm like, I am next
for Killer Instinct.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.270
He's like, no, you not.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.100
Whatever.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.490
Anyhow, early consoles in
arcades defined us as a culture

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.900
with video games.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.590
And from then, we actually
branched out to PC gaming

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.740
and modern consoles.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.830
We saw the rise of
the Super Nintendo

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.266
and the adoption in
the American culture.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.140
And from there things
really got interesting,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.590
when we started seeing the
adoption the early 2000s

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.680
with browser gaming,
social gaming,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.500
and of course, the
boom of mobile game.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.250
And really, that's
where we are right now.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.970
When you look at the
history of gaming,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.030
you actually see
these crests and peaks

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.404
in trends and fashions.

00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:43.820
And it just keeps
and keeps going.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.444
And where we are
today is mobile gaming

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:47.080
is a very, very mature market.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.050
It's an extremely
mature ecosystem.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.892
And working at Google,
working on games at Google,

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:53.600
the number one question
I get from people

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.870
is, what's the next big thing?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.820
What should we be doing?

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.197
The ecosystem is very mature.

00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:00.030
It's very saturated.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.310
There's lots of competition, a
lot of great content out there.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.810
But a lot of people are
wondering what's next.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.210
And there's a lot of great
opportunity out there.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.790
We've seen cloud
gaming become a thing.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.650
Neural gaming, you know,
the little headsets

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.150
that you think about the color
green and all of a sudden you

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.762
can cast Expelliarmus
on somebody.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.470
VR headsets-- has
anyone actually checked

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.340
out cardboard upstairs?

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.370
Round of applause.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.010
And the question is,
these all have opportunity

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.110
to really redefined how
humans interact with gaming.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.180
But I got tell you something.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.810
That when you add
them all together,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.180
they still don't
equal the potential

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.340
of what's going to happen in the
next decade with the next five

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.350
billion gamers.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.620
They don't even
come close when you

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.060
look at it from
this perspective.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.967
You see, in 2014, we reached
about seven billion humans

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:48.550
on the planet.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.796
Can I get a round of
applause for procreation?

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:53.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.940
You have no idea how
long I've been waiting

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.530
to get a round of applause
for humans breeding.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.620
Yeah.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.580
We had seven billion humans
on the planet in 2014.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.070
By all estimates, about
two billion of those

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.960
are connected to the internet,
which leaves roughly about five

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.699
billion who do not have
internet connectivity.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.615
Now if you look at the
trends of connectivity,

00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:15.031
the way that industries are
moving, the way the funding is

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:17.959
working, the way that the
towers are being built,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.980
the way devices are
being rolled out,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.290
everyone pretty much
has the same estimate.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.760
Which is, within
the next 10 years,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.240
that five billion
humans are going

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.050
to become connected
to the internet.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.040
In 10 years-- 2025--
we're going to get

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.940
the majority of
humanity coming online.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.190
Think about that for a second.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.090
It roughly took
us about 40 years

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.250
to get two billion
humans online.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.711
And in 10 years, we're going
to get the next five billion.

00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:46.960
We're talking about Harlem
Shake to a whole new level.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.380
And of course, this has massive
implications for gaming.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.237
Because when you talk about
who the next five billion are,

00:04:55.237 --> 00:04:56.820
you have to look at
all the statistics

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.570
and realize where
they're coming from.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.635
If you actually take
the majority of Japan

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.980
and the United States, and
look at their connectivity

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.290
saturation, we're pretty
much already saturated.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.054
If 100% of these
countries came online,

00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:12.470
we're not even
going to put a drop

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.490
in the bucket of the
next five billion humans.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.440
We are highly saturated with
respect to connectivity.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.840
However, if you look at the
lowly saturated countries,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.550
like China and
India, you realize

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.010
that when you take population
plus connectivity--

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.130
see that rise in that graph?

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.474
You realize that these
low saturation areas

00:05:30.474 --> 00:05:32.890
are where the next five billion
connected human beings are

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.980
going to be coming from.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.920
And to put this in a little
bit more perspective,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.700
let's look at the number
of mobile subscriptions

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.290
to date, right now.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.230
So that previous slide showed
China at roughly about 45%

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.900
connectivity.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.855
That represents 1.1 billion
connections on mobile devices.

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:53.060
In India, 12%
saturation represents

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.650
900 million connections.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.680
And it's going up.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.160
To put this in perspective
of Western game developers--

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.660
everyone in the
room right now who's

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.720
trying to make it big in these
markets-- the entire population

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.660
of the United States
is 317 million.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.290
If you had every single human
being in the United States

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.480
download your game
right now, you still not

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.170
equal 1/3 of 12% of the
potential of these new markets.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.317
That's the next five billion.

00:06:19.317 --> 00:06:20.900
And the cool thing
is that they're not

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.310
going to go through
the same thing we did.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.530
Right?

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.029
Like we all grew up with these
crummy laptops that basically

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:27.031
gave us face cancer
or something.

00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:27.530
Right?

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.071
Anyone remember your
face getting hot

00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:30.771
when you were
programming for too long?

00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:31.270
Nobody?

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.790
That was just me?

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.290
OK.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.532
That's probably why I'm bald.

00:06:33.532 --> 00:06:34.990
But we had this
trend where we'd go

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.155
from some of the
clunky desktops to one

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:38.040
of the more powerful ones,
everyone's on laptops now.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.530
No, these next five
billion human beings

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.696
are going to be able to
leapfrog that entire process

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:43.994
and actually jump
right to mobile.

00:06:43.994 --> 00:06:44.660
Mobile is cheap.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.610
Mobile is powerful.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.485
The amount of power in
a single mobile device

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:50.244
rivals what we had
in the early 2000s.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.660
And it's just going
to get better.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.100
It's going to get cheaper.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.641
Everyone saw in the
keynote yesterday

00:06:53.641 --> 00:06:55.690
the amazing applications,
or the amazing devices

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.250
that are coming out at
really low cost that

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.550
are going to allow
these next five billion

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.924
human beings to come online
and get access to your gaming

00:07:00.924 --> 00:07:02.900
content.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.790
But of course this brings
in problems for Western game

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.300
developers that we don't
even get understand.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.790
Here's the big one.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.330
In India, about 20% of those
individuals speak English.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.000
How many Western game
developers in here

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.690
actually speak more
than one language?

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.641
Round of applause?

00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.390
Round of applause.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.514
No, I can't see your hands.

00:07:21.514 --> 00:07:22.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.090
OK.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.940
So good.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.001
Mainland China only 0.83%.

00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:29.375
Now if you look
at the collection

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.190
in the majority
of game developers

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.330
in the Western market, they
all come from America--

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.130
these guys don't speak English.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.750
When I see an
application show up

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.520
in my store that isn't in
a language I recognize,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.000
I'm automatically
skeptical of it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.250
These individuals are going
to be acting the same way.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.700
Now let's look at this.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.947
Of the five billion
humans are connecting,

00:07:49.947 --> 00:07:52.280
we need to consider who they
are, because that basically

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.920
defines their spending habits.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.870
That defines how they're
going to interact

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.430
with the games in the
environment they were created.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.050
So in the USA, you
have to consider

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.860
if we're 88% saturated, it's
roughly the 88 upper percentage

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.310
of wealthiest individuals who
have internet connectivity.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.710
These are the individuals
who have the ability

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.376
to afford the devices and afford
the internet connection in such

00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:14.920
a leisureship way that it
doesn't put too much strain

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.590
on their day-to-day operations.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.070
Japan-- upper 75%.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.050
China-- upper 45%.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.627
India-- upper 12%.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.460
What this means for
everyone in the audience

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.232
is your users-- the users, the
next five billion human beings

00:08:27.232 --> 00:08:29.440
who are going to be coming
on looking for your game--

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.850
are not going to be coming from
the upper wealthiest echelons.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.110
They're going to be
coming from the lowest.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.610
This means that
you're going to have

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.210
to reconsider how you
define your purchasing,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.460
your marketing, your
monetization strategies.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.370
Because these people will not be
the ones who have 100% ability

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.080
to do In-App purchases
all the time.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.810
This is a great
graph of connectivity

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.230
throughout the world.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.170
You can see the darker
regions, the lighter regions.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.345
Of course, this isn't
a conservative--

00:08:56.345 --> 00:08:58.945
or an inclusive map, because
I couldn't get the resolution.

00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:01.070
But you need to also consider
the next five billion

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.150
users are not going to be
coming on from the areas that

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.245
are already massively connected.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:06.280
They're going to be coming
from the regions that

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.547
are not yet connected.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.630
Because again, if you look
at that previous slide,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.872
and we talk about
wealth and distribution

00:09:11.872 --> 00:09:13.330
and where these
people are, they're

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.850
not going to be in the
major metropolitan cities.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.900
They're going to be
right outside of that.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.340
When you look at the cost
distribution of where

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.048
you can actually afford
to live, and it's

00:09:20.048 --> 00:09:21.200
going to slowly expand out.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.660
Your users are
going to be in areas

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.212
that are developing
connectivity.

00:09:25.212 --> 00:09:26.920
And this is kind of
good and kind of bad.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.710
But the problem is we don't
know what kind of connectivity

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.300
we'll have.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.780
Most people consider
that when you

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.780
start in an urban
environment, you should really

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.196
have the best
connectivity, right?

00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:36.140
There's the most
economic funding there.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.015
You're able to build
the biggest cell towers.

00:09:38.015 --> 00:09:40.760
And as you move towards
more sparsely dense areas,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.380
you get a worse connection
at first, and then over time,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.350
they build it up.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.808
But a lot of
countries are actually

00:09:45.808 --> 00:09:47.520
leapfrogging this process.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.280
Their established infrastructure
in metropolitan areas

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.900
actually keep them from
advancing connectivity

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.670
to a point that they
can actually get 4G

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.710
and beyond connected networks.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.225
So if it's too populated, or
there's too many buildings,

00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:02.240
or there's too much
ancient architecture,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.240
they can't actually build
the cell towers there.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.280
In retrospect, or in conflict
with that, because there's

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.550
so much opportunity to
build these cell towers out

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.133
in the emerging
areas, we can actually

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:12.264
get 4G and 5G connectivity.

00:10:12.264 --> 00:10:14.180
So this means that the
five billion people who

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.610
are coming from the
lower economic areas

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.610
have better connectivity
than the people getting

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.430
paid the most money living
in metropolitan areas.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.864
Which is a little weird.

00:10:21.864 --> 00:10:23.280
The takeaway from
this is that you

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.696
have no idea what
the connectivity

00:10:24.696 --> 00:10:26.780
of these individuals
is going to be.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.461
Half of them could be sitting
in an inner city suburbanite

00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:31.960
with 2G connectivity because
they can't get anything better,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.850
basically having to hop from
Wi-Fi spot to Wi-Fi spot

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.970
to get anything done.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.790
Or they may be out
in the rural areas

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.125
with a full 4G connectivity,
but a device that

00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:41.875
can't run anything
more than a calculator.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.425
So with all this in mind,
you're game developers, right?

00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:49.300
Round of applause if
you're a game developer.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.650
Just so I know what
not to say next.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.274
Round of applause if
you're from press.

00:10:55.274 --> 00:10:56.511
[NO APPLAUSE]

00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:57.010
OK, good.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.495
We can talk about cool stuff.

00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:01.370
So let's talk about what
you guys need to do.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.520
So with all this in
your mind, hopefully

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.070
you're getting a picture of
who the next five billion are

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.069
and what this means for
you as a game developer.

00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:10.120
Let's talk about what you have
to do to actually influence

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.760
this market and be competitive
in this environment.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.800
So the first off is
localization matters, period.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.540
There's no debate to this.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.820
You have no wiggle room
to discuss localization.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.650
You can't-- this is
all that matters.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.205
You have to understand that
the movement between language

00:11:26.205 --> 00:11:29.630
as a communication as the human
brain understands the world

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.190
and perceives the
things around it

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.800
is based in our fundamental
knowledge in teaching

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.830
of language.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.430
How many people in here actually
bought JRPGs for the Dreamcast

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.840
and spent the first 30
hours trying to figure out

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.129
what the game actually was
about because you couldn't

00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:46.170
read any of the Japanese?

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.430
Anybody?

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.180
Round of applause?

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.370
Right?

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.770
Imagine that for the
next five billion gamers.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.060
They're not going
to put up with it.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.620
Right?

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.780
They expect stuff in
their local language.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.830
They're going to want to
experience your content

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.455
in their local language so they
can feel more immersed with it,

00:12:05.455 --> 00:12:06.980
have a deeper
connection with it.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.040
This is such an
important problem

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.400
that Google actually knows
that this is a huge problem.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.970
We actually have a
website dedicated

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.030
to entire resources for
internationalization.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.980
Visit this URL here.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.470
We've got 20 different tools
and products and layouts

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.230
to help you figure out how to
localize your content better.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.897
In fact, one of my favorite ones
is a pseudo-localization tool.

00:12:26.897 --> 00:12:28.980
You can actually run your
application through this

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.090
and it'll change your
fonts and actually show you

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.110
where your UI fails with
different languages.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.360
So I know it's a little hard
to see on the big screen,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.790
but you can see some of the
icons start getting clipped.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.260
You can see things become
unreadable over time.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.890
At least bare minimum, actually
seeing how your app and your UI

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.655
looks when you put it in
Mandarin versus English,

00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:50.830
it changes the way you
actually approach the game

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.280
and how your UI
should be laid out.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.380
And in fact, this is so
important that on Google Play,

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.520
we have a very simple
three-step process.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.232
We have a button.

00:12:59.232 --> 00:13:00.690
You just click the
button and we'll

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.891
do half of the work for you.

00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:02.390
Right?

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.880
You click this, you fill out
a couple things and boom,

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.130
your game will get translated.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.970
That's how important
localization

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.470
is for the next
five billion people.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.600
We don't want you
to just make a game,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.020
we want you to
make a global game.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.390
We want you to make
an impactful game.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.390
We want you to make a
game that changes people's

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.340
lives at a global level.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.760
But this has absolutely nothing
to do with the larger concern

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.550
here, which is that
localization is not

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.591
equal to culturalization.

00:13:26.787 --> 00:13:28.870
Can anyone tell me what's
wrong with this picture?

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.535
Take a second and look it.

00:13:34.535 --> 00:13:36.826
I know we were all partying
last night, it's all right.

00:13:36.826 --> 00:13:38.728
AUDIENCE: They're all violent.

00:13:38.728 --> 00:13:40.670
COLT MCANLIS: Perhaps.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.480
The problem is that
the majority of these

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.890
are actually Anglo-Saxon based.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.170
Dragons, kings, princesses,
knights, honor, swords,

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.020
round tables, chivalry.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.420
These are themes
and lore that we,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.670
in the Anglo-Saxon descendants
in Western America and Europe,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.830
we grew up on this.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.080
We know who King Arthur is.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080
He's part of our linear.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.310
He's part of our stories
that we tell ourselves.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.750
But individuals growing
up in China and in India

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.440
have no idea who the
hell King Arthur is.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.170
They grew up with a different
lore, a different way

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.250
to describe themselves
and represent themselves

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.040
in society.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.710
Where we grew up
with Lancelot, they

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.270
grew up with "Romance
of the Three Kingdoms."

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.470
These types of
environments actually

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.100
allow us to connect
with the content

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.620
at a very important level.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.840
Here's a great case study.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.465
There's a game called Ski Safari
who, a while ago, actually put

00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:33.670
out this information.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.340
Mildly successful in
English-speaking countries

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.950
in Europe and America,
and they wanted

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.674
to actually enter
the Chinese market.

00:14:39.674 --> 00:14:42.090
And so they actually put their
game out pretty much as is,

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.799
with minor localization.

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:45.090
The game really didn't do well.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.850
I mean, we're talking maybe
1% to 2% average conversion

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.640
over a six-week period.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.910
They decided to
throw the long ball

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.950
and go for complete
culturalization.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.400
They touched everything.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.460
What had previously looked like
northern peaks in Switzerland,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.960
they actually changed
it all to look

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.930
like a winter in
the Chinese hills.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.880
The result was staggering.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.450
60 x increase in monetization.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.480
The reason was because
the individuals

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.890
felt compelled and
connected to the content.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.880
It felt like the
stories they knew,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.330
the environment that
they were familiar with.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:20.830
Right?

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.680
While we all know
knights storming a castle

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.800
and pouring tar
on people, that's

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.160
not represented in
these other cultures.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.430
Culturalization
of your content is

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.547
more important than just
simply localizing it.

00:15:33.547 --> 00:15:35.380
Of course, this brings
us to the next thing,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.260
which is that you actually
need to monetize everybody,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.510
everything, all parts
of all processes, right?

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.130
The reason for this is
that how these countries--

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.384
the purchasing habits
is vastly different.

00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:49.050
In China, you have to understand
that there is a boom right now.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.500
There's a surge of
credit card companies.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.650
Credit cards are the big
competing market in China

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.590
right now.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.040
There are more people that
can issue you a credit card

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.750
than there are companies
to sell you a cell phone.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.780
This is a big industry
right now in China.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.210
And as you can see, if
you look at the trends,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.280
it's actually growing.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.700
About 23% of all
individuals in China

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.460
have a credit card right now.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.849
Take this in contrast to India,
where it's only about 1.8%.

00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:18.140
Now their industry is growing,
but it's not necessarily

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.900
that same rate.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.640
As the next five billion humans
come online in the next 10

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.170
years, they're not going
to be doing it the same way

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.590
because the infrastructure
isn't keeping up.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.216
It means a lot of
these individuals who

00:16:29.216 --> 00:16:30.756
are coming online
are not going to be

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.832
able to have that direct
In-App purchaseability.

00:16:32.832 --> 00:16:34.290
Which means you as
a developer need

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.998
to understand that
and start figuring out

00:16:35.998 --> 00:16:40.280
how to monetize these 900
million users who may not

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.990
be purchasing with
credit cards, right?

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.870
Let's go back to look at the
income versus connectivity

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.770
versus population.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.020
This effectively means that
the wealthiest individuals

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.025
in an area who are
connected and are gaming

00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:53.400
are going to be the ones who
are most likely to do In-App

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.941
purchases, because they have
the ability and access to credit

00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:56.590
cards.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.070
Everybody else most
likely is going

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.260
to be best monetized with ads.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.410
Look at that for India.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.310
The majority of
the ability for you

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.410
to monetize your Indian
audience is actually

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.920
going to come from
advertisements, not necessarily

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.055
In-App purchases.

00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:12.680
These are individuals
who we've already

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.430
seen in studies are more willing
to watch a five-minute YouTube

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.410
clip advertising something
than actually enter credit card

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.940
numbers to buy a
temporary power-up.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.680
Now a lot of game developers
would immediately just discount

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.920
this entire market for that,
because you've built yourselves

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.900
up to be an In-App purchasing
environment because that's

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.316
how the most Western
markets work.

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.490
But that shouldn't
be your strategy.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.140
Right?

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.780
Typically this is the
way that game developers

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.370
are working right now.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.920
We have some build
of our application,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.650
we upload it to the Cloud
and it goes out to a device.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.150
And what happens on that
device stays on that device.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.233
And if we want to do AB
testing or something else,

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.100
we basically have to
reissue our packages.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.759
But that can't work that way
with the next five billion

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:48.300
human beings.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.650
You see, we need the ability
to upload an APK or game,

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.760
and have it actually
change and modify,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.309
and basically respond to the
individual in the environment

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:59.100
that's actually monetizing
to it a way that

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.290
doesn't put too much strain
on us as game developers.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.870
We don't want to build 90
different versions of our game.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.405
Who's got time-- ain't
nobody got time for that.

00:18:08.405 --> 00:18:09.280
That was my one meme.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.946
You guys got one meme
out of me tonight.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.850
Basically, this is how you
want something to work right.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.430
So your APK is out in the
wild-- it's out with the phone

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.550
and you upload some
changes to your settings.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.700
You upload a new German pack
or some monetization settings

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.240
to see whether or
not individuals

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.770
will click the blue button
more to buy the red boots,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.330
and how that is
different between Germany

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.500
versus India versus Mongolia.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.962
Then you want some application
to boot up and actually say,

00:18:35.962 --> 00:18:38.420
hey, I am in Mongolia, please
give me the Mongolia-specific

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.550
data, and it comes down.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.547
This is a really big
process to build and to do.

00:18:42.547 --> 00:18:44.880
Well, the good news is Google's
already thought of that.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.750
We have something called
Google Tag Manager.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.880
Round of applause if you've
heard of this before.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:50.700
Nice.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.033
Now those people-- round of
applause if you're using it.

00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:54.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.810
All right.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.310
That was, for you on the camera
back there, that was roughly

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.580
about a 10% to 2% drop.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.600
Right there.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.740
Google Tag Manager is a
technology that effectively

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.730
allows you-- it's a client-side
tech and a cloud tech that

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.440
basically allows
you to say, hey, I'm

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.350
going to upload a bunch of
different name value settings

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.820
in pairs and data files that
represent different builds

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.630
and configurations of my game
depending on these parameters.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.586
And as phones basically boot
up and provide their statistics

00:19:20.586 --> 00:19:21.960
to the Cloud-based
resource, they

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.069
will get specifically the name
value pairs and the information

00:19:25.069 --> 00:19:26.110
that you provided for it.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.860
And the cool thing
is you can keep

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.760
doing this on a daily
basis and the user never

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.896
has to re-download the APK.

00:19:32.896 --> 00:19:34.770
They just get your JSON
setting files-- well,

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.960
hyper-compressed
JSON session files.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.904
This is really nice,
because this effectively

00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:40.570
means if you do your
game the right way,

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.986
you can put settings
in there that

00:19:41.986 --> 00:19:45.240
allow you to monetize people
differently without drastically

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.870
having to change your build.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.271
A skew in China can actually
start offering people

00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:52.520
more In-App purchases if you
notice that their ability

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.240
to view ads is
actually diminished.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.810
Versus in India,
you can actually

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.150
start them with ads as a
primary viewing mechanism.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.930
And then over time, if you
see that their behavior starts

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.360
changing to In-App
purchases, you

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.776
can modify the entire behavior
of your app with Google Tag

00:20:05.776 --> 00:20:07.781
Manager without having
to reissue the APK.

00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:09.780
Because again, we're
talking about connectivity,

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.640
we're talking about lower
echelons of economic ladders

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:11.960
here.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.585
Maybe these people
don't have the money

00:20:13.585 --> 00:20:15.810
to actually pay for bits
to get down on the wire.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.640
So AB testing gets
really difficult.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.689
This actually brings me to
a really touchy subject.

00:20:21.689 --> 00:20:23.230
So I don't know if
you guys have seen

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.374
my videos on Compressor Head.

00:20:25.374 --> 00:20:26.040
Compressor Head?

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.081
Round of applause if you've
seen Compressor Head?

00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:28.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:29.580
So that's like four people.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.079
OK.

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:31.840
Everybody go watch
Compressor Head.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.879
It's a bald man rambling
about compression algorithms.

00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:36.420
So here's my second
meme for the day.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.570
Your apps are too big and you
should feel bad about that.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.200
Period.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.408
Everyone in here-- if you're
making a game right now,

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:44.990
your game is too big and you
should feel bad in your heart

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.180
about what you're doing.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.940
Here's why.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.060
I wanted to figure out what the
hell was going on in the gaming

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.409
ecosystem on Google Play.

00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:53.450
I wanted to figure out
why our games were so long

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.695
and why they took
so long to download.

00:20:54.695 --> 00:20:56.770
So I actually downloaded
a large majority of them

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.759
and start doing
analysis on our games.

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:00.550
What I found out was
that the top free game

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.560
was roughly about
34 megs in size.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.160
The top paid game, 125 megs.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.381
That's huge for a mobile game.

00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:11.880
Right?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.009
The limit is how are people
using extension packs?

00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:15.300
There's a lot of content there.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.550
Let's put this in perspective.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.730
If you're running on
a 1G or 2G connection,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.600
that's about three minutes
to download a free game.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.309
So a lot of the free
developers nowadays,

00:21:24.309 --> 00:21:26.141
they pay a lot of money
for user acquisition

00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:28.410
to click on an ad to go to
the page to then download

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.905
their application to
hope to get a conversion

00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:31.950
and they're adding three
minutes into the middle

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.660
that pipeline for the user
just to get your bits.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.180
You can see a
sudden drop off when

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.420
you-- how many people
in here have done that?

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.870
When you're like, oh, I'm
going to download this game,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.340
and then you forget about it.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.881
And five days later
you're like, when

00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:44.530
the hell did I
install this game?

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.034
Round of applause,
please, please.

00:21:46.034 --> 00:21:47.626
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:47.626 --> 00:21:49.250
Everyone developing
games, look around.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.025
Those are you're constituents.

00:21:50.025 --> 00:21:52.066
These are the people who
are having this problem.

00:21:52.066 --> 00:21:55.060
And for 125 megs, that's
a ten-minute download.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.085
Who's got time for 10 minutes?

00:21:57.085 --> 00:21:59.343
This is the 2000s man, come on.

00:21:59.343 --> 00:22:01.176
I got to give a talk
and then go walk around

00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:04.334
with cardboard
strapped on my face.

00:22:04.334 --> 00:22:06.000
So I decided to dig
in a little bit more

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.210
because I was a little
bit upset about this.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.110
I wanted to figure out where the
bloat was actually coming from.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.830
So I open up all of these
APKs and did analysis.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.250
And what I saw was
actually really

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.740
embarrassing and striking to me.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.740
What I saw here is--
you can see this

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.050
is a breakdown of content--
and the number one

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.450
contributor to size was
actually image data.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.270
By a majority of factor.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.280
We're looking at easily
roughly about 50% of all APKs

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.400
is just image data.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.500
If you dig in a little
bit deeper with this,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.970
you can actually see that
it's majorally PNG files.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.950
75% of all the image
data is PNG files.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.360
Now for those you who don't
understand PNG as a technology,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.560
PNG is an image format
that's only lossless.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.670
Which means it's not actually
reducing any of the procedural

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.720
or the perceptive
bits of information

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.270
to actually get
larger compression.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.536
Other formats like JPEG
and or GIFF or JIFF--

00:22:58.536 --> 00:22:59.910
depending on what
side of a fence

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.670
you're on on that
one-- or GPU formats

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.894
actually taken into account
lossy versions of this.

00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:07.060
They'll effectively reduce
the amount of color space

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.865
that the human eye
can discern in order

00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:10.240
to take advantage
of compression.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.710
And that's why those file
formats are so small.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.710
PNG does no such thing.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.520
Which means the best
you can absolutely

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.460
hope for it maybe 50%?

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.746
60%, if you're lucky.

00:23:21.746 --> 00:23:23.120
If you've got a
full black image,

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.940
maybe you can get
down lower than that?

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.760
PNG is not what you
should be using.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.940
These are devices in their
pockets with powerful GPUs.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.520
And if you notice
up there, the GPU--

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.145
that's the blue mark-- the GPUs
is actually one of the smallest

00:23:34.145 --> 00:23:36.630
used in there.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.130
GPU textures are really
what you should be using.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.200
This is what I hoped to see,
which was the majority was GPU

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.530
and the minority was PNG.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.410
And here's why.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.520
GPU textures compress
smaller than PNGs,

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.120
which means that not only
is your distribution size

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.880
is going to be smaller,
but your GPU residency size

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.880
is going to be smaller.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.505
That's something you
have to understand

00:23:56.505 --> 00:23:58.070
about PNG and JPEG
and GIFF formats.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.920
Is while they transmit small
during your distribution,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.970
they have to be
inflated to full 32 bits

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.510
per pixel when their
resident on your GPU.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.130
If a user has one
or two games open

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.540
and they're all conflicting
for space using 32-bit,

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.320
fully inflated textures?

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.110
That's a lot.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.630
Think of it this way--
a 10kx10k texture

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.820
atlas at 32 bits per
pixel is four megs.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.860
For 256 meg devices that
are strapped to your face

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.880
or to your wrist, that's
a lot of residency.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.180
Let's put this in a much
different perspective.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.322
OK, so let's take this little
256x256 image of a parrot face.

00:24:33.322 --> 00:24:34.280
Everyone likes parrots?

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:34.900
Cool.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.780
The PNG size for
this on disk-- this

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.660
is the distribution size
of 107k-- the GPU memory--

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.720
so the inflated version is 192k.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.530
I want to put this in contrast
with the GPU formats--

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.480
so DXT1, PVR and ETC.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.110
You can easily see
that their disk size

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.210
is equal to their
GPU residency size.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.190
But here's the striking part.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:57.170
If you add all three of these
together, it's only 80k.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.280
So if you were to actually
take your PNG file

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.680
and compress it in
DXT, PVR and ETC

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.110
and ship that instead
of the PNG file,

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:11.491
it still would be 50% smaller
in GPU residency and 20% smaller

00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:12.365
in disk distribution.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.972
Please use
GPU-formatted textures.

00:25:17.972 --> 00:25:20.430
If you do nothing else from
this talk besides this rambling

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.130
guy who was talking about
people in India and China,

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.755
walk away from this knowing that
the first thing you need to do

00:25:24.755 --> 00:25:27.250
is investigate how to get
GPU-formatted textures

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.150
into your pipeline.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.730
Because individuals
in these areas

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.700
are going to be downloading your
content with restricted devices

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.326
with smaller bandwidth, with
higher connectivity costs.

00:25:37.326 --> 00:25:39.200
And this is going to be
the main thing that's

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.440
going to give you the
ability to breach that.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.390
So here's the deal.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.637
We don't know
what's next, right?

00:25:48.637 --> 00:25:49.470
I can stand up here.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.170
I can predict it.

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.128
I'm wrong, no matter
what, no matter what I say

00:25:52.128 --> 00:25:53.361
is the next big thing.

00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:54.360
I can say it's a device.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.296
I can say it's grass
blowing in the winter,

00:25:56.296 --> 00:25:58.420
or some robotic butterfly
that can make you coffee.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.500
It doesn't matter.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.780
The next big thing is unknown.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.049
It could be a new
bird-based game,

00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:05.840
where you're throwing
birds at other birds.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.500
I don't even know.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.214
Every bird game seems
to be a big thing.

00:26:08.214 --> 00:26:09.880
It could be a new
technology that people

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.450
strap to their
faces, or give them

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.533
a better understanding of
the environment at hand.

00:26:13.533 --> 00:26:16.670
We don't know what the next big
technology or the next big fad

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.170
is.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.330
But we know that in
the next 10 years,

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.660
five billion human beings are
going to be coming online.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.640
And they're going to be gamers.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.750
Because that is what we
do as a human species.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.750
We play games.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.480
It's something that
has changed my life

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.160
and the lives of many of
the people in this room.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.290
And you have to understand that
when these five billion humans

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.914
come online for the
first time and they

00:26:35.914 --> 00:26:38.340
get that device their hand
and they play that first game,

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.960
it is going to
change their lives.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.280
Just like it did some
bald kid growing up

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.390
in the Las Vegas desert.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.690
Your job as game
developers is to make sure

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.380
that that game that changes
their lives is yours.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.750
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.790
Thank you for your time.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.400
Go build something great.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.950
[APPLAUSE]
