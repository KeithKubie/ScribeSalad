Yes my name is Lawrence Masha, I'm the Minister
of Home Affairs for the United Republic of

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.980
Tanzania. My belief is that the world cup
in 2010 coming to South Africa can benefit

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.190
not just South Africa but Africa as a whole.
It really depends on how we, as other countries

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.029
with in the continent, prepare ourselves for
this particular event coming. And we in Tanzania,

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.830
am I happy to say, have prepared ourselves
well. We are making sure that we will be advertising

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.870
our country in conjunction with the 2010 world
cup. And I would just like to give the opportunity

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.620
to welcome all those who are listening to
me now to visit Tanzania, see the resources

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.269
we have in terms of tourism. Tanzania is a
beautiful world cup destination in addition

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:47.849
to South Africa.
