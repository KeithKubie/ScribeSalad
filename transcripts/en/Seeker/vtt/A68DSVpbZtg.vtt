If this were TV, we'd start with something
like, "Cute, cuddly and deadly.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.450
These are the pets you CAN'T own, but wish
you could!"

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.710
Hey everyone, welcome to DNews!

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.610
I'm Trace and pets are fun, right?

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.660
Until they're not pets and they're wild animals...
but who decides where that line is?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.980
The federal government says pets don't include
exotic or wild animals, but what is EXOTIC?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.790
Well, the definition is SO broad, that there's
no easy way to define it.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.820
In the Dictionary, it's defined as anything
non-native to the region in question -- but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.900
that's even BROADER.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.070
In the U.S. it comes down to state laws, but
then some states classify new cat and dog

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.690
breeds as exotic pets, while others have zero
regulations for a-typical pets.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.750
We almost got a ferret when I was a kid.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.050
They're regulated or banned in many states
and are the poster-child for illegal pets

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.530
that you just want to cuddle.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.670
A ferret is the domesticated version of a
European Polecat.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.530
They're related to the weasel and the mink
and are primarily from, you probably guessed,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.530
Europe!

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.930
They were declared bloodthirsty vermin under
the reign of Elizabeth the First, and were

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.500
almost extinct in Britain -- though they've
since rebounded.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.360
Owning a ferret as a pet can be tricky, they're
cute, but they smell due to natural scent

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.690
glands on their backsides.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.240
In California, they've been illegal since
1933 because they're non-native, but really

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.110
if a ferret was to get loose and procreate
with another ferret or a related species...

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.660
there wouldn't be a natural predator to control
the population and well, that would stink.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.190
Other pets like hedgehogs and chinchillas
tow the exotic line as well.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.960
The African Pygmy hedgehog is the pet you'd
usually see on the 'net, and they're illegal

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.850
to possess in California, Georgia, Pennsylvania
and Hawaii and restricted in Maine and Arizona,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.150
but most states are cool with them.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.811
Being an African species, the worry is their
ability to start invasive, non-native populations

00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:58.270
and overrun the natural environment.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.830
Hedgehogs require a lot of socialization when
they're young to keep them from stabbing you

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.610
with their spines when nervous.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.340
They might be cute, but they can definitely
be a difficult pet to own.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.849
One of the most exotic, interesting pets people
try to own are chimpanzees.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.840
Twenty-one states ban the possession of non-human
primates, and 12 more have regulations for

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.030
their ownership.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.349
Even so, many jump in without doing research
which can be downright devastating.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.099
Chimpanzees share 99% of their genetic information
with humans.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.610
Getting a chimp is akin to getting a child
for 50 to 60 years that is seven times stronger

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.180
than an adult man, and will never be fully
domesticated.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.889
They've got their own physical, emotional
and mental needs, and when they're not met...

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.510
terrible things can happen.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.819
In 2009, a 55-year-old Connecticut woman was
attacked by her friend's pet chimp and was

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.819
permanently disfigured.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.950
The illegal pet trade is kind of ridiculous.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.909
For example, there are more tigers kept as
pets than there are tigers in the wild!

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.290
Owning definitively exotic animals have come
back to bite in some places.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.650
One man in Ohio owned over 50 lions, Bengal
tigers, wolves, cheetahs, leopards, monkeys,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.909
apes, a grizzly bear, ... he had a lot.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.849
In 2011, he freed the animals and committed
suicide.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:18.849
Yeah.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.419
That being said, there are plenty of people
who still crave the feeling of bringing the

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:22.790
wild into their home.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.430
Some feel it's a connection with nature, others
love the uniqueness of owning something no

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.430
one else has...

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.079
But wild animals are still wild.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.129
And yet there are a lot of exotic beasts that
you CAN own, at least in certain states.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.219
If you wanna know what some of the weirdest
ones are, be sure to check the video on it

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.809
from our friends over at Animalist News.

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.189
What exotic pet would you own if you could
and why?
