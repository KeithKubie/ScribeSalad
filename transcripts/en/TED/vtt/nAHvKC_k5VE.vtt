00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:17.684
We live in a world
increasingly tyrannized by the screen,

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:21.640
by our phones, by our tablets,
by our televisions and our computers.

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:23.967
We can have any experience that we want,

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.627
but feel nothing.

00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.574
We can have as many friends as we want,

00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:30.089
but have nobody to shake hands with.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.939
I want to take you
to a different kind of world,

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:35.598
the world of the imagination,

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:39.847
where, using this most powerful
tool that we have,

00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:43.065
we can transform both
our physical surroundings,

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.140
but in doing so, we can change
forever how we feel

00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:50.459
and how we feel about the people
that we share the planet with.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:56.312
My company, Artichoke,
which I cofounded in 2006,

00:00:56.336 --> 00:00:58.829
was set up to create moments.

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:02.091
We all have moments in our lives,
and when we're on our deathbeds,

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:04.639
we're not going to remember
the daily commute to work

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:05.818
on the number 38 bus

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:09.650
or our struggle to find a parking space
every day when we go to the shop.

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:13.084
We're going to remember those moments
when our kid took their first step

00:01:13.108 --> 00:01:15.476
or when we got picked
for the football team

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.388
or when we fell in love.

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:21.699
So Artichoke exists to create
moving, ephemeral moments

00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:25.905
that transform the physical world
using the imagination of the artist

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.291
to show us what is possible.

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:32.076
We create beauty amongst ruins.

00:01:32.474 --> 00:01:34.396
We reexamine our history.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.101
We create moments to which
everyone is invited,

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:39.549
either to witness or to take part.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:43.649
It all started for me
way back in the 1990s,

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:48.424
when I was appointed as festival director
in the tiny British city of Salisbury.

00:01:48.448 --> 00:01:50.349
You'll probably have heard of it.

00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:54.316
Here's the Salisbury Cathedral,
and here's the nearby Stonehenge Monument,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.090
which is world-famous.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:02:00.408
Salisbury is a city that's been dominated
for hundreds of years by the Church,

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:01.716
the Conservative Party

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.924
and the army.

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:07.528
It's a place where people
really love to observe the rules.

00:02:07.552 --> 00:02:10.512
So picture me on my first
year in the city,

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:13.711
cycling the wrong way
down a one-way street, late.

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:14.892
I'm always late.

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:17.067
It's a wonder I've even turned up today.

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:18.625
(Laughter)

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.552
A little old lady on the sidewalk
helpfully shouted at me,

00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:23.839
"My dear, you're going the wrong way!"

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:26.578
Charmingly -- I thought --
I said, "Yeah, I know."

00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:28.584
"I hope you die!" she screamed.

00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:29.808
(Laughter)

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:33.140
And I realized that this was a place
where I was in trouble.

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:35.993
And yet, a year later,

00:02:36.017 --> 00:02:39.947
persuasion, negotiation --
everything I could deploy --

00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:41.916
saw me producing the work.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.506
Not a classical concert in a church
or a poetry reading,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.723
but the work of a French
street theater company

00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:49.502
who were telling the story of Faust,

00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:54.027
"Mephistomania," on stilts,
complete with handheld pyrotechnics.

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.940
The day after, the same little old lady
stopped me in the street and said,

00:02:57.964 --> 00:03:01.437
"Were you responsible for last night?"

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:02.944
I backed away.

00:03:02.968 --> 00:03:04.785
(Laughter)

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.142
"Yes."

00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:10.141
"When I heard about it," she said,
"I knew it wasn't for me.

00:03:10.165 --> 00:03:12.932
But Helen, my dear, it was."

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:14.642
So what had happened?

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:17.416
Curiosity had triumphed over suspicion,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.125
and delight had banished anxiety.

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:27.083
So I wondered how one could transfer
these ideas to a larger stage

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:31.675
and started on a journey
to do the same kind of thing to London.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.563
Imagine: it's a world city.

00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:37.601
Like all our cities, it's dedicated
to toil, trade and traffic.

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:40.445
It's a machine to get you
to work on time and back,

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.781
and we're all complicit in wanting
the routines to be fixed

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:48.816
and for everybody to be able to know
what's going to happen next.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.338
And yet, what if this amazing city
could be turned into a stage,

00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:56.371
a platform for something so unimaginable

00:03:56.395 --> 00:03:59.628
that would somehow
transform people's lives?

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:01.400
We do these things often in Britain.

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:03.471
I'm sure you do them wherever you're from.

00:04:03.495 --> 00:04:05.174
Here's Horse Guards Parade.

00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:08.603
And here's something that we do often.
It's always about winning things.

00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:10.680
It's about the marathon or winning a war

00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:12.736
or a triumphant cricket team coming home.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.392
We close the streets. Everybody claps.

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.845
But for theater? Not possible.

00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:22.379
Except a story told by a French company:

00:04:22.403 --> 00:04:25.941
a saga about a little girl
and a giant elephant

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:28.264
that came to visit

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:29.644
for four days.

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:32.681
And all I had to do was persuade
the public authorities

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:36.302
that shutting the city for four days
was something completely normal.

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:37.717
(Laughter)

00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.479
No traffic, just people
enjoying themselves,

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:45.403
coming out to marvel and witness
this extraordinary artistic endeavor

00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:48.353
by the French theater
company Royal de Luxe.

00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:50.416
It was a seven-year journey,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.196
with me saying to a group of men --
almost always men -- sitting in a room,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.543
"Eh, it's like a fairy story with
a little girl and this giant elephant,

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:02.917
and they come to town for four days

00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:06.233
and everybody gets
to come and watch and play."

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:07.903
And they would go,

00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:09.978
"Why would we do this?

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.385
Is it for something?

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.513
Is it celebrating a presidential visit?

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:18.351
Is it the Entente Cordiale
between France and England?

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.319
Is it for charity?
Are you trying to raise money?"

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:22.841
And I'd say,

00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:25.221
"None of these things."

00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:28.750
And they'd say, "Why would we do this?"

00:05:29.393 --> 00:05:33.029
But after four years, this magic trick,
this extraordinary thing happened.

00:05:33.053 --> 00:05:35.932
I was sitting in the same meeting
I'd been to for four years,

00:05:35.956 --> 00:05:37.518
saying, "Please, please, may I?"

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:39.557
Instead of which, I didn't say, "Please."

00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:43.782
I said, "This thing that we've
been talking about for such a long time,

00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:46.020
it's happening on these dates,

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:47.984
and I really need you to help me."

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.229
This magic thing happened.

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:54.804
Everybody in the room somehow decided
that somebody else had said yes.

00:05:54.828 --> 00:05:56.946
(Laughter)

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.075
(Applause)

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:06.004
They decided that they were not
being asked to take responsibility,

00:06:06.028 --> 00:06:09.512
or maybe the bus planning manager
was being asked to take responsibility

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.541
for planning the bus diversions,

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:15.917
and the council officer
was being asked to close the roads,

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:19.752
and the transport for London people were
being asked to sort out the Underground.

00:06:19.776 --> 00:06:23.237
All these people were only being asked
to do the thing that they could do

00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:24.618
that would help us.

00:06:24.642 --> 00:06:26.878
Nobody was being asked
to take responsibility.

00:06:26.902 --> 00:06:31.177
And I, in my innocence, thought,
"Well, I'll take responsibility,"

00:06:31.201 --> 00:06:34.788
for what turned out to be
a million people on the street.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.905
It was our first show.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:40.426
(Applause)

00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:46.223
It was our first show, and it changed
the nature of the appreciation of culture,

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:49.497
not in a gallery, not in a theater,
not in an opera house,

00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.523
but live and on the streets,

00:06:51.547 --> 00:06:55.102
transforming public space
for the broadest possible audience,

00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:57.598
people who would never
buy a ticket to see anything.

00:06:57.995 --> 00:06:59.176
So there we were.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.660
We'd finished, and we've continued
to produce work of this kind.

00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:07.916
As you can see, the company's
work is astonishing,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.661
but what's also astonishing is the fact
that permission was granted.

00:07:14.654 --> 00:07:17.258
And you don't see any security.

00:07:17.282 --> 00:07:20.701
And this was nine months
after terrible terrorist bombings

00:07:20.725 --> 00:07:22.672
that had ripped London apart.

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:24.863
So I began to wonder
whether it was possible

00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:29.054
to do this kind of stuff
in even more complicated circumstances.

00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:31.804
We turned our attention
to Northern Ireland,

00:07:31.828 --> 00:07:34.420
the North of Ireland,
depending on your point of view.

00:07:34.444 --> 00:07:38.753
This is a map of England,
Scotland, Wales and Ireland,

00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:40.416
the island to the left.

00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:43.625
For generations,
it's been a place of conflict,

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:46.682
the largely Catholic republic in the south

00:07:46.706 --> 00:07:50.359
and the largely Protestant
loyalist community --

00:07:50.383 --> 00:07:52.705
hundreds of years of conflict,

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.494
British troops on the streets
for over 30 years.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:59.506
And now, although
there is a peace process,

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.598
this is today in this city, called
Londonderry if you're a loyalist,

00:08:03.622 --> 00:08:05.927
called Derry if you're a Catholic.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:09.755
But everybody calls it home.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:10.962
And I began to wonder

00:08:10.986 --> 00:08:15.514
whether there was a way in which
the community tribalism could be addressed

00:08:15.538 --> 00:08:17.564
through art and the imagination.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.311
This is what the communities do,

00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:21.909
every summer, each community.

00:08:21.933 --> 00:08:25.939
This is a bonfire filled
with effigies and insignia

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:28.426
from the people that they hate
on the other side.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.411
This is the same
from the loyalist community.

00:08:31.435 --> 00:08:35.760
And every summer, they burn them.

00:08:35.784 --> 00:08:37.529
They're right in the center of town.

00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:41.838
So we turned to here,
to the Nevada desert, to Burning Man,

00:08:41.862 --> 00:08:43.390
where people also do bonfires,

00:08:43.414 --> 00:08:46.267
but with a completely
different set of values.

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:51.135
Here you see the work of David Best
and his extraordinary temples,

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:54.223
which are built during
the Burning Man event

00:08:54.247 --> 00:08:56.864
and then incinerated on the Sunday.

00:08:56.888 --> 00:08:59.632
So we invited him
and his community to come,

00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:04.451
and we recruited from both sides
of the political and religious divide:

00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:06.367
young people, unemployed people,

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.103
people who would never
normally come across each other

00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:10.685
or speak to each other.

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:14.519
And out of their extraordinary
work rose a temple

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:17.861
to rival the two cathedrals
that exist in the town,

00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:20.011
one Catholic and one Protestant.

00:09:20.035 --> 00:09:23.212
But this was a temple to no religion,

00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:24.617
for everyone,

00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:27.601
for no community, but for everyone.

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:30.885
And we put it in this place
where everyone told me nobody would come.

00:09:30.909 --> 00:09:33.442
It was too dangerous.
It sat between two communities.

00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:35.952
I just kept saying,
"But it's got such a great view."

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:37.976
(Laughter)

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.664
And again, that same old question:

00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:41.410
Why wouldn't we do this?

00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:42.747
What you see in the picture

00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:45.631
is the beginning of 426
primary school children

00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:48.400
who were walked up the hill
by the head teacher,

00:09:48.424 --> 00:09:51.227
who didn't want them
to lose this opportunity.

00:09:51.251 --> 00:09:53.661
And just as happens in the Nevada desert,

00:09:53.685 --> 00:09:56.154
though in slightly different temperatures,

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:59.891
the people of this community,
65,000 of them,

00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:05.272
turned out to write their grief,
their pain, their hope,

00:10:05.296 --> 00:10:07.083
their hopes for the future,

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.295
their love.

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:10.452
Because in the end,
this is only about love.

00:10:11.032 --> 00:10:13.605
They live in a post-conflict society:

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.759
lots of post-traumatic stress,

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:16.968
high suicide.

00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:19.077
And yet, for this brief moment --

00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:22.272
and it would be ridiculous to assume
that it was more than that --

00:10:22.296 --> 00:10:26.782
somebody like Kevin -- a Catholic
whose father was shot when he was nine,

00:10:26.806 --> 00:10:28.316
upstairs in bed --

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:31.144
Kevin came to work as a volunteer.

00:10:31.168 --> 00:10:34.837
And he was the first person to embrace
the elderly Protestant lady

00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:39.436
who came through the door on the day
we opened the temple to the public.

00:10:40.185 --> 00:10:43.197
It rose up. It sat there for five days.

00:10:43.221 --> 00:10:49.114
And then we chose -- from our little tiny
band of nonsectarian builders,

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:52.252
who had given us their lives
for this period of months

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:54.789
to make this extraordinary thing --

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:59.472
we chose from them the people
who would incinerate it.

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.658
And here you see the moment when,

00:11:02.682 --> 00:11:09.508
witnessed by 15,000 people who turned out
on a dark, cold, March evening,

00:11:09.532 --> 00:11:15.420
the moment when they decided
to put their enmity behind them,

00:11:15.444 --> 00:11:19.345
to inhabit this shared space,

00:11:19.369 --> 00:11:24.166
where everybody had an opportunity
to say the things that had been unsayable,

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.399
to say out loud,

00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:28.680
"You hurt me and my family,
but I forgive you."

00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:32.392
And together, they watched

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:36.060
as members of their community let go
of this thing that was so beautiful,

00:11:37.394 --> 00:11:40.053
but was as hard to let go of

00:11:40.077 --> 00:11:43.039
as those thoughts and feelings

00:11:43.063 --> 00:11:45.257
that had gone into making it.

00:11:47.163 --> 00:11:52.077
(Music)

00:11:57.487 --> 00:11:58.940
Thank you.

00:11:58.964 --> 00:12:05.529
(Applause)
