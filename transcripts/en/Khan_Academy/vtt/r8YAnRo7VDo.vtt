00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:01.789
- All right so we've been talking about

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:03.800
the later stages of the Civil War.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.222
And in the last video we
just did a brief overview

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:08.534
of the end of 1863

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:11.745
after the north has won
the battle of Gettysburg

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:16.095
and Lee has been turned
around and sent back down

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:20.204
to Richmond where he will
be encamped for some time

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:23.787
and Ulysses S. Grant
not only takes control

00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:28.834
of the Mississippi River with
the victory at Vicksburg,

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:31.196
he also comes up into Tennessee,

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:34.148
takes control of the state of Tennessee

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:38.313
and in return Lincoln
makes him General in Chief

00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:40.242
of the Union armies.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:44.211
So now let's move on and talk about 1864

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:48.653
and Sherman's March of the
Sea and the election of 1864.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:52.235
Both would be very important
to the United States victory.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:54.628
All right so let's take
a look at our map again.

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:57.961
Now as we recall Lee is here in Richmond

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:02.806
and Grant who was in Tennessee

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.597
now coming over to challenge Lee

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:10.844
at the siege of Richmond.

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:13.785
So Grant has crossed over
from the Western theater

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:16.401
of the war where he's been
pretty much the entire time

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:18.133
into the Eastern theater

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.787
and he's going for the killing blow now.

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:25.013
You're remember that thanks
to the Anaconda strategy

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:27.096
the union now has control

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.798
of the entire area of the South

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:34.753
through a blockade on this side,

00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:38.466
control of the Mississippi
and now control of Tennessee.

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.094
So there's just this
litte area that's left.

00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:42.361
So now what happens?

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.964
Well one of Grants generals who served

00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:49.793
under him in this Tennessee campaign

00:01:49.793 --> 00:01:52.115
is now going to turn his attention

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:56.654
to a massive campaign of
total war in the south.

00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:59.120
So this is William Tecumseh Sherman

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.537
and Sherman's idea is that he is going to

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:06.062
cut a swath through the South

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.096
and he is going to try to
destroy the South's morale

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:17.353
by not only trying to
get rid of food stuffs

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.715
and interrupt supply lines,

00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:24.715
destroy infrastructure, burn houses.

00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:28.873
He's gonna make things
so bad on the home front

00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.574
that the Confederate
soldiers who are fighting

00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:33.879
up here with Lee are gonna get upset

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.372
that their property and their families

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:38.086
are not being protected at home.

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:41.834
So he's trying to win a morale victory

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.814
by making people in the South really tired

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:49.185
of being at war and also
by making Lee's soldiers

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:51.156
want to desert and come back

00:02:51.156 --> 00:02:53.309
and defend their home territory.

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:57.131
So Sherman turns his troops toward Atlanta

00:02:57.131 --> 00:02:59.131
and in September of 1864

00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:02.913
Sherman takes Atlanta.

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:06.592
There's a very famous scene
of this in Gone with the Wind

00:03:06.592 --> 00:03:09.242
where you see Scarlet O'Hara looking out

00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:13.572
over the many injured people
in the city of Atlanta.

00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:15.725
That's Sherman's doing.

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.824
But now let's turn attention away

00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:20.039
from the military campaigns for a second

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.551
and talk about the politics of 1864.

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:25.357
Now in 1864 it's an election year.

00:03:25.357 --> 00:03:26.737
It's been four years

00:03:26.737 --> 00:03:29.609
since Lincoln was elected
in November of 1860

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.152
so now Lincoln has to
stand for reelection.

00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:34.961
And this is a really interesting election

00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:36.666
for lots of reasons.

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:39.336
One is that it's the first election

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.503
during wartime since 1812.

00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:45.132
So in the election of 1864

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:47.455
soldiers are going to cast their ballots

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:51.739
either by getting short
leaves to go to the ballot box

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.432
or by sending in their ballots by mail.

00:03:54.432 --> 00:03:56.179
Another thing that's really
interesting about this

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.085
is that Lincoln is not at all sure

00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:00.705
that he's going to win this election.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:03.515
In fact many in his own
party, the Republican Party,

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:07.049
feel that he's been considerably
too soft on the south,

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.360
that his plans for reunification

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.676
are not nearly punitive enough.

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:13.735
There are many who want to replace Lincoln

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:16.818
with a more radical candidate in 1864

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.403
but that does not end up happening.

00:04:20.403 --> 00:04:22.806
But one interesting thing
that does end up happening

00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:26.431
is to try to increase Lincoln's appeal

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:29.664
his running mate is Andrew Johnson.

00:04:29.664 --> 00:04:32.263
Johnson was a slaveholder,

00:04:32.263 --> 00:04:34.952
believe it or not from Tennessee

00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:38.306
and the idea was that
maybe Johnson could pick up

00:04:38.306 --> 00:04:40.925
some of the Democrats
who might necessarily

00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:42.943
have voted for McClellan

00:04:42.943 --> 00:04:45.300
and maybe he could pick up
some of the border states

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.839
the same way that we often might

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.876
choose a vice president today

00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:51.036
because they come from
a crucial swing state.

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:52.605
And this is gonna be important later

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.974
because after Lincoln is assassinated

00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:57.361
Andrew Johnson will take over as president

00:04:57.361 --> 00:04:59.567
and he is quite a different president

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:02.486
then Lincoln might have
been in the circumstances.

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:04.262
Now on the Democratic side

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.231
the candidate is George McClellan.

00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:09.109
You might remember
McClellan because he was one

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:11.370
of the first commanders of the Union army

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.149
and Lincoln sent him down for failing to

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:17.495
really go after the enemy strongly

00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:19.326
in the early stages of the war.

00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:20.822
Now the Democratic Party is having

00:05:20.822 --> 00:05:22.689
some internal struggles at this point.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.406
There are some who think that the war

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:26.427
against the South is very foolish,

00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:30.362
that no one should be fighting
in the north to end slavery

00:05:30.362 --> 00:05:34.176
which Lincoln has clearly
made a war goal by this point.

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:36.677
So many just wish to have peace

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:39.094
with the South on the terms of the South

00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:41.282
which is as a separate nation

00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:43.207
with the continuation of slavery.

00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:44.866
And then there are those Democrats

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:47.088
who would like to continue the war

00:05:47.088 --> 00:05:49.818
and McClellan ends up being one of those.

00:05:49.818 --> 00:05:51.205
Obviously being a general,

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.747
it would have been
pretty difficult for him

00:05:53.747 --> 00:05:55.483
to say that the war was pointless

00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:57.535
without having disappointed so many people

00:05:57.535 --> 00:05:59.615
who had fought for him or with him.

00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:01.133
This election is really crucial

00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:04.026
because many in the South are hoping

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:07.209
that if someone other
than Lincoln gets elected,

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:09.257
if the Democrats are elected,

00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:12.145
that is gonna be their last best hope

00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:16.398
to try to achieve their
independence from the union.

00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:19.884
If Lincoln is replaced by
someone who is pro-South,

00:06:19.884 --> 00:06:23.053
who is pro-slavery then perhaps
they'll just end the war

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:24.270
and that would be the end of it.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.671
So whites the South are really holding on

00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:31.491
to the idea that Lincoln
will be defeated in 1864.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.388
And there are a lot of
reasons to think that Lincoln

00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:35.163
might have been defeated in this.

00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:37.642
Lincoln himself was not very sure

00:06:37.642 --> 00:06:39.522
that he will win this election.

00:06:39.522 --> 00:06:43.308
Remember that there has not
a single American president

00:06:43.308 --> 00:06:46.597
who has been reelected
in more than 30 years.

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:48.356
The last president to be reelected

00:06:48.356 --> 00:06:51.417
was Andrew Jackson in 1832.

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:56.234
So reelection is very a
unusual thing at this point

00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:58.808
and McClellan was a very popular general.

00:06:58.808 --> 00:07:01.622
He got popular because he was very keen

00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:03.701
to spare the lives of his soldiers

00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:06.044
which is quite different
from the approach that

00:07:06.044 --> 00:07:07.864
Ulysses S. Grant will end up taking

00:07:07.864 --> 00:07:09.458
at the end of the war.

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.722
But there are several things
that go in Lincolns' favor.

00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:16.204
One is the capture of Atlanta
by Sherman in September

00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:19.477
and some very good military victories

00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:22.375
also in this eastern theater of the war.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:25.663
So McClellan who had hoped
that the war was going badly

00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:27.240
didn't have much on his side

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.077
when it actually came to election day

00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:31.354
'cause at that point the
war was going pretty well.

00:07:31.354 --> 00:07:33.291
Remember that Sherman is here in Atlanta

00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:36.054
and Sherman is now going to pick up

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:39.212
what is known as his March to the Sea

00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:41.962
when he cuts a 60 mile wide swath

00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:46.109
of destruction through Georgia.

00:07:46.109 --> 00:07:47.473
So things are looking pretty good

00:07:47.473 --> 00:07:49.418
for the United States at this point.

00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:52.018
And the turning point for
Lincoln in this election

00:07:52.018 --> 00:07:53.982
is really the votes of the soldiers

00:07:53.982 --> 00:07:57.382
and they have a really
strong pro-Lincoln mandate.

00:07:57.382 --> 00:07:59.049
One of Lincoln's campaign slogan

00:07:59.049 --> 00:08:01.042
is Vote As You Shot.

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:03.767
So Lincoln ends up trouncing McClellan

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:06.392
in the election of 1864

00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:10.027
and he really comes away
with a strong mandate

00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:12.116
to finish the war,

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:15.631
finish it with an unconditional
surrender of the South

00:08:15.631 --> 00:08:17.255
and the end of slavery.

00:08:17.255 --> 00:08:20.341
And having triumpthed
in the election of 1864

00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:23.239
Lincoln it gets even more
good news from Georgia

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:26.572
which is a telegram from General Sherman

00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:31.114
from the city of Savannah

00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:32.506
saying Mr. President,

00:08:32.506 --> 00:08:34.898
I wish to offer you the city of Savannah

00:08:34.898 --> 00:08:36.711
as a Christmas present.

00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:38.628
So in December 25, 1864

00:08:39.992 --> 00:08:42.342
Sherman's March to the Sea has concluded.

00:08:42.342 --> 00:08:46.809
And from there he's going
to start heading north.

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:48.923
And we'll get to that in the next video.
