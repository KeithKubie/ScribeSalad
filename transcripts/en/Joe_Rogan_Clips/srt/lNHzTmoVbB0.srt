1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,450
Oh, so going back to this
asteroid impact, oh, sorry.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,490
There is a layer somewhere around 66
million years ago that indicates that the

3
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:11,460
Earth got hit by an asteroid. That's
what I mean. That's why I say that. Yeah.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,340
I think it's,
the layer is high in uranium.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
I think an iridium has a,
it's very rare on earth,

6
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:20,850
but very common in space and uh,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,930
there's a bunch of other indications
that that's the time that it hit.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,560
But what they're saying on the radio
lab one is that the current state of

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,590
understanding is that the dinosaurs and
basically most things died within the

10
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,820
first couple of hours. Like all the
dinosaurs, they were all apparently there.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,200
Their bones or their fossils are in that
iridium layer a lot of times. Right.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,920
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. They found a
lot of, they find him before too. Right?

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,770
They don't just don't find
any after these things. Yeah.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,960
They think that their
blood boiled in their body.

15
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:56,680
They think it got so hot that during
the few hours he got to like 700,

16
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,480
a thousand degrees, 1200 degrees.
It just got insanely hot.

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,060
It was trying to get better
at stand up and stand shape.

18
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,450
Now I gotta worry about fucking
that's a fulltime job. Raise my kids.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,610
That's what we really
should be thinking about.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,620
Not just how bad were
fucking the earth up,

21
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,280
but how bad something could fuck
the earth up from the sky. Yeah.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,480
That's what we really should
be paying attention to.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,170
Instead of paying attention to so
many nonsensical things that people

24
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,004
concentrate on,

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,150
there's a real chance that we could get
hit in our lifetime with something that

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,390
ends civilization like that.
Yeah. 100% can happen. Yep. Yeah.

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,430
I had Graham Hancock on last week and we
were going over his new book. This book.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,590
Where is it? Isn't it right here, Jamie?
It's right there. It's fucking up.

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,530
It's excellent.

30
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,760
And Graham was talking about
to call the America before.

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,640
It's the evidence of civilizations
in the Americas, in North Americans,

32
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,390
particularly in the Amazon,

33
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,170
that they think that there was
millions of people live in the Amazon.

34
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,390
But when the European
explorers came over here,

35
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,190
the game smallpox and wiped out everyone.
Yeah.

36
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,950
And they came back hundreds
of years later. And there
was nothing. Yup. Like the,

37
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,830
the entire civilization way down.
I think.

38
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,570
I feel like in 1492 or
whatever there was that,

39
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,910
I think when the Spanish came up through
the Mississippi Delta, the same thing.

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,990
Yeah, same thing. Yeah.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,790
They wiped out 90 but like a lot of people
think that the genocide of the native

42
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,270
Americans was just European soldiers and,
and people and settlers,

43
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,390
killing native Americans, which did
happen, but it was also influential.

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,220
90% of them were killed by disease.

45
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,100
90% like the entire population.
While they even had,

46
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,260
they even had certain government
policies where they're like,

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,230
do you missionaries are going out
there and trying to convert them to

48
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,110
Christianity.
You're giving them your diseases.

49
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:43,190
They knew that back then they knew that
they were like, you're, you're there.

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,680
They're getting sick and they're dying of,
you know,

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,940
there were all of a sudden they were like,

52
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,280
we're getting these colds
and people are dying.

53
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:54,690
They didn't have any resistance to that
crazy at those dirty Europeans with

54
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:59,590
their shit. Water shoots outside their
house and fucking vermin running around.

55
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,020
That was war of the worlds. I remember
war of the worlds, that movie,

56
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,870
how did they die?
They weren't ready for pathogens.

57
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,720
That's my whole philosophy
on we all try to be tough.

58
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,870
One of the things about all of us as men
or anybody is we hate to be who phone.

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,460
Horrible. So you know, I
trained and I, I stay in shape,

60
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,990
I eat well and I'm going to live forever.

61
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,480
I don't think there's
anything such thing as,

62
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:24,400
I don't think you can be
really ready for a situation,

63
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,750
you know,
in a bar I guess.

64
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:30,620
And then you get bit by a tick or
you get a flesh eating disease. Yeah.

65
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,620
And you'd die. Sure. So I don't know if
there's any way to get mercy to yourself.

66
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,630
Well, I mean you can protect yourself,
but you are ultimately very vulnerable.

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,720
But then this radio lab was freaking me
out about was that there's so many of

68
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,740
those things floating around in the sky.

69
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:50,530
I mean this is what Graham talked
about in not just this book,

70
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,490
but an in previous books that they think
that something slammed into the earth

71
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,160
somewhere in the past
that ended the ice age.

72
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,990
Probably wiped out at a giant chunk of
the large megafauna on North America,

73
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,550
led to almost instantaneous extinction
of so many different animals.

74
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,700
And so it goes, yeah, and so it
goes, and it can happen again.

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,460
There could be a super volcano.
There's all kinds of stuff like that.

76
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,930
All these fucking things,
and it makes you,

77
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,700
what if announced toward
was going to hit Denver?

78
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,650
NASA was practicing that this week.
Dan. Dan had done this before.

79
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,470
They've had like a practice run
using a bunch of the different,

80
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,170
here's the practice, run, get
in the boat, go to Australia.
