ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: I actually
just finished doing a

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.400
videotaped deposition for eight
hours about putting

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.690
Napster on download.com and
CNET, and writing tutorials on

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.160
how to use it.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.890
So this is all very
fresh in my mind.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.090
And in fact, the legal battles
are still going.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.070
ALEX WINTER: Very
much so, yeah.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.780
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: So I thought
you did a great job

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.840
with the film.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.250
It's a massively important
topic.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.590
The internet only
happened once.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.770
Peer to peer only showed up
for the first time once.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.420
And they're both here
with us forever.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.240
What do you see as the relevance
of the Napster story

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.340
to today's technology?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.410
ALEX WINTER: Well,
I think a lot--

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.270
and I think it's a funny thing,
because in some ways

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.710
it's late for a Napster story.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.310
In a lot of ways, it's too early
for a Napster story.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.090
And I feel more on the latter
than I do on the former.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.640
The heart of what Fanning
innovated and disrupted in

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.560
terms of his vision was about
looking at the internet as a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.340
place where everybody could be
communally connected, and that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.990
there would be a democratic
flow of information and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.310
content and all connected by
people all over the world, and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.720
sort of like the idea of
something that Google has

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.390
dealt with subsequently of
cataloging and indexing

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.600
everything.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.980
I mean, the stuff that he was
interested in mostly was

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.880
firstly, the social community
aspect, and then the notion of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.500
being able to find things
that were not

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.600
freely and easily available.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.310
So I think that strikes
at the heart.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.660
That's what I found interesting
about Fanning when

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.800
I first met him over
10 years ago.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.410
That's what I found
interesting about

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.370
Napster when I used it.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.680
And certainly, those, I think,
are the more prevalent issues

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.400
that are facing us today in
every corner of the tech

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.430
sector, whether it's Google,
YouTube, the issues around

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.610
that, some of the battles
that are being

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.820
fought there with Viacom--

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.670
who paid for this movie,
by the way--

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.280
and other people, all the way
to Arab Spring, and Bradley

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.640
Manning, and the NSA Snowden
scandal, and issues about

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.820
transparency, freedom of
information, internet rights.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.990
These are things when Napster
erupted in '99 and I got onto

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.580
it, I'd gotten online in the
late '80s, and it was so

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.040
obviously a seismic shift, and
such a big rock in the water.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.570
It was clear in '99
that the world was

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.520
never going to go back.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.940
So we're still, as you said,
dead in the middle, if not

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.730
actually in the infancy of the
battles for the future that

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.590
are happening right now.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.060
There's absolutely zero
resolution in sight, as far as

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.500
I can tell.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.210
So that's why I think
it's relevant.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.560
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Yeah.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.635
My favorite saying that I've
coined about this, thank you

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:15.400
very much, was that the internet
is a perfect tool for

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.010
freedom or control.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.090
And it seems like Napster was
on the freedom side of the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.910
equation for sure, and it just
seemed incompatible with the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.030
control part that now seems
to be happening

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.820
sometimes on the internet.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.050
ALEX WINTER: Yeah.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.590
And I think that something
that's really often overlooked

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.490
about Napster--

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.660
and I get this a lot, because
I've been talking about this

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.990
movie a lot since we made it and
went on the road with it--

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.390
the very first question I
always get in Q and As--

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.270
I wouldn't get it at Google, but
when I'm not dealing with

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.470
technology people is oh,
where can we download

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.650
this movie for free?

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.620
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: That's
my last question.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.080
ALEX WINTER: Yeah.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.760
And it always makes me laugh.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.980
But it's sad, because my answer
is very mundane in that

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.620
Napster was never a piracy
service, and it wasn't created

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.930
as a philosophical
piracy service.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.900
So your question is interesting,
because to me,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.410
Napster sums up the duality of
the internet in one company.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.310
Because they were
not Pirate Bay.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.529
These were guys with
an ethos--

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.170
and there's things about Pirate
Bay that I love, so

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.779
it's not a pro or con thing.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.630
But these were not anarchists
who were specifically out to

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.920
create a decentralized system
that would be unstoppable.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.910
Quite the opposite.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.050
They intentionally created a
centralized system, knowing

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.300
that in doing so, they had to
have some affiliations with

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.940
businesses.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.430
They were not going to survive
as a company--

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.310
and they wanted to survive,
they wanted to make money,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.130
they wanted to be a business--

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.430
if they couldn't do deals with
the labels and the various

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.070
interests whose content they
were moving around.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.850
So here was a company that was
both at once about freedom of

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.690
the internet, and
also required a

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.010
certain amount of control.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.220
And I think that because of that
need, especially at that

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.540
era of the internet, there was
no way that they would ever

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.750
have survived, because they were
trying to bridge-- the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.080
people that survived
were people like,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.620
say goodbye to control.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.770
We're all about freedom, and
you can basically kiss our

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.150
backsides, because we don't
really want to do

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.300
business with you.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.380
And hopefully, we'll
dismantle you.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.040
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Right.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.730
So in your mind, after speaking
to everybody,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.400
interviewing everybody that you
interviewed in the film,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.910
which is a huge breadth of
people, was it ever your

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.470
impression that the so-called
legal Napster that was a

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.040
subscription service--
did that ever

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.250
really stand a chance?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.250
Did anybody think that?

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.920
ALEX WINTER: I know a lot of
people very much did think

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.920
that it would stand a chance,
because there were some very

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.810
powerful businesspeople who
were working tirelessly to

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.630
make a subscription service.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.200
Did Fanning and Parker and Ali
Aydar and the core Napster

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.580
guys think--

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.770
I mean, it's questionable.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.550
I don't want to make people
angry in retrospect by saying

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.390
what I think about that.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.520
But I think it's questionable.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.690
I think that they realized by
the time they got around--

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.140
because you have to remember
that once you're injuncted,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.460
you can't innovate.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.110
You can't do any R and D. You
can't do any work on the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.730
product at all.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.410
So they were baked in lucite
at a certain point by the

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.910
legal system.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.280
Once that happened, a lot of
them just felt like the game

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.520
was up no matter
what they did.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.640
And it went on like
that for years.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.700
I remember when I first met
Fanning as Napster was

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.610
crumbling, and I said to him,
what to you was the highest

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.720
high you had on this
whole process?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.320
When was the greatest moment?

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.990
He said, everything was great
until I hit send and

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.030
uploaded the app.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.150
He goes, everything up until
then was awesome.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.240
He says from the moment he
uploaded it, within a very

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.170
short period of time,
he realized

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.650
that they were screwed.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.390
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Right.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.930
And it is a shame that there
still isn't really a great way

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.090
to access all that stuff.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.330
I mean, the way that I
used to use Napster--

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.530
I would pretty much just search
for Mogwai that I was

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.790
really into, and then if anybody
had them, I would know

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.880
that anything else they
had, I would be

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.450
probably into that too.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.540
Nobody who just is only into
Metallica is going to have a

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.130
Mogwai song.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.480
And so it's like, that
was my litmus test.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.110
And then it's like, oh, here's a
live Mogwai show, and here's

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.730
some band that's not even on a
label that sounds like that.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.740
Might have been an Explosions In
The Sky song in your movie.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.310
So it seems like there still
isn't anything like that.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.580
And what was it, 60
million users

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.660
Napster had at some point?

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.640
So Spotify right now, which
is the biggest on demand

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.520
subscription service, has
not even half that

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.620
worldwide in 2013.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.410
I think SoundCloud has more
users than that, but nobody

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.440
makes any money from that.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.090
So do you think that
there's a chance?

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.740
Can copyright ever possibly be
reformed to the point where

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.330
there can be an all you can eat
Napstery service that has

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.030
all the grey area files?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.980
ALEX WINTER: You know, I don't
think we have a choice.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.920
I think that the sad truth of
it is, a lot of people wish

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.610
that a lot of things
would go away.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.320
I think that there are people
that wish that people would

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.710
stop legislating against
innovation on the one side.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.440
I think on the other side, there
are certain sectors of

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.340
the industry that just wish
the internet would go away

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.690
completely.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.570
I think the reality of it is
that we have no choice but to

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.350
reform copyright.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.720
Now, frankly, in my opinion,
copyright desperately needs to

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.270
be reformed anyway.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.420
It's Byzantine, and it's built
around pre-existing systems

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.780
that aren't even relevant
anymore and haven't been for a

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.169
very long time, for
the most part.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:44.450
So I think that we currently
live in a world where neither

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.890
the consumer or the artist
is being well served.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.430
So I think copyright law

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.880
desperately needs to be reformed.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.080
And I think that frankly,
YouTube is the only example I

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:01.790
can think of an online service
where you have an opportunity

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.960
to find content that isn't
freely available.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.740
That's the closest thing, in a
way, to what Napster had in

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.360
that it's a searchable
database.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.210
But the difference being,
obviously, that-- and this is

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.540
all going to change
and evolve--

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.730
is that it doesn't yet have the
curation component that

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.210
Napster had in '98, '99, where
it was very easy, like you

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.590
just said about Mogwai, to drill
down and find the stuff

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.512
you were looking for that led
you to more stuff that you

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:32.990
were looking for.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.810
It was kind of a fractal-like
experience.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.310
I remember for me, because I'm
a jazz fan, I was immediately

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.590
after rare and unreleased
jazz bootlegs.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.110
That was my Napster thing.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.740
And I was able to drill down and
drill down and drill down

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.640
and just find unbelievable stuff
very, very, very quickly

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.930
over dialup.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.100
That does not exist right
now in any service.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.520
But it's coming, and copyright
notwithstanding, it's coming.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.040
So we have to reform the laws to
catch up to the technology.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.300
I mean, as Ron Conway says in
the movie, you can't stop the

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.060
technology.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.170
You can't.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:10.580
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: It's true.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.430
I mean, I view file sharing as
kind of a pressure valve on

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.290
the legal services.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.970
Like, if they don't get it
right, everybody's going to go

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.270
back to Napster.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.810
And of course, there's
BitTorrent sitting there.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.800
And some of these are
still around.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.400
But to me, it seems like really,
it's kind of worked as

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.000
a pressure valve.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.970
I mean, would there be
a Spotify had there

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.410
never been a Napster?

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.240
Let's maybe talk about
this a little bit.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.060
So in your film, there's
this idea that--

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.470
I forget who said it, but
there's Napster led to

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.880
Friendster, Friendster begat
MySpace, MySpace begat

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.260
Facebook and Google+ and
everything else.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.625
So do you buy that?

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.310
Do you think Napster is like
the granddaddy all of these

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.250
social services?

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.580
ALEX WINTER: Well, I'm just
a guy who made a movie.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.510
So sure.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.300
In my opinion, absolutely,
because that's what I

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:10.030
experienced with my relationship
to technology.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.120
That was how it worked for me.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.360
I can tell you that everybody
that I know in the tech sector

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.050
feels that way.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.650
Everybody I've met super high
up the food chain in that

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.000
world all credit
Fanning with--

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.220
I mean, there are sort of
grumbly, mumbly people as

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.810
competitive as everybody can
be who are just like,

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.880
obviously, this would have
happened at some point.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.410
It was coming.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.200
But I think what you can't take
away from those guys was

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.120
their ability to scale that
service, which had not been

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.110
done before.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.180
Their ability to get it
to 60 million users.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.940
Their ability to move content
around that quickly in the age

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.590
of dialup was radically
innovative.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.980
And also, the sheer disruptive
nature of what Fanning and

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.450
Parker put out there.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.100
And you can argue--

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.850
I went to great pains to not get
bogged down in the ethics

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:03.770
discussions in the movie.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.160
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Yeah, how
do you respond to that?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.180
ALEX WINTER: Because I feel
very, very strongly that the

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.140
world that we live in,
especially with the way the

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.540
media works and the news media
works in this day and age,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.770
things get very quickly
mythologized.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.940
And I think that once they
do, you lose specificity

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.040
completely.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.710
And to me, the Napster debate
always being focused around

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.250
this notion of piracy versus
artists rights or the

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.640
industry's rights was so
specious and inaccurate, and

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.000
caused, I think, an extra 10
years of not understanding

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.160
what was really going on.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.700
The fact that we're still in
court arguing over various

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:55.110
clauses of the DMCA in 2013 just
says to me that nobody,

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.430
for the most part, has any idea
what the hell is actually

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.710
going on, how to solve it.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.410
And I think it's irresponsible
to just keep creating this

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.880
very buzzworthy debate about
kids in baseball caps who want

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.400
to steal shit and the
man who's trying to

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.460
hold onto the product.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.920
I just think it's irrelevant.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.150
And I think that the reality of
the world we're in is that

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.750
the technology has happened.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.520
A lot of really innovative
people are driving it forward.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.530
A lot of people are
trying to stop it.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.220
And the fact is, as you just
said, it's going to evolve

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.260
with or without this
legislation.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.610
So the best thing we can
possibly do is stop bickering

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.830
about the ethics and go,
guess what, guys.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.500
We live in this world now.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.980
Let's start working out ways of
serving the consumer, the

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.020
artist, various people, and
getting the laws adjusted that

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.110
we need to get adjusted rather
than criminalizing people and

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.990
pointing fingers at who may or
may not be right or wrong for

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.500
wanting to download something,
either for free or for less

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.080
money than somebody wants
it to be spent on.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.970
I just think it's irrelevant.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.550
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: So what do
you think about artists--

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.330
I mean, there a few that--

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.480
I guess Thom Yorke is the
most notable one--

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.430
who are opting out of the quote
unquote "legal services"

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.545
that have descended
from Napster.

00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:14.690
I mean, Spotify uses peer
to peer technology.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.330
Shawn Parker's involved.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.960
It's free if you want
it to be in the US.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.160
And what's your take on artists
that are just saying,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.970
no, we don't want that either.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.530
ALEX WINTER: I think, in a
way, all of it's good.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.440
Like, I have my own opinions
about Thom Yorke's response to

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.600
Spotify, that a lot of people
like Bob Lefsetz have

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.050
responded to very articulately
in that you can take it off

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.060
Spotify, yet it's still
on YouTube.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.650
So it doesn't make a lot of
sense from a technological

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.060
standpoint.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.890
I think that the argument that
artists need to be fairly

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.560
compensated is valuable.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.170
I think it was valuable with the
record industry before the

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.940
technologies, and I think it's
valuable in this new landscape

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.370
we live in.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.380
I think people fighting
for artists--

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:57.900
I'm an artist.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.880
People fighting for the rights
of artists are good people.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.010
So I think that, again, I'm
really against creating black

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.650
and white out of gray.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.040
So I think we live in
a world of gray.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.890
I think that people are going,
OK, so you're innovating over

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.620
there, Spotify.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.820
Well, that's cool, but we don't
like X, Y, and Z. So

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.980
Spotify can respond and maybe
fix some aspect of X, Y, and

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.210
Z.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.120
So I think the democratization
of these evolutionary

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.590
technologies to the degree that
they can be democratic is

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.150
a good thing.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.620
It's better than shutting
people up.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.470
I don't always agree with
them, but I'm happy for

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.770
someone to heckle someone is
trying to build something.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.700
You might make them build
a better mouse trap.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.350
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Well, that's
a very mature way of

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.890
looking at.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.840
I think back then, everyone--

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.680
ALEX WINTER: Yeah, I'm old.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.920
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: I guess we
all are, a little bit more

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.530
than back then, because
it really was a

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.290
black and white thing.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.120
It was like, for us or against
us, and very ideological.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.560
And I think it is helpful
that a lot of people

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.180
have gotten past that.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.990
And I got a press release the
other day about I guess you

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.730
can now back up your phone using
peer to peer technology

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.230
to your own computer.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.070
Like, your own peer, and somehow
bounce it around in

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.960
secure packets or something.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.760
And anyway, it seems like now
it's coming out that there are

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.660
many, many legitimate uses for
this technology as I recounted

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.030
at length during my recent
videotaped deposition.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:26.240
So, shifting gears a bit,
first, let me go here.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.780
We had a 16-year-old intern
where I work, and he's coming

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.240
from a very different place.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.900
He's what they call
in your film a

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.790
digital native, I guess.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:41.030
And he said that when he's
assigned work in school, to

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.800
read something, that literally
nobody actually

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.140
reads the book anymore.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.490
I mean, even with Shakespeare
or something, it's like, it

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.620
wasn't even Cliff Notes.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.600
It's Spark Notes or something is
what they're all using now.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.800
And his question to me
was like, what are

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.770
you going to do?

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.460
How are you going to write long
form stuff to people like

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.950
me who are never going
to read it?

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.130
And I was like, hmm, yikes.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.700
Do you see the documentary or
the video form as the new long

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.960
form journalism, or is this
how more complicated

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.270
information is going
to be relayed?

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.760
ALEX WINTER: I don't.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.839
I honestly don't.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.650
I really, really don't.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:21.369
And I've got three kids, and my
three year old will sit in

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.180
front of a magazine and
try to move the screen

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.720
like it's an iPad.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.620
So I get that the world
is changing.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.640
But I've been saying this
for years within

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.800
my own content unions.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.980
I'm in four different unions,
and there's a sky is falling

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.480
mentality that I just think is
so completely erroneous.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.800
And I think that, yeah, change
hurts some people.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.260
Innovation causes disruptions,
which causes certain aspects

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.130
of our lives to change.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.170
But if there's one thing we've
learned in the last 150 years

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.160
of massive, accelerated change
is there's room for many

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.700
different types of people, and
many different platforms.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.550
And the radio is going to kill
the newspaper, and the movie

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.750
was going to kill the radio, and
TV was going to kill the

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.710
movie industry, and Betamax was
going to kill the movies,

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.720
and downloading music
was going to

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.160
kill the music industry.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.020
And it's all nonsense.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.460
And it just keeps getting proven
over and over and over

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.400
again to be nonsense.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.280
But it's like one more person
talking about why

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.320
write novels anymore?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.840
It's like, go on the subway.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.790
People are reading novels.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:41.010
My kid, who's 14, 15, is a
voracious novel reader.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.760
He reads novels faster
than I do.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.940
He reads all of them.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.480
You know what I mean?

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.080
So I don't think it's
going away.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.340
I think that the world's
filled with people.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.200
There's lots of people in this
world, and there are many

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.610
different types of people
in the world.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.140
And they like consuming their
stuff in different ways.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.220
And you've this one kid who's
like, maybe he's got ADD.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:00.830
I don't know.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.700
But he doesn't want to read
anything that's long.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.450
I don't either, and I'm an old
guy, you know what I mean?

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.330
So I may be more like him by
nature, and the technologies

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:15.380
are serving me in many ways that
I like, because I do like

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.570
doing a lot of different
things at

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.130
once, as opposed to--

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.860
But I think it's a temperament
issue, and I just think the

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.170
world we live in now offers you
that many more outlets for

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.140
consuming whatever culture you
want however you want.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.610
I think that the fact that print
media is beginning to

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.380
respond to these changes as
well as they have, when

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.860
everyone thought they'd be the
first place to go under--

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.500
like, completely.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.640
Why the hell would you ever
read a newspaper again?

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.100
Well, people are reading
them in various forms.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.620
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Well, there
you go with that nuanced

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.640
viewpoint again, where it's
not one or the other.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.420
And I actually think
as a writer, text

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.130
does have its place.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.320
I think it's actually, in terms
of the information per

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.400
minute, it doesn't do
badly against other.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.820
I mean, it depends what you're
trying to present.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.230
About the documentary process.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.630
So, I mean, I think we can
both agree that it's

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.260
important, whether or not it's
going to replace other long

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.000
form information relay
techniques.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
So I'm sure there are people
watching this that have had an

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.570
idea to do a documentary about
a phenomenon that's important

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.380
the way that Napster is, was.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.220
How does one go about
doing this?

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.280
You've got so many people on
camera that were just involved

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.470
with this from the start.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.320
How do you do this?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.960
What do you do?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.176
I'm sure it's really
easy, right?

00:20:38.176 --> 00:20:39.665
ALEX WINTER: Well, like I said,
I started working on

00:20:39.665 --> 00:20:41.120
this project in '02.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.100
I wrote it as a narrative for a
major studio in '03 and '04.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.420
It went into turnaround, which
means it was just sitting in

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.330
development, and
I walked away.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.160
I came back to it in '09, and
I decided to make it a doc,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.460
because I felt like there were
so many prevalent issues in

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.080
Napster's story that would be
better served having the

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.390
original people talk about it
than me putting words in their

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.780
mouth as a narrative.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.160
The fact is that documentaries
are in a golden age.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.920
I think that because-- and this
is going to sound very

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.570
buzzwordy, but they are like
a multi-platform media.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:20.850
For instance, with Downloaded,
our distribution rollout is

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.440
theatrical, nine different types
of digital, streaming,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.570
free streaming, ad aggregated
streaming, downloadable,

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.930
whatever, on all
these portals.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:38.300
They're a good, present
day piece of content.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.535
They are hard to get
made, because

00:21:39.535 --> 00:21:40.490
they're hard to monetize.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.560
I mean, documentaries are tough
to monetize, so you have

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.830
to really find people who just
want to tell the story and get

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:47.710
the story out there.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.300
But they exist, and there are
more of them now than there

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.040
ever have been.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.660
I mean, for all the kvetching
people do in my industry about

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.950
how much worse things are now,
there's way more opportunity

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.710
now than there ever was in terms
of the amount of buyers

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:06.010
and the amount of content
distribution networks.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.910
I mean, there's more popping up
every day via the net, via

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.560
conventional TV, or whatever.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.640
So I think if you have an
interesting enough idea and

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.330
you're willing to stick with
it, I think you have a good

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.500
chance of getting
something made.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.990
The other beauty about a doc
is you can just make it.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.400
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: True.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.840
ALEX WINTER: I mean, you could
just make it and then

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.560
distribute it yourself, or build
into the structure of it

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.140
later with the financing.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.300
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: That's an
interesting way to do it.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.220
Sort of cart before the
wagon, but who cares?

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.720
ALEX WINTER: In this day and
age, I mean, that's it.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.960
There's no cart or
wagon anymore.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.930
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Right.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:37.280
Yeah.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.920
I meant horse cart, but yeah,
I take your point.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.720
So I had an interesting day
around this whole time that

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.140
the film is about.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.500
So I was sitting there at CNET,
and there were a bunch

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.520
of people from News.com.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.530
John Borland, who had a
story in here, and a

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.730
bunch of other reporters.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.740
And we had Hilary Rosen in the
room, from the RIAA, right, I

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.650
think, during the end
of her tenure.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.670
And we grilled her for, I don't
know, an hour or two

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:09.410
hours, 20 reporters, all
recording things in her face.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.870
And she was very
nice about it.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.140
I was surprised that she didn't
actually breathe fire

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.240
after everything I'd
heard about her.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.610
So we all peppered her with
questions forever.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.200
And then at the end of it, she
goes, now I have one question

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.610
for all of you.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.390
What would you do
if you were me?

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.270
And we were like, oh, gosh.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:33.200
So she's got the labels going
after her on one side, and

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.200
then she's got the entire
internet mocking her on the

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:36.830
other side.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.840
And I think in your
film, she comes

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.050
off as kind of agreeable.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.240
But what would you have done?

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.670
Say that you're Hilary Rosen
around this time.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.650
What do you do?

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.260
ALEX WINTER: Well, if I'm Hilary
Rosen, and I'm working

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:55.200
for a trade organization that
represents an industry that's

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.210
in a battle, and I'm being paid
handsomely by that trade

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.970
organization, I fight for my
trade organization or I leave.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:04.800
And I don't mean to be glib.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.090
I think the facts speak
for themselves.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.330
She left eventually.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.430
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: She did, and
she left, notably, before

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.280
they started suing
actual fans.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.600
ALEX WINTER: I think she left
specifically before they

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.160
started suing individual fans.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:25.320
And I think they're all in
a very tough position.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.450
I think the labels are
in a tough position.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.770
I think that the RIAA is still
in a tough position.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.370
The one thing I'm not--

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.280
I'm certainly gray, but
I'm not cavalier.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.570
There's two things that happen
in any kind of revolution like

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.880
this, whether it's cultural
or political.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.690
It's sexier to side
with the new guys.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.660
You know what I mean?

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.000
And you feel like the winner if
you side with the new guys.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.550
So I think psychologically, I
always try to tug against that

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.990
inclination within myself to
just go, yeah, this is cool

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.460
and it's new, so I'm just
going to side with this.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.680
I think that there are things
that have to get worked out,

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.170
and I think that it is incumbent
upon the new leaders

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.330
in the space--

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.390
which is predominantly Google,
to be completely honest, at

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.430
this point in time--

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.810
to really very carefully
navigate this terrain.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.250
I don't think it's
easy for them.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.300
I don't think it's easy for the
pre-existing businesses.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.980
I don't think it's easy
for the artist.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.680
To some degree, I don't think
it's easier for the consumer,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.760
because they're going, Jesus, am
I a criminal if I do this?

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.280
Am I actually breaking
the law?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.300
But I want to do it, and
everyone's telling me to do

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.510
it, and it's definitely more
convenient and a better system

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.730
than this creaky old one they're
trying to bend me to

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:44.980
go back into.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.350
I would say that we're
all Hilary Rosen.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:54.240
I think everybody's facing these
very tough choices right

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.280
now every day.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.800
I think that what's really
interesting--

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.480
not to try to elevate the
Napster story beyond where I

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.670
think it deserves to go,
but I think there's

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.950
a correlative between--

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.410
I mean, look at what's going
on with the Syria decision.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.030
You now have the democratization
of information

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.520
to do to a degree that you've
never had it before.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.900
So you've got the government
saying, oh, no, no.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.380
We've got to do.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.460
And everyone's behind us.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.190
And everyone's going,
well, no we're not.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.940
Now, in the past, you wouldn't
hear everybody

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.900
saying no or not.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.710
There would no way to hear that
voice other than at the

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.760
water cooler.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.650
Now we know that there are tens
of millions of people out

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.980
there via social media saying,
well, actually, no, we don't

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.750
really want to bomb Syria.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.220
Now Obama's Hilary Rosen.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.715
Everybody's now stuck
in this position of

00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:43.650
just going, oh, crap.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.080
How do we deal with the fact
that on the one hand, we need

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.740
to have control, and on the
other hand, there's this all

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.690
of this freedom of
information?

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:51.070
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Right.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.520
So it seems like--

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.940
this was going to be one
of my questions.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.640
Do you view peer to
peer technology

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.240
as inherently political?

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.950
It sounds like yes.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.200
ALEX WINTER: I think everything
is inherently

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.550
political, because look how
quickly the peer to peer issue

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.610
became political.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:09.060
I mean, I saw it
coming in '99.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.480
To me--

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.430
and Fanning said it himself
the day I met him.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.610
He said that Napster has nothing
to do with music, and

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.240
I got that completely when
I got on Napster.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.890
It was like, it could've
been anything.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.680
The idea to move music around in
a way was a delivery system

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.970
for Shawn, because he
knew that that was

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:24.740
like the pied piper.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.750
That would get the kiddies
to come to the party.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.140
The party is what mattered.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.260
The party was the end
game, not the lure.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.530
So of course it was going to
get political, and it got

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.224
political very, very quickly.

00:27:37.224 --> 00:27:38.540
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Indeed.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.000
So I was one of these people
who was a big believer in

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.470
SNOCAP, and followed it all
the way to its end.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.980
I forget who acquired it, and
it kind of fizzled out.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:57.330
But this idea of a universal
database that has audio

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.500
fingerprints of music, and
people can go claim that, and

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.910
then other people know
who owns it.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.580
Or if nobody is claiming
something--

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.850
I talked to a guy from the IFPI
who said he was working

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.960
on something like that-- like
universal identifiers for

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.360
songs so that people know what
it is and what the rules are

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.350
associated with it.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.460
And then he emailed me again,
and he was like, I'm getting

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.890
fired, and I can't talk
to you anymore.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:21.185
ALEX WINTER: Yeah.

00:28:21.185 --> 00:28:24.050
The NSA showed up at his house
and dragged him away.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:24.510
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Possibly.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.800
Who knows?

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.480
But I don't know.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.080
Do you have any hope of
something like this?

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.480
I guess content Id on YouTube is
kind of like that, where it

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.930
just knows this song, the
money goes to that guy.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.930
This song, nobody wants.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:38.050
ALEX WINTER: Yeah.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.245
I think that what's
interesting--

00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:41.860
I remember I was hanging around
with Fanning a lot when

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.950
he was working on SNOCAP.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.090
That was predominantly when I
was writing the movie the

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:45.640
first time.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.560
So I was in the trenches
on that, and

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.360
watched what he was--

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.100
And it was amazing, both the
courage that he had.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.400
And then he had Hilary
Rosen on his board.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.840
It was really an amazing
turnabout from what he had

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.040
dealt with before in that he
had a lot of support from

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.990
within the industry.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.570
People that had villainized
him were aware that he was

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.450
actually trying to help
solve the problem.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:14.040
But it was just brutal to watch,
because it was just way

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.880
too much too soon to
try to do that.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.730
And I think it's
still too much.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.410
I think one of two things
is going to happen.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:20.880
I think actually both things
are going to happen.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.530
I think that companies like
Google or YouTube within

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.010
Google are going to make-- and
already are making, I'm sure,

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.940
behind closed doors-- are going
to just make humongous

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.490
strides in this area, because
they already have their arms,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.040
like you were saying about
Napster-- they already have

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.780
their arms around the community,
which is the lion's

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.750
share of the battle is just
getting your arms around the

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.570
community and going, OK.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.390
We're all here in
this one space.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.500
Well, we're all in YouTube.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.630
I mean, that's a fact.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.320
I mean, there's no comparison
between their metrics and the

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.850
next metrics down
from YouTube.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.350
It drops by like a billion
or something ridiculous.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.970
So all our arms around that.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.960
So they've got a really good
shot at driving a lot of

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.490
reform, because the
numbers are there.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.610
But I think we also can't rule
out the disruptive innovator

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.340
who comes just clean out of left
field, like you're the

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.800
person you're talking about,
who just comes up with a

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.190
better mouse trap.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.890
And that's what's exciting to me
about the landscape that we

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.570
live in where you have that
capability, where someone

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.950
could just come out a left field
with a better mousetrap.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.170
And that would be great, too.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.210
And in this day and age, it
would probably be acquired and

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.830
it would then be folded into the
pre-existing system, and

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.330
the world would be happily
ever after.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:30.050
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Right.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.300
I should mention that we have
microphones, if anybody else

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.940
has a question for Alex.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.760
So here's one.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.540
So Google Play All Access is not
the only service that does

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.980
this, but it's one of them,
where you can take MP3s you

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.180
may or may not have gotten from
Napster over a decade

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.980
ago, or from anywhere else, for
that matter, and upload

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.860
them into a service that
pays copyright

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.340
holders when you stream.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.250
It's a legitimate service,
and I think iTunes

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.670
match works that way.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.370
Sort of amnesty.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.770
Welcome back to paying
for music.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.070
And you can still bring all
that other stuff that you

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:20.630
have, and you're forgiven, to
quote the band in the movie.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.250
Do you think that the kids--

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:27.640
I mean, if you've grown up with
free music at this point

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:34.220
in various forms, do you think
that as kids grow up, they

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.550
will start to pay $10 a month
for something that just gives

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.650
them access to everything,
including the stuff that they

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:40.710
get elsewhere?

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.420
ALEX WINTER: You know, I get
asked this all the time.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.030
And I'm beginning to think that
I must either be totally

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.510
naive, or I don't know what.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:53.100
But I would understand that
question in 2002.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.200
But in 2003, Steve Jobs proved
the answer to that question,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.960
which I knew in '99, and the
Napster guys knew in '99.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.510
And the guys that created
the iTunes store

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.800
all came from Napster.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.110
I mean, Jobs literally hired--

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.550
I won't name names, because it
always gets me in trouble,

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.920
but, I mean, you could
Google it.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.080
He hired this guy, this guy,
this guy, and this guy from

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.530
Napster, who had built the
artist development, the iTunes

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:25.420
store, the head executives over
at what became the iTunes

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.420
store at Apple.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.820
So people will pay
for convenience.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.540
Of course they well.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.180
We learned that in 2003.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.250
They paid through the nose for
convenience, and they continue

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:36.730
to do that.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.660
So again, in my experience,
we don't live in

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.040
free culture anymore.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.370
The free culture window was
really, really short, and it

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.120
was through necessity.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.080
We had a free culture window
because when these

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.890
technologies erupted, they
erupted outside of the purview

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.260
of the industry.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.250
So there was no way
to buy this stuff.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.920
You could only download
it for free.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.550
There was no way to use Napster
and pay for it.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.350
They were desperately trying to
play catch up and make it a

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.690
pay service, because they
weren't going to make any

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:06.740
money if they didn't.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.840
They were using the model
of like, here,

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.180
take all this stuff.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.810
It was like a beta model.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.500
Take this stuff for free, and
if you dig it, then we'll

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.320
start charging for it.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.660
Well, they never got there.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.930
So iTunes did that.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.920
They made a fortune, and they
built the empire that is the

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.650
new Apple-- sort of Apple II--

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.400
off the back of the fact
that the public will

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.800
pay for this stuff.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.580
So my son, for instance--

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.960
my older son--

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.300
he never grew up with
free culture.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.410
He's always paid for
content online.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.040
He didn't grow up during
the downloading era.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.200
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Yeah.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.730
I think people view it as a
waste of disk space now.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.760
Why would I clog up my
whole hard drive?

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.100
ALEX WINTER: Yeah, but even if
you're working off the cloud,

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.960
he'll pay for Pandora,
or he'll pay for--

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.820
and actually, a lot of people
like having stuff.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.440
Like, my son specifically will
be like, I don't want my stuff

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.880
on the cloud, because
it gets lost.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.740
Or if my internet goes down,
I can't listen to my music.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.740
So he likes having stuff.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.660
Drive space being what it
is-- and that's about to

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.590
revolutionize anyway-- that
won't be as big of an issue.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.670
But still, you can keep an
enormous amount of music on a

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.640
thumb drive, and kids
love doing that.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.409
I mean, he's got it on his
phone, on his laptop.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.070
But he'll pay.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.550
I mean, he does everything
on YouTube.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.389
If YouTube--

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.020
and they're doing this with
advertising, obviously-- but

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.000
if they literally turned around
and started charging

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.540
him a subscription fee for
YouTub,e he would pay it.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.749
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: You
guys hear that?

00:34:21.749 --> 00:34:22.080
ALEX WINTER: Like that.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.520
I mean, honestly, he doesn't
want to hear the ads on

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.440
Pandora, so he pays.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.400
I just don't believe we live
in that culture anymore.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.179
I never really viewed the
public as thieves.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:33.999
They wanted to convenience.

00:34:33.999 --> 00:34:35.179
They didn't want to steal.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.469
As soon as people started
offering them services that

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.520
were as convenient as the free
services, they paid for them.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.370
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Right.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.550
So Lars Ulrich features
prominently in your film for

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.520
obvious reasons, and I got to
interview him I don't know if

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.830
it was two or three years ago
at South by Southwest.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.300
Under heavy security,
by the way.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.170
I don't know if you
dealt with that.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.724
Like, there's the Metallica
police or something.

00:34:55.724 --> 00:34:56.900
ALEX WINTER: It's
like Disneyland.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.940
They have their own
police force.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:58.390
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Yeah.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.630
It is really like Dethklok.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:05.510
So I just wondered, so, during
that interview, he admitted to

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:10.080
BitTorrenting his own most
recent album at the time.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.670
ALEX WINTER: Oh, I saw
that interview.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.990
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: So from the
artists that you talked to,

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:17.820
did any of them sort of off
camera tell you different

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.430
things about Napster?

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.110
ALEX WINTER: You know, that
happened all throughout

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.200
Napster's history.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.950
There was always a duplicity
between what was being said on

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.660
camera and what was being
said off camera.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.660
I mean, I did so much research
when I first wrote the script,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.720
and almost all the artists that
I talked to in those days

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.620
used Napster and dug it, but
were really scared of their

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.050
labels getting mad at them if
they said anything pro.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.150
And I think you would still find
that 10 years later, that

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:51.020
a lot of artists wouldn't go on
record for fear of reprisal

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.250
from their record labels.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.520
I think that in Metallica's
case, you were dealing with--

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:07.230
I would say to be fair to them,
they were the front end

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.490
of the very beginning of
people going, holy

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:11.000
crap, what is this?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.630
Like, there's this tsunami.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.410
What is it?

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.100
Can we just stop and figure
out what it is?

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.220
Which I think is actually--

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:24.140
like, to be fair to Lars, is a
justifiable and understandable

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.150
perspective.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.310
I think what happened to Lars is
that a lot of artists that

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.190
may have been pro or con
Napster, whatever, once they

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.840
knew what it was, were like, oh
my God, what is this thing?

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.810
And Lars went running out onto
the battlefield thinking he

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.360
had a whole army behind him,
and then turned around and

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.580
everyone else was like,
no, I'm not

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.830
getting involved in this.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:42.070
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Yeah.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.300
They probably saw
those cartoons--

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.600
ALEX WINTER: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.590
And there he was, and he stuck
his neck out, and nobody came

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.660
to his aid.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:57.640
But I think the reality of it is
that if you look at Dre, or

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:03.470
you look at Lars specifically,
Dre was certainly very vocal

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.870
against Napster, but it's not
like he was a Luddite.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:09.980
I mean, look at how he's
primarily made his living for

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.130
the last 10 years is primarily
through digitally oriented

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:17.150
headphone equipment, and is now
sort of driving forward

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:22.280
beyond that into actual music
based subscription service

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:27.440
technological hoo ha that
he's doing, much off

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.370
the model of Napster.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.830
So I don't think that these
people were just like, no,

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.900
we're never ever ever going
to evolve with these

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.730
technologies.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:38.690
I think that they were just
completely blindsided by them

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:42.870
and wanted to sort of stop
and address these issues.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.470
But the reality of it is you
can't stop these technologies.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.960
You can't stop evolutionary
technology.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.530
You can't.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:49.360
It's unstoppable.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.620
So you have to run with the
train and make the reforms

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.830
that you need to make, and
I think people are

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.250
still adverse to that.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.000
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Right.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.790
Well, unless anybody else has
questions, I'm now going to

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.840
ask the inevitable one.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.050
ALEX WINTER: The one I probably
can't answer.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.140
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK:
No, no, you can.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.540
Have people have been file
sharing your film, and have

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.400
you seen that happen?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.520
And how do you feel about it?

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.925
ALEX WINTER: Oh, yeah,
of course they have.

00:38:12.925 --> 00:38:15.980
As soon as we were available
digitally,

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.450
within however long--

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.400
two hours after that--

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.070
we were DRM stripped
and on Pirate Bay.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.780
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: At which
point you completely reversed

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.600
your philosophy and started
suing everybody, right?

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.210
ALEX WINTER: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.170
I think stealing content is
fine, unless it's mine is

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.280
actually the conclusion
I've come to.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.375
Yeah.

00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:37.930
I mean, look.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:43.380
Again, there is a lot a debate
about this, and there's a lot

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.530
of emotionality around it.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:51.160
A lot of ignorance, I would say,
and a lot of really just

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.630
hurt feelings, too.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.540
I have a lot of friends who
are musicians who are just

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.010
bummed that the industry is
not the same anymore.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.690
And I get it.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.240
The industry isn't, and
it never will be.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.310
We're never going to reset the
clock and go back to the Tower

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:03.910
Records era.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.900
It's never ever, ever,
ever going to happen.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.810
So I'm not callous about that.

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.740
I think there are things that
we've lost that are a bummer,

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.090
just like change.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.660
The horse and buggy-- we didn't
have as much pollution.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.100
Maybe more methane.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.230
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Methane,
I was going to say.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.510
ALEX WINTER: But there
are always

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:26.020
sacrifices when change occurs.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:31.570
But I don't think that there's
anybody sensible in positions

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.930
of power anymore who doesn't
realize the promotional value

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.120
of torrenting.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.070
I think I read an article
yesterday where the guys at

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.840
HBO are getting more
vocal about--

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.280
even like the "Game
of Thrones" thing.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.030
Like, they'd rather people
didn't take it, but I think

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:50.220
that those people are becoming
aware of what the reality is,

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.360
which is as soon as we're able
to match the convenience of

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.510
these free services, people
will pay for them.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.340
And I think that's just
been shown over and

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.240
over and over again.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.220
And you will always have some
degree of pirates within that

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.530
pie graph that's a very
small percentage.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.880
The bulk of the people when
you're dealing with massive

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.620
torrenting, honestly, are not
getting it as conveniently, as

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.740
quickly, and in a more
legitimate service.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.110
So yeah, people are
downloading it.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.730
I think honestly,
for us, on our

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.430
level, it's just promotion.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.740
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: Yeah.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.520
I mean, I think you're
onto something there.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.930
It's the motivation for the
industry to evolve in a way

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.340
that makes more sense for
the fan or the consumer.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.370
ALEX WINTER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.950
And what just got leaked today
or yesterday, I was

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.660
reading about it?

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:38.950
Whatever.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:43.250
Some new show or whatever got
leaked, and the response even

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:44.830
with that was like--

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.400
I think it was the premiere
of "Homeland"?

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.170
Something like that.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:50.890
It was like, it's
really actually

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:51.560
going to drive promotion.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.170
They were just at that point.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:56.230
And if you watch this,
historically, it's sort of

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.970
like the witch trials.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.750
It used to be heretical
to say this.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:04.610
If you said this in public,
you were blacklisted.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.580
How dare you say
piracy is good?

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.060
And when that kid got thrown
in jail for a year for

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.160
uploading the Wolverine movie.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.030
And then subsequently, if you
actually dig into it, you

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.300
realize that it did incredibly
well for the movie

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.250
promotionally.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.390
And I think some poor
sucker's doing time.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.620
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK: It's like,
this movie's so good that this

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.030
guy went to jail for a year?

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.790
ALEX WINTER: Exactly.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:29.270
So I think that people
are beginning

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:30.950
to realize two things.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:33.480
One is that a lot of that stuff
just drives promotion.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.790
And the other is that the public
is not inherently free

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.230
culture people.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.300
I think the idea of free culture
is total mythology.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.060
I don't think we live in that
world at all, and I think it

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.030
just keeps getting proven over
and over and over again that

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.240
people will pay.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:48.800
ELIOT VAN BUSKIRK:
Nicely done.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.050
Well, thank you very much.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:50.380
Alex Winter.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.750
ALEX WINTER: No, thank you.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:52.630
Thank you.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.185
[APPLAUSE]
