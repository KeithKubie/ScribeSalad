to your doctor and depending on what you
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.649

lower dosage that's the personalization

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
lower dosage that's the personalization
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.820

in the future as in what I think will be

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
in the future as in what I think will be
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.999
in the future as in what I think will be
as soon as four or five years when we

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
as soon as four or five years when we
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.450
as soon as four or five years when we
get medicines they will be personalized

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
get medicines they will be personalized
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.630

what I think this this will do is it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
what I think this this will do is it
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330
what I think this this will do is it
quite likely will add a couple years of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
quite likely will add a couple years of
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670
