to think the token gay character in

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410
to think the token gay character in
 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.520
to think the token gay character in
movies and TV shows but I don't think

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530
movies and TV shows but I don't think
 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.319
movies and TV shows but I don't think
we're quite there yet but I think that's

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329
we're quite there yet but I think that's
 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.810
we're quite there yet but I think that's
important to show that even in

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820
important to show that even in
 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.579
important to show that even in
mainstream movies to have gay and

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589
mainstream movies to have gay and
 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.450
mainstream movies to have gay and
lesbian characters who are normalized

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460
lesbian characters who are normalized
 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.389
lesbian characters who are normalized
they're not the token gay character they

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399
they're not the token gay character they
 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.759
they're not the token gay character they
are another character in that movie and

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769
are another character in that movie and
 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.779
are another character in that movie and
I like the idea of sort of plot lines

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789
I like the idea of sort of plot lines
 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.349
I like the idea of sort of plot lines
within TV and film that deal with gay

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359
within TV and film that deal with gay
 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.959
within TV and film that deal with gay
men and women but don't necessarily

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969
men and women but don't necessarily
 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.910
men and women but don't necessarily
focus on that as a soul issue because

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
focus on that as a soul issue because
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.620
focus on that as a soul issue because
then I I think it sort of creates a

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630
then I I think it sort of creates a
 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.630
then I I think it sort of creates a
caricature of what this is supposed to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640
caricature of what this is supposed to
 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.240
caricature of what this is supposed to
be so I I do think to an extent

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250
be so I I do think to an extent

be so I I do think to an extent
Hollywood does hold some

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
Hollywood does hold some
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.130
Hollywood does hold some
responsibilities but you know homophobia

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140
responsibilities but you know homophobia
 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.810
responsibilities but you know homophobia
exists in that industry like any other

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820
exists in that industry like any other
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.000
exists in that industry like any other
while you know your agent or your

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010
while you know your agent or your
 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.360
while you know your agent or your
publicist can be gay don't expect to

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370
publicist can be gay don't expect to
 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.110
publicist can be gay don't expect to
sign on to a movie as an open gay person

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120
sign on to a movie as an open gay person
 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.550
sign on to a movie as an open gay person
and expect a big paycheck yeah I think

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560
and expect a big paycheck yeah I think
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.050
and expect a big paycheck yeah I think
both parties are going to point fingers

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060
both parties are going to point fingers
 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.600
both parties are going to point fingers
it's very easy for me as a movie goer to

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610
it's very easy for me as a movie goer to
 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.480
it's very easy for me as a movie goer to
say Hollywood the institution needs to

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490
say Hollywood the institution needs to
 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.430
say Hollywood the institution needs to
change their ways but I also think if

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440
change their ways but I also think if
 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.090
change their ways but I also think if
they put a openly gay character in a

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100
they put a openly gay character in a
 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.940
they put a openly gay character in a
major motion picture I don't think it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950
major motion picture I don't think it
 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.530
major motion picture I don't think it
would perform as well as the BA at the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540
would perform as well as the BA at the
 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.750
would perform as well as the BA at the
box office so I think we do need to take

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760
box office so I think we do need to take
 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.210
box office so I think we do need to take
small steps to reach that that end-all

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220
small steps to reach that that end-all
 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.440
small steps to reach that that end-all
goal it's not going to happen overnight

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450
goal it's not going to happen overnight
 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.360
goal it's not going to happen overnight
and I think it'd be foolish to assume so

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370
and I think it'd be foolish to assume so
 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.900
and I think it'd be foolish to assume so
but you know I think the American public

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910
but you know I think the American public
 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.830
but you know I think the American public
does still have this cringe mentality

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840
does still have this cringe mentality
 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.569
does still have this cringe mentality
when it comes to the idea of gay men and

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579
when it comes to the idea of gay men and
 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.940
when it comes to the idea of gay men and
women playing leading roles or roles

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950
women playing leading roles or roles
 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.160
women playing leading roles or roles
where they are the gay character

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
where they are the gay character
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.030
where they are the gay character
all the way to Hollywood that is fearful

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
all the way to Hollywood that is fearful
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.670
all the way to Hollywood that is fearful
of even opening up that possibility

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
of even opening up that possibility
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.360
of even opening up that possibility
because the investment is so large and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370
because the investment is so large and
 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.930
because the investment is so large and
you know studio wants to make that bet
