00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, these negative charges all want to get as close to the positive charges they possibly can--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which means all packing in to this one tiny little tip, which means the concentration will be higher.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This will turn out to be very important when we design a tool to save our buildings

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
from lightning strikes, and this is something that some people call the effect of points,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
mainly that pointed objects tend to have higher concentrations of negative charge

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
accumulating in them in these situations than rounder objects or flat objects,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but there's still huge question to be answered--namely, where did this guy come from,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
how do we get a positively charge object to begin with.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Far all we've seen are how an object can become polarized, how the charges can separate.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I want to know how to get a charge object.
