00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300
to get it and a lot of times it succeeds
 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.250

they definitely have kind of the it's CG
 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.740
they definitely have kind of the it's CG
but it's a good mix of kind of this I

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
but it's a good mix of kind of this I
 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.660
but it's a good mix of kind of this I
don't want to say sloppy intentionally

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670
don't want to say sloppy intentionally
 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.509

choppy animation that's very much like

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519
choppy animation that's very much like
 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.580
choppy animation that's very much like
the hand-drawn animation that was very

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590
the hand-drawn animation that was very
 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.910
the hand-drawn animation that was very
very low-budget but it's very stylized

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920
very low-budget but it's very stylized
 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.380
very low-budget but it's very stylized
and they sort of mix it with some

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390
and they sort of mix it with some
 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.030
and they sort of mix it with some
hand-drawn stuff in there as well any
