00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.147
We first took the number and decreased it by 7, so a minus 7. We multiplied that

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:10.027
result by 3, so I say 3 times the quantity a minus 7. Finally, we divide the

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.784
amount by 2. Notice I put the entire quantity over the number 2. I need to

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:19.931
divide this entire number by 2. You chose the last one, nice work. We know it's

00:00:19.943 --> 00:00:24.968
not the first one because we know a minus 7 times 3 is really a minus 21. And I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.145
didn't subtract 21 from my original number, so this one's out. Here I would have

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:35.156
multiplied by 3 first. which we didn't do. so this one's out as well. the same

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.818
is true for the third case.
