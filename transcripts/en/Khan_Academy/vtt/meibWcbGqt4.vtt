00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.120
Like we've done in the last
several videos, let's assume

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.170
that we have some set
of basis vectors B.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.640
And let's say our basis
is going to be v1 v2

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.810
all the way to vk.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.340
So this will span a subspace
of dimension k.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.840
And let's assume that each of
these guys are members of Rn.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.400
So v1 v2 all the way to vk.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.530
They're all members of Rn.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.930
Now in the last video, we saw
that we can define a change of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.530
basis matrix.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.140
And it's a fancy word, but all
it means is a matrix that has

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.720
these basis vectors
as its columns.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.970
So v1, v2 all the way to
vk as its columns.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.530
So we're going to have k columns
and we're going to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.530
have n rows.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.610
Because each of these guys are
members of Rn, so they're

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.880
going to have n entries.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.840
So we're going to have n rows.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.220
So it's going to be
an n by k matrix.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.430
And we saw in the last video
that if I have some vector a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.030
that is a member of Rn-- and
assuming that a is in the span

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.320
of B-- I can represent a.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.480
I could say that a is equal to
the change of basis matrix

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.500
times the coordinates of a with
respect to our basis.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.550
This is what we saw
in the last video.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.030
If I have the coordinates of
a with respect to B, I can

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.960
multiply it by the change of
basis matrix and I'll get my

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.740
vector a in standard
coordinates.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.060
Or if I have my vector a in
standard coordinates, then I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.600
can solve for my vector a in
coordinates with respect to B.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.200
We saw that in the last video.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.490
Now let's take a special case.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.590
Let's assume that
C is invertible.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.530
What does that mean?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.880
Or what does that
tell us about C?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.430
Well if C is invertible,
it's two things.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.540
It means that C is a square
matrix or has the same number

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.450
rows and columns.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.290
And that its rows or columns--
You can pick either of them--

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.760
have to be linearly
independent.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.200
So linearly independent, let's
just pick columns.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.990
Now the second statement
is a bit redundant.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.950
We know that C has linearly
independent columns, because

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.410
its columns are bases
for a subspace.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.750
So a basis, by definition, all
of the vectors have to be

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.790
linearly independent.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.130
So we know this is
a bit redundant.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.280
But what's interesting is if we
know that C is invertible,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.200
C has to be square.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.760
And if all of these vectors are
members of Rn, then k has

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.970
to be equal to n.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.600
So C is square means that k is
equal to n or that we have n

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.850
basis vectors.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.520
Now if that's the case,
what is the span of B?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.430
Think about it.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:20.470
We have n linearly independent
vectors in Rn.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.920
So any time you have n linearly
independent vectors

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.590
in Rn, those guys are
a basis for Rn.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.460
Because any basis that has n
entries-- and they're all

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.110
linearly independent-- is going
to be a basis for Rn.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.640
So then B is a basis for Rn.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.870
So if we know that C is
invertible, we also know that

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.570
you can get to any vector in Rn
by some linear combination

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.820
of your basis vectors
right there.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.110
In the last video, we had to
make sure that this guy was in

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.240
the span of these vectors.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.720
But now we don't have to make
sure, because if C is

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:17.680
invertible, then the span of B
is going to be equal to Rn.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.899
Or another way you could say
it is if the span of B is

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.110
equal to Rn.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.550
If we have n vectors here, if k
was equal to n, then we know

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.040
that the span of B would
be equal to Rn.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.240
And so we'd have n vectors here,
n linearly independent

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.295
columns here, and it would be
an n by n matrix with all of

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:35.750
the columns linearly
independent.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.330
So then C would be invertible.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.590
So we could write
if and only if.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.280
And we could write
it the other way.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:53.530
If the span of B is Rn,
then C is invertible.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.350
And that's useful, because if
either of these things are

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.040
true, then we can rewrite
the same equation.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.570
So let's say if we know this and
we're looking for that, we

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.420
can just multiply
C times that.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.520
Let's say we know this and
we're looking for that.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.065
Before we had to do that
augmented matrix and solve for

00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:10.585
it, whatnot.

00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:15.650
But if we know C is invertible,
then one, we know

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.020
that any vector here can
be represented in

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.300
the span of our basis.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.240
So any vector here can be
represented as linear

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.830
combinations of these guys.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.090
So you know that any vector can
be represented in these

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.680
coordinates or with
coordinates with

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.790
respect to our basis.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.140
We can multiply both sides of
this equation times C inverse.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.930
And what do you get
if you multiply?

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.520
So it becomes C inverse C times
our coordinates of a

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.030
with respect to B is equal
to C inverse times a.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.400
This is just the identity
matrix right there.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.220
Another way of writing this is
that the coordinates of a,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.100
with respect to our basis B,
which spans all of Rn, is

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.270
equal to C inverse times
our vector a.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.230
Let's apply this a little bit.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.700
Let's apply this.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.050
Let's use this information, what
we've done in this video.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.780
Let's do some concrete
examples.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.420
So let's say I have
some basis.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.580
Let me define two vectors.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.290
I'll do it this way.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.310
So let's say I have v1 is equal
to the vector 1, 3.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:35.130
And let's say v2 is equal
to the vector 2, 1.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:43.110
And I have a basis that is equal
to the set of v1 and v2.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.750
Now I'll leave it for you to
verify that these guys are

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.690
linearly independent.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.860
But if I have two linearly
independent vectors in R2,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:59.960
then B is a basis for R2.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.550
And if we write the change of
basis matrix, if we say C is

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.740
equal to 1, 3, 2, 1, we know
that C is invertible.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.700
And actually to show that C
is invertible, we can just

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.590
calculate its inverse.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.720
So what's the determinant
of C?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:24.760
The determinant of C is equal to
1 times 1 minus 2 times 3.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.340
So it's equal minus 5.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.880
That's the determinant of C.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.900
And so C inverse-- We figured
out a general formula for

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.190
doing this for 2 by 2 matrices--
is equal to 1 over

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:42.230
the determinant of C, so 1
over minus 5 times-- You

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.510
switch these two guys, so you
switch the 1's, and you make

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.380
these two guys negative.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.760
So minus 2, and then minus 3.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.890
And the very fact that this guy,
the determinant of C, was

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.920
non-zero told us that
this was invertible.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.460
But anyway, this is C inverse.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.980
So let's say that I have
some vector a that

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.910
is a member of R2.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.990
I'm just going to pick
some random numbers.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.600
Let's say that a is
equal to 7, 2.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.590
And I want to find out what the
coordinates of a are with

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.900
respect to my basis B.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.980
Well we go to this situation.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:32.340
We know what a is, so we just
multiply a times C inverse to

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.179
get this guy right here, to get
the coordinates of a with

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.159
respect to B.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.340
So let me write that down.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.280
So what is C?

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.419
So C is that.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.429
C inverse is that.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:46.370
So we could write the
coordinates of a with respect

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.410
to B is equal to C inverse
times the standard

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.990
coordinates of a.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.480
Or this is the same thing.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.680
Let me put the actual
numbers here.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.780
The coordinates of a with
respect to B are going to be

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:05.900
equal to C inverse, which is
minus 1/5 times 1 minus 3

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:15.030
minus 2, 1, times
a, times 7, 2.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.950
And what is this equal to?

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.320
This is equal to minus 1/5.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.140
And then we're going to get 1
times 7 plus minus 2 times 2.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.180
So it's minus 4.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.270
So 7 minus 4 is 3.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.470
And then we're going to get
minus 3 times 7, which is

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.660
minus 21, plus 1 times 2.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.790
So minus 21 plus 2
is minus is 19.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:46.020
So the coordinates of a with
respect to the basis B are

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.850
going to be equal to-- Let me
just multiply the negative

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.610
1/5-- you get minus 3/5.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.230
And then you get plus 19/5.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.050
So 19 over 5.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.830
Just like that.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.480
And let's verify that.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.490
This means that a is equal to
minus 3/5 times our first

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.580
basis vector plus 19/5 times
our second basis vector.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.730
Let's verify that
that's the case.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:25.330
So let's see, minus 3/5 times
1, 3, plus 19/5 times 2, 1.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.290
Let's see what this is
going to be equal to.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.100
Let me write the two vectors.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:39.940
This is minus 3/5 times
3 is minus 9/5.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.210
And there we're going to
add it to this guy.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:51.690
So this guy is 2 times
19 is 38/5.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.340
Right?

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.390
And then 19/5 times 1 is 19/5.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.850
And then if you add
these two vectors

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.410
together, what do we get?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.960
We get minus 3/5 plus 38/5.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.810
That's 35/3.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:13.480
35/5 is 7, minus
9/5 plus 19/5.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.320
That's 10/5 or 2.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.570
And there you have it.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.400
That was our original a.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.650
So we see that a can definitely
be represented as

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.510
minus 3/5 times our first basis
vector plus 19/5 times

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.090
our second basis vector.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.800
Now that was a case where we
had some vector a and we

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.870
wanted to represent it in
coordinates with respect to B.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.800
What if we had the other way?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:43.180
What if we said that some vector
w's coordinates with

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:50.170
respect to B are-- I'll do
something simple-- are 1, 1.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.180
Then what is w in standard
coordinates?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.120
Well there we can
just multiply.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.980
Remember w is just equal to
the change of basis matrix

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.640
times w's coordinates with
respect to the basis B.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.640
So w is going to be equal to
the change of basis matrix,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:19.500
which is just 1, 3, 2, 1, times
the coordinates of w

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.930
with respect to B times 1, 1.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.450
Which is equal to 1 times
1 plus 2 times 1 is 3.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.270
And then 3 times 1
plus 1 plus 1.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.390
So 3 times 1 is 3,
plus 1 is 4.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.380
So w is just equal to
the vector 3, 4.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.240
So there you see if our change
of basis matrix is invertible,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.460
which is really just another way
of saying that are basis

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.430
spans Rn-- in this example it
was R2-- then you can easily

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.360
go back and forth between
coordinate representations in

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:59.560
our standard coordinates and
coordinate representations

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.300
with respect to our basis.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.620
Right?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.960
This is with respect
to the basis.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.210
This is in standard
coordinates.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.600
And you can do that just simply
by either using this

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.600
information or just saying,
oh, the coordinates with

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.890
respect to the basis equal to
C inverse times a, or the

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.880
inverse of our change of
basis matrix times a.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.540
Or saying our coordinates with
respect to the standard basis

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.120
is just equal to the change
of basis matrix times the

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.740
coordinates with respect
to the basis.
