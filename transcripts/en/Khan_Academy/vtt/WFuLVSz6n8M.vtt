00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:05.092
If I were to buy a put option with a fifty dollar excercise price

00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:09.338
and if I were to buy it for $10.00, then the value of my position

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:12.277
the payoff for that put option, at the maturity

00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:17.713
or at the expiration I should say. At the expiration of the option.

00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:21.282
Depending on what the stock price is, and expiration would look like this:

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:24.600
if the stock price is worth, if the stock price goes to zero

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.408
then the put option is worth fifty

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:28.354
because I could buy the stock at zero

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:30.164
and excercise my option

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:34.667
to sell at fifty. At "putting" the stock to someone else

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.333
at fifty dollars. All the way to if the stock becomes worth fifty

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.364
then my put option, I wouldn't need to excercise it

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:43.800
because why would I?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.533
It's worthless to have the option to sell something at fifty

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.129
where you can just sell the actual stock in the open market

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.344
or buy the stock at fifty. So then the put option becomes worthless

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:56.600
for a stock price above that.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.146
Now, this is the payoff diagram.

00:00:58.146 --> 00:01:00.369
And this is when we just think about the value and expiration.

00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:03.738
If we think about the actual profit and loss at expiration, it would look like this

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:06.400
It would just be shifted down by ten dollars

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.267
because we have to pay $10 to get this value.

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:12.929
So if the stock is worth zero, the put option is worth

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.533
$50, but I spent $10 dollars to get it, so the profit is going to be

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.333
$40 dollars.

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.748
And so then at $50, I wouldn't excercise the put option

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.733
so I've lost the $10 dollars I spent on the option

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:29.267
so my payoff diagram would look like, I'm gonna draw it,

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:33.005
relatively neatly. My payoff diagram would look like this

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.954
Once again, this payoff diagram just incorporates the price of the option

00:01:36.954 --> 00:01:40.262
So it's the actual profit. This is just the value at expiration,

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:42.975
depending upon what the value of the stock is at expiration.

00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:46.333
Now this is just a situation if you were to buy an option

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.502
but there has to be someone on the other side of the contract

00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:53.800
someone who's holding, agreeing to buy the option for you

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:59.667
So you could actually have the writer, you could actually have the writer, of the put

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:03.533
the payoff diagram we just showed is the person who owns the put,

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:05.400
but someone else had to have created the put.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.667
They said, "Oh, you know what, I will give you the right.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:16.324
"I will give you the right to sell, to sell me the stock at $50, up to some expiration date."

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.800
So what does their payoff diagram look like?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.667
Well if this guy is going to be able to make $50, this guy over here

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:27.267
the writer of the put, the writer of the put

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:30.933
is going to lose $50. He's going to have to essentially go out

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:36.415
he's actually going to have to buy that $50 put or buy that $50 stock from this person

00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:39.113
because he has to uphold his side of the transaction

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:41.754
but he's buying something for $50 that's worthless

00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:46.933
because based over, at this end of the axis, the stock would be worth nothing

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:51.862
so he's taking a $50 loss, all the way to him not having to do anything

00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:55.538
because the put holder won't actually excercise their options

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:58.359
if their stock price is $50, so their payoff diagram is going to look like this

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.498
So you can see it's actually the mirror image

00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:05.800
of the payoff diagram of this person on the other side of the contract

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.733
And if you were to add these two payoff diagrams, you would be neutral,

00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:12.667
because all of the money is exchanging hands between the buyer

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:13.677
and the seller of the put.

00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:16.267
If you look at the actual profit or loss

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:19.000
if the put is not excercised

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
then the writer of the put essentially just got a free $10

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.667
He sold the put, he sold the put to this guy for $10

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.333
He created the put and sold it to that guy for $10

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.733
the put is not excercised, he gets to keep that $10.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:36.267
But then if the stock goes down and he's forced to buy the stock

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:38.600
from the owner of the put

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.400
he has to buy it because that's his side of the deal

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.600
then all of a sudden he loses money

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.000
So he would go, if all the way down if the stock is worth nothing,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.133
He is forced to buy something for $50 that is worth nothing

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:56.067
He would take a $50 loss, but he paid the $10 on the actual price of the option

00:03:56.067 --> 00:03:59.400
so it would be a negative $40 profit

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.815
So his profit and loss would look like this

00:04:01.815 --> 99:59:59.999
But once again, these are the mirror images of each other.
