00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.980
From 1600 to 1800, European physics and chemistry
went through revolutions that made them quantitative,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.980
or numbers-based.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.830
Meanwhile, biology remained with natural history,
and stuck with observation-based knowledge.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.390
But what about the study of the earth?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.230
In this field, natural philosophers were asking
questions like, what’s up with fossils?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.060
Are they the remains of extinct organisms?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.839
Or are they so-called “sports of nature”—rocks
that just happen to look like living things

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.829
but don’t mean anything?

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.030
And most importantly, how old is… everything?

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.130
I gotta say, as disciplines of science go,
this one has pretty much everything awesome

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.130
in it.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.130
Vast eons?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.130
Check.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.180
Mega floods and supervolcanoes?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.180
Got those!

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.180
Dinosaurs?

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.190
Uh, huh!

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.190
A hunt for living mastodons?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.739
Buddy, you know it.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.410
Geology, paleontology, oceanography, meteorology,
and others—the earth sciences are fascinating,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.820
and so is their history.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.920
Let’s rock!

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:08.480
[OPENING MUSIC PLAYS]

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.220
If you’re looking for the foundations of

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.440
geology, one place to start is with mining.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.360
Archaeologists have shown, for example, that
indigenous populations around the Great Lakes

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.580
mined and used the copper near modern-day
Lake Superior for over six thousand years.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.440
And in Europe, mining took off along with
colonization.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.200
In the sixteenth century, colonial empires
exploited the precious metals of Central and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.780
South America, relying on the geological knowledge
and technical skills of indigenous communities—not

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.840
to mention their labor.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.580
But, despite gathering a lot of new data about
the Earth in this way, natural philosophers

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.360
kept banging their heads against one question:
how can we reconstruct the earth’s history,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.630
or geohistory?

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.150
No one could confidently know the age of the
earth before the discovery of radioactivity

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.450
and the development of radiometric dating
in the early twentieth century.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.070
Today, by the way, we think the earth is
around 4.543 billion years old.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.360
But since at least the seventeenth century,
people have compared layers of rock and declared

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.970
them younger or older, depending on their
positions relative to other layers.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.800
This was a qualitative, or value-based practice:
it was hard to date rocks just by looking

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800
at them.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.870
But this didn’t stop people from trying.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.070
In seventeenth-century Europe, it was commonplace
to believe that the age of the earth and the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.900
age of human species were about the same.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.290
So to know the age of the earth, historians
tried to create a quantitative chronology

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.640
of human history.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.480
This meant comparing all known ancient sources—such
as texts from China, Greece, or Babylonia—as

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.560
well as things like the records of eclipses
and comets.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.880
All these events were placed into a detailed
chronology: a linear narrative that ran from

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.510
the creation of the universe to the present.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.660
In 1654, Bishop James Ussher—a scholar and
the top religious leader of Ireland—calculated

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.600
the age of the earth to be about six thousand
years old, based on textual evidence from

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600
the bible.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600
Other historians reached different conclusions
and argued over the reliability of different

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.260
sources, but in general they reached a date
for the beginning of time somewhere around

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.740
4000 BCE.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.490
By the late seventeenth century, some European
naturalists, such as polymath Robert Hooke,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.050
argued that natural objects, like fossils,
should also be used like historical texts to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.720
shed light on early human environments.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.620
For example, many believed that the biblical
Flood had scattered organic remains globally,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.020
which explained why we can find seashells
on the tops of mountains.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.850
This attention to fossils would set the stage
for new theories of organic development, such

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.620
as those of Charles Darwin.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.260
Between Hooke and Darwin, several eighteenth-century

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.330
French thinkers played a critical role in
speculating about fossils and finding ways

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.730
to calculate the age of the earth.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.530
These were the “Transformist” natural
historians who developed proto-evolutionary

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.530
theories.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.390
The Comte de Buffon,
for example, argued that the earth was progressively

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.390
cooling.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.110
According to Buffon, during this cooling process,
the earth underwent phases or “epochs,”

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.960
which were roughly parallel with the six Biblical
days of Creation from the book of Genesis.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.020
And since humans appeared only in the seventh
and final epoch, Buffon’s history of the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.890
earth was mostly pre-human—which was a
totally new idea!

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.449
To determine the age of the earth, Buffon
conducted what might be described as “cooling”

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.449
experiments.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.539
He timed the rate at which heated balls of
different sizes and materials cooled down.

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.539
Publicly, Buffon estimated the earth was around
seventy-five thousand years old.

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.050
But privately, based on his experiments, he
speculated that it was up to ten million

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.050
years old!

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.400
So, although most European geologists in the
1700s were devout Christians, they found—like

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.469
Buffon—that the Genesis narrative could
be read as more of a metaphor that complemented,

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.860
rather than contradicted, scientific evidence.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.729
This allowed Christian thinkers to come to
terms with a vast, pre-human history.

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.080
Still, fossils remained a questionable form

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.319
of evidence for understanding the history
of Earth.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:04.629
Did they represent the remains of pre-human
worlds, or were those creatures still roaming

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:06.180
wild spaces somewhere?

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.479
Georges Cuvier thought
he had the answer.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.220
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.710
Cuvier argued that each epoch of earth history
had its own distinctive flora and fauna.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.469
And these epochs were separated by global
catastrophes such as tsunamis, meteorites,

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:21.849
or earthquakes.

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.250
Life forms did not persist after the catastrophes,
he thought.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.830
They went extinct with the end of their worlds.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.360
We call this theory catastrophism.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.620
And according to it, fossils reveal a linear
sequence, which can be used to reconstruct

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.740
the earth’s past.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.589
This wasn’t a new idea: in 1696, for example,
William Whiston published A New Theory of

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.020
the Earth from its Original to the Consummation
of All Things.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.939
And in it, he attempted to explain the history
of earth in terms of catastrophes, too.

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:54.270
Like, Whiston thought that a comet hitting
earth must have caused the Flood of Noah.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.860
What Cuvier did differently was amass fossil
evidence of changes in organisms.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.240
Studying the geology of central France, Cuvier
noticed gaps where the fossils would simply

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.610
disappear, only for new kinds of fossils
to appear a little bit higher up, in new layers

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.610
of rock.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.130
He recognized these gaps as extinction events.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.669
To make things easier, Cuvier decided to focus
on really big bones—

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.370
mastodon and mammoth skeletons.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.490
He figured these animals would be hard to
miss if they were still roaming the earth.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.539
(Spoiler: they were, in fact, extinct.)

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.669
But Cuvier compared the teeth of elephants
and those of other animals like them.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.479
And in doing that, he established that African
and Indian elephants are different species,

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.050
and that mammoths were not the same as either
of them.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.050
Thanks ThoughtBubble.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.569
Now, how did Cuvier get all of these fossils?

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:47.190
Well, the new Revolutionary government in
Paris secured Cuvier a position at the

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.059
Museum of Natural History, which gave him the
power to establish a global fossil delivery

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.930
service for other natural philosophers.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.819
So, those big mastodon fossils that he studied
came from North America.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.900
And it’s worth pointing out that, because
of that, Cuvier became fascinated with Native

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.619
American ideas about creation and extinction.

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:07.809
He went out of his way to buy fossils from
tribes such as the Iroquois, Shawnee, and

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:12.789
Lenape to learn what they thought about these
old, gigantic bones in the ground.

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:17.110
Cuvier couldn’t have come up with new theories
about fossils—or even collected so many

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.439
fossils—without the help of many indigenous
knowledge makers.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:26.149
So by 1800 or so, geologists had reached a
consensus on some wild ideas: the earth had

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:31.619
undergone gradual change over an incredible
amount of time before the appearance of

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:32.619
humans.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.979
And Earth’s history was punctuated by sudden
episodes of violent change.

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:39.969
Life had either adapted to new environments
or gone extinct.

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:44.689
And so the fossil record was progressive:
wimpy little trilobites died out, and humans

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:48.520
came into the story at the end, ready to build
robot musicians.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.410
But not everybody loved Cuvier’s theories.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:57.389
Scottish geologist Charles Lyell instead argued
for a slow, “steady-state” theory of geological

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:00.900
change that would become known as uniformitarianism.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.210
He famously had two specific bones to pick
with Cuvier.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:09.189
First, Lyell thought the French had relied
too much on catastrophes to explain geological

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:10.189
history.

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:15.569
He argued that observable geological processes—like
erosion and deposition caused by wind, rivers,

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:20.840
rain, or the occasional volcanic eruption—were
the only explanations that geologists should

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.099
consider reasonable or scientific.

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:28.330
Second, Lyell argued that extinctions were
spread evenly across geological time—not

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.800
clustered together in mass-extinction events.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.700
This steady extinction rate was balanced,
he thought, by the steady creation of new

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.310
species, according to global climate conditions.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:43.889
So, for Lyell, geohistory wasn’t linear,
but cyclical and ... uniform.

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:46.250
It pretty much worked the same in each epoch.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:52.250
Lyell’s big book, Principles of Geology,
published from 1830 to 1833, became a Principia

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.840
for 
earth scientists.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.440
And I should note here that we've been saying
"Prince-uh-pee-uh"

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.440
for the whole History of Science so far

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.300
But, one of our writers is in the room and has told us it's "Prin-KIP-ee-uh."

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.800
In 'Principles of Geography" he argued that the earth is immensely old, and that, as he put it, “the present is

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.269
the key to the past.”

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:14.760
The debate between catastrophism and uniformitarianism
would go on for a long time.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.160
But while Lyell’s position on extinctions
was dismissed by older geologists as too extreme,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.330
his emphasis on the power of gradual change
inspired many younger scientists.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:30.120
One of them was Charles Darwin, who read Lyell’s
books and later became his good friend.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.980
Lyell could never quite figure out how fossils
and living organisms were related, but—

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.300
like, for now, get out of here, Chuck!

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.470
We're gonna get to you in a couple episodes.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.459
Another influence on Darwin, in the realm

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:43.300
of fossil collecting, was Oxford geologist
William Buckland.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.540
Buckland led trips to caverns and abandoned
mines, where he found remains like cave bear

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.079
bones from the Pleistocene.

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:55.360
For evidence of even more ancient life,
we turn to English paleontologist Mary Anning.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.250
Anning walked the beaches after storms to
find and excavate fossils, which she then

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.550
sold, mostly to Buckland.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.920
In 1811, she even found a spectacularly well-preserved
ichthyosaur.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.620
Anning was a keen observer and talented nature
writer.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:15.160
An 1830 painting of “ancient Dorset” based
on her work brings to life an entire Jurassic…

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.180
world (Universal Studios, please don’t sue
me!), filled with marine and flying reptiles.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.740
In the vision of Buckland and Anning, the
reptilian past was separated from the modern

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.260
world by the Flood, after which humans were
created.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.350
The new theories about the earth, circa 1800,
all required what is perhaps the most important

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.050
idea of earth science: “deep time,” or
“geological time.”

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:43.230
This is the notion that, before humans, the
earth had already been around for an unimaginably

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.230
long time.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.899
And this great expanse of time is, like human
history, full of sudden events and patterns

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:50.569
that persist over epochs.

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:55.879
So, deep time implies that geohistory can
be reconstructed in the same way that historians

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:58.220
reconstruct the human past.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:04.040
Except, instead of relying on vases, ruins,
and letters, geo-historians rely on fossils,

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.110
volcanoes, and rocks.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.700
This epistemic mode of thinking about the

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.769
earth’s history emerged thanks to the technē
of industrializing Europe.

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:17.110
And so the earth sciences became more regular
as professions in the late 1700s and early

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.110
1800s.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.560
In industrializing nations, governments and
landowners started investing in geological

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.730
surveys and mining academies.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.279
In these academies, earth scientists were
trained to generate new ways to satisfy a

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:34.040
world increasingly dependent on one mineral
resource, coal.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.910
New visual technologies for geological mapping,
and a new system for tracking rock groupings

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:44.560
across vast distances, emerged from the works
of Abraham Gottlob Werner and his students

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.410
at the mining academy in Freiberg, Germany,
in the 1770s.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:52.940
In Britain, mineral surveyors and civil engineers,
such as William Smith and John Farey, started

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.740
using fossils to improve the accuracy of their
geological maps.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.879
This technique soon became standard practice.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:03.610
Smith was also one of the first people to
use a thematic map, a map showing something

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:08.430
about the earth other than its shape, to classify
different rocks across Britain.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.779
And he was one of the first to use fossils
to map rock formations for practical ends,

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.810
like civil engineering and mineral prospecting.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:19.511
His maps were very useful to the geologists
reconstructing the earth’s history: they

00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:24.579
helped fossil hunters arrange their finds
according to rock strata and thus age.

00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:29.720
Innovations created by Smith and others like
him set off a wave of geological exploration

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.820
around the world, backed by governments and
industries.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:39.019
And, by the early 1800s, the industrial world
was gobbling up coal at an unprecedented pace…

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:42.129
Quick note that this episode would not have
been possible without the expert advice of

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:43.829
Gustave Lester, a Ph.D

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:47.220
candidate in the Department of the History
of Science at Harvard University.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.420
Thanks, Gustave!

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.770
Next time—the history of technology is going
to get steamy: that’s right, it’s the

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.770
Industrial Revolution!

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.399
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:02.930
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:03.930
Thought Cafe.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.410
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.450
