00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.750
Joanna there is a study that shows one in 60 dads end up

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.430
raising a child that doesn't belong to him. So non paternity is obviously an,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.190
an issue of fairly high prevalence in United States in general and possibly

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.340
the world in, in general. How does 23andMe deal with issues of non paternity?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.180
&gt;&gt; So this is certainly a big issue for 23andMe

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.000
Because it's one of the most high impact results that someone

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.900
who signed up for 20, for 23andMe can

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.420
get. and before people sign up it's very important

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.550
that they consider the possibility of making a

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.160
discovery about biological relationships in their family that they

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.050
didn't previously know about. And so. And that's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.410
why, when we launched the service from the very

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.170
beginning, we in our terms of service we said, be a, a, a, you should be aware

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.240
that you may learn things about yourself that,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.650
that, you find uncomfortable, that are disturbing. Including that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.280
your biological father, is not your biological father. The

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.510
person that you know to be your father is

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.739
not your biological father. So we were very

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.560
explicit from the very beginning that this is a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.260
possibility. so that, The people are aware that that

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.430
is something that can come out of DNA analyses.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.560
&gt;&gt; And so, are people. Do you, do you find many

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.200
people not aware that the personal genetic services offered at 23? I

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.822
mean, is essentially, in a way, can be like a paternity test.

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:30.700
&gt;&gt; Well, many, organizations that do official paternity

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.380
testing are doing it in a way that, the evidence will hold up in court.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.755
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:38.630
&gt;&gt; So it's a bit, a bit of

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.780
a different process. So, for 23andMe customers, it's more

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.460
like something they just discover. right when they're

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.190
exploring their data. And the main way that people

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.980
discover an opportunity is if they find that their

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.800
genetic relationship to another family member is not what

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.050
they had anticipated. That that they are instead

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.400
of being a full sibling with someone they think

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.460
is their sibling, they're a half sibling, because they

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.870
have different fathers. So that's not an unusual. And,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.960
One, resource that we provide, is, we provide a forum, a discussion forum. where

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.970
many of our customers, put out their, questions to other members of the 23andMe

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.450
community. And that's where we've seen evidence

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.980
of, people discovering non-paternity. And very often

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.980
they have questions like how do I check to find out whether this is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.900
true or not? How do I handle conversations with other members of my family? And

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.080
other members of the 23andMe community often come forward with advice on,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.510
you know, who else should be tested in the family. How do, you know, approach.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.140
other family members and I've seen

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.650
people reporting cases where they've said, I'm not going to tell my dad that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.130
I've discovered this because he's been my dad all my life and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
and there's no need for us to change that

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.850
&gt;&gt; Sure I, I imagine.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.570
&gt;&gt; And so people make these big

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.630
personal decisions once they get this, this information.
