00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.070
MAYSOON ZAYID: Hello, Google.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.505
My name-- OK, they
wanted to respond,

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:11.020
so we'll do it that way.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.650
OK.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.720
So, hello, Google.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.944
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:16.610
MAYSOON ZAYID: My
name is Maysoon Zayid.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.970
And the day I was
born, I almost died.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.330
I came out fist first,
ready to fight the power.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.050
Unfortunately, the
doctor who delivered me

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.560
was not ready for this jelly.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.950
He cut my mom six
different times,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.320
in six different directions.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.990
The first cut gave
me my first breath.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.350
And then the dear
old doc smothered me.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.710
So I have brain damage.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.570
Aren't you jealous?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.710
I have what is called
cerebral palsy.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.650
And cerebral palsy
is a spectrum,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.710
and the symptoms are
totally different,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.930
depending on the person with CP.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.540
In my case, I
shake all the time.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.900
So I shake it, shake it,
shake it, like Taylor Swift.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.420
Except she just wants
to shake, shake, shake,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900
and mine is totally involuntary.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.830
OK, Google?

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.379
This is comedy.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.720
Come on a journey with me.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.210
At some point, every
single one of you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.700
has dreamt of being disabled.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.110
It's Christmas Eve.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.230
You're at the mall.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.340
You're driving around,
looking for parking,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.520
and what do you see?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.395
16 empty handicap spaces.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:23.750
You're like, god, can't
I be a little disabled?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.070
Just, like, dyslexic
or something?

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.850
So I grew up in Cliffside
Park, New Jersey, which

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.630
makes me bridge-and-tunnel.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.750
And I grew up in a time
where I was completely

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.450
oblivious to the fact that being
Muslim, Palestinian, brown,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.110
a girl, and someone
with a disability

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.780
would be something
that in the future

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.850
would be used against me.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.040
I had no idea that being
an other was a bad thing.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.480
I grew up in an
extremely diverse town

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.070
with 33,000 Italian
Catholics and six Arabs that

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.210
were all my family.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.490
And I don't think
anyone ever noticed

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.420
that I wasn't one of them.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.640
Because look at me.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.156
I look like the lost Kardashian.

00:02:09.156 --> 00:02:11.110
People can't just guess.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.090
But when I grew up, I
encountered something

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.250
that I was never prepared for.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.530
Because as a child,
I was never bullied.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.030
I was never mocked.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.370
When I was growing
up, "Muslim" wasn't

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.950
a slur used by
candidates and campaigns

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.910
to gain the hate vote.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.520
It was just-- Maysoon doesn't
eat for a whole month.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.565
And she doesn't
lose a single pound.

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:39.273
It's fascinating.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.300
But then I
encountered something.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.750
I encountered social media,
and my entire world changed.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.400
I started my dalliance
with social media

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.570
back in the days of chat rooms.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.990
And no, it's not the chat
rooms that you think.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.880
I only frequented one chat
room-- the "Soap Opera Digest"

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.810
chat room.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.610
I would spend hours a day
discussing a soap opera

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.640
that I had watched since
I was five years old.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.070
Because even though I
was born to extremely

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.780
strict Palestinian
Muslim parents,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.640
my parents had no idea that
they should monitor what

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.860
I watched on TV.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.660
So I was all about love in the
daytime and Andrew Dice Clay.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.090
These are the
things that I loved.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.300
So I started off
in the chat rooms.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.990
It was nice.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.220
Everything was great.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.190
I had AOL dial-up.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.670
You had to put the
CD-- computers used

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.290
to have these CD-ROMs.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.360
You know, because I'm
like 150 in Google years.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.320
I walked around this
building and did not

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.880
see a single old person.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.180
I think that you guys
put them to sleep at 40.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.960
And then wake them
up again at 100,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.040
because Google's nefarious,
and you can do that.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.020
So my next thing,
though, was Facebook.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.630
And I was sitting in a room
with one of my bridesmaids.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.570
I've been a bridesmaid
17 times, and I've

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.420
spent $28,000 on my
friends' weddings.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.010
So when I turned 33, I decided
to get married, because I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.452
wanted to make my money back.

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:17.480
And because also, like,
married people, they

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.640
sucker you into marriage, and
they don't explain anything

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.410
about it.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.740
So they dress like
a Michelin man.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.240
It looks like it's all fun.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.760
They get all these gifts.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.270
And they don't tell you that
it's a 50-year commitment.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.550
They're just like,
yay, I went to Belize.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.800
So at 33, I decided
to get married,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.530
because I wanted to
make my money back.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.960
And I went to catch a husband.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.790
Now, let me be clear about this.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.420
People seem to think that
people with disabilities

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.820
don't, like, date.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.160
They think we're these eternal
snowflake angel babies that

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.030
are, like, ahh, I'm so happy.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.680
And that's totally not true.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.770
We do date.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.430
And I wasn't desperate
when I got married.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.080
If my dad had allowed
me to marry someone

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.970
who wasn't Palestinian,
I could have

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.420
married this guy named Mike.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.300
But my dad said that he would
throw himself off the George

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.340
Washington Bridge,
and I couldn't

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.910
bear the image of them fishing
him out, all bloated and shit.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.080
So I had to catch a husband.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.060
And the way my parents
met is really, really,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.120
really romantic.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.944
It's definitely something--
it's such a beautiful story.

00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:31.360
And I think that
when people think

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.230
of Muslim or Arab
or Palestinian,

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.630
they don't think of romance.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.720
But the way my parents
met is so beautiful.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.910
They're first cousins.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.410
My dad swears that the very
first time he saw my mom,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.387
he knew she was the one.

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:48.720
And I was like, Daddy, how
did you know she was the one?

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.270
And he said, your
grandfather, he told me.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.810
But I couldn't do what
my parents did, because I

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.080
am way too disabled to inbreed.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.480
And I couldn't go on match.com,
because typing is not my thing.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.910
So I was like, where am I
going to catch a husband?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.410
Do you guys want to
know where I caught him?

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.290
I'm like a seal.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.570
I won't do anything if
you don't clap and scream.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.130
You want to know
where I caught him?

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.326
I went to Gaza.

00:06:13.326 --> 00:06:15.200
And the reason I went
to Gaza is because they

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.170
got no place to run.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.060
So here's what I did.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.240
I took my American
passport and I framed it

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.630
in a big gold frame.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.150
And I just walked through
the refugee camp, going,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.490
you want a visa, baby?

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.940
And my husband was like, yes.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.340
I'm like, pack up your stuff.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.840
Let's go.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.530
And he's like, I have no stuff.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.520
So this is another time that
the internet came into my life

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.660
really strongly.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.710
Because all of my friends
had these amazing proposals.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.980
Like my friend Janet, she was
like, so he wrote "I love you"

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.500
on the Scrabble board.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.160
And then we went up in
the hot air balloon.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.050
The balloon exploded,
and the smoke

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.750
wrote, "Will you marry me?"

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.660
And as we were
plummeting to our deaths,

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.540
parachutes opened, and he slid
a Tiffany diamond on my hand.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.440
And I'm like, I don't have the
coordination for any of that.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.780
Like, none of it.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.440
So I bought a diamond ring and
I gave it to him, because he

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.630
was a starving refugee.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.340
Where's he gonna get
a diamond from, right?

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.440
And I showed him a
clip of the season

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.260
finale of "The Bachelorette."

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.960
And I'm like, this
is how you propose,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.130
but you don't leave
two weeks later.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.890
And you have to surprise me.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.200
And then I waited.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.110
One week, two
weeks, three weeks.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.417
And I was like, aw,
man, he stole the ring.

00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:37.500
And I was like, probably
needs to feed his family.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.580
It's OK.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.900
And then I was
crossing a checkpoint,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.380
and I see him on the
other side, like this.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.936
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:07:45.936 --> 00:07:47.810
Now they're going to
shoot him, and I'm never

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.240
gonna get that ring.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.200
Like what am I gonna
do, just loot the body?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.210
Excuse me, it's mine.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.620
So then he held out
the ring, and like

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.780
everything disappeared.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.720
And he looked at me,
and I looked at him,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.580
and he went, here!

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.236
Take it!

00:08:03.236 --> 00:08:04.630
And I went, yes!

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.353
He speaks English.

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:11.010
So as I said, I was
never bullied as a child.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.650
I was never made fun of.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.330
And I happen to have the
exact same best friends

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.410
that I had when I was five
years old, the Jersey girls.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.360
And yeah.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.950
And my friends totally treated
me as an equal at all times.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.930
So when I turned 21, I became
everyone's designated driver.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.659
And the reason they did this
was because Muslims don't drink.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:38.490
Or at least we don't admit
to it on social media.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.720
So they were like, oh, perfect.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.807
You know, Maysoon can be
the designated driver,

00:08:42.807 --> 00:08:44.390
'cause she doesn't
want to go to hell.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.700
And it's great.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.190
And remember, no bacon.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.790
And then-- but it
was a horrible idea.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.760
Because law enforcement
is actually not

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.860
trained to deal with people
with disabilities, right?

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.600
And I thought about this a lot
during "Hands up, don't shoot,"

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.450
because my hands don't go up.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.520
They just stop right here.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.700
And when I used to
get pulled over--

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.720
because I'm a speed demon.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.430
When I used to get pulled over,
the cop would come to the car,

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.170
and I would go to
hand him my license.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.560
I'd be like, hey!

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.890
And he'd be like, are you drunk?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.190
I'd be like, I'm not drunk.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.710
I'm differently abled.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.320
And then he would
ask my best friend

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.710
Tina, who was sitting
next to me, like slumped,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.940
with vomit in her hair.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.650
And they'd be
like, is she drunk?

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.750
And I will never, ever forget
the first time this happened.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.670
The officer asked
her, is she drunk?

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.340
And Tina said, no,
she's retarded.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.500
And I was like, oh my god,
where do I even begin with you?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.590
And the thing is, my friend
Tina never caught on.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.000
It's fascinating to
me that she thought

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.430
I had Down syndrome didn't
realize that retard was a slur,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.460
and had been my best
friend since I was five.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.370
And then I remembered,
Tina doesn't catch on.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.660
My friend spent every single
summer at the Jersey Shore,

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.472
and my dad would send us back
to Palestine, to the war.

00:10:08.472 --> 00:10:10.930
Because he was convinced that
if we didn't go to the Middle

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.130
East every single summer,
we would forget our heritage

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.190
and grow up to be
Britney Spears.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.230
And every single year when I
went, she would come up to me

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.610
and ask the same question.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.594
Are you scared?

00:10:22.594 --> 00:10:24.490
Are you scared to
go to Pakistan?

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.805
So after Tina responds
to the police officer,

00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:33.560
then he looked at me,
and he said, ma'am,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.530
I'm gonna need you to
walk a straight line.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.900
And I was like, I can't!

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.736
And I was like, can I just
do the alphabet backwards?

00:10:40.736 --> 00:10:44.880
Z, Y, X, W, V. And he was like,
I can't even do it forward.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.140
Go.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.220
But like I said, I had the
same friends my entire life.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.400
And so when I joined
Facebook, my Facebook friends

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.970
were my actual friends.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.150
And I had no idea
what I was doing.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.760
So my first status
was, I am on Facebook.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.540
And I was so disappointed
because, I researched it

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.220
for this talk, and
I thought it would

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.250
be something like really deep.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.720
And I was like, oh my god, I
just said, I am on Facebook.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.010
So Facebook, I had
actual friends.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.690
And then I joined Twitter.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.680
And on Twitter,
I met the trolls.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.530
And I've been a
comedian for 15 years.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.230
And I grew up in a
time before YouTube.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.980
So I actually had to
go to comedy clubs,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.930
and stand and wait my turn.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.620
And if you didn't bring
five people to watch you,

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.330
you weren't allowed
to get on stage.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.020
And it was like a brutal game.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.200
And my very first
job as a comedian

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.910
was driving famous
New York comics

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.690
from New York to New Jersey
to do shows in Atlantic City.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.330
And I would be speeding
down the turnpike,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.590
and they would be terrified.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.070
Because I'd be like, no,
I'm an excellent driver.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.170
I swear to God.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.125
And then I'd whip into
the handicap space,

00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:00.500
and they would
forget their fear.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.600
They were like, yeah.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.740
Yeah, she's good.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.870
And so I had had to deal
with hecklers my whole life.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.080
So internet trolls were
no big deal for me.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.220
I thought it was fun.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.560
Like, I basically
have a strategy

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.280
for my internet trolls.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.320
First, I try to educate.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.700
And what I mean by that is I
have some really well-meaning

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.740
trolls.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.620
They just want to help me.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.220
They just want to save me.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.430
So in 2013, I did this TED Talk.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.840
Now, prior to that,
I was actually

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.460
known as the Arab J-Lo.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.280
I kid you not.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.510
This is very funny.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:43.255
I was a comedian, and I had gone
on "Arabs Gone Wild" and "Allah

00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:44.350
Made Me Funny."

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.040
And I did-- I shot a documentary
called "The Muslims Are

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.490
Coming," where this guy who was
my partner, Dean Obeidallah,

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:56.400
he came up with this
brilliant idea for a bunch

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.970
of Muslim comics to tour
places in the deep South that

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.670
had, like, set mosques on
fire and I peed on Qurans.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.320
So we went, in August,
during Ramadan,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.860
to shoot a documentary
in Alabama, Mississippi,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.690
Gainesville, Florida,
Columbus, Georgia.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.360
I mean, Tupelo, Mississippi.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.810
And I was fasting
the entire time

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.660
that we were on tour,
which really gave me

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.840
patience for bigotry.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.880
It's amazing, when you're
hangry, how much patience you

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.350
have for these people.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.240
But even worse than
that was my producer.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.590
And my producer came up to me
one day and she said, listen,

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.140
we can't stop after the
show for you to eat.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.090
Because the shows were
always during the time

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.950
that I was supposed
to break my fast.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.250
She said, we have to
get to the next city.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.820
So can you just grab like
a bagel or something?

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.070
And I was like,
no, I can't survive

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.317
on a bagel for
the next 24 hours.

00:13:53.317 --> 00:13:55.150
And the producer looked
at me, and she said,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.870
Maysoon, nobody
told you to fast.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.900
And I said, nobody told you to
do a documentary about Muslims

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.970
during Ramadan and expect
no one to be fasting!

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.510
So I was known as the Arab J-Lo.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.570
And then I did this TED Talk.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.650
And when I did my TED Talk,
I called it "99 Problems,

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.420
and Palsy is Just One."

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.230
And the point was get
Beyonce's attention.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.980
That's actually the only point.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.480
No.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.290
The point was to
say that we are more

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.090
than just our disabilities.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.090
And I did this entire talk about
how people with disabilities

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.060
are the largest
minority in the world,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.020
and we're the most
under-represented

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.160
on television.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.390
And when we are
represented, it's

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.630
usually by able-bodied
actors cripping up.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.950
And the disabled community
finds that really offensive.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.420
We believe that much like race,
physical visible disability

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.616
cannot be played.

00:14:50.616 --> 00:14:52.490
And even though they
have different histories

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.310
and oppressions,
both people have

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.470
been exploited through media.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.440
And as a people, by the way,
we have absolutely no way

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.570
of knowing how many on-air
personalities and performers

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.460
have invisible disabilities.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.340
Because there's such a
stigma against things

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.360
like mental illness and
chronic pain that to this day,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.240
actors and anchors and
hosts don't feel comfortable

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.340
disclosing a disability
that can't be visibly seen.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.660
But if you turn
on your TV today,

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:27.640
you can click to any daytime
show, from CNN to MSNBC,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.520
"Good Morning America," "The
Today Show," "The View,"

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.540
"The Talk."

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.840
There is not a single visibly
disabled person on television

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.260
right now.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.080
So when I got my
big break, it was--

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.690
I got invited to be on
"Countdown with Keith

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.800
Olbermann."

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.300
And when he invited
me on the show,

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.120
nobody knew I was disabled.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.230
I went in and I
joked about politics.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.280
I was talking about Saudi
Arabia and Michele Bachmann

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.110
and Sarah Palin at the time.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.890
And the fact that I had
disability never came up.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.410
It wasn't part of
the conversation.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.040
So when I went home, I
decided to join Twitter.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.140
Because Keith Olbermann
was my Mr. Miyagi.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.160
And if he tweeted, so would I.
I was like, wax tweet, wax off.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.840
You know.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.220
And so I went on Twitter,
and all of a sudden,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.308
I started having people
guess what was wrong with me.

00:16:22.308 --> 00:16:24.016
And they were like,
did you see that girl

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.099
on Keith Olbermann's show?

00:16:25.099 --> 00:16:26.430
I think she was drunk.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.610
Oh my god, her lip
was so distracting,

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.290
I just wanted to yank it up.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.490
Or my favorite one-- she looks
like an honor killing gone

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.200
wrong.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.980
And somebody else called
me Gumby-mouthed terrorist

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.980
and said they
should pray for me.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.010
So that was my first
experience with trolls.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.320
But on the other
side, as I said,

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.730
were the trolls with
good intentions,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.510
those who wanted to save me.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.990
And they would say,
Maysoon, you were so funny.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.770
I loved your TED
Talk I'm so inspired.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.420
It's amazing how
many people tell me

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.520
I am inspirational when the
main line of the talk was,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.760
"I am not your inspiration."

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.890
People seem to think that
people with disabilities

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.390
are here to make them feel
better about themselves.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.710
So these people would say to
me, I love you so much, Maysoon.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.270
You are so funny.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.130
But you need to accept Jesus.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.452
And I was like, I
do accept Jesus.

00:17:24.452 --> 00:17:25.839
Because guess what?

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.320
Muslims believe that Jesus was
a prophet born to a virgin.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.970
Mind-blowing, I know.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:35.870
Three candidates
just passed out cold.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.860
And I would then say
to them, but can you

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.120
accept that Jesus looks like me?

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.860
Because Jesus was
born in Palestine.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.020
And so that's what
I mean by educate.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.070
First, I try to educate.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.650
But if people refuse to be
educated, then I mock them.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.860
And that's the comedian in
me coming back out to play.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.730
So when people insist
that America is not

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.810
a place for Muslims,
and you need

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:08.399
to go back to your own country,
I'm like, you mean New Jersey?

00:18:08.399 --> 00:18:10.440
Because I know we're
different, but it's actually

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.840
part of the United States.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.730
And I they think that there's
a country out there called,

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.180
like, Islamland, where
all the Muslims came from.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.390
Because I was doing a show
in Texas, and this woman

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:22.330
came up to me.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.769
And I had told the story about
the drunk doctor in New Jersey.

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:27.560
And she came up to me
and she goes, so when

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.780
were you naturalized?

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.170
And I was like, well, like,
you know, my first joke,

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.670
about, like, I'm
born in New Jersey?

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.640
And she's like, I know, I know,
but when were you naturalized?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.610
And I was like, well,
I was born here.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.470
And she's like,
but you're Muslim.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.040
And I was like, yes.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.325
Sit with it.

00:18:47.325 --> 00:18:49.560
Just keep sitting with it.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.670
So after I'm done rambling--
because I'm totally rambling,

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.510
because it's 12 noon, and
that's what I do-- there's going

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.700
to be a Q&amp;A. And you guys
have to think of questions

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.770
and participate.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.260
I know it's hard.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.290
But you guys have
to ask me questions.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.770
Then I'll ignore the
questions and I will

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.980
talk about whatever I want.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.670
So after I got engaged,
I brought the fiance back

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.690
to America.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.630
And my friends, instead of
throwing me a bridal shower,

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.910
they threw me an intervention.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.490
Because here's the problem.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.120
I went to Palestine
basically single.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.970
I come back married, right?

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.720
And they don't understand
that Arab girls don't date.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.800
We get married.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.750
And if you don't
believe me, look at what

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.350
happened to George Clooney.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.250
It's true.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.920
It's totally true.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.120
And so when I walked
into my bridal shower,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.900
Tina met me at the door
holding a piece of paper.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.970
And she was like, Maysoon,
the decisions you are making

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.530
are affecting both
of you and us.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.720
And I am here to tell you that
you are a free American woman.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.320
And you do not, I
repeat, you do not

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.530
have to have an
arranged marriage.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.370
And I was like,
Tina, I arranged it.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.300
So this whole thing about social
media and Twitter and stuff all

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.310
comes full circle to
the fact that I do not

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.310
think that if I grew
up with social media,

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.350
I would actually ever have
become a stand-up comedian.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.390
By the time that I got
exposed to the fact

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:27.720
that people hate online, and
that that hate can bubble off

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.920
into the real world?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.800
I had a woman named Tammy.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.000
Isn't that just the
most sinister name?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.780
Have you ever met
a non-evil Tammy?

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.000
Good Tammy, I know
you're out there.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.670
For every dark side,
there's a light, Good Tammy.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.800
I know you're there.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.070
But this woman named Tammy
started stalking me on Twitter.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.960
And she hated my politics.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.610
Because I have very
controversial politics.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.190
I'm here to admit that.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.590
I believe in equality for all,
regardless of faith, race,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.450
ability, orientation, economic
class, and anything else that

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.370
could other you.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.990
And people do not dig
that kind of radicalism.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.420
Like, the idea that
everyone should be equal

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.350
is just so disgusting, right?

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.670
And so Tammy was
really not having

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.810
my wanting equality for all.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:22.180
And she somehow found my
chefugee's cell phone number.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.840
And you may ask yourself
what a chefugee is.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.910
A chefugee is a
refugee who is a chef.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.020
Because the refugee that
I caught and brought

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.580
to America now owns a vegan food
truck, so I call him chefugee.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.410
And I never use his
real name because I

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.280
don't want people like Tammy
to google him and find me.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.790
But somehow she did.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:48.690
And she started calling
my house 24 hours a day.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.150
And I had to actually go
and get a restraining order.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.170
And when you're
being cyberstalked,

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.680
no one takes you
seriously at all.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.260
And when you're a comedian
that travels the world,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.060
the restraining order will
only cover you in one place.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.820
So any other place
that I publicly

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.050
announced that I was going
to be made me vulnerable.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.690
And it became the
reality of my life.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.270
The reality of my life
is, as a Palestinian

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.940
who happens to be
Muslim-- because you

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.580
can be Christian or atheist
or Buddhist or Mormon.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.330
We're not just one religion.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.650
It's not a monolith.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.430
But as a Muslim woman
that performed uncovered

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.230
and uncensored all over
the Middle East, in Doha,

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.460
in Beirut, in Jerusalem,
Ramallah, Amman, Cairo,

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.390
I had never in my
life been threatened

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.720
by a fellow Muslim or a fellow
Arab who identified as such.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.420
And in America, the reality of
my life is on a daily basis,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.590
I get threats from
right-wing extremists

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.350
who do not believe
that I have the right

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.050
to exist in this country.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:59.590
And it's interesting to
me that we live in an age

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.020
where I grew up with
the same best friends.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.490
They never made fun of me.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.440
The disabled kids that reach
out to me on a daily basis

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.760
online now-- because one of
the blessings of the TED Talk

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.880
was the fact that people who
never had access to the world

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.860
now do.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.100
That means people who
are non-verbal, people

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.030
who don't have the ability to go
to settings like this, because

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.020
up until recently, buildings
weren't accessible,

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.480
they got a whole new
accessibility to the world

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.760
through the internet.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.800
So for every troll,
there was another person

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.190
who was worth knowing.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.740
For example, I'm
rarely defeated.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.620
And I have this mantra,
and it's Yes, you can can.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.120
Right?

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.155
My dad taught me.

00:23:40.155 --> 00:23:41.660
It's, yes, you can can.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.400
Means, like, you
can do anything.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.030
And sometimes I get defeated.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.810
And one of the times was when
I was offered a job writing

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.160
at the Daily Beast.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.460
And I really wanted to do
it, but I couldn't physically

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.910
keep up with the typing.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.130
And if I paid a typist, I
would actually make no money.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.920
So I complained
about it on Twitter.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.410
And this woman named Mary
volunteered to type for me.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.920
And she's been typing for
me for three years straight.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.000
She typed a book.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.310
She typed a screenplay,
every single article

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.360
I've ever written for
The Daily Beast and BBC

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.340
and anything else
I've ever written for,

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.960
and she's never
charged me a dime.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.450
And there's another
thing that I do,

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.350
which is I live-tweet
"The Amazing Race."

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.030
And I've been doing
this for years.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.120
And I have a
teammate, and our team

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.270
is called Team [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.470
It's a long story.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.120
But we race every single season.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.130
And by the end of it,
I feel like I actually

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.750
have raced around
the world in a race

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.870
that I could never actually do.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.580
And "The Amazing
Race" and reality TV

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.650
is the one place
that we actually

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:46.940
see disability reflected
honestly in media.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.660
With "Dancing With the
Stars," "The Bachelorette."

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.820
"The Bachelorette" is
my favorite example

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.870
of mainstreaming disability.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.190
Because there was a Bachelorette
who was missing a limb.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:04.500
And she proved that you could
be disabled, vapid, annoying,

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.340
and desperate, just like
any other Bachelorette.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.730
And that's the other problem.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.740
The other problem is
on the rare occasion

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.270
that television does cast
someone with a disability,

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.000
we are rarely seeing
people of color.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.840
And when they do, as I
said, you don't see them

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.720
as the lawyer on "Scandal,"
or the best friend

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.600
on "The Big Bang Theory," or
a romantic lead in a sitcom.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.750
It's always that
very special episode.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.150
And one of two
things has to happen.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.980
Either they have to be healed,
or they have to scream,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.100
you can't love me
because I'm disabled!

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.680
And I just want to scream
back, no, we can't love you

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.846
because you're annoying.

00:25:49.846 --> 00:25:50.698
Anyway.

00:25:50.698 --> 00:25:52.640
So I have a lot of anger.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.290
Because in the
Oppression Olympics,

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.660
I would win a gold medal.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.660
I'm Palestinian, I'm Muslim,
I'm disabled, I'm a female,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.580
and I live in New Jersey.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.740
It just doesn't get
worse than that.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.590
OK.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.980
So I'm gonna wrap up
everything that I've

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.850
been talking about
with a joke that

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.790
has nothing to do with anything,
because I feed off laughter.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.880
And then a really
serious statement

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.648
about how you guys can fix this
broken world. 'Cause the world

00:26:21.648 --> 00:26:25.070
is busted.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.710
I decided to stop
using the word bitch.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.760
Because bitch is misogynistic.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.440
And it never really
occurred to me,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.180
except I was doing this
panel with Felicity Huffman.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.610
Sorry, I just dropped a name.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.492
I'm palsy.

00:26:36.492 --> 00:26:37.374
I drop stuff.

00:26:37.374 --> 00:26:38.260
Oops.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.060
And she was like, you know, we
shouldn't use the word bitch,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.730
because it's misogynistic.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.810
But I'm so used to
using it that I needed

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.540
to find a replacement word.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.220
So like, I'd love you guys
to join me in replacing bitch

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.558
with the following word.

00:26:52.558 --> 00:26:53.514
Popple.

00:26:53.514 --> 00:26:57.930
It's spelled P-O-P-P-L-E.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.510
And for those of you who
don't know what a Popple is,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.970
it was a stuffed animal
from the '80s that

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.270
had the ability to stuff
its head in its butt

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.220
and become a ball.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.820
And it works out perfectly as a
replacement for the word bitch.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.050
Because first of
all, like, if I'm

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.290
like, why you being
such a Popple?

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.460
The person you're yelling
at is like, I don't even

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.012
know what she just said.

00:27:21.012 --> 00:27:22.796
Am I-- am I insulted?

00:27:22.796 --> 00:27:24.140
I kind of-- I don't know.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.276
And then like, what
a basic Popple.

00:27:27.276 --> 00:27:29.445
Or you're like, Popple, please!

00:27:29.445 --> 00:27:32.070
And what you're saying is, stick
your head in your ass and roll

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.820
outta here.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.050
So it's like my
"fetch" or "fleek."

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.660
And I would really appreciate if
the Google Empire started using

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.120
Popple instead of bitch, OK?

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.030
Can I get a witness.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.250
So the world is broken.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.720
But we can fix it.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.210
We can fix it by saying no.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.980
Say no to being
an internet troll.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.180
And if you have kids, say no
to raising an internet troll.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.670
Say no to arming
violence worldwide,

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.770
and say no to violence
against women.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.380
It is very, very
disturbing that I

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.240
can walk around a war zone
at 2 o'clock in the morning

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.090
and feel safer than
I do at 2 o'clock

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.130
in the morning on a
US college campus.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.010
Say no to being silenced.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.040
Your voice is your weapon
against inequality.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.125
Use it.

00:28:25.125 --> 00:28:28.910
My name is Maysoon Zayid, and
if I can can, you can can.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.330
Thank you, Google.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.260
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.230
See, this is really good.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.560
People are always
fascinated by the fact

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.770
that I can walk in heels.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.902
Or limp in heels, as
I like to call it.

00:28:47.902 --> 00:28:49.360
And there's a good
reason for that.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.870
And that's because when my
dad taught me how to walk,

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.040
he used to dangle a
dollar bill in front of me

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.400
and have me chase it.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.675
And so my inner
stripper is so strong

00:28:57.675 --> 00:29:01.260
that I was, like, running
in stilettos at, like, five.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.390
OK, who has a question?

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.640
In the back.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.534
AUDIENCE: What happened with
the person-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:09.534 --> 00:29:11.950
What happened with the person
that made a slur against you

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.500
in the car?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.640
MAYSOON ZAYID: I'm sorry?

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.040
AUDIENCE: You gave an example
where someone made a slur--

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.630
MAYSOON ZAYID: OK,
so the person who

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.120
made the slur
against me in the car

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.830
was actually my best friend.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.430
And she is proof that a lot
of people still to this day

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.610
do not know that the
R-word is a slur.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.910
And now I'm going to
talk to you about words.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.070
I think that context
actually matters.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.250
And I had the Mothers
Against the R-word

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.740
came after me because
I tell that joke.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.580
And the reason I tell that
joke is if you go online and go

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.800
look at clips of me,
you'll find 10 to 20 people

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.650
in the Comments section
that say she's retarded.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.430
Or retard.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.770
Like, I get called
it all the time.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.070
So I think of it
as a word that I

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:00.020
can use, because I want people
to understand that not only is

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.120
that offensive, but
it's sometimes a word

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.080
that people don't even realize
they're being offensive.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.255
So when she said it, she didn't
know that it was a bad thing.

00:30:11.255 --> 00:30:14.050
You know, I work with
kids in refugee camps.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.200
And often the kids with cerebral
palsy are put with the kids

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.220
with the intellectual
disabilities,

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.860
because we slur, and we
drag words, and some of us

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.960
are non-verbal.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.810
And the assumption is,
if you're non-verbal,

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.630
that you don't understand.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.090
And it's a really
big issue in America.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.730
There's 30 states
that don't allow

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.440
people with certain
disabilities to get married.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.150
And there's been a
lot of opposition

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.700
to this, because with the
creation of technology that

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:46.480
allows the non-verbal community
to now express themselves,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.280
we're able to show people that
these people do have opinions,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.720
and that they do have feelings.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.920
And just because they
can't verbalize it,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.210
doesn't mean they don't
think of those things.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.700
So I don't punish Tina.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.470
But what I do now is I
punish people on Facebook.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.340
So one of the things
that people like to do

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.660
is they'll write,
that's fucking retarded,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.880
about something
that's really stupid

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.180
and should be criticized.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.570
And I come back, I'm
like, guys, you can't

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.720
use the R-word on my page.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.840
And then they'll come right back
and put fucktard or libtard.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.950
And I'm like, OK, guys, the
word tard cannot be used on this

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:22.840
page.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.390
But the crip community, we call
ourselves the crip community.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.950
We use the word cripple.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.440
We don't like the fact that
it's used on news reports

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.010
to describe things
that are negative.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.740
We're trying to bring back
like a positive image to it.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.010
Because you have a
lot of associations--

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.912
and I'm going off on a tangent,
but I hope it makes sense.

00:31:42.912 --> 00:31:44.370
You have a lot of
associations that

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.340
are run by parents or people
without the disabilities

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.430
speaking for the people
with disabilities.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.430
This happens with CP.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.615
It happens with autism.

00:31:51.615 --> 00:31:54.810
And it happens with a lot
of other disabilities.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.940
And there's a myth that
people with disabilities

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.810
spend day and night
dreaming of being healed.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.100
And it's just not the truth.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.350
And so there's a lot of
people trying to cure us.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:12.660
There's a lot of suggestions of
unnecessary, brutal surgeries

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.660
that parents that have
no idea-- they just

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.640
want to fix their broken kid.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.350
They don't understand that
you can have quality of life,

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:24.470
that having a disability becomes
part of your personality,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.390
like any other aspect
of your personality.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.690
And I've seen parents have
these extensive surgeries

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.310
without the child ever
giving permission.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.680
And the kids grow up
and they resent it.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.000
Because they feel like they
were never good enough,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.400
and the parents were
always trying to fix them.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.780
And I think what made me
so confident was my parents

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.670
weren't trying to fix me.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.010
They just didn't really care
that I had a disability.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.960
So it was never a big
deal in our family.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.840
I was treated exactly the
same way that my sisters were.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.630
If they had to clean,
I had to clean.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.430
If they went to
bed, I went to bed.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.830
I got no leeway because
of the disability.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.070
And they did things to
help improve my health,

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.280
but I never even realized
they were doing it.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.260
Like, they sent me to dancing
school so that I could walk.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.900
They sent me a piano instead
of occupational therapy.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.780
Because I was born in a time
where the ADA didn't exist.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.660
Accessibility didn't exist.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.830
And they just tried their
hardest to mainstream me.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.160
And I lucked out.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.410
And I don't understand why.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.560
Why am I the person who ended up
with the friends whose parents

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.860
taught them to be decent?

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.270
Why is it that to
this day-- like,

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:39.030
there's a campaign
going on right now,

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.710
and it's such a nightmare.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.590
It's called "Just say hi."

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.660
And it's by one of
these foundations that

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.040
don't know what they're doing.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.510
And they suggested that if
you see a disabled person,

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.660
just say hi.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.660
Excuse me, uh, I'm
not a zoo animal.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.250
And-- and so we reacted.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.580
And I was like, first
of all, I'm really busy.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.940
And if you come up to
me while I'm eating

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.128
and you just say hi, I'm just
gonna spit and blame the CP.

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:11.560
And then they delved further
and they said, well, you know,

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.179
it's because people don't
know how to approach people

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.520
with disabilities.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.730
And this is fascinating to
me, that in 2015, people

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.980
don't know how to talk
to someone with CP?

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.550
Why is that?

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.679
I'll tell you why.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.860
Because if you turn
on your TV, there

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.429
are no positive
images of disability.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.850
And that is where
children learn, a lot more

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.219
than from their parents.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.310
Yes, parents have
dropped the ball

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.340
at teaching their kids to be
more accepting, whether it's

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.810
of someone who doesn't
believe in Santa,

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.030
or someone who has severe burns.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.315
That is a parent's job.

00:34:45.315 --> 00:34:48.929
But you and I, we all
know a lot of parents

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.330
are not good parents.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.929
Like, that's a total myth.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.460
And I hate on holidays,
when social media is flooded

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.330
with stuff like, if you
don't call your mom,

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.279
you're an asshole.

00:34:58.279 --> 00:34:59.820
Well, maybe they
don't have a mother.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.590
Maybe their mother beat
them their entire lives.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.160
So what do we look at then?

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.720
We look at TV.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.050
Why doesn't Sesame Street have
a permanent disabled character?

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.470
Why doesn't Dora have
a disabled friend?

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.110
Why, when you turn on
daytime talk shows,

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.710
a show like "The View" that has
represented every type of woman

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.422
you could imagine, including
those with their so

00:35:23.422 --> 00:35:27.236
little information they
should never speak in public,

00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:32.420
they've never once had a
visibly disabled host-- why?

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.360
So if you don't see these
people on television,

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.120
and you don't meet these
people in real life,

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.310
that's what makes
us a spectacle.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:43.450
But it's shocking to me
that a foundation that

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.160
claims to represent
people with CP

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.900
decided to do a campaign with a
bunch of celebrity videos, none

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.060
of which included celebrities
with CP, saying, if you see me

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.490
on the street, just say hi.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.910
Again, like I'm totally
paranoid about being killed.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.386
It's, like, my big thing, right?

00:36:02.386 --> 00:36:03.010
I have no fear.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.130
I've been in war zones.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.710
I've been shot at, but not hit.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.360
That's what counts.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.350
But I'm a touring comic,
and I tour by myself.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.930
So I'm constantly afraid
of being serial-killed.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.950
So if random people just start
popping up and saying hi,

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.830
I'm gonna like start
doing jiu-jitsu,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.760
and it's not gonna be pretty.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.512
Next question.

00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:28.410
AUDIENCE: Are there
any things that you

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.790
find encouraging
about what's happened

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.689
since your talk and all
the success with it?

00:36:32.689 --> 00:36:35.104
I mean, you mentioned
that TV hasn't progressed.

00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:37.980
But are there rays
of hope, in terms

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.220
of seeing people with
visible disabilities as just

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.080
normal people?

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.310
MAYSOON ZAYID: Yeah.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.867
So the downside of
the TED Talk was

00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:48.730
I got millions and
millions of hits.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.345
I had the number one
TED Talk of 2014.

00:36:50.345 --> 00:36:52.782
I beat all the men.

00:36:52.782 --> 00:36:54.180
It's not a competition.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.060
I just won.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:57.225 --> 00:36:59.900
And I was shocked,
because after "Countdown

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.040
with Keith Olbermann,"
no one would hire me.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.390
And I heard two things.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.440
One, she's too distracting.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.344
And they're talking
about me shaking.

00:37:07.344 --> 00:37:09.510
And two, we hate her politics.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.550
And they're talking
about me wanting equality

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.840
for Palestinians.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.790
That's what they hate about
my politics, to be clear.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.814
And-- but the upside
of it was the people

00:37:18.814 --> 00:37:20.170
that I told you about.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.460
The people that reached out
to me, like Dominick Evans.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.610
Dominick Evans,
every Saturday night,

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.030
does a chat-- not a
chat, but like a thing,

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.480
where he does #FilmDis.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.480
Like the word Film and
the beginning of the word

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.560
Disability.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.130
And he reached out to me.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.020
And he was like,
hey, Maysoon, we've

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.620
been fighting against
able-bodied actors playing

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.570
disabled for years now.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.020
And we do this hashtag.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.270
And I joined the group.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.570
And when I joined the
group, a lot of my friends

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:52.180
who are non-disabled, like
Jonas Elrod and Lexi Alexander,

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.150
they started
following these guys

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.750
and realizing there
are disabled directors.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.140
There are disabled writers.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.180
There are disabled actors.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.990
And a lot of the blowback
I got after the TED Talk

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.220
was, she would have no
career if she didn't have CP.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.940
And I thought,
that's so hilarious.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.880
Like, because as if Hollywood
just loves disability so much.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:20.840
And it was amazing to me
that it didn't translate

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.460
into the work I wanted.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.420
But it was also amazing to
me that people literally

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.880
have written to me saying,
I was going to kill myself.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.580
I am now not going to.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.410
And that's the thing
that I never expected.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.460
I joke about I never
want to be a role model,

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.200
because anyone who
follows me will end up

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.080
running around Times Square,
naked, screaming "Jihad!"

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.080
But I have people
reaching out to me

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.070
that just had a kid
with cerebral palsy, who

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.250
were sitting there
mourning the child

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.285
that they lost, not realizing
that the child that they had

00:38:52.285 --> 00:38:53.890
could have a great life.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.600
And that it wasn't the
end-- it was actually

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.470
just the beginning.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.710
I've had people with
cerebral palsy that

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.500
are fighting with their
colleges and feeling totally

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.852
defeated reach out to me.

00:39:03.852 --> 00:39:06.310
And then I get on the phone
with the college, and I'm like,

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.600
you don't want me to tweet this.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.235
You do not want
me to tweet this.

00:39:10.235 --> 00:39:12.080
Get rid of that gravel path.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.230
And you know, I do yoga.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:18.600
So there was this theory, and
it's-- like if you google it?

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.960
I say that all the time.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.060
You can go on my Twitter
and see how many times

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.520
I go, oh, just google it.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.240
I'm not doing your homework.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.610
But if you google this, people
claim that people with CP

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.360
start to deteriorate
after the age of 25.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.150
In my case, when I was 27, the
resting position of my hands

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.260
was this.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.780
And then I started doing yoga,
and I actually progressed.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.800
So I have people with
CP reach out to me

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.840
who have just
thought that this was

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.070
the end of the road for them.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.250
I'm like, no, you gotta
look into nutrition,

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.520
and you gotta look
into exercise.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.830
And I've been able to give
advice to people in Malaysia,

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:02.190
in Texas, in places that I
would never meet them otherwise.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.910
And what works for me
won't work for everyone.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.386
But if I'm able to get that
one person that just never

00:40:08.386 --> 00:40:10.260
had a friend to feel
like they have a friend?

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.355
Like that's-- you know, I
said the internet's like "Star

00:40:13.355 --> 00:40:13.960
Wars," right?

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.020
And there's a dark side.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.090
But the light side
is a lot of people

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.090
who never had friends can
actually now find and have

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:20.610
friends.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.290
They find that
community online that

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.080
believes in what
they believe in.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.830
And I think that
that's something

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.320
that no matter what
else I do in my life,

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.570
like win an Oscar--
which I will do.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.380
I just need to get
cast in a movie,

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.795
because disabilities win awards.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.990
I think that that's one of
the biggest things that's

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.530
affected me, is the
fact that I know

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.050
that there are people who had
absolutely no hope, who do now.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.550
Who are living healthier,
more productive lives.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.230
And it's great to have this
team of disabled actors

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:54.470
that are on my side with
wanting the representation

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.930
to change in Hollywood.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.870
Because in the intersection
of intersectionality,

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.430
disability got run over.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:03.040
We're the last community
to be represented.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.600
So like, everyone else is
making leaps and bounds,

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.900
and we're still not.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.860
And when you realize that you're
not the only one fighting it,

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.510
together with our
voices, we were

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:15.210
able to get the Screen
Actors Guild union to partner

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.580
and do a workshop that
was all about what's

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.910
wrong with disability in
entertainment, this summer.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.930
And we had people from CBS
and from all the big networks

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.250
coming in to see.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.670
And understanding
that, like, it's 2015.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.210
We don't need a Just
Say Hi campaign.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.790
We need to be mainstreamed.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.746
Next question.

00:41:38.546 --> 00:41:39.151
Two at a time.

00:41:39.151 --> 00:41:39.650
He's first.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:40.357
You're second.

00:41:40.357 --> 00:41:42.542
I watched him touch the base.

00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:44.784
AUDIENCE: I actually
a meeting at 1:00.

00:41:44.784 --> 00:41:46.492
But it was very
interesting watching you.

00:41:46.492 --> 00:41:47.220
Thank you.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.705
MAYSOON ZAYID: What, what, what?

00:41:48.705 --> 00:41:50.310
AUDIENCE: I had a
meeting at 1:00.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.630
But it was very
interesting watching you.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.171
MAYSOON ZAYID: OK,
thank you so much.

00:41:53.171 --> 00:41:54.306
Follow me on maysoon.com.

00:41:54.306 --> 00:41:55.810
M-A-Y-S-O-O-N.com.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.470
If you forget,
palsy Palestinian.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.680
Palsy Palestinian.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.380
OK, I think she's in the light.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.740
AUDIENCE: So how do you
think technology can help?

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.480
MAYSOON ZAYID: I'm sorry?

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.390
AUDIENCE: How do you
think technology can help?

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.889
MAYSOON ZAYID: Technology can
help on every different level.

00:42:11.889 --> 00:42:16.540
One of the biggest obstacles
that the disability community

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.810
alone is facing is
the fact that we often

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.330
are denied the right
to education worldwide.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.050
And I work with disabled
and wounded refugee children

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.030
with physical disabilities
that were left out

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.710
by the public school system.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.350
And one of our biggest
assets is using technology

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.080
so that they can communicate.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.480
It really is a game
changer for people

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.410
that are non-verbal, for
people who are missing limbs.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.660
It's so important.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.780
I did something for
Google a couple of years

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.260
ago called Conflict
in a Connected World.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.960
And I think that
technology also helps

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.040
as a voice of the oppressed.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:55.410
I've seen such a difference in
the way political events have

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.400
been covered in
the past 10 years

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.770
than I did in the '90s,
when it was completely

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.220
controlled by governments
letting cameras in or not.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.420
And now you have all
these citizen journalists

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.970
who are given a voice that we
would never otherwise hear.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:13.650
And I think that has really
been a game changer for people

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:15.040
who suffer oppression.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.270
Where I've seen
it completely fail

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.640
is in battling
violence against women.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.890
Because social media
has become another form

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.440
of violence against us.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.630
So I'm not quite
sure how technology

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.030
plays into battling that.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.010
I don't think documenting helps.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:35.490
We saw that when kids--
kids-- got a one-year sentence

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:36.900
for a brutal rape.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.380
So I don't know
how technology can

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.390
be used to kind of solve that.

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:46.490
So if you figure it
out, you let me know.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.185
Yes?

00:43:47.185 --> 00:43:48.476
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:43:48.476 --> 00:43:49.746
One's very quick.

00:43:49.746 --> 00:43:51.412
The vegan food
truck you mentioned

00:43:51.412 --> 00:43:52.549
that the chefugee started?

00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:53.090
What is that?

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.590
MAYSOON ZAYID: It's
called Falafull.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.900
It's based in Hoboken
and Jersey City.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.950
And it's really
interesting, because one

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:04.350
of the things that I found
out was that sugar, chemicals,

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:08.340
caffeine, and meat,
meat products,

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.680
made my cerebral
palsy more severe.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.436
They made me spaz more.

00:44:12.436 --> 00:44:15.040
So like when Kanye's like, hold
me back, I'm 'bout to spaz?

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.560
If I ate a cheeseburger,
I was like, I'm spazzing!

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.374
So I decided to try vegan,
and it cut down my spasticity

00:44:22.374 --> 00:44:24.830
by, I would say, about 60%.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:29.740
And it completely changed my
digestion, the way I breathe,

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.230
and it just really helped.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.240
Problem is, I'm
addicted to cheese.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.060
So I'm constantly falling
off the vegan wagon.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.740
I just had some
cheddar Sun Chips.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.680
And I was like, I
need sour cream!

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.390
And like-- I just, I'm
a failed wannabe vegan.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.000
And so my husband started
a vegan food truck

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.410
because I don't allow
any meat in the house.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.330
And he's basically a vegan chef.

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:54.740
It's really cool.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.090
And I think he's really
interesting, and I never,

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.670
ever, ever talk about him.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.940
Because I never wanted
people to think that marriage

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.960
was an accomplishment,
because it's not.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.635
And I do not recommend it.

00:45:05.635 --> 00:45:07.490
But he's a fascinating story.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.710
Because this is a dude who--
all five of his brothers

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.925
have been shot.

00:45:11.925 --> 00:45:13.740
All five have survived.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.630
And he and all five
of his brothers

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.640
have been political prisoners
at some point in his life.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.960
And when he lived
in Bethlehem, he

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.250
had absolutely no chance of
pursuing any sort of dream.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.800
So when he came to America,
I was like, you're free.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.040
You can do anything.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.240
What's your dream?

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.290
And he said, I want to
work in a supermarket.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.970
And I said, no, that
is not your dream.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.020
And then he came up with
the vegan food truck,

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.100
and now he's a business owner.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.800
And you know, he
bought me this ring

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.640
to replace the one I bought.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.520
And you know, the American
dream is something

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.760
that no one believes
exists anymore,

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.910
unless you live in a nightmare.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.720
And then when you
do, you know it does.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.250
So what was the second question?

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.310
AUDIENCE: Second
question was, what's

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.490
the most annoying thing
about using your phone?

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:06.417
MAYSOON ZAYID: About--
I barely use my phone.

00:46:06.417 --> 00:46:08.250
The most annoying thing
about using my phone

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.420
is that it falls out
of my hand constantly.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.260
So I just have a series
of shattered BlackBerrys.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.590
And I have to use a BlackBerry,
because I need a keypad.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.424
Because otherwise I'd just
be slapping at a smartphone,

00:46:19.424 --> 00:46:20.670
feeling stupid.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:22.720
And I hate the phone.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.660
I never answer my phone calls.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.490
My voicemail says I never
answer my phone calls.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:28.910
I don't answer.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:30.790
And I don't check
my voice messages,

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:34.140
so if you actually want
to talk to me, text me.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.500
And people will go
find me on Twitter.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.020
Like, I'll ignore my phone,
and suddenly my agent

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.350
will be tweeting me, like
answer your damn phone.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:47.660
You know, my mom's not on
social media and that's good.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.840
I would hate that, yeah.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.290
So OK, we have time
for one last question,

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.560
and it has to be outlandish.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.350
No pressure.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.170
But one of my nails broke.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:47:00.490
I need to get offstage,
because it's snagging my face.

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:06.530
The guy in the New York
Yankees cap in denial

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:10.160
that the Mets are
finally winning!

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.530
I'm a lifelong Mets fan,
not a fair-weather friend.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.071
And again, you get
on my social media

00:47:14.071 --> 00:47:17.759
and see 10 years of me crying.

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:19.258
AUDIENCE: I'm
actually more of a fan

00:47:19.258 --> 00:47:20.683
of Yankees hats than Yankees.

00:47:20.683 --> 00:47:21.516
MAYSOON ZAYID: Nice.

00:47:21.516 --> 00:47:23.070
That is so strange.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.349
What other hats do you fan?

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:26.140
AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.589
I'm a bald guy.

00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:29.673
I get sunburned on my head,
so I gotta have a hat.

00:47:29.673 --> 00:47:31.172
MAYSOON ZAYID: I
feel your baldness.

00:47:31.172 --> 00:47:32.108
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:32.108 --> 00:47:33.506
Um.

00:47:33.506 --> 00:47:36.780
MAYSOON ZAYID: Just
gonna pet myself.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.110
Trying to bring sexy
back to disability.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.204
Is it working?

00:47:41.204 --> 00:47:42.633
OK.

00:47:42.633 --> 00:47:44.758
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
you've traveled a lot.

00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:45.591
MAYSOON ZAYID: Yeah.

00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:47.174
AUDIENCE: And I was
wondering if there

00:47:47.174 --> 00:47:49.620
was any place that you've been
that's really doing things

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.400
right by you.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.740
MAYSOON ZAYID: Cambridge
High School in Massachusetts.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.190
That's the only place that's
really doing it right.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.429
As far as accessibility,
or as far as equality?

00:48:04.429 --> 00:48:05.720
AUDIENCE: I can go with either.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.553
MAYSOON ZAYID: Yeah.

00:48:06.553 --> 00:48:08.670
Like, I went to
Luxembourg, and I thought

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.060
that place would be perfect.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.070
And it wasn't.

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:13.450
So like, Europe is
failing on equality.

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:17.010
The Middle East is a hot mess.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.810
Texas is a nightmare, but
the food is really good.

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.850
There's no place-- there's no
place that's getting it right.

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:27.110
But there are places that are
doing a lot better than we are.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.860
So I just flew back from
Canada, and they are definitely,

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.912
definitely more diverse.

00:48:32.912 --> 00:48:36.630
Like when I turned on the TV and
started watching TV in Canada,

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:39.322
they're so much more
diverse than we are.

00:48:39.322 --> 00:48:43.240
BBC actually forced
there people who

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.230
are producers to commit to
putting on more disabled people

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.670
or more people of color.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:51.470
And a lot of people think
that's forced, and it's not.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:55.470
Like, having something that
reflects reality is not forced.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.450
It's accurate.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.320
But this Cambridge School, they
were the most accessible school

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.310
I've ever seen.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:03.540
They did it totally right.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.050
They had captioning.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.560
So like a lot of people
use auto-captioning.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.420
Auto-captioning is horrible.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.280
It's terrible.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.950
It's like the game of telephone.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:14.740
It has nothing to do
with what's being said.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.220
So like, Cambridge School
live-captions everything.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.860
It's extremely diverse.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.250
The entire campus
was accessible.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.480
So in that little
microcosm was the best

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.230
I've ever seen it done.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.250
But I'll take your question in
a totally different direction

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.870
and talk about my favorite
places to do comedy.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.335
So of course I-- you
can sit and relax.

00:49:34.335 --> 00:49:36.660
You don't have to stay.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.829
I love, of course, I love doing
comedy in New York, right?

00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:41.620
Because this is the
center of the universe.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.670
And I got to perform with Dave
Chappelle and Lewis Black,

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.730
and you could only do
that in New York City.

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:49.180
Because I would be a loser
waiting my turn at a club,

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.820
and they would walk
in and do comedy.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.111
And then I'd be like, I did
a show with Dave Chappelle!

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:58.140
But I love doing
comedy in Texas.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.750
And they are the most,
like, jubilant, happy, ready

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.740
to laugh crowd I have ever seen.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.800
And even though
they're in denial,

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.100
Texas is really diverse.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.100
Like, I saw like
fifty shades of brown.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.090
I was like, wow!

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:17.270
And worldwide, I love
doing shows in Beirut.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:18.950
It's another party city.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:21.200
But I get to do
comedy in Arabic,

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.490
and I love doing
comedy in Arabic.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:25.970
Because Arabic is
such a great language.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.860
It has, like, all
these different words.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:32.700
And people are used to
Arabic being shouted on TV.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.970
So they go out there and
do tons of jokes in Arabic

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:39.160
and have it be, like, light
and full of laughter, that's

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.330
really, really cool for me.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.650
And the best show that
I ever did in my life

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:47.530
was I got to perform
for Muhammad Ali.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.700
And I got on stage
and I said, I'm

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.500
performing for the man who
floats like a butterfly, stings

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.110
like a bee, has
Parkinson's, and shakes just

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.550
like me, Muhammad Ali!

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:01.530
And so that was my favorite,
favorite performance.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:04.590
But as I wrap up and let
you go back to your work,

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:07.392
I'll tell you about my
favorite celebrity meeting.

00:51:07.392 --> 00:51:10.000
So, I love Dave Matthews.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.810
I had seen him 103
times in concert.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:16.950
And from the age of 14, I
used to say to my friends,

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:18.970
someday I'm going to
meet Dave Matthews.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:20.515
We're going to chat,
become friends.

00:51:20.515 --> 00:51:21.890
He's going to give
me his number.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.250
I'm gonna tell him
all about Palestine.

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.100
And so I got cast in this
movie with Adam Sandler called,

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.890
"You Don't Mess with the Zohan."

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:33.140
And I walk on set, and it's
like a comedy dream come true.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.990
I walk on set and it's
Chris Rock, Dana Carvey,

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.830
Kevin Nealon, Kevin James,
Rob Schneider, Adam Sandler,

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.884
and Henry Winkler, the Fonz.

00:51:41.884 --> 00:51:43.315
And I'm like, oh my god!

00:51:43.315 --> 00:51:47.610
I've obviously died and
gone to comedy heaven.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:50.900
And I was trying so hard
to be cool, and failing.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:54.000
And I had this laptop bag
that said Dave Matthews.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.530
And Adam Sandler says to me,
oh, you like Dave Matthews?

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.320
He's in the movie.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.370
And I was like, haha, funny man.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:02.380
So I go and I get my
makeup done to go on set.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.610
And this is like
$100 million movie.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:06.680
So if you're late, you
make anything late,

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.860
you're losing like
thousands of dollars.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:14.700
And I walk out on set in full
makeup and I see Dave Matthews.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:17.001
And so Adam Sandler
comes to introduce me,

00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:18.490
and I'm like, oh my god.

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.610
I can't believe this
is actually happening.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.790
And so I was so
happy, because I had

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:26.030
this beautiful makeup and this
amazing outfit from wardrobe.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:28.530
And I looked great, like
to meet Dave Matthews.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:32.780
And I turned around and I went--
and I started ugly crying.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.290
And like, the snot
was meeting the drool,

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:36.692
and it was all going down.

00:52:36.692 --> 00:52:39.050
And the makeup people
came running up to me,

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:40.580
because I'm supposed
to go on set,

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.260
and I'm crying off my face.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.900
And I started like ranting.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.975
And I was like, and then
when I went to the prom,

00:52:46.975 --> 00:52:48.557
and nobody would
dance with me, I

00:52:48.557 --> 00:52:50.390
was just like--
(SINGING) Crash into me.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.165
And then I was listening to "Red
Rocks," and there was a war.

00:52:53.165 --> 00:52:54.540
And I was like--
(SINGING) Crash.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.290
And I was crying.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.580
And then the makeup
woman came up to me.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:02.640
And Dave put his arm
around me and I crumpled.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.880
And then I came to, and
they put me in time out.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.930
And I was driving home that
night, and I was like, oh!

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.080
I carried a watermelon.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.860
And then I came
back the next day,

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.831
and I didn't know he
was going to be on set.

00:53:14.831 --> 00:53:16.205
And as I was
walking across set--

00:53:16.205 --> 00:53:18.790
there's like 100
witnesses, because nobody

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:22.430
would believe this story
otherwise-- he sang my name.

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.100
We became friends,
he gave me his number

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.580
and we talked about Palestine.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.200
So dreams can can come true.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.310
Thank you again, Google.

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:31.590
I'm Maysoon Zayid.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.090
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:35.490
Ready?

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:36.690
One--

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:39.039
[LAUGHTER]
