00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.060
So if we think about our nuclear

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.770
chromosomes, and our mitochondrial chromosomes, that includes everything

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.370
that you see here in this picture. All of this is the total cellular genome, for

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.410
the total human genome. Now when I say the total human genome in this case, I'm

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.600
not referring to any individual human in particular.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.790
I'm just referencing The constituent parts, or chromosomes,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.590
that all play a role in making a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.060
human. For example, we know that chromosome one, two,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.270
three, four, five, six, seven, alright, all the way

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.160
down to the chromosome 22 and the sex chromosomes

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.650
and the mitochondrial chromosome is important in making a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.470
human. Now for just a moment, don't count extra

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.970
copies of chromosomes. I want you to tell me

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.230
how many unique chromosomes are there in the total

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.590
cellular genome. Remember, I don't want you to count extra copies of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.510
chromosomes. I want you to tell me how many unique chromosomes are there? It can

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.820
be a little tricky, so think about it before you answer. And I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.530
want you to put your answer in number form in this text box here.
