As we go to our next game,

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.940
The Rejects-Files.
The Rejects-Files.

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:13.146
-The hit series from the 1900s,
<i> X-Files,</i> is back on Fox -What?

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.680
for a six-episode revival!

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.282
And, seriously,
it's (bleep) great.

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.084
If you're not watching it,
I don't know why

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.753
you don't like good things.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:23.222
But for those of you
who are too young to remember,

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.491
<i> The X-Files</i> was about a team
of FBI agents,

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:28.694
uh, who was partially led by
the guy from<i> Red Shoe Diaries,</i>

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:32.031
who investigated
all the bizarre unsolved cases

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.966
the government couldn't crack,
while we all watched 'em

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.635
and just waited for them,
"Please, for the love of God,

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.970
just do it one time.
One time, one time!"

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.972
But clearly its return
to television means

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.308
that there are still cases
as yet unsolved.

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:44.477
So, comedians, I would like you
to come up with some new<i> X-Files</i>

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.746
paranormal cold cases that
are just waiting to be solved.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.748
And begin. Scott.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.617
Uh, the Trumpacabra, which is
a-a little orange creature

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.087
-that eats Mexicans.
-Yes, points.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.056
(cheering and applause)

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.994
Points for that. Annabeth.

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:04.530
Are aliens
just really into butt stuff?

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.866
Yes, points. Yeah.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.868
They are. Greg Proops.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.070
The mystery of why
David Duchovny looks old

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.738
and Gillian Anderson looks
exactly the same.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.140
All right, points.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.142
-Ah. Oh.
-Scott Adsit.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.212
Uh, the recyclable
<i> Twilight Zone</i> episodes.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.616
Aw! They are not recyclable
<i> Twilight Zone</i> episodes!

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.285
-That's why it's a mystery!
-They are not at all!

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:28.955
<i> The Twilight Zone </i>
were-were social commentary

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.358
-and morality tales! -Oh, and
this is just a bunch of crap?!

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.361
-Why are you indicating to her?!
-Me?! Crap?!

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.563
-She's on the show!
-I know she's on the show!

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:40.233
-It's her show you're insulting!
-I lo... You insulted the show!

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.769
-I don't think so, sir!
-No! Scott, Scott, Scott,

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.439
if you watch the tapes back,
the truth is out there!

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:49.409
I never watch this show!

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.048
-Uh... -Did you say "points"
after I said that?

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.184
-Oh. Points?
-Yeah.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:00.253
Not like you're gonna see it
later.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.222
(laughter)
