00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.560
 Contrary to what many people think, military bases and embassies do not count as American territory. 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.760
 Yet it comes close. 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.720
 The host country agrees that its laws do not apply in that area but the bases are still in its area. 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.040
 That is hers. 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.280
 Because it's hers. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.720
 In her country. 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.780
 This is called extraterritoriality, and it is not unique to America, but America stands out for its large number of bases and embassies, 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.800
 and in one case (Guantanamo Bay, Cuba) for his fight over the bases. 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.260
 The short version of the story is this: 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.080
 Cuba used to belong to the United States, 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.140
 (Captured after the Spanish-American war with Puerto Rico, and Guam, and pride of Spain). 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.300
 After the decolonization of Cuba, the navy remained the base of the United States, 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.760
 where it was and the United States paid for the rent of the land. 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 And then revolucion and disagreement between Cuba and the United States about the rent, 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.760
 which led to the current uncomfortable situation: 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.680
 where the United States says to Cuba: "Thanks for renting this country out to us!" 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.080
 and Cuba that says: "We have not rented this country out to you." 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.060
 and the United States that says, "Here's the rent!" 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.360
 and Cuba that says, "We don't accept that, would you please leave?" 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.960
 and the United States that says, "Thanks for renting the land to us!"
